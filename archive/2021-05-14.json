Superstar MC J. Cole, whose career has long been informed by both basketball metaphor and actual basketball playing (in May 2021, ESPN reported that Cole had joined the Basketball Africa League's Rwanda Patriots BBC), has crafted his <i>The Off-Season</i> mixtape in the same mold, affirming that if he’s done anything in the time since 2018’s <i>KOD</i> album, it’s get even better at what he does.<br />\nThe 12-track tape is at once a testament to his actual rhyme skill and the reverence he’s earned within hip-hop. He’s sourced production from Boi-1da, Timbaland, Jake One, and T-Minus, among others, and has words—but not verses—from Cam’ron, Damian Lillard, and a man he admits to having once had an actual physical alteration with, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs. Though he takes time to shout out both Chief Keef and Dave East—conspicuously opposite forces in the realm of contemporary rap—proper features here come from fellow Fayetteville native Morray and “a lot” collaborator 21 Savage. Over the course of his career, Cole’s been known as something of a lone wolf—J CoLe wEnT pLaTiNuM WiTh nO fEaTuReS.

The additions are tacked on to the top of her classic mixtape, thus beginning with her present and moving backwards towards her early days; what's revealed is a compelling ascent that looks entirely inevitable.<br />\nOn “Seeing Green,” which opens the proceedings, she spars with her YMCMB family, proving that, as was the case then, she can not only effortlessly hang with some of the greatest, but bring the best out of them as well. “Fractions,” a la “Chi-Raq” just a couple songs later, is vintage Nicki—a showcase of hypnotic cadences and clever lyricism that never stops rewarding repeated listens.<br />\nBut the real magic begins with the still-stunning “Itty Bitty Piggy.” Atop Soulja Boy's “Donk” beat, she lets loose a barrage of inventive wordplay (“Flyer than a kite, I get higher than Rapunzel/Keep the Snow White, I could buy it by the bundle,” she spits at one point), breathless flows, and undeniable charisma that, even a decade-plus on, cements that Nicki was always a star. Elsewhere, more playful songs like “Slumber Party” (with early cosigner Gucci Mane) and “I Get Crazy” (with Lil Wayne) and mellower ones like “Can Anybody Hear Me?” and “Still I Rise” testify to the vision of versatility she's always had: a riveting combination of pop theatrics and quick-witted rhymes all pulled together by a personality she's never been afraid to hide. <br />\nA few of the original tracks are missing here—“Mind on My Money,” “Handstand,” and “I Feel Free” among them—but the spirit of <i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>, and the energy it brought to the rap landscape, remains fully intact. Much the way the tape doubled as Nicki’s claim to the throne in its time, in 2021, it's another excuse to adjust her crown.","short":"The rapper’s classic mixtape arrives on streaming with some new additions."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2upw5IrzeqKApIQZyx5o6r"}},{"id":"1566965523","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566965523?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8b/5d/49/8b5d49f0-15c6-c2c3-df96-d101ac6eca77/19752.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f6f5fb","textColor1":"050505","textColor2":"212023","textColor3":"353536","textColor4":"4b4b4e"},"artistName":"Yung Mal","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/1-5-way-or-no-way/1566965523","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-19","name":"1.5 Way Or No Way","recordLabel":"Alamo Records","upc":"808391117761","copyright":"℗ 2021 Alamo Records","playParams":{"id":"1566965523","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Jt91wbEFYK34hZ29n2YKg"}},{"id":"1563007618","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1563007618?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8f/96/29/8f962954-e2db-bc3d-d8a1-f1a23e2a8fdb/196006390891.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"a50027","textColor1":"edd7cd","textColor2":"e3cbcc","textColor3":"dfacac","textColor4":"d6a2ab"},"artistName":"Jorja Smith","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/be-right-back/1563007618","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Be Right Back","recordLabel":"FAMM","upc":"196006390891","copyright":"℗ 2021 FAMM","playParams":{"id":"1563007618","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If it wasn’t already clear from her soul-baring 2018 debut album <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>, then perhaps her 2019 single “Be Honest” made it extra clear: Jorja Smith is, amongst others things, incredibly truthful where her music is concerned. “I was actually going to call this <i>This Is Not My Second Album</i>,” the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music of the EP <i>Be Right Back</i>. “Because these are songs that I love and I've written in the past two years, but I'm not yet ready to do 'the album.' When it’s time, I want to tour that album. And also: I know that there's another level that I can get to—musically, creatively, and all other aspects.” The British singer-songwriter has, of course, previous experience when it comes to non-album material making a splash. Her silky, soulful appearances on Drake’s <i>More Life</i> “playlist” are arguably what opened her up to a global audience, while a slew of post-<i>Lost &amp; Found</i> collaborations with artists including Brent Faiyaz, Popcaan, and ENNY mean Rihanna-style anticipation for an eventual album two.<br /> \nThis eight-track set of evocative ballads—a self-described sonic “waiting room”—finds Smith continuing to thoughtfully navigate her way through a changing world. “Music's great,” she says. “It’s a little escape, and that's why I gave the project this title. I just wanted to dip in and dip out. But I want it to be a safe escape for my fans—for right now—because I know they miss me.”<br />\nPerhaps fittingly, then, it’s a striking and spare collection of moods and moments. “Bussdown” is gorgeous: a sultry hookup with UK rapper Shaybo that recalls Smith’s “Blue Lights” in potent storytelling. The bracingly direct “Addicted” glides over guitar licks that wouldn’t be out of place on <i>In Rainbows</i>, while “Gone” memorializes the tragic loss of a friend. “Anyone who listens will hear it differently to what it actually means in the first place,” she says of the track. “That’s what I love.” Elsewhere, “Home” feels like chancing on Smith at an open mic night with a diary entry, and “Weekend” brings us to a dreamlike, considered climax. Smith’s falsetto on this track, by the way, has never sounded so angelic.<br />\nThe minimalist makeup of this music—notably trekking free of the soul and jazz borders of <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>—hint at fresh, exciting levels to come. After being cued up as the UK’s next R&amp;B/pop powerhouse, <i>Be Right Back</i> is the sound of an artist taking a breath before her next play. “I only dropped my first album three years ago,” she says. “And now I’ve been able to take in everything I've done in the last three years. I’m actually able to look at [plaques and records on] my walls like, ‘Oh my god, I did this.’ I appreciate everything, but I miss my fans, and I miss [doing] shows. The last year and this year has been so tough. I wanted to give them something.”","short":"“I miss my fans.

From his 1990 studio debut <i>Here in the Real World</i> onward, Jackson has stayed true to traditional country music, earning a legion of fans who adore him for doing exactly that. <i>Where Have You Gone</i>, his first new album in six years, continues in that vein. “When I look at this album and its whole content, I don't think that it's much different than almost any album I've made,” Jackson tells Apple Music. “I've always had the same subject matter.” That subject matter includes small-town living (“Back,” “Where the Cottonwood Grows”), family (“I Do,” “Where Her Heart Has Always Been”), tossing back a drink or two (“Wishful Drinkin’,” “Way Down in My Whiskey”), and, of course, country music itself, as on standout track “That’s the Way Love Goes,” which pays tribute to the late Merle Haggard. Below, Jackson shares insight into a few of <i>Where Have You Gone</i>’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Where Have You Gone”</b>\n“I wrote it from this perspective as though it were a woman that had left you. I let people hear that song when I was finished and first thing they would hear is, ‘Oh, here's another heartbreak song.’ And they get to the chorus and it kind of flips a switch there.”<br />\n<b>“Back”</b>\n“It kind of started as a joke, really. I don't know, several years ago, I don't know about that music so much, but my kids were talking about how Justin Timberlake had this ‘bringing sexy back’ song. And they were just laughing, talking about it. And I never even heard it. I said, ‘Well, I think I'm going to write one about how I'm going to bring country back.’ Anyway, they kept asking me about it every now and then, so I ended up writing it. And I didn't write it from a position of ‘I'm going to bring country back.’ I think it was just more of a fun song. And I ended up talking all these memories, visual memories of things that I remember growing up in the South in a small town, which is so relatable to country music.”<br />\n<b>“Where the Cottonwood Grows”</b>\n“It just came to me one day. I was probably driving along, that's when a lot of them come. I just remember that hook coming up, and that melody, too, and I just stuck with it. Nowadays, it's easier with the phones, because I can record a melody real quick. Because it can be five minutes later, and I couldn't remember that melody again. I hadn't had an album in six years, and it wasn't intentional, just things kind of happened this way. I've had hundreds of little hooks and clips like that recorded on my phone. And when I started writing last fall, I kind of sat down and said, ‘How am I going to write for this album?’ Because I hadn't felt like writing for a while, but then I took all those out and I had about 200 of them on the phone.”","short":"“I hadn't had an album in six years.

Their passion for the genre shows in their raw and effortless performances—whether they turn John Lee Hooker’s “Crawling Kingsnake” into a six-minute incendiary jam or give the full treatment to R.L. Burnside’s “Mellow Peaches” with a soulful guitar interplay that rises into an intense crescendo. But for the most part, Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney are not interested in adding any bells and whistles, like on “Sad Days, Lonely Nights,” where they capture the live essence of Junior Kimbrough’s 1994 original. “Some of the best roots music are those spontaneous records,” Auerbach adds. “You can just feel this kind of nervous energy, but it was just fun.”","short":"“Any chance we get to turn people on hill country blues, we want to do that.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/682pJqnx8hcrCfSjvyNBki"}},{"id":"1567077424","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567077424?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"height":1425,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/23/26/a3/2326a30a-95d0-4101-9925-76e135a99d85/075679783714.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"cdd2d3","textColor2":"d6bb9f","textColor3":"a4a8a9","textColor4":"ab957f"},"artistName":"Kodak Black","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/haitian-boy-kodak/1567077424","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Haitian Boy Kodak","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records","upc":"075679783714","copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1567077424","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4DGNmFH2q7WEtFI88geAmu"}},{"id":"1552955481","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1552955481?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/d4/75/e4/d475e41d-16b4-63f3-984f-0bf7615c6ed5/20CRGIM25029.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"e7bd31","textColor2":"d4b89d","textColor3":"b89727","textColor4":"aa937d"},"artistName":"St. Vincent","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/daddys-home/1552955481","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Daddy's Home","recordLabel":"Loma Vista Recordings","upc":"00888072238459","copyright":"℗ 2021 Loma Vista Recordings., Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1552955481","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In the wake of 2017’s <i>MASSEDUCTION</i>, St. Vincent mastermind Annie Clark was in search of change. “That record was very much about structure and stricture—everything I wore was very tight, very controlled, very angular,” she tells Apple Music. “But there's only so far you can go with that before you're like, ‘Oh, what's over here?’” What Clark found was a looseness that came from exploring sounds she’d grown up with, “this kind of early-’70s, groove-ish, soul-ish, jazz-ish style in my head since I was a little kid,” she says. “I was raised on Steely Dan records and Stevie Wonder records like [1973’s] <i>Innervisions</i> and [1972’s] <i>Talking Book</i> and [1974’s] <i>Fulfillingness’ First Finale</i>. That was the wheelhouse that I wanted to play in. I wanted to make new stories with older sounds.”<br />\nRecorded with <i>MASSEDUCTION</i> producer Jack Antonoff, <i>Daddy’s Home</i> draws heavily from the 1970s, but its title was inspired, in part, by recent events in Clark’s personal life: her father’s 2019 release from prison, where he’d served nearly a decade for his role in a stock manipulation scheme. It’s as much about our capacity to evolve as it is embracing the humanity in our flaws. “I wanted to make sure that even if anybody didn't know my personal autobiography that it would be open to interpretation as to whether Daddy is a father or Daddy is a boyfriend or Daddy is a pimp—I wanted that to be ambiguous,” she says. “Part of the title is literal: ‘Yeah, here he is, he's home!’ And then another part of it is ‘It’s 10 years later. I’ve done a lot in those 10 years. I have responsibility. I have shit I'm seriously doing. It’s playing with it: Am I daddy's girl? I don't know. Maybe. But I'm also Daddy, too, now.” Here, Clark guides us through a few of the album’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Pay Your Way in Pain”</b>\n“This character is like the fixture in a 2021 psychedelic blues. And this is basically the sentiment of the blues: truly just kind of being down and out in a country, in a society, that oftentimes asks you to choose between dignity and survival. So it's just this story of one really bad fuckin’ day. And just owning the fact that truly what everybody wants in the world, with rare exception, is just to have a roof over their head, to be loved, and to get by. The line about the heels always makes me laugh. I've been her, I know her. I've been the one who people kind of go, ‘Oh, oh, dear. Hide the children's eyes.’ I know her, and I know her well.”<br />\n<b>“Down and Out Downtown”</b>\n“This is actually maybe my favorite song on the record. I don't know how other people will feel about it. We've all been that person who is wearing last night's heels at eight in the morning on the train, processing: ‘Oh, where have we been? What did I just do?’ You're groggy, you're sort of trying to avoid the knowing looks from other people—and the way that in New York, especially, you can just really ride that balance between like abandon and destruction. That's her; I've been her too.”<br />\n<b>“Daddy's Home”</b>\n“The story is really about one of the last times I went to go visit my dad in prison. If I was in national press or something, they put the press clippings on his bed. And if I was on TV, they'd gather around in the common area and watch me be on Letterman or whatever. So some of the inmates knew who I was and presumably, I don't know, mentioned it to their family members. I ended up signing an autograph on a receipt because you can't bring phones and you couldn't do a selfie. It’s about watching the tables turn a little bit, from father and daughter. It's a complicated story and there's every kind of emotion about it. My family definitely chose to look at a lot of things with some gallows humor, because what else are you going to do? It's absolutely absurd and heartbreaking and funny all at the same time. So: Worth putting into a song.”<br />\n<b>“Live in the Dream”</b>\n“If there are other touchpoints on the record that hint at psychedelia, on this one we've gone completely psychedelic. I was having a conversation with Jack and he was telling me about a conversation he had with Bruce Springsteen. Bruce was just, I think anecdotally, talking about the game of fame and talking about the fact that we lose a lot of people to it. They can kind of float off into the atmosphere, and the secret is, you can't let the dream take over you. The dream has to live inside of you. And I thought that was wonderful, so I wrote this song as if you're waking up from a dream and you almost have these sirens talking to you. In life, there's still useful delusions. And then there's delusions that—if left unchecked—lead to kind of a misuse of power.”<br />\n<b>“Down”</b>\n“The song is a revenge fantasy. If you're nice, people think they can take advantage of you. And being nice is not the same thing as being a pushover. If we don't want to be culpable to something, we could say, 'Well, it's definitely just this thing in my past,' but at the end of the day, there's human culpability. Life is complicated, but I don't care why you are hurt. It's not an excuse to be cruel. Whatever your excuse is, you've played it out.”<br />\n<b>“…At the Holiday Party”</b>\n“Everybody's been this person at one time. I've certainly been this person, where you are masking your sadness with all kinds of things. Whether it's dressing up real fancy or talking about that next thing you're going to do, whatever it is.

It's a fitting assignment: The Atlanta rhymer's sinister raps align with the gruesome bent of the franchise. On the opening track of his <i>Spiral</i> EP, he raps over a bass-boosted sample of the movies' spine-tingling theme music, detailing revenge fantasies spawned from his animus for enemies—“call me Saw 'cause I laugh when I body shit,” he announces. On closer “Emergency,” he links up with Young Thug and Gunna for a track that feels more teaser than thematic. In between, he lets his progeny shine with Young Nudy's “You Ain't Hard” and Real Recognize Rio, 21 Lil Harold, and SG Tip offering their own takes on their mentor's style on “Down Bad.” The EP is short and sweet and may leave listeners craving more from 21 Savage, whose deadpan delivery is ripe with potential for translating true horror.","short":"The Atlanta rapper's sinister style aligns with the franchise's gruesome bent."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1566175587","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566175587?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/34/d1/47/34d14728-5114-d62e-c007-d4824074c7ae/886449087488.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"00b1ff","textColor1":"00081c","textColor2":"001544","textColor3":"002a49","textColor4":"00346a"},"artistName":"MK xyz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sweet-spot-ep/1566175587","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Sweet Spot - EP","recordLabel":"Epic","upc":"886449087488","copyright":"℗ 2021 Epic Records.

The music itself reflects these personal stories: It’s more stripped-back and intimate than anything she’s released before. “I used an entirely new approach for creating the album,” she says. “I approached it like a biography. I wrote the majority of the songs in my home in Los Angeles at my white piano, after thinking and talking through a life experience.” The resulting effort led to more than 60 songs, written alongside Matthew Copley and Marla Altschuler. “They created a safe space for me to tell these stories with freedom and transparency,” she says. The album was also recorded live, unlike her earlier releases, with “no sounds or effects”—leaving it to feel as raw and truthful as the stories within. Below, Goodrem talks through each song on <i>Bridge Over Troubled Dreams</i>.<br />\n<b>“Keep Climbing”</b>\n“‘Keep Climbing’ sets the tone for the whole album. It’s about the resilience in never giving up and having the strength to keep reaching for your dreams. Oftentimes, we might feel stuck between where we are and where we want to be; sometimes fear is holding us back or limiting our beliefs. Change can be scary, but we must stay focused.”<br />\n<b>“Everyone's Famous”</b>\n“I kept thinking about the difference in growing up now and when I was a kid. I wanted to reach for the stars—I was so inspired by the legends, obsessed with learning the craft. But kids are growing up with social media fueling an impossible aspiration of fame and popularity. I wanted to write an ode to the greats, sharing gratitude and admiration for those I continue to be inspired by. It’s about striving for greatness, whatever industry you work in or life you are living.”<br />\n<b>“Solid Gold”</b> \n“‘Solid Gold’ is about a relationship where someone has taken you for granted. I wanted it to have an empowering message. The lyrics speak to reminding that person of your value, worth, and strength. From time to time, we all have people come into our lives who criticize us or don’t appreciate all that we have to offer. This is a reminder to never forget that you deserve to be treated with kindness and love.”<br />\n<b>“Dear Elton”</b>\n“My hands wrote the piano part by themselves. Looking back, I don’t even know how it happened. The song is a letter to Elton John. I was brought back to a moment when I was young and he reached out to me. It was when I was at my weakest, physically, undergoing chemotherapy. His kindness and belief in my music has always stayed with me. His generosity of heart gave me tremendous light, but don’t think I fully understood the weight of that moment until much later. I’ve always had this deeply inspired connection to him and his music: the way he plays the keys, and the artistry in his music and lyrics will always be an inspiration. The song is a metaphor, too—in some ways it’s an empowered message to myself, saying, ‘Here I am.’”<br />\n<b>“Billionaire”</b>\n“‘Billionaire’ is one of my favorite songs on the album. It’s gritty and unfiltered girl power, and there’s a toughness to its femininity—like a Nancy Sinatra track, but with the lyrical vibes of her father’s ‘I Did It My Way.’ ‘Billionaire’ is for all of the girls who lead with their hearts and make it happen for themselves. Also, life isn’t about how much material wealth you accumulate, it’s about being rich in what counts: family, friends, love, understanding, and kindness.”<br />\n<b>“Paralyzed”</b>\n“As a songwriter, I write about my own experiences, and this one’s about a forced reset that I wasn’t expecting. I’ve learned to lean into change and uncertainty. Life is fluid and constantly changing—when we embrace resets and change and use them to our advantage, our perspective shifts and opens up new opportunities and experiences. This song carries a message of hope and love. Getting through the tough times is hard, but with hope and love we can get through anything.”<br />\n<b>“All of My Friends”</b>\n“‘All of My Friends’ was inspired by and written through tears, when I was missing home, family and friends. It’s a raw, vulnerable moment when you wonder if your decisions and sacrifices in life are worth it, and contemplate striking the balance between all that is most important to you.”<br />\n<b>“Kill Them With Kindness”</b>\n“‘Kill Them With Kindness’ was written on August 4, 2019, the same day I wrote ‘Paralyzed’ and ‘Everyone’s Famous.’ A lot of music came flooding out that day. Growing up, my mum always taught me that you never know what someone else is going through, and if someone projects anger and negativity on you, the best response is to smile back and to be kind.”<br />\n<b>“Crash”</b>\n“‘Crash’ tells the story of the start of my life. Lyrically, it plays out like a movie scene. It’s a moment that my parents have explained to me over the years in different ways, and here I’m singing the story as I’ve always imagined it: My mum was driving alone, while pregnant with me, when someone crashed into her. Even though she was alone, I know something spiritual happened—it wasn’t just us in the car. We had faith in the front seat and hope by our side. The angels heard us cry. I was born 10 weeks premature, in that wreck, and the first moments of my life were touch and go for mum and I. I’ve experienced a series of resets and sliding-door moments in my life, which I never take for granted.”<br />\n<b>“The Power”</b>\n“This was one of the first songs I wrote on this record, originally called ‘The Power of a Prayer.’ I always loved it, but so much changed in the world and myself since it was written. Just before I was due to hand in the final mastered album, I rewrote the verses and went back into the studio to record it again. The meaning had changed and I suddenly heard themes of strength and empowerment, rather than the original sentiment. A gospel choir brought the energy I was hearing to life. Listening to the song literally lifts me up.”<br />\n<b>“Play”</b>\n“This last song starts with an audio sample by Alan Watts from the <i>Tao of Philosophy</i> talk ‘Coincidence of Opposites.’ We listened to this recording before starting any of the writing for this album, and it has such important messages that resonated with me: You don't work the piano, you play the piano; the whole purpose of the dancing is the dance; how life is like an analogy of music. It is a musical thing and you are supposed to dance while the music is being played. So, just go and 'Play.'”","short":"“Many of the stories on this album had been in my heart for some time.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4xlkFyFyf5z9oTiE7OX2S9"}},{"id":"1563837744","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1563837744?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/bd/bb/05/bdbb050e-60ff-706c-e9df-2d374a94a06f/193436258944_01_img001.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"02010c","textColor1":"fefffd","textColor2":"b6b2cf","textColor3":"cbcccc","textColor4":"928ea8"},"artistName":"Nascent","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/minus-the-b-t-lifes-great/1563837744","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Minus the B******t Life's Great","recordLabel":"Don't Grow Up Too Soon","upc":"193436258944","copyright":"℗ 2021 Don't Grow Up Too Soon","playParams":{"id":"1563837744","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4oP4LxB36ixn9QydAT4Q45"}},{"id":"1565004051","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565004051?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/11/b6/3a/11b63af2-cb0b-20ea-57b1-bbb5669ba0d5/195375112257.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"67c6ff","textColor1":"0b090c","textColor2":"141313","textColor3":"1d2f3c","textColor4":"243742"},"artistName":"Alkaline","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/top-prize/1565004051","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Reggae","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Top Prize","recordLabel":"Autobamb Records","upc":"195375112257","copyright":"℗ 2021 Autobamb Records","playParams":{"id":"1565004051","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3y09mvRbBlkfCJHmlpQnc7"}},{"id":"1556167786","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1556167786?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/7b/0c/bd/7b0cbd22-ad40-563a-76ec-d930ab629a4c/196006223120.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"140a13","textColor1":"eddcb4","textColor2":"e3d0a9","textColor3":"c2b294","textColor4":"b9a88b"},"artistName":"Dillon Carmichael","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hot-beer-ep/1556167786","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Contemporary Country","Music","Country"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Hot Beer -

On <i>Black to the Future</i>, the Mercury Prize-nominated quartet is at their most direct and confrontational with their sociopolitical message—welcoming to the fold a wide array of guest collaborators (most notably poet Joshua Idehen, who also collaborated with the group on 2018’s <i>Your Queen Is a Reptile</i>) to further contextualize the album’s themes of Black oppression and colonialism, heritage and ancestry, and the power of memory. If you look closely at the song titles, you’ll discover that each of them makes up a singular poem—a clever way for Hutchings to clue in listeners before they begin their musical journey. “It’s a sonic poem, in that the words and the music are the same thing,” Hutchings says. “Poetry isn't meant to be descriptive on the surface level, it's descriptive on a deep level. So if you read the line of poetry, and then you listen to the music, a picture should emerge that's more than what you'd have if you considered the music or the line separately.” Here, Hutchings gives insight into each of the tracks.<br />\n<b>“Field Negus” (feat. Joshua Idehen)</b>\n“This track was written in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests in London, and it was a time that was charged with an energy of searching for meaning. People were actually starting to talk about Black experience and Black history as it related to the present, in a way that hadn't really been done in Britain before. The point of artists is to be able to document these moments in history and time, and be able to actually find a way of contextualizing them in a way that's poetic. The aim of this track is to keep that conversation going and keep the reflections happening. I've been working with Joshua for 15 years and I really appreciate his perspective on the political realm. He's got a way of describing reality in a manner which makes you think deeply. He never loses humor and he never loses his sense of sharpness.”<br />\n<b>“Pick Up Your Burning Cross” (feat. Moor Mother &amp; Angel Bat Dawid)</b>\n“It started off with me writing the bassline, which I thought was going to be a grime bassline. But then in the pandemic lockdown, I added layers of horns and woodwinds. It took it completely out of the grime space and put it more in that Antillean-Caribbean atmosphere. It really showed me that there's a lot of intersecting links between these musics that sometimes you're not even aware of until you start really diving into their potential and start adding and taking away things. It was really great to actually discover that the tune had more to offer than I envisioned in the beginning. Angel Bat Dawid and Moor Mother are both on this one, and the only thing I asked them to do was to listen to the track and just give their honest interpretation of what the music brings out of them.”<br />\n<b>“Think of Home”</b>\n“If you're thinking poetically, you've got that frantic energy of 'Burning Cross,' which signifies dealing with those issues of oppression. Then at the end of that process of dealing with them, you've got to still remember the place that you come from. You've got to think about the utopia, think about that serene tranquil place so that you're not consumed in the battle. It's not really trying to be a Caribbean track per se, but I was trying to get that feeling of when I think back to my days growing up in Barbados. This is the feeling I had when I remember the music that was made at that time.”<br />\n<b>“Hustle” (feat. Kojey Radical)</b>\n“The title of the track links back to the title of our second album, <i>Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do</i>. The answer to that question is to hustle. Our grandparents came and migrated to Britain, not to just be British per se, but so that they could then create a better life for themselves and their families and have the future be one with dignity and pride. I gave these words to Kojey and he said that he finds it difficult to depict these types of struggles considering that he's not in the present moment within the same struggle that he grew up in. He felt it was disingenuous for him to talk about the struggle. I told him that he's a storyteller, and storytelling isn't always autobiographical. His gift is to be able to tell stories for his community, and to remember that he's also an orator of their history regardless of where his personal journey has led him.”<br />\n<b>“For the Culture” (feat. D Double E)</b>\n“Originally, we'd intended D Double E to be on 'Pick Up Your Burning Cross.' But he came into the studio and it really wasn't the vibe that he was in. We played him the demo of this track and his face lit up. He was like, 'Let's go into the studio. I know what to do.' It was one take and that was it. I think this might be one of my favorite tunes on the album. The reason I called it 'For the Culture' is that it puts me back into what it felt like to be a teenager in Barbados in the '90s, going into the dance halls and really learning what it is to dance. It's not just all about it being hard and struggling and striving; there is that fun element of celebrating what it is to be sensual and to be alive and love music and partying and just joyfulness.”<br />\n<b>“To Never Forget the Source”</b>\n“I gave this really short melody to the band, maybe like four bars for the melody and a very repeated bassline. We played it for about half an hour, where the drums and bass entered slowly and I played the melody again and again. The idea of this, when we recorded in the studio, is that it needs to be the vibe and spirit of how we are playing together. So it wasn't about stopping and starting and being anxious. We need to play it until the feeling is right. The clarinets and the flutes on this one is maybe the one I'm most proud of in terms of adding a counterpoint line, which really offsets and emphasizes the original saxophone and tuba line.”<br />\n<b>“In Remembrance of Those Fallen”</b>\n“The idea of 'In Remembrance of Those Fallen' is to give homage to those people that have been fighting for liberation and freedom within all those anti-colonial movements, and remember the ongoing struggle for dignity within especially the Black world in Africa. It's trying to get that feeling of 'We can do this. We can go forward, regardless of what hurdles have been done and of what hurdles we've encountered.' But, musically, there's so many layers to this. I was excited with how, on one side, the drums are doing what you'd describe as Afro-jazz, and on the other one, it's doing a really primal sound—but mixing it in a way where you feel the impact of those two contrasting drum patterns. This is at the heart of what I like about the drums in Kemet. Regardless of what they're doing, the end result becomes one pulsating, forward-moving machine.”<br />\n<b>“Let the Circle Be Unbroken”</b>\n“I was listening to a lot of [Brazilian composer] Hermeto Pascoal while making the album, and my mind was going onto those beautiful melodies that Hermeto sometimes makes. Songs that feel like you remember them, but they've got a level of harmonic intricacy, which means that there's something disorienting too. It's like you're hearing a nursery rhyme in a dream, hearing the basic contour of the melody, but there's just something below the surface that disorientates you and throws you off what you know of it. It's one of the only times I've ever heard that midtempo soca descend into brutal free jazz.”<br />\n<b>“Envision Yourself Levitating”</b>\n“This one also features one of my heroes on the saxophone, Kebbi Williams, who does the first saxophone solo on the track. His music has got that real New Orleans communal vibe to it. For me, this is the height of music making—when you can make music that's easy enough to play its constituent parts, but when it all pieces together, it becomes a complex tapestry. It's the first point in the album where I do an actual solo with backing parts. This is, in essence, what a lot of calypso bands do in Barbados. So when you've got traditional calypso music, you'll get a performer who is singing their melody and then you've got these horn section parts that intersect and interact with the melody that the calypsonian is singing. It's that idea of an interchange between the band backing the chief melodic line.”<br />\n<b>“Throughout the Madness, Stay Strong”</b>\n“It's about optimism, but not an optimism where you have a smile on your face. An optimism where you're resigned to the place of defeat within the big spectrum of things. It's having to actually resign yourself to what has happened in the continued dismantling of Black civilization, and how Black people are regarded as a whole in the world within a certain light; but then understanding that it's part of a broader process of rising to something else, rising to a new era. Also, on the more technical side of the recording of this tune, this was the first tune that we recorded for the whole session. It's the first take of the first tune on the first day.”<br />\n<b>“Black” (feat. Joshua Idehen)</b>\n“There was a point where we all got into the studio and I asked that we go into these breathing exercises where we essentially just breathe in really deeply about 30 times, and at the end of 30, we breathe out and hold it for as long as you can with nothing inside. We did one of these exercises while lying on the floor with our eyes shut in pitch blackness. I asked everyone to scream as hard as we can, really just let it out. No one could have anything in their ears apart from the track, so no one was aware of how anyone else sounded. It was complete no-self-awareness, no shyness. It's like a cathartic ritual to really just let it out, however you want.”","short":"“The point of artists is to document these moments in history and time.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6AfA0FZhzRTpjDDYHkCd5B"}},{"id":"1565769105","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565769105?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/43/c3/80/43c38049-c41a-8efc-8b5d-fc72ccb62177/886449274413.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"efe862","textColor1":"202425","textColor2":"2f221d","textColor3":"4a4b32","textColor4":"554a2b"},"artistName":"OH MY GIRL","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dear-ohmygirl-ep/1565769105","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-10","name":"Dear OHMYGIRL - EP","recordLabel":"WM Entertainment","upc":"886449274413","copyright":"℗ 2021 WM ENTERTAINMENT INC.","playParams":{"id":"1565769105","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1552427104","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1552427104?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/06/63/c0/0663c0b5-fa1b-9473-914f-8ff9b443b49f/195497986699.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"4b4b4b","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"d3d3d3","textColor3":"dadada","textColor4":"b8b8b8"},"artistName":"Paris Texas","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/boy-anonymous/1552427104","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"BOY ANONYMOUS","recordLabel":"Paris Texas LLC","upc":"195497986699","copyright":"℗ 2021 Paris Texas LLC","playParams":{"id":"1552427104","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ErmhbEFnhCLRqKibj245w"}},{"id":"1554003131","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1554003131?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/dc/97/5a/dc975aa7-84e9-cfea-1b73-3bf0fae28290/5055869565899.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"20201e","textColor1":"fdfcfa","textColor2":"c0c7bd","textColor3":"d1d0ce","textColor4":"a0a69d"},"artistName":"Basic Rhythm","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/electronic-labyrinth/1554003131","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Electronica"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Electronic Labyrinth","recordLabel":"Planet Mu","upc":"5055869565899","copyright":"℗ 2021 Planet Mu","playParams":{"id":"1554003131","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6O7y9NqbFdWrA3pcg2tAqh"}},{"id":"1557474962","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1557474962?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8e/0e/f9/8e0ef9fd-d743-a55c-fee9-5e3a1eafdc14/5056167162100_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"250915","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"de94bd","textColor3":"d3cdd0","textColor4":"b9789c"},"artistName":"Alaina Castillo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/parallel-universe-pt-1/1557474962","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"parallel universe, pt. 1","recordLabel":"Chosen People","upc":"5056167162100","copyright":"℗ 2021 Chosen People under exclusive license to AWAL Recordings America, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1557474962","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4hKWAWw7dOBJvPiwghGWC5"}},{"id":"1554601818","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1554601818?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/a1/04/c5/a104c5d1-4414-10d0-3421-0f81dd4b8278/196006147341.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"030504","textColor1":"dbd9da","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"b0aeaf","textColor4":"9e9f9f"},"artistName":"Charlie Benante","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/silver-linings/1554601818","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Silver Linings","recordLabel":"MRI","upc":"196006147341","copyright":"℗ 2021 Megaforce Records","playParams":{"id":"1554601818","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Charlie Benante’s first solo album is a product of the pandemic. Stir-crazy during lockdown, the Anthrax drummer and songwriter started playing covers during “quarantine jam session” video conferences with his bandmates and other musician friends. “I was losing my mind a little bit and needed to focus on something more positive and creative,” he tells Apple Music. “Doing the jam sessions and this album got me out of the depressive funk I was in.” Featuring covers of his longtime favorites from Kiss, Iron Maiden, and Run-DMC alongside unexpected versions of songs by Billie Eilish, Massive Attack, and proto-grunge shooting stars Mother Love Bone, <i>Silver Linings</i> boasts collaborations with Benante’s girlfriend Carla Harvey (Butcher Babies), Death Angel vocalist Mark Osegueda, Suicidal Tendencies bassist Ra Díaz, and many more. Below, Benante discusses each track.<br />\n<b>“City of Blinding Lights” (feat. Frank Bello and Mark Osegueda)</b>\n“This is one of my favorite U2 songs. It’s not obscure, but it’s definitely not ‘With or Without You’ or ‘Bullet the Blue Sky.’ Every time I hear it, it makes me so happy. The hardest part for me with this song was The Edge’s guitar tone and delay. It's not one delay that's going on—it's two. One is doing one millisecond, but the other’s not in sync. It’s hard to put together, but once you do, that’s the sound.”<br /> \n<b>“Chloe Dancer / Crown of Thorns” (feat. Mark Menghi and Mark Osegueda)</b>\n“Mark and I, we were on tour a lot together. We'd have those nights on the bus where we would just be having some drinks and listening to our favorite songs, and this was one of the songs that bonded us. We always loved Mother Love Bone and Andrew Wood. When we did the Metal Allegiance show, I pulled out a keyboard and we played the first half of the song live. I always wanted to do the rest of it, so when it came time to do these quarantine jams I felt confident enough.”<br />\n<b>“Teardrop” (feat. Carla Harvey &amp; Ra Díaz)</b>\n“I was on tour in Europe when our record company A&amp;R person gave me an advance of [Massive Attack’s] <i>Mezzanine</i>. I listened to it on the bus every night and I was taken away to another place. That record, to me, is one of the best records to come out of the ’90s. I always wanted to do a cover of ‘Teardrop,’ but it wasn’t easy because there’s a lot of textures. I really had to push Carla to do this because it was out of her comfort zone. Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins, who sang on the original, sings like a fucking angel. But Carla did a wonderful job.”<br /> \n<b>“Run-DMC Medley” (feat. DMC, Rob Caggiano &amp; Ra Díaz)</b>\n“To me, Run-DMC were larger than life. I remember seeing them back in the day—when the whole arena took off their shoes and held them in the air for ‘My Adidas,’ I was like, ‘This is fucking awesome!’ I had this arrangement in my head to do three Run-DMC songs. I put it together as if I was a DJ, and I recorded it on the fly. I sent it to Ra, and he put the bass on it. Then I asked Rob to play some leads—he tore it up. Then I gave it to D and he put his voice on top. It was perfect. It was like, ‘Wow—I just did a fucking mash-up of a Run-DMC song, and DMC is on it!’”<br /> \n<b>“Rhiannon” (feat. Mark Menghi, Jennifer Cella &amp; Randy McStine)</b>\n“My friend Mark Menghi, who put together the Metal Allegiance group, hit me up when I started doing the quarantine videos. His mom had passed away recently and her favorite song was ‘Rhiannon’ by Fleetwood Mac. I was really nitpicking it because I wanted it to sound really authentic and very '70s-like, so the drum sound is very Mick Fleetwood—very dead and loose-sounding on drums. Jennifer Cella, who sings with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, did such an awesome job. I was blown away when I heard her tracks.”<br /> \n<b>“Yer So Bad” (feat. Carla Harvey &amp; Ra Díaz)</b>\n“The <i>Full Moon Fever</i> record has so many great songs. A couple of years back I tried to get Anthrax to do ‘Runnin’ Down a Dream,’ but it never happened. Carla sang ‘Yer So Bad,’ and it’s so weird hearing your girl singing that song, because you’re used to Tom Petty singing it. But she has this rasp to her voice, and it works. I loved doing it, because you can’t beat a Tom Petty song. I don’t think we’re ever going to have an artist again like Tom Petty, and it makes me sad.”<br /> \n<b>“Transylvania” (feat. Snake Sabo, Frank Bello &amp; Jon Donais)</b>\n“When I started doing the quarantine jams, Snake called me up and said he wanted to do a Maiden song. He made it easier because we didn't have to get a singer—this is an instrumental. Plus, it’s a song that we all grew up loving and learning. It's on the first Maiden album, and it's such an awesome song—every part of it is just Maiden. We had fun with it, too. I wanted to do more with Snake, but it never happened. I blame him.”<br /> \n<b>“Presto Vivace” (feat. Ra Díaz, Alex Skolnick &amp; Jordan Rudess)</b>\n“Not everyone knows the band U.K., but Alex, Ra, Jordan from Dream Theater, and myself all love them. Some of the guys were in Asia, and then Terry Bozzio came in later on. They’re a musician’s band, but they had songs as well. It wasn’t easy pulling this one off, but I’m so happy we did it. Jordan really stepped it up, because the keyboard part on this song is unbelievable. And the timing on this song is crazy. But we did it.”<br /> \n<b>“Bad Guy” (feat. Ra Díaz)</b>\n“I have a teenage daughter, and a few years ago she would play the Billie Eilish song ‘Ocean Eyes’ all the time. When her new album came out, she was playing that all the time, too. I just started to like these songs because I was hearing them every day, taking her to school and stuff like that. This song is so hooky and has such a memorable melody, and I just wanted to funk it up a little bit. I added some heavy guitar and Ra was on bass. We just vibed it out.”<br /> \n<b>“Jimmy James Jam” (feat. Ra Díaz)</b>\n“God, I love the Beastie Boys. <i>Paul’s Boutique</i>, <i>Check Your Head</i> and <i>Hello Nasty</i>—those three records are so awesome. One of my favorite tracks on <i>Check Your Head</i> is ‘Jimmy James.’ I love the Hendrix sample in the intro. That lick right there is just so awesome. Again, Ra and I just jammed it out as if we were two DJs going back and forth.”<br /> \n<b>“All the Way” (feat. PJ Farley, Joe McGinness &amp; John 5)</b>\n“Everybody knows I'm a huge diehard Kiss fan from back in the day. What they meant to me from '73 to '79, I still have that in me, that love for them. I wanted to do two deep cuts. ‘All the Way’ is one of those songs off of <i>Hotter Than Hell</i> that I wished was on <i>Alive!</i> I would love to hear that song played on that record and have that sound to it—that would’ve been awesome.”<br /> \n<b>“Mr. Speed” (feat. Joe McGinness &amp; PJ Farley)</b>\n“‘Mr. Speed’ is on <i>Rock and Roll Over</i>, which is my favorite Kiss album, and I always felt that the song gets overlooked. I think it’s one of the best Paul Stanley songs. A couple of my friends from a band called Klassik ’78, who do Kiss-type songs, helped out. And then PJ just fucking nails the Gene Simmons parts on bass. I told the guys, ‘I don’t want any modernized guitar tones or anything. I want it to sound exactly like Kiss.’”<br /> \n<b>“Public Image” (feat. Hank Von Hell, Dave Brownsound &amp; Cone McCaslin)</b>\n“When I was a kid, my sister worked at a salon in Manhattan, and sometimes she would take me to work. Right below the salon was a record store called Disc-o-Mat. One day I was in there and saw Johnny Rotten. When I ran up to him, he put his finger to his lips and says, ‘Shh…’ I immediately froze. He wanted his time, his privacy. When he was paying for some records, he calls me over and starts talking to me. I asked him what he was doing in New York, and he said he was working on a new project called Public Image. I didn't even know the Sex Pistols had broken up. Then he took a Disc-o-Mat card, turned it over, and signed his name for me. I still have that card.”<br /> \n<b>“Funny Vibe” (feat. Ra Díaz, Corey Glover &amp; Henry Flury)</b>\n“Living Colour put out one of my favorite first albums by a band—I don’t think there’s a bad song on the record. When I was talking to Ra about it, he suggested we do ‘Funny Vibe.’ I asked Henry, who plays guitar for the Butcher Babies, to be a part of it. He’s a fucking awesome guitar player. Then I contacted Corey, who sings his ass off. The funny thing is, he didn’t even record it to a tape. He recorded a video of himself just sitting at a table and singing it. So we had to mix it from a video, which was even funnier.”","short":"A genre-hopping covers LP born of—and designed to beat—pandemic blahs."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ce1fbz7EtYJv4QZe37neu"}},{"id":"1557796593","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1557796593?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/02/a8/30/02a83081-e6b8-b942-4b91-52b7694e9ef5/20UM1IM18131.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"0d0f0e","textColor1":"fbdb23","textColor2":"ed5b36","textColor3":"ccb21f","textColor4":"c04b2e"},"artistName":"Steve Miller Band","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-breaking-ground-august-3-1977/1557796593","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Live!

Limiting himself to a pared-down set of musical elements, his structure drew from ’60s minimalists like Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Melodically, he incorporated snippets of ancient Scandinavian folk songs, which he slowed and rearranged into haunting refrains. And thematically, he was influenced by the late philosopher Mark Fisher, whose writings on capitalism, futurism, and melancholy Nordmark found profoundly inspiring. A similar set of guidelines had yielded the formal austerity of 2019’s <i>Eternal Words</i>, but with <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, “I decided I wanted to be more personal,” he tells Apple Music. Fisher’s work, in particular, made him ask himself, “Why am I doing this music?” In search of answers, the London-based artist began work on the album just before the city went into lockdown. It’s not hard to hear how the experience of the following months may have shaped its direction. Although soft and contemplative, Nordmark’s mostly wordless pieces harbor a deep-seated unease. “My friend who is releasing the album said, ‘It’s so dark and so dense,’” he says. “I didn’t really reflect on that when I made it.” Here he does a bit more thinking about each of the LP’s tracks.<br />\n<b>Exit</b>\n“This was one of the first tracks I did for the album. I see it as a bridge between the previous album and the new one. When I started making <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, I made a sound palette based on <i>Eternal Words</i>, but then I added a few more sounds to that palette. One was a really processed electric guitar, which is frozen, in a way. Maybe that’s because I’m a guitarist and it’s a more tactile instrument, so that’s a more personal side I’m letting into the project.”<br />\n<b>Ghosts (feat. Waterbaby)</b>\n“Where other tracks used these ancient Swedish melodic fragments, ‘Ghosts’ uses the ‘Tristan chord,’ from Richard Wagner’s <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, which for its time was very spectacular. I deconstructed that, just using those first notes from <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, and built the track from it. It’s also different because there are voices on it. They’re singing a line that I picked from a Swedish neo-gothic novel. The book starts with a feverish dream: The protagonist is dreaming and there’s a ghost whispering to this character, asking him if his sleep has been refreshing. There are a lot of layers embedded in this track.”<br />\n<b>Dreaming</b>\n“It’s very cinematic. I was thinking about film scores when I was making this album, and how you use cues to enhance the drama in a film. That’s definitely happening in ‘Dreaming’: It goes up and down in that way and creates the drama.”<br />\n<b>Spirit</b>\n“It feels really medieval; there’s something that might be a flute sound. This rhythmic element—I call it the space-jazz drummer—feels organic. It’s actually processed noise. When I did that sound, I was thinking a lot of Arthur Russell’s <i>World of Echo</i>, which is one of my favorite albums. It’s so out there, rhythmically. He seems to just play and all these rhythms happen. And how he distorts his cello is so beautiful. That was the inspiration for that sound, which returns in other places, but most significantly in ‘Spirit.’ Maybe that’s the spirit of Arthur Russell that pokes into the song.”<br />\n<b>Aftertime</b>\n\"This is one of the few tracks where you could actually hum the melody. Coming from a background in pop music, melody is something that I really appreciate. I’m doing this skewed instrumental music, but sometimes it just happens that these layers present a melody. I think of it almost as a symphonic track, in a way.”<br />\n<b>Nights</b>\n“I think of this more as an opera. I’ve been working with an opera director on a few projects. We did an opera together, really avant-garde stuff, and a film as well. There’s a sound in this, a human sound, that you might recognize as an operatic voice. This is one of the tracks I haven’t really come to terms with. But then I thought, ‘Maybe that’s a good sign,’ because it has a weirdness that I haven’t really accepted.”<br />\n<b>Becoming</b>\n“Before I did <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, I started to make an album that was totally ambient. I did half and then I just said, ‘No, this is not what I want to do.’ But some made its way into <i>Exit Ghosts</i>. ‘Becoming’ is what I took from that project. It’s more serene and ambient, and it doesn’t have many percussive elements. It prepares us for the end of the journey. Maybe I see it as a transition as well, because it transitioned from the project I trashed and made its way into this album anyway.”<br />\n<b>Outsides</b>\n“If you listen to the album in full, there’s a drama: You start out one way, go up in the middle, and then you’re being washed out toward the end. There’s actually a quote from Mark Fisher’s <i>The Weird and the Eerie</i> that I connect with this track: ‘What the weird and the eerie have in common is a preoccupation with the strange. The strange—not the horrific…. It has, rather, to do with a fascination for the outside, for that which lies beyond standard perception, cognition, and experience.’ And I think that’s a summary of my thoughts on this album.”","short":"“I decided I wanted to be more

most inventive guitarists, her acclaimed recordings spanning music from Brazil and Spain across to her native China. This beautiful, intimate EP is the second recorded by Yang exclusively for Apple Music at London’s Platoon Studio. Its stunningly crafted arrangements of Gershwin’s “Summertime” and three of The Beatles’ greatest songs show off her breathtaking technical skill and expressive command. Chinese singer Li Jian’s “Lake Baikal” and Japanese composer Akira Nakada’s “A Song of Early Spring” (masterfully arranged by composer Tōru Takemitsu) are touching in their simple warmth and bring this wonderful global journey to an end.","short":"Stunningly crafted arrangements show off the guitarist’s breathtaking skill."},"isCompilation":false}}]}
