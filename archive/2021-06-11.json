They’d long established themselves as hip-hop trendsetters and needed only to complete the trilogy before moving on to the next phase of their near decade-long chart domination.

If you’re surprised that a group of three would create space for that many guests on a project where their own voices get near equal run time, you’re clearly unfamiliar with how self-assured the group is. “Last time I checked we were running the globe,” Quavo raps on “Modern Day.” If the excitement drummed up by lead single “Straightenin” was any indication, this is unlikely to change before the next time he checks.<br /><br />\n<i>All Apple Music subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV can listen to thousands of Dolby Atmos Music tracks using any headphones.

Earning Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Original Score in 2008, his <i>In the Heights</i> regaled audiences for nearly three years with an unforgettable uptown chronicle told via irresistible songs that deftly blended Times Square panache and tropical rhythms. With the release of its highly anticipated film adaptation comes a corresponding soundtrack that keeps the enjoyment going long after the credits roll, with listeners benefiting further from the immersive Spatial Audio experience. Beginning with Usnavi’s spirited exposition on the title track that sets the proverbial stage, the songs depict a layered narrative full of family traditions, romantic longings (for people and homeland alike), and dramatic turns aplenty. From the lottery ticket dreams of “96,000” to the panic and promise of “Blackout,” the diverse cast encapsulates everything that made both the musical and the movie great. Recusing himself from his iconic Broadway run as Usnavi to play the neighborhood Piraguero, Miranda rails proudly against the dark forces of soft-serve on the plucky “Piragua.”<br />\n<i>All Apple Music subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV can listen to thousands of Dolby Atmos Music tracks using any headphones.

The nine-track project showcases reimagined hip-hop drums and acoustic guitar riffs laced underneath airy vocals. The opening title track invites listeners to go on a journey with the singer through some of her thoughts, emotions, and anxieties: “Running the race/Could you stand in my place?/Got anxiety/Can I borrow your time machine?” Throughout her project, Fousheé encourages a balance between her slow, intimate introspective side and uptempo bangers. On “my slime,” Fousheé navigates the euphoric feeling of finding a new crush/partner in crime: “You’re my slime/My partner in crime/We just blew a day but you’re still on my mind/Let’s go to Paris sometime.” Just as revelatory is her cover of Depeche Mode’s “enjoy the silence,” which turns the synth-heavy anthem into a sultry, haunting R&B tune.","short":"Fousheé proves that her rise to instant fame wasn’t purely by luck."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1569128457","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569128457?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/07/6b/88/076b88b9-a23b-ed4c-92d6-1a9bbf45c4ab/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"fdfdfd","textColor1":"171717","textColor2":"29284b","textColor3":"454545","textColor4":"53536e"},"artistName":"Marshmello","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shockwave/1569128457","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Shockwave","recordLabel":"Joytime Collective","upc":"735119944616","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Joytime Collective","playParams":{"id":"1569128457","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Megan, Juicy J, Carnage, and more help push Marshmello’s sound to new heights."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1570547059","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570547059?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/dc/2b/86/dc2b86c0-14ed-62fd-02f3-c23354f34284/19976.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"5a3676","textColor1":"fbfbfd","textColor2":"d7b1e3","textColor3":"dad3e2","textColor4":"be98cd"},"artistName":"Lil Gotit","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/top-chef-gotit/1570547059","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-10","name":"Top Chef Gotit","recordLabel":"Alamo Records","upc":"808391119710","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Alamo Records","playParams":{"id":"1570547059","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1566636556","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566636556?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d6/02/45/d602455b-23ea-8b81-9ea2-f0931db4a1f9/738676858204_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"160904","textColor2":"081c44","textColor3":"453a36","textColor4":"394a69"},"artistName":"TWICE","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/taste-of-love-ep/1566636556","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Taste of Love -

It just happens. “We don’t really speak to each other about anything, we just go into a room and what comes out is what comes out,” the singer tells Apple Music. “It’s usually a shambolic kind of journey. Somehow we end up with a record at the end of it all and we wonder how we did it. It’s a mystery, which I think is probably as it should be.” The quartet refines their chaotic process into another captivating collection of electronic-rock anthems on seventh album <i>No Gods No Masters</i>, a record that takes in snarling techno-punk, synth-pop flourishes, and atmospheric balladry across its 11 tracks (this version also includes a bonus disc of covers). <br />\nCombining themes of personal turmoil with state-of-the-nation temperature-taking, it swerves from defiance to despair and back again, with Manson in exhilarating lyrical form throughout. “I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to articulate somewhat complex issues in quite a colorful way without being too heavy-handed,” she says. It all began with Manson and her bandmates—Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and Butch Vig—in a room together in Palm Springs, California, thrashing out ideas. However, lockdown meant it had to be completed remotely. Manson says they drew on three decades’ worth of experience to get the job done. “I have to commend the whole band on being able to shape-shift and adapt,” she says. “I think one of the reasons we’ve had a long career is everybody in this band is capable of adapting.” Here, Manson unravels some of the mystery of how they do it by taking us through the album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“The Men Who Rule the World”</b>\n“It was Butch’s call to open with this. I was like, ‘I don't know. I feel like maybe not.’ And then I tried a billion different ways of sequencing the record and each time I had to come back to ‘The Men Who Rule the World’—that was really pretty much the only place for it. It’s definitely a mood setter. I think it’s really good-natured, but it’s this sort of retelling of Noah’s Ark, it’s a biblical tale. It’s grand in theme, but it has a lot of humor in it, and also a lot of outrage. To me, that’s the perfect combo.”<br />\n<b>“The Creeps”</b>\n“These lyrics tell a tale of great change in my mind. I had told myself that at the grand old age of 40, I was over the hill and I would never, ever be an artist again. I got paralyzed and depressed. I was driving along Los Feliz Boulevard, having been dropped by Interscope Records, and I saw a garage sale selling a shop-size poster of my band. I was so humiliated. But from that humiliation, I somehow managed to free myself from public perception and industry perception and expectations and focus on trying to have a good life and being creative and singing and making music and writing. My life bloomed from that point forward, so ‘The Creeps’ is important to me.”<br />\n<b>“Uncomfortably Me”</b>\n“I think everyone can relate to that feeling of not being fully developed yet and feeling uncertain and fearful and not fitting in. Certainly, an overriding feeling my whole life is that I just never quite fit in at a dinner party, I never quite fit in a festival bill. I feel like I don’t even fit into my own band—I’m the only woman, I’m much younger, I come from Scotland and they’re American. I just feel like a permanent outsider. And the band do too, we just don’t fit in with any scene. It used to upset and frustrate me, but now I’m like, ‘It’s fucking great.’ In this world that has a plethora of bands and artists, we are here in a singular form.”<br />\n<b>“Wolves”</b>\n“I stumbled upon this Eastern European fairy tale about the idea of two wolves that exist in each human being and wrestle with one another. You choose how you’re going to respond to a situation. Even though you think it’s just instinct, it’s actually a split-second choice. ‘Am I going to be an asshole or am I actually going to try and deal with this situation with kindness?’ It’s hard for me not to be an asshole. I want to attack; that’s just my natural state of being. If someone hurts or offends me, or makes me scared, my instinct is to destroy. As I’m getting older, I want to choose kindness instead and I want to try and control the hardcore wolf and let the kind, soft wolf out instead.”<br />\n<b>“Waiting for God”</b>\n“I would have felt really disappointed in myself if I hadn’t touched on systemic racism on this record. It really is something that’s just become more and more pressing on me. When Trayvon Martin was murdered—this beautiful 17-year-old kid, walking home at night in a hoodie, holding a bag of Skittles in his hands and he gets shot by a white supremacist—and the way his death was treated in the press, the way that disgusting George Zimmerman got off by pleading his own fear, I think it triggered something in me. I finally started really paying attention. And I have great shame around the fact that it’s taken me this long and I’m 54 years old. But after the death of Trayvon Martin, I just saw this alarming spate of murders of Black kids in America, it was shocking. It felt like it was every day and nobody gave a shit.”<br />\n<b>“Godhead”</b>\n“‘Godhead’ is really tongue-in-cheek, but it’s also stating the obvious, which is: If I was a male, I would be treated very differently in the world. I know this because of some of the misogyny and sexism I have endured as a professional musician. When I was in my thirties, it infuriated me to the point that I couldn’t really see straight. Now, I find it almost funny that the male is given all this gravitas in society because he’s got a silly cock and balls between his legs and women aren’t given the same amount of gravitas because we’ve got vaginas. When you start examining that patriarchal coloring of absolutely everything, that even God is sold to you as a male figure, you start to see this insidious madness that conditions males into feeling they’re more important. And it conditions females into thinking they are less important. And it’s really beginning to wear on me terribly.”<br />\n<b>“Anonymous XXX”</b>\n“We kept on obsessing over Roxy Music and how modern they still sound, and how exciting and dangerous. The idea of danger in music seems to have been almost eradicated entirely, certainly in mainstream pop music. We were obsessing over Andy Mackay’s sax sound, and so we wrote a song using a synth sax. I wanted to write about this idea of anonymous sex. I find it so fascinating. What attracts us to having sex with people we don’t know? And why do we project all our longing onto these kinds of dalliances? It was that fascination with the hidden and the secrets and the self-deception.”<br />\n<b>“A Woman Destroyed”</b>\n“I think this is my attempt to flip the narrative on what was happening with the Me Too movement, where I felt women were being portrayed poorly by the media. And it pissed me off that so much of the discussion was focusing on the victimization of women and what had women done to encourage their attacks on their bodies and on their freedoms. I wanted to create a female superhero who took revenge much like <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>, which is the Persian movie by Ana Lily Amirpour. I love that notion of this vampire taking revenge on those who hurt her. And so the song is a cinematic fantasy of revenge.”<br />\n<b>“Flipping the Bird”</b>\n“I was inspired by <i>Men Explain Things to Me</i> by Rebecca Solnit, and this idea of suddenly being aware that a lot of the time, when you’re choosing to engage with men about certain subjects, they automatically assume that you know nothing and that they are the ones who know everything. I was also inspired by hanging out with Liz Phair and feeling a little taken over by her spirit. I wanted to sing a song like she does, where she always picks a really low register in her voice. It’s an acerbic look at the male ego and how women often choose, myself included, to form ourselves around this ego in the room in order to keep the peace and not have an angry man. We make these little compromises on the surface, but behind our eyes, there’s a whole other perception of what’s going down.”<br />\n<b>“No Gods No Masters”</b>\n“I sing on this song, ‘No masters or gods to obey,’ and I was like, ‘Great, “no gods no masters” is the old punk slogan’ and that seemed like the perfect title for the whole record because of what was going on socially at the time. There was just so much dissent and rebellions against governments and the people really rising up, whether it was the Me Too movement, the Black Lives Matter movement—it was a glorious, beautiful thing to see. We all want good things for our babies, our families, our friends. And yet we so often then want to crush someone else’s spirit, who’s not our friend, who’s not our baby, who’s not our family. And it’s a mystery to me. And yet the world tumbles on, evolution continues. The future still holds. And that is a glorious thing. I love feeling hopeful about new generations who will eventually sort this shit out.”<br />\n<b>“This City Will Kill You”</b>\n“This song is a goodbye and it’s an elegy, but it’s also hopeful. If you find yourself in shit, it doesn’t mean you have to stay there. It doesn’t mean your life is over. I still believe in the possibilities [that] you can turn pretty much anything around. I wanted that sense of comfort to be there, because it’s a dark record, it’s a difficult record. I wanted this to be, at the end of everything, like an embrace, like, ‘It’s going to be OK.’”","short":"“It’s a dark record but I wanted a sense of comfort to be there.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1569753635","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569753635?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/7a/6b/4b/7a6b4b50-6219-4bab-5872-259c94e43d2d/21UMGIM44442.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"eda1d0","textColor1":"140a09","textColor2":"0e0e0e","textColor3":"3f2831","textColor4":"3b2c35"},"artistName":"Years & Years","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-years-years-single/1569753635","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Apple Music Home Session: Years & Years - Single","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438364046","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1569753635","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Olly Alexander had a pretty primal response to one of 2021’s signature hits—and subject of his exclusive Apple Home Session cover. “When I first heard ‘MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)’ I wanted to take off all my clothes and run screaming through the street,” Alexander—aka Years & Years—tells Apple Music. “The song is already perfect so I just wanted to have fun doing an acoustic version and seeing if I could sing all the parts in my range—which was a challenge, but I love it.

Inspired by living through the events of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest of 2020, Crowder found himself pondering the optimism inherent within the biblical origin of the phrase, which refers to the Promised Land in the book of Exodus—“a land flowing with milk and honey.” That line of thought led Crowder to write a collection of songs primarily grounded in faith-based positivity, one that he hoped would foster a sense of community and connectedness in his listeners, both through hopeful lyrics (“Milk & Honey,” “Hallelujah for Every Broken Heart”) and prominent choral vocals. “The whole album, I wanted choral stuff on it,” Crowder tells Apple Music. “I think that's just because we were separated from each other [during the pandemic]. It's the idea of togetherness. I think we're made for community and relationships.” Below, Crowder walks us through several of <i>Milk & Honey</i>’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Good God Almighty”</b>\n“In the middle of something pretty traumatic, we're still going to claim this, that God is still God. God is still good and he's in control. So there's a lot of trepidation, to me, in the song. It sounds like a fun song. But the lyrics are like, ‘Hey, no matter what comes, I'm still going to make this statement.’”<br />\n<b>“Milk & Honey”</b>\n“A friend of mine early on sent me a link to Neil deGrasse Tyson on the [Joe] Rogan show. And he was talking about milk and honey. To me, when I knew I was wanting to title this record <i>Milk & Honey</i>, I was most curious how it would connect with people outside of any sort of church context—that's a phrase that would mean something to people who've read the Torah, but maybe not someone that's outside of a Christian culture. And he says that they're basically the only things you can eat that don't involve death. That all animal and plant products die for us to eat their leaves or their flesh. But milk and honey, nothing dies. To me that was like, ‘Ah, that's even more beautiful than I thought.’ It's like you're headed somewhere where there's life and just more life. So I was trying to find a lot of images or word pictures that let us understand, like, what could it be like to have love blooming where hate used to grow.”<br />\n<b>“Higher Power” (feat. Hulvey)</b>\n“I love the collaborative thing. There's a number of them on this album. But since I moved to Atlanta—I've been in Atlanta for about eight years—I've gotten to be good friends with the Reach Records, 116 crew, with Lecrae and the gang, especially this guy that runs their studio space, Jacob Morris. He goes by Biz and he helped me design the studio that's at my house. Since Biz had been over at the house all the time, he kept talking about this new guy that they had signed at Reach, this Hulvey guy. This dude, you just put a microphone in front of him and it's just gold.”<br />\n<b>“God Really Loves Us” (feat. Dante Bowe and Maverick City Music)</b>\n“I think it might be my favorite moment on the whole album. And maybe it's because it’s the last thing we did, but I think it could be really special. And we'll see how it connects with people once it's out the door, but it sure felt special. My favorite writes are the ones that you feel the least responsible for. You walk away and go, ‘I don't even know how that got done or where that came from.’”<br />\n<b>“Hallelujah for Every Broken Heart”</b>\n“I'm a huge NEEDTOBREATHE fan, and it's the first time I've gotten to write with Bear [Rinehart], who's the singer for NEEDTOBREATHE. And all of a sudden he starts sending me songs; he would call them hymns. And I'm telling you, I was in heaven. He sent me this one and immediately, with the moment that we were in, it felt super timely.”<br />\n<b>“The Anchor”</b>\n“Tommee Profitt is a Nashville guy that I had written with a bunch on my last project. I had gone to him for beats and tracks on the last project, so I hollered at him early on for this one. I had known that I was wanting to do a song called ‘Anchor’ and had some of the ideas and content already pinned. I'm like, ‘I think we might be almost done with this. I think that this is supposed to just be such a sparse end. And I think this is the last track on the album and all we need is...’ And he goes, ‘Let me guess, a choir.’ Like, ‘Yes, we need a choir and then we're good.’”","short":"“It's the idea of togetherness.

It sounds really pretty, and even though it’s a really dark song, it’s got something lovely and light about it. I’ve always loved music like that.” It’s a gorgeous, floating cover, joined by piano-led versions of the singer’s 2020 track “Oh No” and “American Beauty,” which is taken from her 2021 EP <i>The Sky Is Bleeding</i>. Stripped of the singer’s preferred hazy melodies and heavy beats, they’re given a haunting, intimate new edge. “With ‘Oh No,’ I forgot how heavy that tune is in the lyrics, and I guess in the format it is originally there’s a lot going on in it,” says Smyth. “Stripping it back to just the keys, there’s a vulnerability where there’s not much to hide behind.” Like so many artists, Smyth has found the enforced time spent at home in 2020 and 2021 an enlightening experience. “The space has been a real time to reflect on how much we have to value and appreciate each other,” she says. “I think music as a means to do that is just beautiful.”","short":"“I had a really good time doing these tracks like this.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569831419","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569831419?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"height":2000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d4/c3/d8/d4c3d8b4-ab25-7ec2-6d1e-9a7f437b1f73/810016764502.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"fbfbfb","textColor1":"0f0d10","textColor2":"421434","textColor3":"3e3c3f","textColor4":"67425b"},"artistName":"Poppy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eat-nxt-soundtrack-ep/1569831419","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-08","name":"EAT (NXT Soundtrack) - EP","recordLabel":"Sumerian Records","upc":"810016764502","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sumerian Records","playParams":{"id":"1569831419","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1570253219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570253219?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/dc/e2/a7/dce2a7a7-561a-838e-e509-1f9afe26e95d/EXO_DIGITAL_COVER.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"00fa00","textColor2":"00e300","textColor3":"00c800","textColor4":"00b600"},"artistName":"EXO","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-fight-the-feeling-special-album-ep/1570253219","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-07","name":"DON'T FIGHT THE FEELING - Special Album - EP","recordLabel":"SM Entertainment","upc":"888735938146","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 SM Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1570253219","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The boy band return with a smooth set of funky pop tunes.","short":"The boy band return with a smooth set of funky pop tunes."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1567158268","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567158268?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/36/d5/58/36d5580d-0462-7d00-f7d4-25192c715ad1/876931070500.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000002","textColor1":"f8f9fd","textColor2":"ff0024","textColor3":"c6c7ca","textColor4":"cb001d"},"artistName":"Mötley Crüe","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/girls-girls-girls-40th-anniversary-remastered/1567158268","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Girls, Girls, Girls (40th Anniversary Remastered)","recordLabel":"Mötley Records","upc":"876931070500","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Masters 2000, Inc., under exclusive license to Better Noise Music","playParams":{"id":"1567158268","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Celebrating four decades of swaggering down the Sunset Strip."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1558693842","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1558693842?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/e4/8c/25/e48c25e2-0711-d62a-4392-09d6263d1f95/0045778781164.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"202123","textColor1":"d1d6b3","textColor2":"cfbfa8","textColor3":"adb296","textColor4":"ac9f8e"},"artistName":"Danny Elfman","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/big-mess/1558693842","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Big Mess","recordLabel":"Anti/Epitaph","upc":"0045778781164","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Danny Elfman, under exclusive license to Anti","playParams":{"id":"1558693842","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"From Tim Burton’s classics like <i>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</i> and <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> to <i>The Simpsons</i>, Danny Elfman’s world-class scores have become indelible elements of some of the most beloved movies and TV shows of the past three decades. In preparing for a career-spanning live performance at the 2020 Coachella festival, Elfman began working on a set that would combine his film work with reimagined versions of songs from his old band, LA New Wave pioneers Oingo Boingo, and new chamber pop compositions written for a live rock band. When the festival was canceled due to the global pandemic, Elfman continued writing through lockdown and ended up with two albums’ worth of material, which he duly recorded with assistance from Robin Finck (Nine Inch Nails, Guns N’ Roses), Josh Freese (Weezer, Devo), Stu Brooks (Lady Gaga, Dub Trio), and renowned guitarist Nili Brosh. The result is <i>Big Mess</i>, his first solo album since 1984 and a collection of material unlike anything Elfman has previously created. “This came out of the shitstorm that was 2020,” he tells Apple Music. “I was feeling frustrated from every side, but particularly from what I was seeing in society. I haven’t seen the country so divided since the Vietnam War.”<br />\nIn channeling that frustration, Elfman combined symphony orchestration with traditional rock band elements to write some of the heaviest and most chaotic music of his career. “The songs were all coming out in pairs,” he says. “Heavy and fast and crazy, and then light—like each one was a reaction to the other. It felt like I was developing two different albums, hence the title. I became more and more aware of the fact that I have two very functional dysfunctional writers living inside me, and they don’t like each other.” Below, he discusses some of the key tracks from <i>Big Mess</i>.<br />\n<b>“Sorry”</b>\n“This was my first song for <i>Big Mess</i>. It started as a concept piece about combining an orchestra and rock band in a way I’d been thinking about for a while. It ended up as an explosion of frustration and pent-up anger.”<br />\n<b>“True”</b>\n“This song was a new thing for me, writing from such a personal place. It wasn't something I set out to do—it just happened. And it was also the song where I was finding a new voice for this album, because I clearly can’t sing as high as I used to. ‘True’ was the song where I was finding myself able to sing in a way that I couldn’t do 30 years ago. I was surprised by how dark it came out, but that’s where I was at in 2020 when I wrote it.”<br /> \n<b>“In Time”</b>\n“This is another personal song, reflecting on the passage of time and the end of everything. I don’t want to overexplain the lyrics, other than to say that the idea of finality was floating around in my mind and just kind of came to the surface in this song. It’s something that artists have been obsessed with for years. If you look at a Titian painting from the Renaissance, it’s about the transient, momentary thing that this life is.”<br /> \n<b>“Dance With the Lemurs”</b>\n“This is another personal reflection on my life and the process of aging. That sounds grim, but I feel like it’s a light song at the same time. I was surprised that I wrote about that topic—it feels like something I wouldn’t normally let out. At first, it felt too personal to even put out. I thought maybe I was going to just release the fun, fast stuff and keep songs like this in my own archives. But eventually I figured I should put it out.”<br /> \n<b>“Happy”</b>\n“I wanted to have a bit of fun creating a song that began like a bubbly pop song and slowly degraded into a subversive, nasty rant. At the beginning, the song pulls in one direction, and by the end you’re going, ‘What is this place I was lured into?’ It was kind of designed to be a little bit of a trap, like, ‘Come on in, it’s a nice safe place.’ And by the end, it’s really despicable.”<br /> \n<b>“Just a Human”</b>\n“This song is kind of a counterpoint to ‘Kick Me’—again, the songs were written in pairs. It’s part of the schizophrenic cacophony I was feeling during lockdown in 2020, when anger, frustration, and pure ridiculous absurdity were mixing all together in my mind.”<br /> \n<b>“Devil Take Away”</b>\n“This was totally off the cuff and just pure fun for me. I decided to just pick up the guitar, let it run amok, come up with improvised lyrics, and then not try to fix it. It was more of a really fun exercise more than anything else. I wrote this one after ‘Everybody Loves You,’ which is really elaborate, and I’m talking about God and my place on the planet. After that, I wanted to do something where no thought goes into it and I don’t go back and reshape it, which is typically how I write. So this was just pure improvisational mayhem.”<br /> \n<b>“Native Intelligence”</b>\n“This was a tricky one. I was still obsessed with ways of combining the orchestra strings and the band, and this was the song I was most pleased with in that exploration. I was also reflecting my feelings about the political moment of living in America in 2020.”<br /> \n<b>“Kick Me”</b>\n“Nothing is more fun for me than poking a stick in the eye of celebrity mentality and the unique love-hate relationship celebrities often have with their fans. People become celebrities for the most peculiar reasons, and we live in a time where one can be an enormous celebrity without even having any particular talent. The concept of celebrity and the relationship between celebrities and the public—this weird interdependency—has always fascinated me. I find it to be constantly humorous.”<br />\n<b>“Insects”</b>\n“I had so much fun reworking this old Oingo Boingo song, I just had to include it.”","short":"“I have two dysfunctional writers living inside me; they don’t like each other.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1551117636","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1551117636?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/a6/18/78/a618782c-f593-7243-a7c5-2897177aed47/686091846965.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"686868","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"f7cbaa","textColor3":"e0e0e0","textColor4":"dbb79c"},"artistName":"Mammoth WVH","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mammoth-wvh/1551117636","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Mammoth WVH","recordLabel":"EX1 Records","upc":"686091846965","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 EX1 Records","playParams":{"id":"1551117636","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Wolfgang Van Halen joined his dad and uncle’s legendary and eponymous rock band at age 15, he quickly proved himself as a bass prodigy in a band of virtuosos. While on tour with Van Halen in 2015, he began composing songs for what would become his solo debut, <i>Mammoth WVH</i>—an album on which he plays all the instruments and performs all the vocals. “It was a labor of love,” he tells Apple Music. “It was so much fun to creatively explore and have no bounds.” It’s no coincidence that Mammoth was the moniker Van Halen went by before they changed their name in the mid-70s. Wolfgang chose it to maintain a musical connection to his dad, who passed in 2020. “It’s impossible to ignore where I’m from, so I wanted to touch on the history while taking it in my own direction,” he says. “Plus, I’ve always loved the name. When my dad told me the story, I was like, ‘I want to call my own band that when I grow up.” Below, he discusses each track.<br />\n<b>“Mr. Ed”</b>\n“Contrary to the title, this lyrically has nothing to do with dad. It was the demo title because I harmonically tap the intro, and it just kind of stuck around. It’s a tongue-in-cheek, funny title for the song, so even after the lyrics were done I decided to keep it.”<br /> \n<b>“Horribly Right”</b>\n“This is a song I wrote in New York when we had a week off on the 2015 Van Halen tour. Rather than going home, I stayed in my hotel and made the demo that became this song. It was really fun to take a quick break from tour and just lock myself in my room and write. The title comes from the punchline of a story that my producer was telling me—something like, ‘If we get there, things will have to go horribly right for us.’ I just thought it fit the vibe of the song.”<br />\n<b>“Epiphany”</b>\n“I view this as one of the core-sounding songs. It’s kind of like the center of what the band is really about. Just like ‘Mr. Ed,’ ‘Epiphany’ was the demo title because I was just cleaning my kitchen when the melody came to me. I ran upstairs, but instead of recording the idea on my phone, I went straight to Logic and made a demo. And the song came out pretty similar to that demo, so I kept the title.”<br /> \n<b>“Don't Back Down”</b>\n“I like to think of this one as the fight song. It's the song you throw on when you want your team to just beat the shit out of the other team. It really has that galloping, Black Sabbath sort of vibe—you can hear it with the riff and the fuzz tone on the guitars. It’s a really fun, balls to the wall rocker.”<br /> \n<b>“Resolve”</b>\n“This one is super different from the rest of the album—a little bit to the left of the main sound. The bass is grooving the whole time, and it rarely changes. It’s just locked in a groove with the drums. But it’s a softer, more melodic kind of groovy song—very vocal heavy. It’s another one I wrote on the 2015 Van Halen tour, this time in the back of the bus.”<br /> \n<b>“You’ll Be the One”</b>\n“This is a shorter song with a dance drumbeat that I really love. I was kind of cheeky with the intro on this one—you don’t really know where the one is, and the drums come in on the up-beat. So when it finally hits, you’re kind of playing catch up and you don’t really start to get it until the vocals come in. It kind of forces you to pay attention. The solo was done with a talk box that I’d never used before. I was so bad at it that I had to tape my nose because I kept breathing into the mic while I was doing it.”<br /> \n<b>“Mammoth”</b>\n“I love the self-titled debut with the self-titled song—that triple hit. I was definitely following Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden with this idea. I think Green Day did it, too. Like ‘Epiphany,’ I feel this is the core sound of the band, which is why the name of the song is also the name of the band and the album. It’s also at the center of the album. It’s a really personal song about anxiety and depression and finding your way out of it—or at least attempting to.”<br /> \n<b>“Circles”</b>\n“This is probably the most different song on the whole album. It’s a really fun one that came together during the recording process. It’s got a lot of layers, but it’s primarily rooted in kind of an acoustic rhythm, and I really enjoy how dark and gloomy the song is. I’m also a big fan of vocal harmonies, so it was fun to really go nuts on this one. I think every single line is harmonized throughout the verse, except for the little bridge.”<br /> \n<b>“The Big Picture”</b>\n“The demo title for this one was ‘Queens,’ because I’m a big Queens of the Stone Age fan and this very much has that fuzzy Queens vibe. It’s almost like Queens and Alice In Chains had a baby. I’m a big fan of bendy riffs, and this has a super bendy one, but my favorite part is the bridge, with the layered harmonies.”<br /> \n<b>“Think it Over”</b>\n“This was my dad’s favorite song on the album. It’s really just a straight-up pop song that really echoes the bands I grew up on, like Blink-182 and Jimmy Eat World. It has that pop sensibility, but it’s still very much within the Mammoth sound. My dad called my solo a ‘George Harrison solo,’ which was one of my favorite compliments he gave me. It’s not a flashy solo, but melodically it perfectly fits the song.”<br /> \n<b>“You’re to Blame”</b>\n“This has a very Rage Against the Machine or Audioslave kind of riff and a really fun solo. Most of the songs don’t really have too many solos, maybe some little leads here and there. When it comes to solos, I always do it for the song. When you’re part of a band, you maybe want to show off when you’re playing just one instrument. But when you’re playing everything, you kind of look like an asshole if you’re trying to show off on every instrument. It really makes you respect the songwriting process and write the best song rather than be like, ‘Hey, I did that!’”<br /> \n<b>“Feel”</b>\n“The first time I posted it on my Instagram was in like 2015, so it's crazy to have it finally coming out. For one of the guitar tracks, I played my dad’s original Frankenstein guitar. I played it on ‘Mammoth’ as well. When he pulled it out, he kind of noodled with it for a second and then sort of haphazardly tossed it on to the couch and everyone in the room just gasped. To him, it’s just a piece of junk he put together, but to us it’s the most recognizable guitar in music history.”<br /> \n<b>“Stone”</b>\n“The intention with this one was to make an epic finale. It’s a bit longer, over six minutes, and it’s almost like Nine Inch Nails and Black Sabbath had a baby. It has that kind of darker, sludgy vibe.”<br /> \n<b>“Distance”</b>\n“This is a bonus track. I originally put this out for Pop and had all the proceeds go to his favorite charity, Mr. Holland’s Opus Foundation, but after the crazy success that it saw, we felt like it was a good idea to have it on the album. Dad had been up and down so much health-wise over the years, and emotionally it was a tough thing to go through. I wrote this song imagining what it would be like to be without him, and it ended up being really poignant. It’s really about loss, and I think anybody can relate to that.”\n","short":"“It’s impossible to ignore where I’m from, so I wanted to touch on the

So after completing a three-album experiment in microtonal tuning—playing notes that exist between the notes on standard Western scales—with February 2021’s <i>L.W.</i>, it’s no surprise to find them poking the reset button again. This time, they’re underscoring the pop in psych-pop with a song suite that funnels their wide-eyed ambition through satisfyingly direct melodies. All built from arpeggiated synth loops, the songs skip off in divergent directions, including the motorik rush of opener “Yours,” shimmering cosmic disco (“Catching Smoke”), and celestial synth-pop (“Interior People”). The scope of the band’s adventure would be dizzying if it weren’t for the smooth turns they forge in and out of each track. In a year marked by lockdowns and limited choices, trust The Giz to have created music that feels so boundless and upbeat.","short":"The Giz break new ground again with a suite of divergent psych-pop."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1567554505","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567554505?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/7f/35/a9/7f35a9ca-d95f-892d-5ea4-ed53a48c7852/5056167163831_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"3c0502","textColor1":"8fd0e3","textColor2":"e87b67","textColor3":"7ea7b6","textColor4":"c56453"},"artistName":"Gus Dapperton","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/orca-deluxe/1567554505","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2020-09-18","name":"Orca (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Gus Dapperton","upc":"5056167163831","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Gus Dapperton under exclusive license to AWAL Recordings America, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1567554505","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1558747521","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1558747521?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/da/db/67/dadb6799-9459-0c91-3de5-f8bcfb6535a1/44003240612.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"d8d2cb","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"610d00","textColor3":"2b2a28","textColor4":"783528"},"artistName":"Dizzy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/separate-places-ep/1558747521","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Separate Places - EP","recordLabel":"Royal Mountain Records","upc":"044003240612","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Royal Mountain Records","playParams":{"id":"1558747521","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1554962478","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1554962478?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/15/fc/b7/15fcb740-5744-050e-be00-a6cc265a6669/20UM1IM17831.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"395b78","textColor1":"daecf7","textColor2":"c6e2f7","textColor3":"bacfde","textColor4":"a9c7de"},"artistName":"Julian Lage","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/squint/1554962478","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Squint","recordLabel":"Blue Note Records","upc":"00602435521480","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Blue Note Records; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1554962478","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Much like his duo and quartet partner Nels Cline, guitarist extraordinaire Julian Lage made the move from Mack Avenue to Blue Note, continuing his artistic evolution in the footsteps of jazz greats. <i>Squint</i>, the result, is his second trio album with bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Dave King, after 2019’s <i>Love Hurts</i>. It reflects a deepening devotion to the solid-body guitar and its very particular sonic and geometric properties. In this setting, Lage has accessed a whole other array of timbral options as an improviser. The way Roeder and King work with him to bring it all together is impeccable.<br />\nEight new originals, an electric reworking of the acoustic “Day and Age” from 2015’s <i>World’s Fair</i> (transposed from E down to D), readings of the jazz standard “Emily,” and the old Gene Autry movie number “Call of the Canyon”: Lage makes it all gleam with a consistent guitar voice, no matter the stylistic “bag.” Whether it’s Ornette Coleman-esque jazz (“Squint,” “Familiar Flower”), the vintage rock flavor of “Boo’s Blues” and “Saint Rose,” or the Western swing vibe of “Twilight Surfer,” this is music where the guitar-and-amp combo, not just the guitar, becomes the instrument. Lage is determined to wring every ounce of tone and bite from that setup. “Quiet Like a Fuse” is a title that somehow captures it all, and a textbook example of how to use semi-gnarly overdrive on a ballad.","short":"Joining Blue Note, the guitarist ups his trio game once again."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1559574523","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1559574523?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1440,"height":1440,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/a4/dc/3f/a4dc3fe5-8b34-9a72-1afd-e0dfd7c9ff55/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"002c6d","textColor1":"fbfeff","textColor2":"d3e4f9","textColor3":"c8d3e1","textColor4":"a8bfdd"},"artistName":"Gilb'R","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/on-danse-comme-des-fous/1559574523","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronica","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"On danse comme des fous","recordLabel":"Versatile Records","upc":"3616554251194","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Versatile records","playParams":{"id":"1559574523","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1560734559","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1560734559?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/8b/c0/a3/8bc0a32d-5c12-fd31-a5a8-9f035aaf7b5a/810874022103.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"446a70","textColor1":"ebf3f6","textColor2":"eaeef8","textColor3":"cad8db","textColor4":"c9d4dd"},"artistName":"Rarelyalways & Hanni El Khatib","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/manic-ep/1560734559","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap","Hip-Hop"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"Manic -

It didn’t seem like the right time to compose new music, he tells Apple Music, but rather “a good moment to understand where I started, where I left off, and what I want to do next.” So, O’Halloran rerecorded pieces from three of his previous albums: <i>Piano Solos</i> (2004), <i>Piano Solos Vol. 2</i> (2006), and <i>Lumiere</i> (2011). <i>Silfur</i> introduces listeners to newly minted, beautifully produced performances of 13 tracks from them, including new string arrangements and artist collaborations. Composed in different countries at different points in O’Halloran’s life, many of the original tracks were recorded live or “very humbly, with almost low-fi aesthetics” on an old upright piano. “I thought I could bring new meaning to some of these pieces and make a better recording of them,” he says. “Digging back into my pieces and rerecording them has made me realize how music itself captures time, but also how it changes over time.”<br />\nIt’s this idea of his music existing in two forms—past and present—that inspired this album’s unique title. O’Halloran recorded <i>Silfur</i> in Iceland, splitting sessions between the Fríkirkjan Church in Reykjavík and a concert hall in Akureyri, in the north, to ensure the acoustic qualities needed for each track. “While I was making this recording, a friend of mine brought some Icelandic silfurberg stones to give me good energy for recording,” he reveals. “Silfurberg splits light into two rays. The Vikings used it for navigation, and it was used in medical instruments in the 1800s. I thought it was a beautiful analogy for what I was doing, which was taking something and reflecting it into two perspectives: the present time that I made the recording, and the idea of looking back on my work.” <i>Silfur</i> is bookended by two original tracks—“Opus 56” and “Constellation No. 2”—a sign, says O’Halloran, of the musical direction in which he’ll head after this album. Read on as the pianist guides us through each track on the mesmerizing <i>Silfur</i>.<br /> \n<b>Opus 56</b>\n“I'm always searching for different things each time I write a piece. I wrote this one at the beginning of lockdown and was looking for something that had a purity to it. A few years ago, I had a problem with my arm, which caused nerve problems in my hand. I’ve lost a bit of technical ability in my right hand, so it’s like I’m working with my limitations. There are usually a lot of colors in my music, but there’s a lot of white in this one.”<br />\n<b>Opus 28</b>\n“I wrote ‘Opus 28’ while I was living in Italy. I wrote the string arrangement not long after, but I never got a proper recording of it. I used to perform it live with strings a lot, and I actually played it with the Siggi String Quartet the first time I came to Iceland. To feature them on the album was a nice circle to complete with them.”<br />\n<b>Opus 44</b>\n“For <i>Silfur</i>, I played this one on a Bösendorfer grand piano, but originally recorded it for [2011 album] <i>Lumiere</i> on an old British piano made by Wing & Son, which had four pedals and has this woody, deep tone. This wasn’t a piece I originally thought to rerecord, but when I started to get into it, I realized that it was one that, despite its constantly changing keys, still sounded very fluid. I didn’t study piano and I didn’t go to conservatory. So, for me, it’s a question of working with what I’ve got and searching from something interesting in the piano.”<br />\n<b>Opus 18</b>\n“This is a very simple piece with a nostalgic feel for me. It always reminds me of my time in Italy, which is where I really started to focus on the piano. In the original recording, you can hear the sound of birds or a Vespa going by. I didn’t have a lot of sound isolation. This time, I recorded it in the Fríkirkjan Church in Reykjavík. I always imagined this piece having a lot of space in the recording.”<br />\n<b>Opus 17</b>\n“I’m a huge fan of Baroque and counterpoint, and this was my exploration of that. It’s influenced by Scarlatti and Bach. ‘Opus 17’ got me into film scoring, because it was used in Sofia Coppola’s film <i>Marie Antoinette</i>. I think, when they heard it, they probably thought it was by a dead composer!”<br />\n<b>Opus 55</b>\n“I originally recorded this in the Grunewald Church in West Berlin. Bryan Senti is an amazing composer in his own right and a fantastic violinist. We did a live session at Capitol Records for Deutsche Grammophon, and I asked him if he would perform it with me. When I write a piece for piano, I usually don’t think about adding anything more. I always imagine it just for that instrument. But Bryan was able to find a way to make the violin feel a part of the piece. He really brought it up to date and gave the piece a new life.”<br />\n<b>Opus 12</b>\n“This is from my first record, which has a lot of nostalgia in it. I thought if I was going to make <i>Silfur</i>, I needed to show where I started. I think my early works have quite a naive approach, but I realized that I’ll never write a piece like that again. There’s something very beautiful about the fact that I’m never going to be in that musical place again.”<br />\n<b>Fine</b>\n“I find the Minimalist movement inspiring. I’ve always been a ‘less is more’ type of composer anyway. And I love repetition—I think it’s a really beautiful thing. This piece is just an exploration of minimalism and repetition.”<br />\n<b>Opus 20</b>\n“‘Opus 20’ is really open-hearted, and I wanted to create something that would move through a lot of different parts and sections and take you on a journey. But really, I just wanted to make something that was beautiful but which also expressed that feeling of beauty.”<br />\n<b>Opus 7</b>\n“This is from my first record. It’s got a bit of a dark, dramatic feel to it. Again, it’s probably not a piece that I would write today, but it reminds me of the angst of youth. I really feel I captured a moment in time in it, so I thought it would be nice to try to give it a new life.”<br /> \n<b>Opus 30</b>\n“Here, I tried to adopt a more simple, left-hand approach. I love trying to use not too many notes at the same time, and this one rarely uses more than three or four notes simultaneously. It explores small color shifts and how you can shift the tonality with the left hand alone.”<br /> \n<b>Opus 17 (String Quartet Version)</b>\n“I was asked if I could do some string quartet versions of the pieces, but I didn’t feel most of them would work as a quartet—they felt so centered on the piano itself. But because this one has that counterpoint element, I thought it could work. The quartet is my favorite string ensemble because every player has to be spot-on. In an orchestra, things can be a little bit more blurred, but I like that every player has to really play their part and it has to be very controlled. I like that dynamic.”<br /> \n<b>Opus 21</b>\n“There is definitely a bit of Chopin influence in here. I think because I never got to study the piano masterworks, I was always trying to write my own that I could play. The interesting part of recording all of these pieces is that I know that I’m now going in a different direction, but finding your own voice means touching on different aspects and styles of music. So, this piece is me just exploring a certain style.”<br />\n<b>Opus 37</b>\n“This is very meditative with a lot of subtle tones—a lot of white and pale blue colors. I wanted to record it at the Fríkirkjan Church, as I have always pictured this piece as having a lot of resonance and openness.”<br />\n<b>Constellation No. 2</b>\n“I wrote this one with [Icelandic musician] Gyða Valtýsdóttir. It was the last piece I wrote and recorded in Berlin. I lived there for 10 years and shared a studio with fellow composer Johan Johansson and then [Icelandic musician and composer] Hildur Guðnadóttir. Gyða was spending a lot of time in Berlin, and she and I had worked a lot together over the years. She has a really sweet, beautiful touch on the cello’s upper register. Nobody really plays the high notes, but all of the strings on this piece are played on a cello. This piece is really simple, but it has a strong emotional pull. Maybe it’s a sign of the direction that I’m going in.”","short":"“A good moment to understand where I started and what I want to do next.”\n"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1564796344","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1564796344?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/9c/4f/b2/9c4fb2b5-c27f-d6a2-b000-2bd819ec033a/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"1d2323","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"c1c1c1","textColor3":"d1d2d2","textColor4":"a0a1a1"},"artistName":"Mark System","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/25-years-of-metalheadz-pt-4-single/1564796344","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jungle/Drum'n'bass","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-11","name":"25 Years of Metalheadz, Pt. 4 - Single","recordLabel":"Metalheadz","upc":"3616555203635","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Metalheadz Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1564796344","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
