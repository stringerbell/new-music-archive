So it's bittersweet for me because I'm here: I'm at a point in my life where I reached my most success. And beating the system in a way where I'm not a statistic, I'm not in prison or my life wasn't cut short due to gun violence. We literally call n***as OGs when they turn 25 years old. So I want my music to reflect that, to reflect my headspace and the mode that I'm in.”<br /> \n<i>25</i> follows 2020’s <i>PTSD</i>, a project that stamped him as one of Chicago’s most impactful MCs and also one of the most revered voices in hip-hop. With <i>25</i>, Herbo continues to build his legacy, reflecting on art and life in a way he hopes will draw him closer to some of his biggest inspirations. “I just feel like I got in this to go down as somebody that's legendary,” Herbo says. “One of the artists that will be remembered for generations to come, like a Nas, like a JAY-Z, like a Kiss, like DMX, like a Wayne, Fab—those are the people who I looked up to. I work hard enough to feel like I'm a star, but I feel like my ceiling is so much higher and I got so much further to go.” Below, the esteem-focused MC breaks down five tracks from <i>25</i> that show his range.<br />\n<b>“I Don’t Wanna Die”</b>\n“I'm a hip-hop artist, so my intro always got to feel like the hardest, one of the songs with the most substance of the whole project. And 'I Don't Wanna Die,' for me, is how I explain the album in a whole, just becoming 25 years old and just beating the streets. It's about me reflecting on the gun violence and the killing in my city—not only from my perspective, but from a mother's perspective, from a child's perspective. It's one of those records where I'm just going all the way in, there's no hook on it, I'm just letting all my feelings and emotions come out.”<br />\n<b>“Cry No More” (feat. Polo G & Lil Tjay)</b>\n\"Polo and TJ, they my dogs, both of them my boys. And they was just really speaking on the trauma and the stuff that we endure every day, and not wanting to feel that way no more. [From] being in the streets, or this industry, or dealing with life in general—I feel like a lot of people can relate to it, because it's been a lot of change dealing with the pandemic and a lot of the stuff that's going on. A lot of the trauma that I endured was from street violence, but we just talking about life in general on that song.”<br /> \n<b>“T.O.P.” (feat. 21 Savage)</b>\n“A lot of these records, the energy that you feel is because I'm actually connecting with these people. I'm connecting with the producers, I'm connecting with my peers, we all together in the studio when we getting all this stuff done. For 'T.O.P.' I was having fun in the studio with Hitmaka. It’s a record where I was letting my hair down in a sense. I always speak about my story and being in the streets, or what I deal with on a day-to-day basis, but I still have fun with my music, too.”<br />\n<b>“You Can’t” (feat. The Kid LAROI & Gunna)</b>\n“I was in the studio with Turbo and we was just vibing. We recorded a bunch of songs, and that was actually the last song that we did before we left. He just played the beat, and the shit was so hard, I'm like, I'm about to just lay it right now. I didn't even really have no direction. I just got on the beat and started rapping. And that's why I come in first before the hook. And then LAROI, that's my little brother. He pulled up on me in the studio, and I just played that record like, 'Man, put a hook on this for me.' I feel like it's one of those 'indexing records' that's going to be on a bunch of playlists that I probably usually wouldn't be on.”<br />\n<b>“Demands”</b>\n“‘Demands’ is one of those records where I feel like it's going to cause a little controversy. I always wanted to be known as a conscious rapper since I started. I came out doing music in the drill era, and I never really wanted to be known as that kind of artist. I’m talking about bringing change and shedding light on the situation by saying, 'Hey, this is what I feel we need to do to make a difference, and to put ourselves in a better position.' I’m not pointing the finger at anyone. I’m holding us accountable as a people as well.”","short":"“I got in this to go down as somebody that's legendary.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7AvdSuKYkwzJA8upKuW6zz"}},{"id":"1573621674","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573621674?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/65/45/ce/6545ce83-ce0d-cb93-d7f3-b9438b43c297/5056495202981_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"494949"},"artistName":"Lil Peep & Lil Tracy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/castles-single/1573621674","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"castles - Single","recordLabel":"Lil Peep","upc":"5056495202981","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Lil Peep / AUTNMY","playParams":{"id":"1573621674","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The EP from the GothBoiClique rappers lands on streaming."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1573622265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573622265?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d8/de/07/d8de0721-97df-8075-fa01-218ca62b3616/5056495203162_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"010005","textColor1":"fad3d6","textColor2":"fbd1bd","textColor3":"c8a8ac","textColor4":"c9a798"},"artistName":"Lil Peep & Lil Tracy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/castles-ii-ep/1573622265","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"CASTLES II - EP","recordLabel":"Lil Peep","upc":"5056495203162","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Lil Peep / AUTNMY","playParams":{"id":"1573622265","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The angsty second EP from the pair of rappers gets a streaming release."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1567417064","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567417064?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"height":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2c/d1/38/2cd138b3-9969-008d-121d-6f7a8682ae15/720665657271_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"4b6d72","textColor1":"fdfdfd","textColor2":"eee663","textColor3":"d9e0e1","textColor4":"cecd66"},"artistName":"Flatland Cavalry","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-countryland/1567417064","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Americana"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"Welcome To Countryland","recordLabel":"Flatland Cavalry","upc":"720665657271","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Flatland Cavalry","playParams":{"id":"1567417064","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7mbvRPQce4Lg8NpQkpOzxX"}},{"id":"1571588156","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571588156?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9d/fe/1a/9dfe1a43-66f5-5f75-52b1-2c2710be8e64/886449331192.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"b0ad9a","textColor1":"070f12","textColor2":"1d1e18","textColor3":"292e2d","textColor4":"3a3b32"},"artistName":"Dennis Lloyd","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/some-days/1571588156","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"Some Days","recordLabel":"Arista Records","upc":"886449331192","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 MTFKR, Ltd., under exclusive license to Arista Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1571588156","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“My life changed drastically when ‘Nevermind’ was released and blew up all over the world,” says Dennis Lloyd to Apple Music about the 2016 song that made him a worldwide sensation. “On the last tour in 2019, I felt like something had cracked.

But Jones also knows that you often have to travel from the lows to reach the highs, and there’s an absorbing sense of humanity to the songs. Crowd-rousing electro-pop on the surface, “Crystallise” reveals—via vocalist Jem Cooke—some of the emotional turbulence Jones and his wife felt having suffered a miscarriage before the birth of their daughter. On “You Broke My Heart Again,” meanwhile, Jones reworks New Mexico producer Teqkoi’s lo-fi electric ballad into effervescent beats and melodies that cradle beguilingly fragile and lovelorn vocals.

An Atlantic Records UK release, ℗ 2021 Flamingo Records Limited","playParams":{"id":"1557922475","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"<i>Pink Noise</i>, Laura Mvula’s third full-length project, is a sexy album. “It really is,” Mvula tells Apple Music. “And I wanted it to be. I needed it to be.” Having felt boxed in by the success of her first two records, what she calls the “serious music” of 2013 debut <i>Sing to the Moon</i> and 2016’s <i>The Dreaming Room</i>, the UK singer-songwriter allowed herself to “paint using more colors than perhaps I let myself use before,” resulting in a vibrant, ’80s-influenced soundscape, shot through with rediscovered confidence and unabashed desire. Indebted to the era of MTV icons—Michael and Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Prince—this is sophisticated, luxurious, kinetic pop music. It demands that you dance.<br />\nMvula is deeply respected as an artist—classically trained, nominated twice for the Mercury Prize, the recipient of an Ivor Novello award—but <i>Pink Noise</i>, by deliberate design, presents her as not just a talent, but a superstar. “I had gotten so comfortable with everything being so focused on the music as its own thing, and somehow I was sort of separate from that,” she says. “This time I wanted to be front and center.” Here, Mvula walks us through <i>Pink Noise</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Safe Passage”</b>\n“'Safe Passage' was the first song I made that felt like the beginning of something. There’s a [1988] song by BeBe & CeCe Winans called ‘Heaven.’ And I knew I just needed to capture that sound, because that song was always played on a Sunday after church. And if I hear it now, I can smell Sunday dinner. I can go back there. I was creating the palette that this was going to be nostalgia. This body of work was going to be nostalgia, but brought into the present moment. It needed to make me and us feel good and safe and celebrated.”<br />\n<b>“Conditional”</b> \n“I instinctively knew that ‘Conditional' was going to be the most far-left thing that I'd written or put out to that point. I didn’t grow up with hip-hop, so discovering it now in my own world, in my own way, since I started listening to Kanye, I've just been floored by his level of creativity. A lot of what he does sounds like symphonies to me. The idea that you can make something so hypnotic and rich from the simplicity of a cyclical beat. There's so many thousands and millions of versions of how you can manipulate just one frequency. I remember messing around with that beat and then Dann Hume, who co-produced the album, took it to another level with the sounds that we were using.”<br />\n<b>“Church Girl”</b>\n“Chris Martin FaceTimed me to tell me that this was his standout song. I'd done it randomly on the train. And then I wrote the chorus chords like six months later, but didn't really have a melody or a verse for it. But the fact that the verse and the chorus lived in two different tonalities was always going to be the thing. The shifting gears is really important to me for the story of this song and letting go of the devils, so to speak, and figuring out how to dance. It's like looking back as well as looking forward all at the same time.”<br />\n<b>“Remedy”</b> \n“I wanted to offer something direct to the struggle. It was during the time where people were taking to the streets and protesting. It needed to kick the way it did, it needed to slap the way it did, because I was pissed and tired and confused. I think that's all in that song. It was a direct point to Janet Jackson's <i>Rhythm Nation</i> and that whole era. The militant-ness of it was important for me. There's only so many times we can have the same conversation. My people are tired.”<br />\n<b>“Magical”</b>\n“I only used to have a verse and chorus chords for this song for so long. I hated it. I rewrote the chorus, and once the chorus came, that’s when we knew it was a game-changer. My brother, my sister, my adopted brother from another mother came through, played guitar and sang on it. And we just basically put the song to bed. I can't describe to you the feeling when something becomes what it is: the mystery of music-making.”<br />\n<b>“Pink Noise”</b>\n“The simplicity of this being a dance moment meant that I needed to draw, access things, tools I hadn't used before. I had to chip away at it slowly. It's not the kind of music where you play nine notes in a chord and it sounds lush. This is the kind of thing where if you put a few too many grains of whatever seasoning, it fucks the whole thing up. But you put it on and instantly you move, which is different for me. This is where the word ‘bop’ actually truly shines, because it is an actual bop.”<br />\n<b>“Golden Ashes”</b>\n“My cry for help for anyone that feels like they suffer in silence. Which is unfortunately a universal truth, a very universal reality. I’ve always been good at crying and I’ve always been good at expressing my woes. I needed, in the midst of all this triumph, a space to do that on this record. Just towards the end where it peters out and you have this very strange dissonant harmony and the pulsating sort of circular breathing, it’s supposed to feel hypnotic, like 'Are we still here? Are we still in this moment?' I'm super proud of this song.”<br />\n<b>“What Matters” (feat. Simon Neil)</b> \n“I don't think I've said this before, but for me, this wasn't really going on the album. This was truly just for me, the Laura who doesn’t know what radio is, what streaming is—they don’t exist to me. It was like an afterthought, but then it became this lullaby anthem. Simon [Neil, of Biffy Clyro] is one of the most special humans I think I'll probably ever meet or work with, so reverent for music and the art of collaboration.”<br />\n<b>“Got Me”</b> \n“I'd been trying to pander to this picture of innocence and purity—all things that I do value on some level, but unfortunately, at a cost to ignoring a large part of who I am. I just needed a moment and an outlet to put into that. I feel like it serves a different purpose to any other song on the record. I don’t have to hide anymore in that way, and it’s really liberating.”<br />\n<b>“Before the Dawn”</b>\n“When you are at a point where you're struggling and you feel like you're going through a moment in life where it's like, how on earth do you navigate this crisis? And you go back to the simple truths. My best friend said it to me first: ‘The night comes before the dawn.’ Which we all know, but it's just being reminded and reminding myself and singing to myself. Once I'm in that and I reflect or meditate on that and it seeps more deeply into my subconscious, I find that I move with way more purpose and with less baggage.”","short":"“This is a sexy record.

Its opening track, “Agos,” is a dream-like introduction that gradually pulls into focus, its harmonies and textures coalescing and allowing Plano’s voice to soar. And on the title track, the composer’s voice again calls out in a mesmerizing way that’s reminiscent of prayer, this time joined by a simple piano and electronic accompaniment. The three-part “Soul” suite channels the great composer Vangelis with its hymn-like harmonic sequences and innovative use of electronics. The final, rippling track, “Liv,” brings a sense of stillness to this moving self-portrait.","short":"An intimate, often melancholy album of atmospheric textures."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2SO9W0vx2L123tksH0rlrB"}},{"id":"1571481998","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571481998?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d2/8a/25/d28a2597-3213-89c2-cd10-035a45f2efeb/4251804115933_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"13091f","textColor2":"170c2b","textColor3":"423a4c","textColor4":"463d55"},"artistName":"Black Fan","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tiger-fisted-ep/1571481998","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"Tiger Fisted - EP","recordLabel":"Quintessentials","upc":"4251804115933","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Quintessentials","playParams":{"id":"1571481998","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569656690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569656690?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/5d/7e/ac/5d7eac5b-956a-2896-b5b6-c0878e7d6c47/0502485601210.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"6f61ff","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"584dcb"},"artistName":"DS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/indetured-servitude-ep/1569656690","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"Indetured Servitude - EP","recordLabel":"Avoidant Records","upc":"0502485601210","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Avoidant Records","playParams":{"id":"1569656690","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569382021","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569382021?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"height":2000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a6/5b/ba/a65bba12-4c49-d94d-9aca-31908af5d69e/5053760077114.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"250d0d","textColor1":"fe666b","textColor2":"ea5052","textColor3":"d35458","textColor4":"c24344"},"artistName":"Justin Cudmore & Risa Taniguchi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/out-run-not-yet-feat-brooks-mosher-ep/1569382021","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-02","name":"Out Run / Not Yet (feat.
