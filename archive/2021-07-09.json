The Dubliners had established themselves as one of Ireland’s most exciting new bands on the back of their live performances, and they were midway through a support tour with Blossoms that had shown them to be perfectly at home in arenas. Suddenly, though, the four-piece were confined to their parents’ houses, wondering what gigs would look like in a post-pandemic world. With little else to do, they started writing songs, firing ideas to each other across digital channels. The music that emerged added new depth to their melodic indie rock; some tracks brooded and reflected, others itched with frustration, and all of them revealed a broadened worldview. “When we got into the band after school, [it was] to not grow up,” singer/guitarist Eli Hewson tells Apple Music about a decision that unsettled his parents, who wanted him to go to college. They came around, he says, when they realized how good Inhaler was—an opinion worth noting given that his dad is Bono. “And we didn’t have to grow up for two years because we were on the road,” he says. “The lyrics were inspired by teenage things like the girl you liked or a party you were at. When lockdown happened, we all matured as people. We had to. We told ourselves, ‘If we’re ever going to talk about our surroundings and the world, now is the time.’” A debut album that was originally scheduled to be a collection of previously released singles and live favorites, recorded in snatches between gigs, became a much richer, more considered piece, assimilating dream pop, funk, and psychedelia into their world. “Part of the fun about being in Inhaler is that we'll never find our sound,” says Hewson. “Lockdown did give us that extra space to push it further.” Let Hewson, drummer Ryan McMahon, guitarist Josh Jenkinson, and bassist Rob Keating guide you through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>“It Won’t Always Be Like This”</b>\nRyan McMahon: “That was the first song we wrote together. What’s been interesting is how the title is being interpreted by different people. We can see in comment sections that there’s people going, ‘Yes! It won't always be like this. They’re dead right.’ And then other people are like, ‘It won’t always be like this? Yeah, it could get a lot worse, lads.’ It's doing what songs should do—have a different meaning for a different person, depending on whatever point they’re at in their life.”\nEli Hewson: “I still have on the old computer, on GarageBand, a little of that riff in there from 2016. I remember playing it in the room together for the first time and the drums being a hook. That was like, ‘Oh man, that’s catchy.’ The first time we wrote something catchy.”<br />\n<b>“My Honest Face”</b>\nEH: “It fits into the theme of getting lost and finding yourself again, because it was all about finding out what you wanted to say onstage and what kind of people we wanted to be as performers, and that first experience getting up there and that kind of shock. So it’s an important part of the story of the album.”<br />\n<b>“Slide Out the Window”</b>\nRM: “That was one of the first lockdown tracks to really happen. Sonically and rhythmically, it’s quite left-field from anything that anyone will have heard from us before. I remember hearing that beat in the song that someone had done on Logic: I thought, ‘Oh no, this is going to be a nightmare. I have to go away and learn this now.’”\nEH: “It was written in the spring, and it reminds me of being in my bed, staring out the window over lockdown, just daydreaming and wishing that we were somewhere else.”<br />\n<b>“Cheer Up Baby”</b>\nEH: “We were in the studio, kind of wondering, ‘Fuck, “Cheer Up Baby,” are we going to be able to say that? Are people going to be annoyed at us for saying it in a time like this?’ But it just made sense. Our fans are in love with that song. We’re in love with it. And every time we play it, they sing at the top of their lungs. So it really was a big moment for not just us but our fans, I think, to get their hands on that one.”<br />\n<b>“A Night on the Floor”</b>\nEH: “That’s one that we’ve been playing for a long time. We came into the studio one day and Ant [Genn, producer] was messing around with what we had done, and he’d done the intro part with all that kind of crazy psychedelic stuff. We were like, ‘Oh my god, there it is. That’s the identity of that song.’ [Lyrically it comes from ] the news. Looking at our phones over lockdown and just horror after horror. And most of it is inspired by stuff we’d seen over in America. We had such a really, really special time going over there, and we all fell in love with it again when we went on tour with Blossoms. And it’s just sad to see America in that kind of state, because it symbolizes so much to us. It feels like, I guess, the States is having a bad hangover or something. It needs to get off its arse and have a coffee or something.”<br />\n<b>“My King Will Be Kind”</b>\nEH: “It’s kind of playing a character. I’d watched a documentary on incels. There’s so many people in our generation that are so easily taken into extreme groups or fads. A lot of people don’t really have any room for the other side of an argument. And that’s what the song is trying to touch on. It was originally more of an Interpol-y-type thing. But it really did take shape in studio with the acoustic guitar.”<br />\n<b>“When It Breaks”</b>\nJosh Jenkinson: “It came from being stuck in the room I spent my whole childhood in, and having gigs stripped away, and just longing to play that type of music and make that type of music.” \nRM: “It was in contrast to that midtempo feeling that we’d been experiencing with ‘Slide Out the Window’ and ‘My King Will Be Kind.’ Those were songs reflecting our moods about being at home. ‘When It Breaks’ is us very much itching to get back to that place that we were at. It was written at a time where coronavirus was at its peak, Black Lives Matter was happening. Everything was a little bit up in arms and crazy. And so this was [Eli’s] observation on it.”\nEH: “It’s asking if there was an end to this whole crazy scenario that we’re in, what’s going to be on the other side, and are we going to change anything?”<br />\n<b>“Who’s Your Money On? (Plastic House)”</b>\nEH: “It’s about the future of the band and how much we want it. Maybe our relationships had taken a bit of a strain because we’d been in the studio for so long and there was a lot of pressure and a lot of work, and we weren’t really hanging out—it felt more like we were there to do a job. This is us talking to each other, being like, ‘This is a gamble that we’re going to take. Gigs may never come back again. We may not be a band. But we’ve got everything to lose and everything to play for.’”<br />\n<b>“Totally”</b>\nEH: “It feels like a big pop song, but it’s a different type of pop song than we had written before. It’s funny because we weren’t playing live, but it feels like it would be such a great festival tune. I guess we were imagining what that could look like—where are we going to be playing it, what moment in the show is it going to be? For us, this is the hold-your-mates-at-the-end-of-the-gig one, going ‘Waaaaaayyy!’”<br />\n<b>“Strange Time to Be Alive”</b>\nRob Keating: “It used to be a full song and it turned into an interlude. It has only got the one lyric, a little message to have towards the end of the album. And we thought it worked really well with the ending song as well. We jammed it together in the studio.”\nRM: “It was Ant who spotted it. It was the chorus of this demo that Rob was writing. He was like, ‘We need to get that on the album. That’s going to resonate with so many people.’”<br />\n<b>“In My Sleep”</b>\nEH: “When we did it, it felt like such a big Thin Lizzy moment, almost. We were like, ‘Oh god, it reminds me of being at home,’ that kind of music you listen to as a kid. And we put some uilleann pipes in there, which are an Irish instrument, and it really felt like us. It embodied that feeling of coming home after a tour. It just felt really natural to put at the end. It’s a send-off.”","short":"“Lockdown gave us that extra space to push our sound further.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574045492","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574045492?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d6/d3/fe/d6d3fe53-7f4e-6bc2-7014-748ef3d83f7e/21UMGIM58943.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"504647","textColor1":"ecddce","textColor2":"ebd3b9","textColor3":"cdbeb3","textColor4":"ccb6a2"},"artistName":"Claire Rosinkranz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/6-of-a-billion-ep/1574045492","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"6 Of A Billion - EP","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602438516124","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Purple Monkey Recordz LLC, under exclusive license to Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1574045492","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The singer-songwriter's latest EP is a relatable, poppy experience."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1571821960","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571821960?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/8f/79/38/8f793876-4bce-b939-bf64-726fb6b28d30/886449365159.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"cbd1c5","textColor1":"0b0d0d","textColor2":"41241c","textColor3":"313432","textColor4":"5d463e"},"artistName":"Mariah the Scientist","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ry-ry-world/1571821960","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"RY RY WORLD","recordLabel":"One Umbrella/RCA Records","upc":"886449365159","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 RCA Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1571821960","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Mariah the Scientist's music traffics in a beatific, futuristic sound that envelops the ear. On <i>RY RY WORLD</i>, it feels a little like floating despite subject matter that is more often concerned with the ways in which love can make us feel so heavy. “I can be what you need, maybe more, everything,” she sings on single “Aura.” “Maybe you'll come to your senses, I'll use up my minutes to tell you how I believe you are a rainbow.” Her lyrics are vulnerable and unafraid to deal with the humiliation of unrequited feelings or the lust for revenge when it all goes bad, but her vocals and sonic palette keep her sound enchantingly atmospheric.<br />\nSongs like “RIP” and “All for Me” accentuate the unique tonality of her voice, a delicate yet full-bodied quality as intriguing as it is pretty. Elsewhere, her experimental streak is revealed in the production choices on tracks like the off-kilter intro “Impalas & Air Force 1s” and the stuttering loop of “2 You.” Mariah the Scientist may be just getting started—this marks only her second album—but her vision of R&B is already reimagining the genre's possibilities.","short":"The Atlanta singer’s music feels a little like floating."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1575244959","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575244959?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a3/d5/bb/a3d5bbc4-cd69-34a5-1f28-94907bd69370/21UMGIM58198.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"e7e6eb","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor4":"464647"},"artistName":"Greentea Peng","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-greentea-peng/1575244959","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Apple Music Home Session: Greentea Peng","recordLabel":"EMI","upc":"00602435557618","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An AMF Records / EMI release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1575244959","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For her Apple Music Home Session, Greentea Peng had a straightforward time picking out records. “These are two of my favorite songs in the world,” she tells Apple Music. “I love a raw and uncut version of any tune, but I guess these are especially gritty and spontaneous, in a way.” Greentea's Session features an exclusive cut of “Make Noise”—the spirited opener to her acclaimed debut LP <i>MAN MADE</i>—backed by her live band The Seng Seng Family.

If I’m feeling happy, then I’m out with my friends and actually living life—so I gravitate towards songwriting when I need it.” But while the Toronto singer/producer’s first full-length effort, <i>ALPHA</i>, reverberates with all the heartache and intense introspection that made her earlier EPs (2016’s <i>CDW</i> and 2018’s <i>Stone Woman</i>) so compelling, she’s using the album format to provide a more “all-encompassing” portrait of herself. That means not only expanding her style of nocturnal, slow-motion R&B to absorb cinematic soul grooves, group gospel sing-alongs, pitch-shifted harmonies, indie-disco jams, and even Neil Young nods, but also opening herself up lyrically in ways she never has before. As a songwriter, Wilson admits she “always comes back to love—it’s corny, but I do think love and relationships really are the meaning of life.” However, unlike her previous forays into the topic, the songs on <i>ALPHA</i> are clearly written through a queer lens, providing the sort of intimate snapshots of relationships between women that still feel all too rare even in a diversified 2020s pop landscape. “I got more comfortable in my ability to just really spell out who I’m singing about,” Wilson says. “I didn’t really feel like I needed to be mysterious anymore. Not that I’m trying to do anything revolutionary by being a woman singing about women—that’s a narrative that should be normalized. I just want to make the music that I want to hear.” Wilson explains how she did it with this track-by-track guide.<br />\n<b>“Strangers”</b>\n“I feel like the first few lyrics on this song set up the record in a way that felt just intriguing. There’s a lot of unrequited love and longing on this record, and I wanted to start with a feeling of almost desperation. Everything on this song is me—I just pitched down my voice for the harmonies.”<br />\n<b>“I Can Only Whisper” (feat. BADBADNOTGOOD)</b>\n“I actually wrote this song partly in my sleep. I woke up and just had that line in my head—‘I can only whisper’—and then I wrote all of the lyrics in my head lying in bed. And then I came up with the melodies, and my brain was also pretty much composing the chords around all the melodies. It all just kind of made sense in this really insane way. I recorded the song a few different times with a few different approaches, and I wasn’t really liking how it was feeling. I knew I wanted it to feel like an old soul song, so eventually, I was just like, ‘OK, BADBAD just needs to play the drums and the bassline and get that kind of groove that they’re so good at.’ So, basically, the drums and bass are BADBAD and then all the other sounds are just me building around that.\"<br />\n<b>“If I Could”</b>\n“[Toronto R&B singer] Merna Bishouty wrote the lyrics to this song. We met through a mutual friend and had a fun night out, and then we were like, ‘Oh, we should go to the studio together.’ And I don’t really tend to do that very often with other people’s music—I’ve never sung someone else’s song. But we really connected on a lot of different levels. She’s a queer woman, we were both going through similar things in our relationships at the time, and she played me a version of this song, and I was just completely blown away. Growing up, I didn’t have any gay people in my surroundings. My parents are super supportive and proud, and they have a Pride flag on their porch, but it was never like, ‘Oh, you could be gay and that would be OK!’ That was never a conversation we had. I didn’t have anyone to look to in that way. So, I was deeply closeted for my whole life, until I left for university. I think I had an idea of what Merna’s meaning was for the song, but for me, when I sing it, I very much feel like I’m singing it to a younger version of myself.”<br />\n<b>“Lovesick Utopia”</b>\n“Before I started putting music out as Charlotte Day Wilson, I was writing a lot of folk music, and that was the main thing I was comfortable doing. And I think the reason why I haven’t done it quite as much is just because I had already done it in my own private life, and I wanted to grow and evolve. But when I sing these more folky acoustic songs, that feels like the most true version of how I started playing music and how I started writing songs. So, in some sense, I guess this song is a departure for me—or for the perception of how I write—but for me, it’s quite familiar. I was at my cottage with the person I was seeing at the time, and she was listening to Neil Young’s ‘Harvest Moon’ a lot. And then, I had a morning where I was just alone in the woods, and I wrote this song on acoustic guitar.”<br />\n<b>“Mountains”</b>\n“I wrote this with a group of people in LA: Brandon Banks, Kyla Moscovich, Teo Halm, Daniel Caesar, Babyface, Mk.Gee—there’s so many people on this song, I don’t even know if I would be able to remember them all. The interesting thing about songwriting is that, sometimes, even after you’ve written a song, you don’t really know where it was coming from, or what it was about. With this one, a few of us wrote that chorus together, and then I went in and wrote the verse by myself. At the time, I don’t think I was fully conscious of the fact that the relationship I was in was not working for me. But I think, subconsciously, I knew. And that’s what ended up coming out in the music—the honesty that you can’t quite speak out loud to yourself.”<br />\n<b>“Danny’s Interlude”</b>\n“Danny [Caesar] wrote this and sent it to me, and I just thought it was a beautiful ending to ‘Mountains.’ It takes us out of that song in a nice way and leads us to ‘Changes.’”<br />\n<b>“Changes”</b>\n“I’m hesitant to talk about it sometimes, because it’s so personal, but this is about the journey of going from being an aspiring singer who works as a janitor at a church to someone that has a public career off of their art. That’s been an intense change for me. There’s always going to be ups and downs, and pros and cons to that kind of life adjustment.”<br />\n<b>“Take Care of You” (feat. Syd)</b>\n“I wrote this at my cottage and, when I came back to Toronto, I played what I had for Merna, who cowrote ‘If I Could.’ I was like, ‘I want to write a no-nuance, lesbian R&B love song!’ We jokingly wrote the verses of this song—it was all supposed to be about converting religious imagery and making it gay. And I never thought I would put it out. But then I showed it to my managers and they were like, ‘No, this is actually really good!’ And I was like, ‘OK, well, maybe I should get another singer to feature on it.’ In my head, I always thought Syd would be the perfect one. And then I was with a friend in LA who works with her, and he sent it to her. She loved it and recorded her verse that same day and sent it back. Everything about this song was quite easy and fun. You can feel that in the record.”<br />\n<b>“Keep Moving”</b>\n“I was driving back from the cottage—everything on this record is about the cottage, for some reason!—with my partner at the time. It was right after Pride, and she thought it would be a cool music-video idea to film the Dykes on Bikes. Every Pride parade begins with these iconic, older lesbians on their bikes. And my partner was like, ‘Imagine documenting the Dykes on Bikes in a really cinematic and beautiful way. I don’t feel like anyone’s really done that.’ And I loved that idea. I was like, ‘That would be amazing...but I just don’t know what song I would do that to.’ So, then I wrote ‘Keep Moving’ with that video concept in mind.”<br />\n<b>“Wish It Was Easy”</b>\n“I was working with this amazing producer in LA named Dylan Wiggins. We were at Raphael Saadiq’s studio, and there was a really beautiful sounding piano there. Dylan was playing around on some chords and wrote this really nice progression. And I was really, really going through stuff in my relationship, so everything just flowed out of me in 10 minutes. It was one of those songs that was very stream-of-consciousness.”<br />\n<b>“Adam Complex”</b>\n“This song is probably the most vulnerable song I’ve ever written. It’s cryptic because my brain is also cryptic and kind of nonsensical sometimes, so that’s probably reflected a little bit in the stream-of-consciousness approach of this song. It’s about a feeling of inferiority and a deep fear of being left by a woman, or a man.”","short":"“It’s corny, but I do think love and relationships really are the meaning of life.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574578122","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574578122?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/05/e7/a9/05e7a98f-793a-cae9-4038-df72631087e8/886449170586.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"9c886d","textColor1":"070605","textColor2":"0c0c0d","textColor3":"25201a","textColor4":"292520"},"artistName":"Zach Williams","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rescue-story-deluxe-edition/1574578122","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"trackCount":31,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Rescue Story (Deluxe Edition)","recordLabel":"Essential Records","upc":"886449170586","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Provident Label Group LLC, a unit of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1574578122","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1565923183","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565923183?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/e5/f6/b6/e5f6b633-5657-6f11-19bc-0aa6ac3d02a7/889030021458.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"aaada6","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"0c190f","textColor3":"222221","textColor4":"2b362d"},"artistName":"Koreless","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/agor/1565923183","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Agor","recordLabel":"Young","upc":"889030021458","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Young","playParams":{"id":"1565923183","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I can only work by being really open,” Welsh electronic producer Lewis Roberts, aka Koreless, tells Apple Music. “If I don’t start a piece of music by being inquisitive and playful, I lose interest very quickly.” This inherent curiosity forms the basis of his shape-shifting releases. Coming to prominence with his post-dubstep-influenced debut EP, 2011’s <i>4D</i>, and then working with labelmate Sampha before releasing its synth-heavy follow-up, <i>Yugen</i>, in 2013, Koreless has spent the past six years without any solo releases. Instead, he collaborated with Sharon Eyal’s groundbreaking dance company L-E-V for 2019’s Bold Tendencies festival, produced for FKA twigs’ acclaimed album <i>MAGDALENE</i>, and endlessly refined his long-awaited debut album—the aptly titled <i>Agor</i>, which means “open” in Welsh. Throughout its rigorously edited 10 tracks, Koreless toys with notions of tension and release, building expectations through crescendos of intensity before thwarting the cathartic payout with an immediate cut to blissful spaciousness. “You can accelerate a rhythm so much that it stops being heard as rhythm and, instead, becomes a single tone,” he explains. “That’s what I’m doing with these arrangements—pushing you to a threshold point until you burst through the chaos into an entirely new feeling and experience.” Here, he dives deeper into each of <i>Agor</i>’s tracks.<br />\n<b>“Yonder”</b>\n“‘Yonder’ is a prelude to the record, like the lights coming up for a moment before we begin. It feels like an empty stage where nothing is really happening yet; it’s just providing a general feel. It was important to start like this, because the rest of the record can be quite melody-heavy, so I wanted something to welcome the listener in first.”<br />\n<b>“Black Rainbow”</b>\n“I wanted ‘Black Rainbow’ to be a digital folk song. It builds in intensity as I’m squeezing every drop out of it. But then we reach a threshold that we break through, and it just becomes very blissful. The song is like taking off and accelerating into total bliss rather than into chaos. That’s one of the aims behind the record—to enable these ruptures and then to accelerate into a peaceful state.”<br />\n<b>“Primes”</b>\n“This track is my homage to someone like Oren Ambarchi, since it’s just made of sine waves, which are the perfect, irreducible sound. You can’t get any simpler than a sine wave; it’s what you’re left with when you strip everything else away. I really like working with sines because they’re very general and there’s something comforting about their generality. I used to work a lot more with them, and this is probably their only place on the record. It plays like shards of sine wave dust.”<br />\n<b>“White Picket Fence”</b>\n“I like using vocals almost like instruments and capturing the material quality of them, rather than having an artist feature. I like an anonymous, slightly inhuman vocal, which is why these vocals are just played through a keyboard. There’s a comforting safety to a vocal that sounds like it’s been grown in a lab, and on this track, I’m trying to separate them from any personality as much as possible and just keep them as these angelic, general voices.”<br />\n<b>“Act(S)”</b>\n“This was the same tune as ‘White Picket Fence,’ but I decided to chop it halfway. It felt like ‘White Picket Fence’ needed to finish there and that this ending had a certain sculptural difference to it. I love when albums have extra sections tagged on at the end of a song. They aren’t interludes but rather a moment to breathe.”<br />\n<b>“Joy Squad”</b>\n“I like when you’re in a club and you hear a song that is a bit of a roller-coaster and that can take you on a wild and unexpected ride without ruining everyone’s night. I was trying to find a version of that with ‘Joy Squad.’ I think of it as being a giant in terms of visualizing the sonic scale, because it’s quite an empty soundworld, so everything fills up much bigger in that space—it doesn’t just feel like microtones.”<br />\n<b>“Frozen”</b>\n“I was exploring how you can use a vocal to get it to sound like percussion. Both this and ‘Joy Squad’ are using vocals in that way to make very short, percussive sounds. This is about finding that moment of beauty before failure—like having blind faith just before everything falls apart—and that was the structure of the song. I wanted to create a digital, sugary sweetness and I was getting there through very heavy-handed vocal processing.”<br />\n<b>“Shellshock”</b>\n“The themes of ‘Shellshock’ are similar to ‘Frozen’ in trying to tread this line between something super-sweet and sincere and then some kind of creeping fear underneath. All of this builds to create that same sense of rupture and disassembly we find in ‘Black Rainbow.’”<br />\n<b>“Hance”</b>\n“This one’s a little machine—it feels like a Heath Robinson device, a bionic music box. This is a short track, but it might have been one of the ones that took the longest to make. With a lot of these shorter ideas, I didn’t want to make them into full songs—they are enough however long they are. It’s a nice palate cleanser before we end.”<br />\n<b>“Strangers”</b>\n“This was the last track to be written for the record. It felt like a lot of the previous songs had been really labored over and almost strangled tight, whereas ‘Strangers’ came together really quickly. It feels less constrained and like there’s more life to it because of that. It was fun to make and it works really well to tie everything together as the final tune. It is a joyful ending.”","short":"“I can only work by being really open.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574124144","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574124144?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/4a/b8/c4/4ab8c442-78f7-1b2e-58f1-e58d2e80cd1d/21UMGIM55554.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"5bbdfc","textColor1":"0c0e0d","textColor2":"0d2d10","textColor3":"1b313c","textColor4":"1d4a3f"},"artistName":"JEON SOYEON","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/windy-ep/1574124144","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-05","name":"Windy - EP","recordLabel":"Universal Music LLC","upc":"00602438498116","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 CUBE ENTERTAINMENT INC.","playParams":{"id":"1574124144","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1563303812","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1563303812?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5c/94/80/5c9480ee-28e0-03df-99a0-59df5b2074db/886449045549.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"19171c","textColor1":"efefef","textColor2":"d7d7d7","textColor3":"c4c4c5","textColor4":"b1b0b1"},"artistName":"Mayhem","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/atavistic-black-disorder-kommando-ep/1563303812","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Atavistic Black Disorder / Kommando - EP","recordLabel":"Century Media","upc":"886449045549","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Century Media Records Ltd. under exclusive license from Mayhem","playParams":{"id":"1563303812","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"With this pandemic-induced follow-up to their 2019 album, <i>Daemon</i>, Norwegian black-metal progenitors Mayhem return with a collection of originals and punk covers tracked during the same recording sessions. “We finished the <i>Daemon</i> album way faster than expected, so we had some extra studio time,” Hungarian-born vocalist Attila Csihar tells Apple Music. “The guys had a few drinks and decided to record these punk covers. They didn’t even tell me. But at least they picked songs from bands that I also love.” Titled with the vinyl release in mind, the <i>Atavistic Black Disorder</i> side is comprised of three originals, while the <i>Kommando</i> side features covers of punk favorites by Discharge, Dead Kennedys, Rudimentary Peni, and the Ramones. “This record is like a Frankenstein album,” Csihar says. “It was not supposed to be—it’s like a COVID escape to give to people. But it’s cool because it shows our roots, and I think people might be surprised that we have this punk and hardcore connection.” Below, he comments on each track.<br />\n<b>“Voces Ab Alta”</b>\n“This is a song that was supposed to be part of the album, but we felt it didn’t quite fit the framework. Otherwise, it’s a great song. It’s not easy to make these decisions—we just don’t want to release an 80-minute record. But the only thing I can tell you about this song is that it’s poetry. It doesn’t have a concrete meaning apart from the voices in your head, which is the Latin translation. The lyrics were mostly written by [guitarist] Teloch. It has a cool groove, a bit of an old-school black metal touch.”<br /> \n<b>“Black Glass Communion”</b>\n“This is a song written by [guitarist] Ghul, and it’s a little bit different. It’s more aggressive and brutal. This is another one that could have been on the album, and it was a difficult choice to not include it.”<br /> \n<b>“Everlasting Dying Flame”</b>\n“This is another great song that Teloch composed. There’s a little bit of an acoustic part at the end, a little bit of these psychedelic things. I just like the groove and atmosphere.”<br />\n<b>“In Defense of Our Future” (Discharge cover)</b>\n“My favorite song from Discharge would probably be ‘The Nightmare Continues’ from <i>Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing</i>, but this is a f**king cool song and it was fun to sing. Discharge meant a lot to me in the early days. When my first band, Tormentor, toured in the ’80s, the punk scene was still there and we had this crossover in Hungary, even though extreme metal was kind of on the periphery. Even the drummer of Tormentor, who joined in ’87, came from the hardcore punk scene.”<br /> \n<b>“Hellnation” (Dead Kennedys cover)</b>\n“This is a cool f**king track. Maniac did the vocals and did a really good job. Also, it shows that he is a punk. You can hear it in the way he sings. I couldn’t do any better. My first punk record was a Dead Kennedys album, and I was super into it. I met Jello [Biafra] when he came to the first show in San Francisco that I played with Mayhem, and we immediately became friends. I was super amazed that he showed up, but we had some drinks and we keep in touch. I actually just mentioned to him that we did this cover, and he was happy to hear about it.”<br /> \n<b>“Only Death” (Rudimentary Peni cover)</b>\n“This is a band that not many might know. I don’t know how big they are or how big they became, actually. I was surprised the guys picked this one, but it’s pretty cool because I used to love this band. I was super into the album <i>Death Church</i> when it came out. We had less access to music in Hungary, so I was very happy to hear this record. I didn’t have the vinyl, but my friend did. I listened to it for hours. The artwork is amazing and the music is so crazy and dark. It sounded very black metal to me.”<br /> \n<b>“Commando” (Ramones cover)</b>\n“This is from the Ramones, of course. We used to play it sometimes live, just for fun. But this time, it’s really cool that Messiah, the first vocalist of Mayhem, sings it. And he’s doing a f**king cool job. I love the way sings it—very punk. It shows that even when we didn’t know each other, we all loved punk. We all came from the same thing.”","short":"“This record is like a Frankenstein album.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1567974613","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567974613?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"height":2000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/2d/45/d7/2d45d72d-0e1c-3623-e04f-e1e13f1c03b2/5037300935133.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f2dccf","textColor1":"0d2b27","textColor2":"14302c","textColor3":"3b4e49","textColor4":"40524d"},"artistName":"Megan Wyler","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/upside-now/1567974613","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Upside Now","recordLabel":"Nowever Records","upc":"5037300935133","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Nowever Records","playParams":{"id":"1567974613","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1544444948","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1544444948?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/78/3d/88/783d8817-b1ca-3aaa-48bb-66f2f83d6690/20UMGIM93111.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"11100e","textColor1":"fffff4","textColor2":"feed00","textColor3":"cfcfc5","textColor4":"cfc102"},"artistName":"Krystian Zimerman, London Symphony Orchestra & Sir Simon Rattle","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-complete-piano-concertos/1544444948","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Beethoven: Complete Piano Concertos","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948399789","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1544444948","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When the great Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman first recorded all five of Beethoven’s piano concertos in Vienna in 1989, the sessions were beset by technical problems. “They put carpets on the walls of the Musikverein, totally destroying the acoustic,” Zimerman tells Apple Music. After that, tragedy struck. Leonard Bernstein, who had been conducting the Vienna Philharmonic for the recordings, passed away halfway through the project. Rather than cancel, Zimerman conducted the <i>First</i> and <i>Second</i> concertos himself from the keyboard. Fast-forward a little more than 30 years to Beethoven’s 250th anniversary, and a chance arose for Zimerman to rerecord the concertos. “I spoke to [London Symphony Orchestra music director] Simon Rattle and told him that I absolutely had to do them again,” recalls the pianist. “He immediately said yes and suggested we record them with the LSO. He’s a wonderful man and a great friend of mine, and he basically agrees to any idea I have!”<br />\nThen, the pandemic struck. Quarantine measures forced Zimerman to spend weeks sleeping in a campervan in November 2020 (“I felt like a scout!”)—it was the only way he could be near his own piano while staying within social distancing rules. During the recording sessions, the players of the London Symphony Orchestra had to be spread out across the entire area of LSO St Luke’s. That presented enormous challenges (“It made it difficult for the instrumental sections to sound homogenic, to sound together in a color sense”), yet it was also, says Zimerman, a “really great experience.” “It was like chamber music on a great scale,” he says. “Everybody was sharing the music.” Just how that music might have sounded at the beginning of the 19th century is at the forefront of Zimerman’s mind on the album. To get close to it, he brought four bespoke keyboards to the recording, each able to be slotted into the body of the Steinway grand at LSO St Luke’s, and each one ideally suited to its concerto’s unique technical challenges and the subtleties of sound that Zimerman believes Beethoven intended. Read on as the pianist takes us on a personal tour of Beethoven’s five masterpieces.<br /> \n<b>Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, Op. 15/Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-Flat Major, Op.19</b>\n“I don’t make a distinction between <i>No. 1</i> and <i>2</i>. For me, they’re very similar in style. Beethoven was a young man when he wrote them, and nothing has changed for the problems of young people today. They were still rebelling against their parents, and you can hear that in the music. In the <i>Piano Concerto No. 2</i>, for example, there are a lot of goofy moments. There’s a place at the end of the final movement where I said to Simon Rattle, ‘I want to play it as goofy as possible. Please don’t be nice here. Just play it as stupid as you can!’ In fact, the final movements of both <i>No. 1</i> and <i>No. 2</i> sparkle with humor and jokes. <i>Piano Concerto No. 1</i> is a very long piece. It’s very serious, but it also has a lot of humor, and the slow movement is one of the most touching of any Romantic composer. Beethoven was clearly already a Romantic when he was composing this work.”<br />\n<b>Piano Concerto No. 3 in C Minor, Op. 37</b>\n“I remember at the start of the first movement of this concerto that I said to Simon Rattle, ‘I would like the music to be like a piece of rock, but not a beautifully polished rock. Perhaps like a piece of granite.’ Towards the end of the cadenza near the end of the movement, the music is so scary. The second movement could be played as a mass in a church. It’s one of the most personal statements I know from Beethoven—it’s almost religious. And the third movement is incredibly witty. I’ve used extremely fast tempos in some places.”<br />\n<b>Piano Concerto No. 4 in G Major, Op. 58</b>\n“This concerto contains a lot of revolutionary ideas, such as starting it with solo piano. Audiences expect an orchestral tutti, but of course that doesn’t happen. Instead, the piano starts to improvise. Where is the music headed? Why? What is Beethoven saying here? It’s a shock for the listener who hears it for the first time. Again, this movement has a fabulous cadenza, and its final notes are one of the most touching moments in the history of music for me. It’s so beautiful and so incredibly warm. It expresses Beethoven’s anxieties—a man who could never find a lover and who could never fulfill his inner needs. It’s a place to cry. The second movement of <i>Concerto No. 4</i> is a shock because it’s not a traditional slow movement but an intermezzo, a discussion between two people, like Christ talking to Pilate. It’s like the music is in conflict. The final movement is a return to joy with the orchestra again competing with the piano. There’s a lot of wit and humor here.”<br />\n<b>Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-Flat Major, Op. 73 “Emperor”</b>\n“The ‘Emperor’ concerto is a completely different story. It’s so much more modern than the last four. It’s a symphony with a piano, where the piano is also the orchestra. Recording this concerto with Simon Rattle was an incredible experience. The second movement is a hit—it’s one of the greatest pieces written by anybody in the 19th century. And the final movement is joyful, but this time it’s a noble sort of joy, the joy of a noble man making polite jokes in an amiable way.”","short":"In his only interview about the album, Zimerman salutes five masterpieces."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1572687093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572687093?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1920,"height":1920,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/eb/1f/6b/eb1f6b2d-956f-9fa5-09fc-66924da106f5/10Year_DJMixTemplate_Square_Conro.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"1a3232","textColor1":"f4f8f7","textColor2":"57cba1","textColor3":"c8d0d0","textColor4":"4aac8a"},"artistName":"Conro","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/monstercat-10-year-instinct-1-dj-mix/1572687093","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":31,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-05","name":"Monstercat 10 Year: Instinct #1 (DJ Mix)","recordLabel":"Monstercat","upc":"5056381812409","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1572687093","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1567252463","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567252463?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d8/cf/c5/d8cfc598-675d-c9c3-4fb1-186b0917ccae/21UMGIM40198.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f3980c","textColor1":"0b0d09","textColor2":"151b41","textColor3":"392809","textColor4":"413436"},"artistName":"Isata Kanneh-Mason","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/summertime/1567252463","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Modern Era","Piano"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Summertime","recordLabel":"Decca Music Group Ltd.","upc":"00028948518692","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Decca Classics Release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1567252463","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For her second album, pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason turns to American music for inspiration.

It’s a work of staggering variety and its playful, sinister opening movement, doleful second, and almost Shostakovich-esque finale earn it a rightful place in the pantheon of piano masterpieces. The versatile Kanneh-Mason is a masterful guide, as she is when showcasing other, lesser-known works by Amy Beach (a shamefully neglected giant of American music), Aaron Copland, and 19th-century English composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, whose arrangements of three spirituals provide an emotional coda.","short":"The versatile pianist turns to American music on a masterful second album.

For most string quartets, that would be a surprising move. But for this adventurous, US-based ensemble, it’s a logical next step. In eight albums released since 2013, the Attaccas have explored music as wide-ranging as Haydn, John Adams, Weinberg, and contemporary composer Caroline Shaw (their performance on the 2019 album of Shaw’s music, <i>Orange</i>, cemented their reputation as cutting-edge players). “We’re just stretching expectations further to include more of the diverse interests we have,” violist Nathan Schram tells Apple Music. “With electronic music, we felt like we could be our truest instrumental selves.” <i>Real Life</i> succeeds because of the group’s evident love of electronic pop, which lies at its heart, with each member of the quartet putting forward their favorite tracks. “I felt like a kid in a candy store listening to Thundercat and Flying Lotus and so many other great artists,” reveals second violinist Domenic Salerni. Alongside those names, the album’s tracklist features pieces by US producer and multi-instrumentalist Louis Cole (“Real Life”), Canadian electronic group The Halluci Nation (“Electric Pow Wow Drum”), and cellist/composer Anne Müller (“Drifting Circles”), in addition to original music written for the Attaccas by US record producer Daedelus and British electronic musician and producer/DJ Squarepusher.<br />\nEach member of the Attaccas had a hand in arranging that music for quartet. They worked, too, alongside American composer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Michael League, whom Attacca cellist Andrew Yee refers to as an “equal partner.” “There was a lot of playing around in the studio,” they add. “There was an amazing feeling of creating a musical playground. It was so much fun.” All of which led to a supremely tight, thrilling, and often gritty homage to great modern music, which is a testament to the endless versatility of this string quartet. Read on as Yee, Schram, and Salerni walk us through the kaleidoscopic sounds of <i>Real Life</i>.<br />\n<b>“Electric Pow Wow Drum”</b>\nAndrew Yee: “During the pandemic in 2020, I would hang out with a group of friends on the sidewalk outside of their house, where we would sit on camping chairs. I told them I was looking for electronic music to arrange, and one of my friends said, ‘You’ve got to listen to this’ and put on ‘Electric Pow Wow Drum’ by A Tribe Called Red, who are now called The Halluci Nation, a First Nation group based in Canada. The music was so unbelievably honest and exciting, and I went home that night and started playing around on the cello. As soon as I sent it to the group, everyone was like, ‘Yeah, this absolutely has to be on the album.’”<br />\n<b>“Real Life”</b>\nNathan Schram: “This one is a track by Louis Cole, an incredible drummer and pop persona. We all wanted to do a Louis Cole track, and Amy [Schroeder, Attacca Quartet’s first violin] took it upon herself to choose one. ‘Real Life’ is almost like a parody of a dance track, and Amy really dug into that. We all decided to go full disco and make it borderline cheesy, because that’s kind of how Louis is. He’ll take something that’s maybe a little corny and he’ll just lean into it. Amy did an incredible, masterful job of arranging this.”<br />\n<b>“Why?”</b>\nDomenic Salerni: “‘Why?’ is from an album by [South Korean folktronica musician] Mid-Air Thief called <i>Crumbling</i>, which Nathan discovered. It’s just unbelievable—totally genre-bending stuff. It starts with this crazy, aleatoric, dream-like beginning, and so we all sampled these little snippets. At one point, we were doing a version in Nathan’s own home studio, and he was like, ‘What if I just press <i>reverse</i>?’ And all of a sudden, just by putting that effect on it, it sounded like the original. Also, I remember listening to a Billie Eilish track and just hearing this incredibly close-up mic and that barely singing technique that she uses. We use that for all the vocal sections.”<br />\n<b>“Clock Catcher”</b>\nSchram: “The three Flying Lotus tunes [‘Clock Catcher,’ ‘Remind U,’ and ‘Pilgrim Side Eye’] were envisioned to go together in one consecutive suite, so that’s why they’re next to each other on the album. This one is the first song on Flying Lotus’ 2010 album, <i>Cosmogramma</i>. It’s just wild electricity from the beginning. And that’s always been what I’ve wanted to do with a quartet—how wild can we make the string quartet sound? When I found real music that was so wild outside of the string quartet genre, I was so excited to make it exist.”<br />\n<b>“Remind U”</b>\nSchram: “This was a really cool collaboration with [US producer and DJ] TOKiMONSTA. It wouldn’t have happened without Sony introducing us to her music and getting her in contact with us. But we were never in the studio with her, and we never met her in person. I think that’s how a lot of music is made these days, and it was really interesting to do it that way. ‘Remind U’ was supposed to be kind of a calm before the storm, but once TOKiMONSTA got hold of it, she turned it into something that had this kind of vintage vibe. She made it feel like these memories of childhood in the ’90s.”<br />\n<b>“Pilgrim Side Eye”</b>\nSchram: “Again, this is part of that Flying Lotus ‘suite.’ For us, Flying Lotus was one of the artists that I was most excited to get on this album. When I heard his music, it was so alive in every line and constantly shifting in detail and in content. It seems so perfect that I really see Flying Lotus as a proper composer. We wanted to show people that this music is just as legitimate as Beethoven in our eyes. ‘Pilgrim Side Eye’ leans more on the quirky side. The biggest thing in this piece is Andrew’s bassline, which is an instrument on the original track played by Herbie Hancock.”<br />\n<b>“Xetaka 1”</b>\nYee: “When we found out that Squarepusher was going to write us a piece, we couldn’t believe it. But the music was so unbelievably difficult that I didn’t know what I was going to do! It was like when you see a score by Charles Wuorinen or some out-there composer for the first time: You just can’t figure out where to even begin learning it! We had to start slow and build it up. But it was just one of the most exciting recording sessions that I can remember. This track exists in a zone that I think we’re more known for, closer to a John Adams sort of style. It’s a modern classical piece, for lack of a better way of describing it.”<br />\n<b>“Holding Breadth”</b>\nSalerni: “Daedelus sent Nathan an Ableton session—Ableton being a piece of software where you record music into your computer. So, we had this fairly complicated thing with four different soundworlds representing the instruments of the string quartet. And we were scratching our heads: What were we going to do with this? I then transcribed the file into Sibelius and wrote out string parts for everybody. It was an interesting vibe, but we weren’t really sure about it. We talked to Daedelus, and [they were] wonderfully creative and gave us a lot of trust.”<br />\n<b>“Drifting Circles”</b>\nSalerni: “It was Andrew who turned me on to Anne Müller. She wrote the original of this track, which is from her album <i>Heliopause</i>. She didn’t get our scratch tracks until two days before we entered the studio. And she, of all our collaborators, is closest to Flying Lotus, in that she has a clear idea of what she wants. When she heard it, she was like, ‘Oh, I really love what you guys did.

Otherwise, we would've kept repeating ourselves.” The Brisbane-based indie-pop trio of Riley, Louis Forster, and James Harrison—all singer-songwriters and multi-instrumentalists—went through many changes, both personal and musical, in the three years it took to complete the album. Forster temporarily relocated to Berlin, Germany, and started getting more into electronic music, while Riley and Harrison formed a post-punk band called Soot. Once they'd come up with a good amount of ideas, the band decided to live in a shared house, where they were able to practice together three times a week and give each other all their attention without ever having to leave that creative space.<br />\nThe final result is some of the band's most collaborative and explorative work yet, in which they combine their distinct musical personalities and distill a new crop of influences—whether it's noise, psychedelia, experimental rock, or mainstream pop—into their usually bright, whip-smart pop songs. “We got back into a lot of our earlier influences, but at the same time, we were trying to push our sound as far as we felt we could go,” Forster says. “It was a really slow writing process in which we scrapped a whole bunch of songs multiple times, but I felt like we were honing in on this conceptual world.” Here, Jones, Forster, and Harrison give insight into the songs they each contributed to the album.<br />\n<b>“In the Stone”</b>\nLouis Forster: “‘In the Stone’ was the last song I wrote on this record. That song is really about shifting perspectives. It's about losing your sense of self when you feel like you've been connecting to it so strongly. When you feel like you've had this really limitless idea of yourself, which is based around another person who's accepting you in any way. As tacky as it is to talk about, it was also about addiction. It was about using drugs to connect to an essence of yourself and feel closer to that, but then going too far and feeling so far away from yourself. And even using drugs to connect to sex, and then taking so many drugs that you couldn't have sex, and feeling really lost. It's about excess and avoidance—trying to avoid talking about things by just taking something that will make you happy.”<br />\n<b>“Psychic”</b>\nLF: “The whole of that song was really about whether there is an inherent truth, whether multiple truths can be valid, and whether truth can be a more flexible concept. I feel like it's going between these two realities all the time—a more normal reality and a psychic supernatural reality. Like when there's two people who have this connection, and it feels like you can't entirely choose to live in one because there's always forces from the other that prove themselves to be more real than you can pretend they're not. You can live in this psychic reality, but the real world—whether it's plans, aging, and time—still can catch up with you, and you can't escape those things.”<br />\n<b>“Tag”</b>\nRiley Jones: “I think my biggest influence for that song is probably Psychic TV and their song ‘Godstar,’ just for the atmosphere, as well as Jeffrey Lee Pierce from The Gun Club. But sonically, it doesn't actually sound very much like that at all. It's speak-sung and a bit country-ish, which I think comes from his influence. I wrote it on bass in about five minutes, but it took a lot of different forms before we got to the final version. It used to be a lot slower, and then we ended up just playing with the tempo until it felt right. The thing that took the longest was probably James’ guitar part. We had a lot of noise influences on this album, but James had never played noisy guitar before, so that's probably the thing that we did the most takes of in the end. It took a few months of the song evolving until it reached this point.”<br />\n<b>“Temples”</b>\nJames Harrison: “I'd actually played the ascending melody a couple of times while I was jamming over COVID, and the chord progression has an elating feel to it anytime I play it. I wrote it for someone.”<br />\n<b>“The Chance”</b>\nLF: “I wanted to write a song that starts off with one idea, to then try to incorporate something else that fundamentally contradicts it. I was really influenced by Tim Hardin and ’60s folk songs. And then I got really obsessed with this idea of putting a ’90s kind of Hole chorus, which was insanely fun to me. It's about the power of imagination and a psychic connection where you're no longer with someone, but you're dreaming about them and imagining them, and you know that some part of you is with them and some part of them is with you.”<br />\n<b>“Bathwater”</b>\nLF: “Riley and Jim really changed that song when we started to play it together. I'd written that song and it was really The Raincoats-inspired. It was the first song that I wrote for the record, the very first thing, and then I remember showing it to them when we got back to Brisbane. Riley started playing a disco beat under it, and Jim was playing this prancing guitar line. It reminded me of Kiss or something. I really liked it and it completely changed the meaning of the song. I think the verses are inspired by The Blue Nile. I got really, really obsessed with that band and the way they slowly hold tension and have this feeling of nighttime in their music.”<br />\n<b>“Desire”</b>\nRJ: “These are the two songs on the album where I play guitar, and so they're a lot noisier but poppy in terms of the structure. I wanted to be somewhere between an Elvis song and a Keiji Haino song, but then I was also very inspired by classic pop like Kylie Minogue. It's a strange cocktail of all of these things. It's definitely rooted in what we've done in the past, and I think the method hasn't changed so much. We still work together in the same way, but sonically, it is pretty different.”<br />\n<b>“Carpetry”</b>\nJH: “That song came the quickest to me. I wrote the chorus at a different point, and Riley brought in a specific drumbeat which felt like it tied the whole song together. I thought it was a really simple song for a while, but then it started clicking in the band, which was good. I think the lyrics are a bit weird—they’re meant to be metaphorical.”<br />\n<b>“Til Dawn”</b>\nLF: “As much as it's a cliché, it's like the Townes Van Zandt lyric about waiting around to die. I think it was about feeling very, very mortal. I was pretty depressed and I felt like I was just waiting to be obsolete, waiting till it was okay to die. But at the same time, just wishing that I hadn't. It was being angry at the world that I existed at all, because I felt like my time of obsolescence was still quite a way off. But then, I think it's about finding some kind of peace in that as well. I made that song sound more depressing than it was at first. It's about accepting that you have an amount of time here and having a strange relationship with being alive, which, maybe at one point, was and is now not at all that way. I think I've moved a long way from that. I've accepted my place in this world.”<br />\n<b>“Caterpillars”</b>\nJH: “The way I originally played it on guitar, it just went everywhere. I listened to a bunch of Nick Drake songs and tried to streamline it out a bit so that it was a bit more listenable and sounded more simple. It does have the piano, which I think gives it good groove, too. But I also really like the lyrics. That's probably some of my favorite lyrics that I wrote—it definitely has a whimsical feeling to it.”","short":"“We really needed to find ourselves in different ways.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1565972189","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565972189?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3616,"height":3616,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/1e/1f/70/1e1f706d-600f-a4cc-fd59-588b20eac252/3663729158208_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f6f4e8","textColor1":"5f1017","textColor2":"5a1a1c","textColor3":"7d3d41","textColor4":"794545"},"artistName":"Lack","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/make-it-circular-ep/1565972189","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Make It Circular EP","recordLabel":"Livity Sound Recordings","upc":"3663729158208","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Livity Sound Recordings","playParams":{"id":"1565972189","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569661495","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569661495?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3200,"height":3200,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/4d/81/d7/4d81d7ad-1b84-f18f-726d-a74cd9d3633a/827949088360.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"005a2b","textColor1":"f4ffff","textColor2":"b1e9a6","textColor3":"c3ddd4","textColor4":"8dcc8e"},"artistName":"Angel Blue, Lester Lynch, Chauncey Packer, Kevin Short, The Philadelphia Orchestra & Marin Alsop","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gershwin-porgy-bess-highlights-live/1569661495","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Opera"],"trackCount":22,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Gershwin: Porgy & Bess (Highlights) [Live]","recordLabel":"PENTATONE","upc":"827949088360","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 PENTATONE","playParams":{"id":"1569661495","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1573222938","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573222938?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c8/0b/02/c80b02a5-9807-b9d5-9a84-49663057f5bf/4250101427657_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"390905","textColor1":"fffffd","textColor2":"f14319","textColor3":"d7cdcb","textColor4":"cc3715"},"artistName":"Robert Dietz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/schnups-ep/1573222938","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Schnups - EP","recordLabel":"Live at Robert Johnson","upc":"4250101427657","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Live at Robert Johnson","playParams":{"id":"1573222938","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574179701","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574179701?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/a3/51/2c/a3512ccb-fdd6-ee4a-9326-4ac4296a73f5/886449346585.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"141821","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d5dbd6","textColor3":"cfd0d2","textColor4":"aeb4b2"},"artistName":"Daniel Harding, Vienna Philharmonic & Igor Levit","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sommernachtskonzert-2021-summer-night-concert-2021/1574179701","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral"],"trackCount":37,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Sommernachtskonzert 2021 / Summer Night Concert 2021","recordLabel":"Sony Classical","upc":"886449346585","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Wiener Philharmoniker, under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1574179701","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1560736292","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1560736292?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/30/d4/35/30d435d8-6073-84d4-d89d-aee5bd491c68/5056321637529.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f9485c","textColor1":"010200","textColor2":"240a0d","textColor3":"331012","textColor4":"4e171d"},"artistName":"Foodman","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yasuragi-land/1560736292","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-09","name":"Yasuragi Land","recordLabel":"Hyperdub","upc":"5056321637529","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Hyperdub","playParams":{"id":"1560736292","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
