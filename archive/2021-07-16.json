The second half—on songs like “Woo Baby” and “Mr. Jones”—spotlights the agile melodies he was beginning to employ; “8-Ball” introduces an especially bluesy version that summons even more possibilities. The first half, though, is where he shines with his signature style. It's especially there on songs like “30” and “Brush Em,” which feature fellow Brooklyn drill rappers Bizzy Banks and Rah Swish, and in other flashes, even as the sounds around him shift. <br />\nAs with <i>Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon</i>, <i>Faith</i> is heavy on features in order to fill out the song fragments he left behind. This one pairs him with the likes of Kanye West, Pusha T, Rick Ross, and Pharrell as well as would-be peers like 42 Dugg, 21 Savage, and Lil Tjay. It's rarely disappointing to hear Pop doing what he did best, but it's also impossible not to wonder how he would've approached these songs had he been here—still creating, still innovating, still evolving. Nevertheless, Pop Smoke's magic lives on, even if only in frustratingly fleeting moments.","short":"The Brooklyn rapper's second posthumous album is in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MlT9dGKoGH2hsfcz7UUXL"}},{"id":"1568819304","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1568819304?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b0/81/99/b081991e-22da-957d-226d-688dc35f7843/886449323081.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f4eddd","textColor1":"0a0602","textColor2":"1e373f","textColor3":"39342e","textColor4":"495c5e"},"artistName":"John Mayer","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sob-rock/1568819304","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Sob Rock","recordLabel":"Columbia","upc":"886449323081","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1568819304","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Once John Mayer mapped out the concept and the songs for <i>Sob Rock</i>, his first studio album since 2017’s <i>The Search for Everything</i>, he promised himself he was going to stick by it. “This is the record where I had 10 songs locked,” John Mayer tells Apple Music. “My record before suffered because the door was open to it the whole time—new songs would come in, old songs would go out. And so it became ‘This is my script, this is my movie.’ We're not going to write a different scene from a different movie.” For the veteran singer-songwriter, that meant immersing himself in the sound of the ’80s—aiming to synthesize a piece of work that feels true to the era while injecting his own flair.<br />\nMayer cozies up to mellow, easygoing blue-eyed soul that oozes with nostalgia at every turn—from his serious, Don Henley-like posture on the album cover to bringing in session musician par excellence Greg Phillinganes (known for his work with Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, and Toto) to play keys. As always, his songs serve up a meticulously tidy mix of smooth pop with bluesy accents—though this time around, he does so in a more subdued manner.<br />\nRomantic ballads like “Shouldn’t Matter but It Does” and “Why You No Love Me” ease in with snare drum taps and weeping guitars, as Mayer tries to mend his broken heart. He lets a little looser on “Last Train Home,” stamping in vintage sonic pleasantries like gated drums and slow synth swells as he wonders if his time to settle down in a long-term relationship is running out. It’s a thought that Mayer’s been circling back to more now that he’s in his forties, especially on “Why You No Love Me,” on which he reconsiders how to ask this no-win question. “I have spoken those words for a long time in relationships,” Mayer says. “Maybe it takes 43 years to ask that question, but you still ask it in the language of a child? I've never written more brutal lyrics in my life.”<br />\nEven if Mayer embraces these sounds with his usually slick, demure manner, he was keen on making sure that the album wasn’t too sentimental or overly dramatic. “This is the whole <i>Sob Rock</i> game—get sweet, but never sappy,” he says. “It’s demonstratively sweet and luscious, and melodic and colorful, but it's never to the point where it gets cloying and syrupy. I like to teeter on that line.”","short":"“This is the whole Sob Rock game—get sweet, but never sappy.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JmfwvRDitJlTUoLCkp61z"}},{"id":"1572859144","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572859144?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5f/12/8f/5f128f6c-3354-b004-c7b4-80763ee92abe/190296673603.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"050000","textColor1":"ffbf9f","textColor2":"f4965b","textColor3":"cc987f","textColor4":"c47849"},"artistName":"ILLENIUM","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fallen-embers/1572859144","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Fallen Embers","recordLabel":"12Tone Music","upc":"190296673603","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 12Tone Music, LLC under exclusive license from Illenium LLC","playParams":{"id":"1572859144","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"It’s easy to understand why ILLENIUM, aka Denver’s Nicholas Miller, gets told his music helps fans through hard times.

Maybe I’ll find out there’s no <i>sound</i>.”<br />\nKSI has given his fans/subscribers an access-all-areas pass to that journey. One of the UK’s foremost YouTubers and online personalities, he released his solo debut album <i>Dissimulation</i> in 2020, serving intimate, personal tracks alongside heavy-hitting anthems and larger features from standout names—and creating space for his digital and personal personas to coexist. “With this one, I'm starting to realize that I’m a really big deal,” he says. “I used to think that I had to be super serious to be a rapper. But, you know what? I can just be myself. And that's okay, because I started out doing just that. And I haven't looked back since.”<br />\nIn that spirit, <i>All Over the Place</i> is true to its title. We get a carousel of alt-pop (“Patience”), R&B balladry (“You”), and a surprisingly slick garage anthem that recruits childhood hero Craig David (“Really Love”), nestled up against potent rap, with appearances from Lil Durk, Bugzy Malone, 21 Savage, and JAY1. There’s a similarly impressive band of production talent on board (S-X, Digital Farm Animals, Ayo Beatz, M1 On The Beat, Toddla T), but the Londoner insists the album executes his very individual vision. “I don't need other people, I just do things by myself,” he says. “I’ve always been a bit of a loner when it comes to working. Especially on my own albums. So during the whole pandemic and lockdown situation, I was there like, 'OK—this is my realm now.'” Here he breaks down his second album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“The Moment”</b>\n“After <i>Dissimulation</i>, I was just focused on improving. My verses, writing, singing, I wanted to step it all up. The track speaks for itself—I’m taking the moment, this is my year, and no one can stop me.”<br />\n<b>“Number 2” (feat. Future & 21 Savage)</b>\n“Another track where I’m gloating. I’m taking on the people that doubted me. So many were shitting on me, saying I’d never amount to anything, and now these guys look like clowns in a circus. I'm at a point that I'm loving life, and that feeling is amplified with getting Future and 21 Savage on this album. I'm in a completely different space now.”<br />\n<b>“Patience” (feat. YUNGBLUD & Polo G)</b>\n“I met YUNGBLUD at the NME Awards [February 2020] after his performance that night, and I instantly loved his energy. But I wanted to have him hone it in on this track, and sing a bit more, because he can, <i>really well</i>. But right now, it’s a bit too fast to push my audience into super screamo stuff—you want to ease people into such things.”<br />\n<b>“You”</b>\n“Not for the first time, here’s a track about my girlfriend. Or maybe it’s about me being a bit <i>too</i> obsessive? There are parts of the chorus that remind me of the character from [2018 TV drama] <i>You</i>, Joe Goldberg. I feel like this would be his anthem, or backing track.”<br />\n<b>“Don’t Play” (feat. Anne-Marie & Digital Farm Animals)</b>\n“It's funny now that I listen to the original [version] of this song, how it sounded—before Anne-Marie got on the track. I already had my two verses, but she was like, ‘Yo, I love this so much, I want my own.’ And she blew it out of the water and literally made it a hit. She’s amazing.”<br />\n<b>“Really Love” (feat. Craig David & Digital Farm Animals)</b>\n“This is my first time trying a garage beat. Well, [2020 single] ‘Lighter,’ perhaps, but that was a dance track to me. This is a <i>whole</i> lot more garage. First of all, I wasn’t too sure people would know who Craig David was, especially my [young] audience. Most people do—12-year-olds probably won't. I was really interested in the response, and it was insane. He's such a nice guy, so it's cool we were able to help get him yet another top 10 in his decorated musical career.”<br />\n<b>“Gang Gang” (feat. JAY1 & Deno)</b>\n“This track was one of the very first I made for the album. I wanted it as a single immediately, till more and more bangers kept coming.”<br />\n<b>“Rent Free” (feat. GRACEY)</b>\n“This is one of the first times I've been in the studio to make a song from scratch. I’m usually picking through beats, so here, I definitely wasn't super comfortable at first, but I just went along with it. Either way, GRACEY is so talented and started killing, doing the melodies all over the track. And Toddla T on production—super talented as well. It's crazy how I’m with all these talented people, just awkwardly sitting there.”<br />\n<b>“Madness”</b>\n\"It’s a drill track—and it's pretty much me just talking my shit, like, really, really talking my shit. About how everything I do gets people talking. If I tweet, they talk about the tweets; if I do <i>anything</i>, people are going to make memes. Most of the time, I'm on my humble shit, but this track, I really let it go, like ‘Fuck that!’”<br />\n<b>“Silly” (feat. Bugzy Malone)</b>\n“This is an epic track. Again, it's a new flow from me, a new style, but it’s really all about how silly I actually am. I'm just not a super serious guy. And Bugzy absolutely killed it with the numeric flow, too.”<br />\n<b>“Flash It” (feat. Rico Love)</b>\n“I move into the Afrobeats section of the album here. Firstly, I learned Rico Love is so good at writing, it’s fucking ridiculous. He absolutely did his thing, and he’s so quick. And then I put some of my own sauce on it.”<br />\n<b>“No Time” (feat. Lil Durk)</b>\n“I know a lot of people, when they hear my vocal on this, will say, ‘What the fuck is this?’ I kinda borrowed it from [Atlanta rapper] 645AR—he’s a meme artist, but he does this crazy high-pitched thing that I thought would be cool to use, but obviously not go overboard with it.”<br />\n<b>“No Pressure”</b>\n“A funny story: My first verse on this track was actually meant for Wes Nelson’s 'Nice to Meet Ya.' Because [British rapper and producer] Ayo Beatz had been working with Wes a lot, around the time we were working also. That’s all I can say really, it just didn't work out. It was about timelines, and a little bit of politics.”<br />\n<b>Holiday</b>\n“Yet another song inspired by my girlfriend. Whenever we’re together, it feels like I’m on holiday. She helps me relax, calms me down, and makes my life easy—especially when things are getting stressful.”<br />\n<b>“Sleeping With the Enemy” (feat. S-X)</b>\n“This song is more conceptual than the others. I’m looking back at my career and realizing: ‘This is all really weird. It’s like I'm living in a simulation, or a video game.’ Because with everything that I've accomplished, it just seems a bit too...I don't want to say too easy, because I've definitely worked hard for it. But still, sometimes I feel like, ‘Why me?’”","short":"“I’m starting to realize that I'm a really big deal.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3WgAFg6y9jmNYLdC4xzHBF"}},{"id":"1571215405","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571215405?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/77/62/4a/77624a46-f824-57bd-2cfa-f2808761724e/21UMGIM42676.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"363437","textColor1":"eae1de","textColor2":"cee4ea","textColor3":"c6bfbc","textColor4":"b0c0c6"},"artistName":"Clairo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sling/1571215405","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Sling","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602438346325","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Clairo Records, LLC, under exclusive license to FADER Label / Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1571215405","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The origins of Clairo (born Claire Cottrill) hold their own modern mythos: 2017’s lo-fi bedroom pop track “Pretty Girl” went viral, and a major-label record deal with Fader/Republic followed. Then came her debut LP, <i>Immunity</i>, and its sardonic indie pop punctuated by jazzy instrumentation, soft-rock harmonies, and diaristic revelations. On her sophomore album, <i>Sling</i>, produced by Jack Antonoff in a remote and rural part of upstate New York, Clairo has mined deeper into her well of self-possessed folk. The outdoors seems to have grounded her; even moments of ornate orchestration are stripped down to their emotional core, like in the fluttery horns and xylophone of “Wade,” the herd of violins on “Just for Today” and “Management,” or their psychic opposite—the heartbreaking piano ballad intro on “Harbor,” and the campfire stopper “Reaper.” Standout first single “Blouse” features backing vocals from Lorde, and borrows a familiarly devastating chord progression (think Big Star’s “Thirteen”).

Her sound has evolved from bubblegum pop hits to alt-R&B to, now, a full pop-punk album. However, her transition into the genre shouldn’t be surprising, since rock runs in her blood: Her first introduction to the medium was from being on the road with her mother Jada Pinkett Smith’s nu-metal band Wicked Wisdom in the early 2000s. Then the multi-hyphenate talent experimented with rock-adjacent sounds on tracks like “Human Leech” from her 2017 album <i>The 1st</i>, and more prominently on her 2020 album <i>THE ANXIETY</i>. All of these moments set the groundwork for the singer’s fifth studio album.<br />\nCreated and recorded during quarantine, <i>lately I feel EVERYTHING</i> is an homage to the touchstones of 2000s pop-punk, such as blink-182, Avril Lavigne, and Fefe Dobson. The opening track “t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l” is an upbeat, energetic, angst-ridden anthem with a mix of clean and distorted guitars backed by booming drums courtesy of blink-182’s drummer Travis Barker, who assists on two other tracks on the album.

The loosely conceptual EP conjures images of a desert resort flanked by palm trees and tall drinks, a setting that suits the trio’s left-of-center take on traditionally informed, playfully contemporary Texas country music. It also has an edge to it, as the band explains the EP was partially inspired by the jarring changes wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our last headlining gig was in front of 80,000-plus people at the Houston Rodeo, and you kind of go from that, from feeling like you're on top of the world, like everything's rolling your way,” Wystrach says. “It did feel like you'd kind of arrived at a place that's at the end of the road, and it's not necessarily glamorous and it's not glitzy, but it's also not horrible.”","short":"The Texas trio offers up a loose, left-of-center conceptual EP."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1572775752","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572775752?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5f/c6/4e/5fc64e77-c2b4-605e-2435-38d9775da98e/192641760358_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"201f1d","textColor1":"efe8d9","textColor2":"f68237","textColor3":"c5c0b3","textColor4":"cb6e32"},"artistName":"Tainy & Yandel","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dynasty/1572775752","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"DYNASTY","recordLabel":"Neon16","upc":"192641760358","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 NEON16/Y Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1572775752","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58YsVjb7H6iov9MmLuvome"}},{"id":"1575522825","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575522825?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d7/74/84/d77484bf-8d17-21c4-51a5-d13ed27d9a6f/21UMGIM59675.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"e7e6eb","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"212121","textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor4":"484849"},"artistName":"Inhaler","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-inhaler/1575522825","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Apple Music Home Session: Inhaler","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438555826","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records Release; ℗ 2021 Inhaler, under exclusive licence to Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1575522825","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For Inhaler, recording this Apple Music Home Session was a chance to experiment, to reinvent an old favorite while also exploring something completely different. They achieved the latter by producing a cover of Billie Eilish’s “Your Power.” “We wanted to do something that felt really modern and contemporary,” says singer/guitarist Eli Hewson. “I don't think any of us had been listening to that song on our own, but when we played it in the room, we realized that it is actually a really, really good song. And we were just able to dress it in our own kind of Inhaler style.” It helped that Eilish’s original gave them quite a malleable starting point. “We thought, ‘Let’s make life easy for us, let’s choose a song that’s just guitar and vocals,’” says drummer Ryan McMahon. “It’s like, no bass, no drums, no keys, so let’s take that. Let’s see what we can do with this.” The indie-rock quartet has also injected new life into “It Won’t Always Be Like This,” a 2019 single that had already been given a 2021 glow-up as the title track to their debut album. Like that rerecording, this exclusive Home Session version draws on the brash energy of the band’s live performances. “It was down to us playing [the song] live for years and years and seeing how people were responding,” says McMahon. “It was slightly more distorted. It was a bit louder. It was a bit more sure of itself as well. And we just fell in love with that.”","short":"“We wanted to do something that felt really modern and contemporary.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1572887780","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572887780?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/99/bb/29/99bb29ee-f157-f671-e511-d3a34f91aa18/093624880936.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"321a0d","textColor1":"ecb374","textColor2":"e2986a","textColor3":"c7945f","textColor4":"be7f57"},"artistName":"Charlie Worsham","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sugarcane-ep/1572887780","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Sugarcane -

Featuring plucked guitars and gentle vocals, it’s a soft, swaying new version, but it retains all of the original’s summer energy. This session was, of course, recorded in Hill’s own home, somewhere she—like most of us—spent a lot of time between 2020 and 2021. “It taught me that I could create alone again,” the singer says of the experience. “I started off writing songs alone in my bedroom as a teenager, and since joining the music industry, I’ve only collaborated with other writers and producers. The pandemic reminded me I can still write great songs with no one else in the room.”","short":"“This time taught me that I could create alone again.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574261408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574261408?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/3a/16/4b/3a164bee-7d18-0bcd-8594-cbe2f85dd02d/843357196206_01_img001.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"932417","textColor1":"f5ee55","textColor2":"ffd881","textColor3":"e1c648","textColor4":"e9b46b"},"artistName":"Phabo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/soulquarius/1574261408","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Soulquarius","recordLabel":"Soulection/Over Everything","upc":"843357196206","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Soulection/Over Everything","playParams":{"id":"1574261408","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/762U5ToU14EyGscZC1iwzg"}},{"id":"1568333963","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1568333963?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d2/56/cd/d256cd16-1a58-314a-964c-585f17ba10c1/21UMGIM18495.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"385b89","textColor1":"dddaf8","textColor2":"d9daee","textColor3":"bcc1e2","textColor4":"b9c1da"},"artistName":"Alice Coltrane","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kirtan-turiya-sings/1568333963","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music","Indian","Devotional & Spiritual"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Kirtan: Turiya Sings","recordLabel":"Alice Coltrane","upc":"00602435939780","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An Impulse Records and UMe release; ℗ 2021 Jowcol Music, LLC, under exclusive license to Verve Label Group","playParams":{"id":"1568333963","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4tAK7NuAunKHYEiof5ikyG"}},{"id":"1560016946","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1560016946?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/cb/c4/18/cbc418f0-f4be-eee9-36b9-a8ba34a8796e/196006206680.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"010302","textColor1":"e8d9b8","textColor2":"cfc4a9","textColor3":"baae93","textColor4":"a69d88"},"artistName":"Chase Bryant","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/upbringing/1560016946","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative Country","Music","Country"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Upbringing","recordLabel":"Green Iris Records","upc":"196006206680","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Green Iris Records.

For Scottish-Italian violinist Nicola Benedetti, any musical celebration of the 18th century has to include Vivaldi, the great Italian composer who himself wrote more than 500 violin concertos. “You have to wade through a lot!” she tells Apple Music. “I really love Vivaldi and, in preparation, I listened to hundreds of his concertos.” <i>Baroque</i> showcases four of them, as well as a work by the lesser-known Francesco Geminiani, whose <i>Concerto Grosso</i> is an arrangement of a set of theme and variations by Corelli. “The Corelli is a favorite of so many young people learning to play,” says Benedetti. “But Geminiani’s version just takes you into all extremes that Corelli’s doesn’t. It’s really a lot more bold.”<br />\nBenedetti describes Baroque music as embodying an “expressive indulgence” at a time when artists, composers, and architects pushed their imaginations to their limits. Certainly in 18th-century Venice, Naples, and Rome, excitement, passion, and beauty were the building blocks of secular and church music. “The challenge with this music is to do enough and to have the boldness to do enough,” admits Benedetti, adding that Vivaldi—a man with Baroque coursing through his veins—gave her the courage she needed to be daring. Accompanying her in that process here is a crack team of the UK’s finest period instrumentalists, among them Kati Debretzeni and Matthew Truscott from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, plus celebrated continuo players, lutenist Elizabeth Kenny and harpsichordist Steven Devine, who all bring an energy and vitality to the textures. “Making music with them was edifying,” explains the violinist. “They all bring an entire history of all the various groups they’ve played with. I’m constantly watching exactly what my musicians are doing, looking at their eyes and seeing how they’re articulating things, and then I have to try and sit within that sound. You have to absorb so much.” From that process, you can expect a scintillating album housing a thrilling, visceral exchange of musical ideas. Read on as Benedetti guides us through it, one work at a time.<br /> \n<b>Concerto Grosso in D Minor, H. 143 “La Folia”</b>\n“This is a theme and variations on a historic and popular bassline chord progression. The sarabande-type theme that plays over the top of the ground bass has a very somber feel, and you can almost imagine a masked dance—it has that <i>misterioso</i> feel to it. There are a lot of variations—it’s long for this type of piece—and there are one or two of them that are much slower and that take you into another world altogether. Geminiani pushes the boundaries of how far away from a theme you can go without it officially not being a variation on that theme anymore!”<br />\n<b>Violin Concerto in D Major, RV 211</b>\n“There are a good number of D-major concertos written by Vivaldi. This key meant something to him, and he always uses it in a very bright way. At the start of this concerto, you can imagine the doors bursting open, like the beginning of a procession. I always imagine trumpets more than I imagine the violin! The work is in a typical form of three movements with an intimacy in the second movement and much more of a chase in the third. There are a lot of running semi-quavers and much lightness and virtuosity.”<br /> \n<b>Violin Concerto in E-Flat Major, RV 257</b>\n“From the beginning, the opening movement has this continuous engine played by the violas. The solo part is quite lyrical, but also very playful. Some of the phrases feature his usual sequences. But then, suddenly, the music bursts into something that’s extremely melodic. The second movement has this slow-paced kind of gallop feel. Its dotted rhythm is quite simple, but it’s one of my absolute favorite things to play. The last movement is in three, and we try to play it as rough as possible.”<br />\n<b>Violin Concerto in B Minor, RV 386</b>\n“I love the thematic material of the <i>B Minor Concerto</i>, but it’s the solos for me that really bring this movement to light. Vivaldi writes these flourishes, arpeggios, and sequences that have this continual, fast semi-quaver motion. But there’s one moment in the first movement, a minute from the end, where time seems to stop. And then, suddenly, we enter a world of a drum with the most dramatic, fierce music possible. It’s almost got a pop vibe to it. The second movement is like a written-out improvisation. I wouldn’t be surprised if Vivaldi simply played some random improvisation and wrote out roughly what he played! The last movement is like a semi-quaver chase where each bar races towards the next.”<br />\n<b>Violin Concerto in B-Flat Major, RV 583</b>\n“I drove myself crazy listening to [Italian violinist] Giuliano Carmignola’s recording of this movement. I don’t feel that I reached his level at all, but I did my very best. I love this movement with all my heart. It’s basically in a theme-and-variations form, but it’s like it’s from the soul of an angel. It’s just phenomenal.”\n","short":"“The challenge with this music is to have the boldness to do enough.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6zKygcgm39URPfXuwtaW6H"}},{"id":"1558309844","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1558309844?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/0c/33/f8/0c33f8fc-bf47-6f2c-f05d-01d945b661eb/634457054035.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"112316","textColor1":"febec7","textColor2":"4a9ae2","textColor3":"ce9fa4","textColor4":"3e82b9"},"artistName":"A Place to Bury Strangers","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hologram-ep/1558309844","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative","Punk"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-16","name":"Hologram -
