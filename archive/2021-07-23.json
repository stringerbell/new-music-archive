He landed on Gold-Diggers in East Hollywood, a three-in-one bar, hotel, and recording studio that allowed the Texas-bred singer to tap into his sound the way he hears it in his head, free from the expectations of others. “It definitely felt the most liberating to me,” he says of the process. “I was just able to be myself and let go of any inhibitions and create without any boundaries.” <br />\nThe songs born of those sessions—produced by Ricky Reed and Nate Mercereau—became <i>Gold-Diggers Sound</i> and some of Bridges’ most refined work. He rose to fame through his ’50s and ’60s soul stylings, but the R&B contained within this album situates its nostalgia in a more modern context, bridging ’80s and ’90s R&B with lush, jazz-inspired live instrumentation. His writing coupled with his voice has long been the centerpiece, but hearing both in this context is to experience them anew. “When you look at <i>Gold-Diggers Sound</i>, a lot of these songs were derived from improvisational jams,” Bridges says. “Back to the basics of musicians in a room and creating music from the ground up.” Here he walks through each song on the album.<br />\n<b>“Born Again”</b>\n“‘Born Again’ is a song that transpired out of the pandemic. Pretty much everything on <i>Gold-Diggers Sound</i> was born within the Gold-Diggers space, but this is one that happened after the fact. Basically, Ricky Reed was doing this livestream series where he would produce a song live. He sent me an instrumental, and he wanted me to write something to it and send it in the next day, so I was stressing out like crazy because I just couldn't think of what to write about. I woke up that morning and the song came to me. I wanted to make it parallel to the concept of spiritual newness within a gospel context or within the Bible, but I take that concept and just talk about how I felt during the pandemic and how the pandemic was very healing for me. I felt like this song was a great opener for the album, and it totally sets the mood.”<br />\n<b>“Motorbike”</b>\n“The instrumental of ‘Motorbike’ was already something that my friend Nate Mercereau was working on, and it resonated with me, and everyone else during the session just kind of slept on it. I went out to Puerto Rico for my 30th birthday, and I was able to spend that time with some of my best friends, and there was just so much camaraderie and love in that moment. I wanted to take that feeling of just living in the moment and escaping with someone you love, and so that's kind of what 'Motorbike' is.”<br />\n<b>“Steam”</b>\n“This is almost reminiscent of a Talking Heads kind of thing. 'Steam' is one of the first songs that we worked on for this album. It's like a vibe of being at the party and the party gets cut short, and you want to prolong the hang, and so the best thing to do is just bring it on back to the hotel for the after-party.”<br />\n<b>“Why Don’t You Touch Me”</b>\n“Shout-out to the undefeated, badass songwriter Kaydence. This was a tune that we worked on remotely during the pandemic and just felt like it was a cool angle to write about love diminishing in a relationship from a man's perspective. And just the crippling feeling of being physically close to someone but emotionally distant. It's an angle that you don't really hear often from a man's perspective, and so that's kind of the inspiration behind that.”<br />\n<b>“Magnolias”</b>\n“I immediately was pigeonholed after my first album, and the more I continue to create, I want to be honest about the music that inspires me. I love the juxtaposition of that beautiful acoustic guitar with the more trap, modern R&B thing. My mother always used to encourage me to write a song about this magnolia tree that was in her backyard. And so I kind of took that and shaped the lyrics around it. In my head, as far as the chorus, it felt like this is how Sade would sing it in terms of that melody. That probably doesn't make sense, but it made sense in my head at the time.”<br />\n<b>“Gold-Diggers (Junior’s Fanfare)”</b>\n“Shout-out to Ricky Reed for curating some really awesome horn players. I mean, you got Josh Johnson and Keyon Harrold, and with the inception of this album, I wanted to do a progressive sound but also keep it rooted with some organic elements. And so I felt it was important to have jazz interwoven throughout all of this album. It's a really awesome interlude, and it's something that you don't really hear a lot within the R&B space.”<br />\n<b>“Details”</b>\n“‘Details’ is about learning to appreciate the small things. It's the little details that paint the big picture.”<br />\n<b>“Sho Nuff”</b>\n“For ‘Sho Nuff,’ I wanted to take a page out of Houston culture. I love when you look at artists like UGK—I love the fact that those guys incorporated soul music within their songs. And so that guitar part is definitely reminiscent of that. I wanted to have this very minimalistic, soulful guitar and juxtapose that with a sexy vibe.”<br />\n<b>“Sweeter”</b>\n“Throughout my career, I've always been scrutinized for not making political music, and I've kind of sat with that for a long time. I just didn't want to half-ass it. So this is a moment where Terrace Martin jumped off a session with these crazy chords. And for me, the chords or whatever's happening in the music always dictates what the song is about. As soon as he started playing that, I knew immediately this was the moment for 'Sweeter.' We wrote this prior to the situation of George Floyd, but it's reflective of the perpetual narrative of Black men dying at the hands of police. We had been sitting on this song for a while, and I was planning to release a tune with my friend Lucky Daye and we kind of put that on the back burner. But after George Floyd, I was totally compelled to just put this out in the world in hopes it would serve as the beacon of light and hope.”<br />\n<b>“Don’t Worry”</b>\n“‘Don't Worry’ is kind of a stream of thoughts to myself, reminiscing about a past lover and who she's currently with. Shout-out to my friend Ink, who is the singer-songwriter from Atlanta, and she embodies this country-hood type of vibe. Her energy is so infectious. I mean, she literally walks into the studio every day with cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and then just like brings this really awesome energy to the music—that's kind of how 'Don't Worry' came about.”<br />\n<b>“Blue Mesas”</b>\n“This whole album encapsulates the multifaceted aspects of life. It's not serious all the time, but sometimes there are those moments that capture the struggle, and that's what it was for me. 'Blue Mesas' just talks about the moment when I transitioned into fame, and it was honestly hard for me. When you take an insecure person and put them in the limelight, some people can tend to fold or thrive. I'm grateful that I had great people around me to help me get through those struggles. 'Blue Mesas' is just like that feeling of the solitude and weight that comes with having a little notoriety and still feeling isolated—even in the midst of people that love you.”","short":"The singer-songwriter’s new album has arrived, along with a short film."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1576455253","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576455253?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/fa/da/84/fada8423-d64d-19ac-8f52-eda390ec1538/21UMGIM64791.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"eaeaea","textColor2":"d1d1d1","textColor3":"bbbbbb","textColor4":"a7a7a7"},"artistName":"EST Gee","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bigger-than-life-or-death/1576455253","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-21","name":"Bigger Than Life Or Death","recordLabel":"CMG/Warlike/Interscope Records","upc":"00602438446612","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"CMG/Warlike/Interscope Records; ℗ 2021 CMG/Interscope Records","playParams":{"id":"1576455253","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1567637891","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567637891?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/29/5f/8f/295f8ff5-9d34-fe38-8611-10b979fbcf45/190296697425.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f9c6c5","textColor1":"0d0000","textColor2":"2d0f06","textColor3":"3c2727","textColor4":"55342c"},"artistName":"Anne-Marie","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/therapy/1567637891","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-23","name":"Therapy","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records/Asylum","upc":"190296697425","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Major Toms / Asylum Records release, ℗ 2021 Warner Music UK Limited.","playParams":{"id":"1567637891","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For Anne-Marie, the UK’s first lockdown in 2020 was an eye-opening experience. “For so much of my life, I depended on other people to make me happy,” the Essex singer-songwriter born Anne-Marie Nicholson tells Apple Music. “When I was in 2020 with no one around me, I was like, ‘I don’t quite know how to be happy now.’” And so, forced to confront feelings she’d long suppressed amid hectic schedules and life on the road, she began therapy—and unlocked the inspiration for the follow-up to <i>Speak Your Truth</i>, the huge 2018 debut that took her from in-demand featured artist to one of Britain’s biggest pop talents. “I wrote this album over months of having therapy sessions and writing songs after therapy sessions,” says Anne-Marie. “It’s been an experience, for sure.”<br />\nYou’ll find much of what she felt along the way across the 12 tracks here, all but two of them informed by that time. Amid uplifting, empowered pop and the singer’s trademark conversations-between-friends lyricism, there’s radical self-acceptance (“Who I Am”), battles with insecurities (“Beautiful”), and heartache (breakup anthems “x2” and “Our Song”). Therapy, too, helped Anne-Marie overcome trust issues, particularly when it comes to collaborators—and you’ll find a cream-of-the-crop roster here, including Ed Sheeran, Max Martin, Rudimental, Little Mix, and KSI. But this album is no straight-line story of a pop star overcoming tough times: For every lyric of self-love, there’s another of self-doubt. “It’s an up-and-down journey,” admits the singer. “I still have bad days. I didn’t want people to think you just have therapy and everything is sweet as a nut. I just want people to find solace in this album. I want it to be there for them.” Read on as Anne-Marie guides us through <i>Therapy</i>, one song at a time.<br />\n<b>“x2”</b>\n“This is a revenge song. When we were in the studio, I wanted to write about doing someone worse off than what they did to you, which is literally what I grew up being like. I was googling people's stories about what they've done to their exes—it was so fun just seeing the crazy shit people had done. Looking back, I think it shows that this is who I used to be and I’m working to make myself better. So I knew it needed to go first.”<br />\n<b>”Don’t Play” [with KSI and Digital Farm Animals]</b>\n“In 2020, KSI asked me to listen to some of his music to see if I liked it. This track was so garage, which made me think of my teenage years. I went to the studio and they only wanted me to sing the chorus, but I just wrote a whole verse—I think they were a bit shocked! It was nice to put my own little touch on it. And it was such a great collaboration to be a part of, because KSI is a brilliant human being.”<br />\n<b>“Kiss My (Uh Oh)” [with Little Mix]</b>\n“Little Mix and I have been wanting to collaborate for so long. When this song came up, I sent it to Leigh-Anne [Pinnock]. Little Mix made it a hundred times better. It felt good to collaborate with girls, because for some reason, I tend to collaborate with boys. For me, this is song is about realizing that someone isn't treating you right and plucking up the courage to walk away. It samples Lumidee’s ‘Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh),’ which is the complete opposite meaning. But I just love that song. It was popping off in Essex when I was younger.”<br />\n<b>“Who I Am”</b>\n“I wrote this one in LA in 2019. I was feeling really confident, something I’ve struggled in my past to feel. I went to the studio and said to everyone, ‘I just want to look in the mirror and tell myself that I’m brilliant. I don’t care what people say anymore.’ It’s a good release to sing that in a song.”<br />\n<b>“Our Song” [with Niall Horan]</b>\n“I did a radio show interview and they were like, ‘Who do you want to collaborate with?’ I said Niall Horan. He messaged me after and said, ‘Do you want to get in the studio?’ The day we wrote this, I was listening to the radio in the car, and I just thought, ‘Imagine if you had that one song with your ex and then you split up and now you have to hear that song, and you hate it.’ Niall picked up his guitar, and literally the first thing he played is what you hear on the track. It was just a fun day.”<br />\n<b>“Way Too Long” [with Nathan Dawe and MoStack]</b>\n“Nathan sent me this song and it was instant love. It wasn’t just because of what it said—even if it has been way too long since we’ve been free [due to the pandemic]—but also because of the vibe of this track. I thought MoStack’s lyrics were so clever. He completed this collaboration.”<br />\n<b>“Breathing”</b>\n“This is a very different track. It’s the first-ever love song I’ve ever written, because I normally cringe when I’m trying to write a love song. My parents have been together since they were 14, and I always thought that would happen for me. But I’ve gone through so much heartbreak since then that I started not believing in love. This song is about coming to the realization that you can’t not believe in it. We tried many different vibes for it, from speeding it up to making it into a house song. But we ended up going back to its original form, only adding violins and strings. I think it's a nice break in the album where people can just take a breath.”<br />\n<b>“Unlovable” [with Rudimental]</b>\n“It felt <i>so</i> good teaming up with Rudimental again. When I wrote this song, it was very basic and very slow. Rudimental put their spin on it, with the trumpets and the beautiful piano parts. They always seem to know how to make a song feel very positive, even if it’s sad. The lyrics are the complete opposite to the track before it. But that is something I’ve always struggled with. I’ve always had love around me, but never believed it. It’s been a massive contradiction, so that’s why I put them together.”<br />\n<b>“Beautiful”</b>\n“When I wrote ‘Perfect to Me’ on the first album, I couldn’t believe how many felt the same way. It made me feel less alone. I always knew I needed to write another song like it on the next album. ‘Perfect to Me’ is about not feeling great but accepting it. At the end of this song, I asked all my friends and family to sing the chorus and the backing vocals in voice notes. My godson and his little sister sing the solo at the end.”<br />\n<b>“Tell Your Girlfriend”</b>\n“I wrote this in 2019 in LA. [US songwriter/producer] Blake [Slatkin] had the guitar riff, and I came up with the chorus melody. For some reason, ‘I’m going to tell your girlfriend’ just came out of my mouth. We ended up thinking about what that means. I hate cheaters and I want to find every one of them and tell the person they’re cheating on what they’re doing. I basically want to be a private detective on the side of music. Beware of me!”<br />\n<b>“Better Not Together”</b>\n“Another song that was written as a ballad. This was written as a very slow-tempo, very sad song. [British producer and songwriter] Tre Jean-Marie managed to make it very upbeat and positive. With the lyrics, I’ve seen my friends stay with people they’re not necessarily happy with. And sometimes people just need to accept that they're better not together. It’s a really direct lyric.”<br />\n<b>“Therapy”</b>\n“This is the only song I wrote after coming up with the title of this album. Therapy can come in so many forms, like writing a diary or growing vegetables or speaking to a friend. It’s doing what you love and figuring yourself out. In this song, I talk about love being the answer to happiness, or getting tattoos making me feel happier. But when we remove all of the outward distraction, we see that true happiness comes from ourselves—from our own brains. It’s so personal. I treated that studio session like a therapy session.”","short":"“I want people to find solace in this album.

Across the 11 tracks and four phone-call skits from its original release, seven extra tracks on the first deluxe version (<i>SAVAGE</i>), and seven more here, on <i>OVER YOU</i>, the Kamilaroi hip-hop artist details the messy breakdown of a destructive relationship and the emotional tug-o’-war he’s struggling with.<br />\nThe Gadigal-born rapper has risen rapidly since he first gained international attention in 2019—particularly since dropping the original <i>F*CK LOVE</i> mixtape in July 2020, and its deluxe version, <i>SAVAGE</i>, which featured guests including Marshmello, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and Machine Gun Kelly. His sound often takes musical cues from artists like the late Juice WRLD (who guested on “GO” and had helped LAROI find his feet at the beginning of his career) and Post Malone, but he’s also played with warm, ukulele reggae rhythms and emotive, guitar-led sounds. His emotionally open lyrics touch on heartbreak, loneliness, and, ultimately, being every bit as flawed as those around him. It’s a vibe that’s clearly hit a nerve and earned him some big-name fans: Miley Cyrus loved his track “WITHOUT YOU” so much, they performed it together on an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. After LAROI featured on Justin Bieber’s 2021 track “Unstable,” the iconic pop star returned the favor here, guesting on the mega-hit “Stay.”<br />\nSure, dropping the same mixtape three times with new tracks is less conventional than three separate releases, but it nevertheless adds to the narrative—not to mention the artist hype. The new tracks on the <i>OVER YOU</i> version show a LAROI apparently resolute in his decision to extinguish the relationship for good. “I told you I’m over waiting on you,” he sings on the new track “Over You.” “You don’t have a place in my heart no more/It’s time to go separate ways.” Still, it’s never easy to forget or move on—and he’s not afraid of showing it. “I feel better when I’m not sober,” he admits over forlorn R&B keys on “Not Sober,” featuring Polo G and Stunna Gambino. On the bouncy, Bieber-featuring “Stay,” the pair own up to their mistakes and beg their partners not to leave. “I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you/I need you to stay,” he sings. “I’ll be f**ked up if you can’t be right here.” And on “Still Chose You,” featuring Mustard, he reveals, “I know I said I wouldn’t, but I fell in love again.”","short":"Seven more tracks add depth to the young rapper’s romantic woes."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1575638552","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575638552?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ab/dd/b4/abddb45d-d5a7-3328-ebca-4ad8f5b09c16/194690563249_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"000003","textColor1":"d3d1d5","textColor2":"bfaec7","textColor3":"a9a7ab","textColor4":"998c9f"},"artistName":"Yung Bleu","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moon-boy/1575638552","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-23","name":"Moon Boy","recordLabel":"Vandross Music Group, Inc. / EMPIRE","upc":"194690563249","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Vandross Music Group, Inc. / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1575638552","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The story behind Yung Bleu’s ascent-hastening Drake collaboration “You’re Mines Still” is that friend and fellow Mobile, Alabama, native and Los Angeles Clippers center DeMarcus Cousins heard the original version of the song—which appears on Bleu’s 2020 EP <i>Love Scars: The 5 Stages of Emotions</i>—and thought Drake might sound good on it. A novel idea! But just a few short days later, Drake, an actual friend of Cousins, was in Bleu’s DMs asking him to send over the song (and to make room for an extra verse!). Sure, Yung Bleu had had a few hits under his belt before Drake, but big bro Boogie was clearly invested in Bleu’s success, and from the sound of <i>Moon Boy</i>, he’s far from the only one. <br />\nThe features across <i>Moon Boy</i> play out like a Bleu-curated version of Apple Music’s #OnRepeat playlist. Besides Drake, you have H.E.R., Moneybagg Yo, Kodak Black, Kehlani, Big Sean, Jeezy, Gunna, Chris Brown, 2 Chainz, Davido, John Legend, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. Which is not to say that Bleu’s own voice is particularly buried. He’s made a Grammy after-party of an album and stirs the pot not unlike the way fellow singer and MC Drake did on his own <i>More Life</i>. Within <i>Moon Boy</i> you get tinges of Bleu the poet (“Die Under the Moon”), the trap rapper (“Shoe Box”), the pain-music practitioner (“Dark Cloulds”), the Afrobeats-loving melody maker (“Unforgiving”), the barbecue-ready summer jam specialist (“Baddest”), and the drip god (“Water Works”), to name but a few zones. Across it all, he strikes a perfect balance between pugnacious MCing and the sultry R&B songmaking that led to him calling himself Bleu Vandross. Inviting all of your most famous friends to guest on your debut album is an interesting approach to making a name for yourself, but if nothing else, Yung Bleu is the newcomer well equipped to run with the big dogs.","short":"The Mobile, Alabama, MC offers many vibes and even more friends."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1570898734","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570898734?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"height":1425,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/15/1d/45/151d4566-a04c-477a-c078-384bc85b25b6/075679782311.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"291b1a","textColor1":"feffff","textColor2":"f14040","textColor3":"d3d1d1","textColor4":"c93838"},"artistName":"Bizzy Banks","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/same-energy/1570898734","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-23","name":"Same Energy","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records","upc":"075679782311","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1570898734","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1572527553","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572527553?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3600,"height":3600,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/01/66/28/01662820-3de0-562d-aba0-13925dba74ac/21UMGIM52224.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"404145","textColor1":"dfe79b","textColor2":"e7c587","textColor3":"bfc689","textColor4":"c6aa7a"},"artistName":"Brittany Howard","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jaime-reimagined/1572527553","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-23","name":"Jaime (Reimagined)","recordLabel":"ATO Records","upc":"00880882466954","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 ATO Records, LLC.

Lo and Usher, but with Chiiild, he’s making music purely for himself. And on their first full-length album, he and partner Pierre-Luc Rioux stretch the psychedelic-R&B sound of 2020’s <i>Synthetic Soul</i> EP to fill a wide canvas. <i>Hope for Sale</i> is a hallucinatory blur of disco, funk, and pop that owes as much to Pink Floyd as D’Angelo’s <i>Black Messiah</i>, its expansive vision colored with charming details like mouth-trumpet solos. “Musically, it’s about chasing a certain feeling that you had when growing up,” Ayal tells Apple Music. “I didn’t realize how much nostalgia was a part of my palette.” But while <i>Hope for Sale</i> may feel like an escapist antidote to pandemic panic, Ayal sees it very much as a time capsule of its era. “I wanted this record to reflect this moment,” he says. “If you listen to this record and remember this time, I feel like I’ve done my job. And when I listen to this record in 10 years, I’m going to remember this moment and it’s going to be a special experience for myself. And I hope it is for everyone else.” Here, Ayal presents his track-by-track guide to your future nostalgia.<br />\n<b>“Sleepwalking”</b>\n“This is about gaining agency over your existence. It’s my mission statement—like, ‘Hey, I don’t know if you realize it, but you should be alarmed, because you’re just sleepwalking through life. You’re just going through the motions and doing what society told you to do.’ So, ‘Sleepwalking’ is meant to represent the idea that you have no agency over your future.”<br />\n<b>“Hold on Till We Get There”</b>\n“This song would have never happened if it wasn’t for the pandemic. It’s definitely a song that speaks to what we were all going through and thinking, but my natural self just leans more optimistic. The difference between those that fail and those that succeed are those that don’t stop. And so, we just need to hold on till we get there.”<br />\n<b>“Weightless”</b>\n“‘Weightless’ can be interpreted in the literal sense—like, ‘You’re going through a hard time. Let me help take the weight off. Let’s connect, let’s have sex, whatever.’ You’re having a conversation with someone and you’re saying, ‘Hey, I realize that you’re going through something, so how about we just sit here and flow and daydream and think about nothing.’ The trumpet line is actually a mouth trumpet that I did. Those are the things that happen in those situations: You’re with a partner, and they’re going through a hard time, so you just do something silly.”<br />\n<b>“Awake” (feat. Mahalia)</b>\n“This originally started with the front half, and I was messing around with it, trying to find my footing. I had the chorus for a while and then linked up with Jay Warner in London, and we fleshed it out. I don’t just pull my heart out in a song and then just leave it—the editing process is such a big part. I really make a point of getting edited by ears that I trust. So, Jay helped make that chorus more potent. But I was seeking a woman’s perspective on this particular song. I happened to be on a call with Ari PenSmith, and I played him the song, and he was like, ‘I really think Mahalia would be a great collaborator for this.’ And this was, like, a week before the song is meant to be released.”<br />\n<b>“Eventually”</b>\n“This could have been on <i>Synthetic Soul</i>. We actually performed it when we were opening for Emotional Oranges, but it was just never fully completed. ‘Eventually’ speaks to that situation where you wake up in the morning, and for some reason you and your partner are just not connected, you’re on two different pages. My approach is to just do silly things throughout the day to find a moment to reconnect. So, the song is basically saying, ‘I know eventually you’ll fall for me, and you’ll want me back.’”<br />\n<b>“13 Months of Sunshine”</b>\n“I’m a big fan of instrumental music, and this is a modern take on the music I grew up listening to, culturally. It’s psychedelic, it’s in the pentatonic scale. I’m trying to bridge Ethiopian music and Pink Floyd all in one swoop. On <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>, one of my favorite songs is ‘Any Colour You Like,’ and it’s just this random instrumental that happens in the middle of the album. And I feel like it’s such a great palate cleanse. So, that was my inspiration for putting this in the middle of the album.”<br />\n<b>“Lotus”</b>\n“I was on a Zoom session with this guy named Monsune from Toronto. He had this beat that had this piano riff in it. And his version was a little more like Majid Jordan, it was a little more upbeat. But I was like, ‘Let me take a stab at this and send you something later.’ And that same night, I sent him a song that was just like one long sentence—it just wrote itself, like a poem. After that, I brought it to Pierre and we made it a more scenic experience and made the emotions even more potent.”<br />\n<b>“Gone” / “Gone Remix” (feat. Jensen McRae)</b>\n“‘Gone’ also wrote itself. If you read it, it’s also just one long sentence. It’s so simple. And the remix is technically part of the record, too—or part of the same era. I was having a pizza night at my place, and I was just scrolling through Instagram, and I saw Jensen singing [Tracy Chapman’s] ‘Fast Car,’ and I remember thinking, ‘Oh, my god—this girl’s voice is doing something to me.’ I immediately called my manager and I asked, ‘What do you think about getting her on the ‘Gone’ remix?’ And I think within the same night, he had made the introductions.”<br />\n<b>“Wasting Time”</b>\n“During the pandemic, we went up to Joshua Tree and I was listening to random vinyls. And, for some reason, <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> kept playing, and I just felt connected to that particular record. And in that moment, ‘Wasting Time’ happened. I really wanted this record to complement <i>Synthetic Soul</i>, because when we go on the road, I wanted to make sure that you get a really dynamic experience, instead of it being, like, all R&B. There isn’t one song that completely represents me. I’m represented by the sum of all the parts, and ‘Wasting Time’ is part of who I am.”<br />\n<b>“The Best Ain’t Happened Yet”</b>\n“This song is self-reflective—you’re talking to yourself and saying, ‘Hey, remember what you just went through, and remember all the lessons that you learned? I know that things get hard, but you know this, because you’re the same person that told other people, “Don’t worry about it—it’s going to be all right.”’ So, this is like the moment where you’re looking at yourself in the mirror and saying, ‘Yo, I know you’re going through some s**t, but just remember that the best ain’t happened yet.’”","short":"“It’s about chasing a certain feeling that you

Halen joined his dad and uncle’s legendary, eponymous rock band at age 15, he quickly proved himself as a bass prodigy in a band of virtuosos. While on tour with Van Halen in 2015, he began composing songs for what would become his solo debut, <i>Mammoth WVH</i>—an album on which he plays all the instruments and performs all the vocals. “It was a labor of love,” he tells Apple Music. “It was so much fun to creatively explore and have no bounds.” It’s no coincidence that Mammoth was the moniker Van Halen went by before they changed their name in the mid-’70s. Wolfgang chose it to maintain a musical connection to his dad, who passed away in 2020. “It’s impossible to ignore where I’m from, so I wanted to touch on the history while taking it in my own direction,” he says. “Plus, I’ve always loved the name. When my dad told me the story, I was like, ‘I want to call my own band that when I grow up.” Below, he discusses each track.<br />\n<b>Mr. Ed</b>\n“Contrary to the title, this lyrically has nothing to do with Dad. It was the demo title, because I harmonically tap the intro, and it just kind of stuck around. It’s a tongue-in-cheek, funny title for the song. So, even after the lyrics were done, I decided to keep it.”<br /> \n<b>Horribly Right</b>\n“This is a song I wrote in New York when we had a week off on the 2015 Van Halen tour. Rather than going home, I stayed in my hotel and made the demo that became this song. It was really fun to take a quick break from the tour and just lock myself in my room and write. The title comes from the punchline of a story that my producer was telling me—something like, ‘If we get there, things will have to go horribly right for us.’ I just thought it fit the vibe of the song.”<br />\n<b>Epiphany</b>\n“I view this as one of the core-sounding songs. It’s kind of like the center of what the band is really about. Just like ‘Mr. Ed,’ ‘Epiphany’ was the demo title because I was just cleaning my kitchen when the melody came to me. I ran upstairs, but instead of recording the idea on my phone, I went straight to Logic and made a demo. And the song came out pretty similar to that demo, so I kept the title.”<br /> \n<b>Don’t Back Down</b>\n“I like to think of this one as the fight song. It’s the song you throw on when you want your team to just beat the s**t out of the other team. It really has that galloping, Black Sabbath sort of vibe—you can hear it with the riff and the fuzz tone on the guitars. It’s a really fun, balls-to-the-wall rocker.”<br /> \n<b>Resolve</b>\n“This one is super different from the rest of the album—a little bit to the left of the main sound. The bass is grooving the whole time, and it rarely changes. It’s just locked in a groove with the drums. But it’s a softer, more melodic kind of groovy song—very vocal-heavy. It’s another one I wrote on the 2015 Van Halen tour, this time in the back of the bus.”<br /> \n<b>You’ll Be the One</b>\n“This is a shorter song with a dance drumbeat that I really love. I was kind of cheeky with the intro on this one—you don’t really know where the one is, and the drums come in on the up-beat. So, when it finally hits, you’re kind of playing catch-up, and you don’t really start to get it until the vocals come in. It kind of forces you to pay attention. The solo was done with a talk box that I’d never used before. I was so bad at it that I had to tape my nose because I kept breathing into the mic while I was doing it.”<br /> \n<b>Mammoth</b>\n“I love the self-titled debut with the self-titled song—that triple hit. I was definitely following Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden with this idea. I think Green Day did it, too. Like ‘Epiphany,’ I feel this is the core sound of the band, which is why the name of the song is also the name of the band and the album. It’s also at the center of the album. It’s a really personal song about anxiety and depression and finding your way out of it—or at least attempting to.”<br /> \n<b>Circles</b>\n“This is probably the most different song on the whole album. It’s a really fun one that came together during the recording process. It’s got a lot of layers, but it’s primarily rooted in kind of an acoustic rhythm, and I really enjoy how dark and gloomy the song is. I’m also a big fan of vocal harmonies, so it was fun to really go nuts on this one. I think every single line is harmonized throughout the verse, except for the little bridge.”<br /> \n<b>The Big Picture</b>\n“The demo title for this one was ‘Queens,’ because I’m a big Queens of the Stone Age fan and this very much has that fuzzy Queens vibe. It’s almost like Queens and Alice in Chains had a baby. I’m a big fan of bendy riffs, and this has a super-bendy one, but my favorite part is the bridge, with the layered harmonies.”<br /> \n<b>Think It Over</b>\n“This was my dad’s favorite song on the album. It’s really just a straight-up pop song that really echoes the bands I grew up on, like blink-182 and Jimmy Eat World. It has that pop sensibility, but it’s still very much within the Mammoth sound. My dad called my solo a ‘George Harrison solo,’ which was one of my favorite compliments he gave me. It’s not a flashy solo, but melodically it perfectly fits the song.”<br /> \n<b>You’re to Blame</b>\n“This has a very Rage Against the Machine or Audioslave kind of riff and a really fun solo. Most of the songs don’t really have too many solos—maybe some little leads here and there. When it comes to solos, I always do it for the song. When you’re part of a band, you maybe want to show off when you’re playing just one instrument. But when you’re playing everything, you kind of look like an a**hole if you’re trying to show off on every instrument. It really makes you respect the songwriting process and write the best song rather than be like, ‘Hey, I did that!’”<br /> \n<b>Feel</b>\n“The first time I posted it on my Instagram was in, like, 2015. So, it’s crazy to have it finally coming out. For one of the guitar tracks, I played my dad’s original Frankenstein guitar. I played it on ‘Mammoth’ as well. When he pulled it out, he kind of noodled with it for a second and then sort of haphazardly tossed it onto the couch, and everyone in the room just gasped. To him, it’s just a piece of junk he put together, but to us it’s the most recognizable guitar in music history.”<br /> \n<b>Stone</b>\n“The intention with this one was to make an epic finale. It’s a bit longer—over six minutes—and it’s almost like Nine Inch Nails and Black Sabbath had a baby. It has that kind of darker, sludgy vibe.”<br /> \n<b>Distance</b>\n“This is a bonus track. I originally put this out for Pop and had all the proceeds go to his favorite charity, Mr. Holland’s Opus Foundation. But after the crazy success that it saw, we felt like it was a good idea to have it on the album. Dad had been up and down so much, health-wise, over the years and, emotionally, it was a tough thing to go through. I wrote this song imagining what it would be like to be without him, and it ended up being really poignant. It’s really about loss, and I think anybody can relate to that.”","short":"“It’s impossible to ignore where I’m from, so I wanted to touch on the history.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1576471314","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576471314?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/71/0a/1d/710a1df8-5425-4dc8-0332-412f4a2bf6dd/192641781735_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"070906","textColor1":"95e5f4","textColor2":"82abe1","textColor3":"78b9c4","textColor4":"698ab5"},"artistName":"GRiZ","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rainbow-brain/1576471314","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":22,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-22","name":"Rainbow Brain","recordLabel":"GRiZ","upc":"192641781735","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 GRiZ","playParams":{"id":"1576471314","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1568523593","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1568523593?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/1a/17/59/1a175954-8785-02ab-bb61-74878e182c9e/860002653747.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"f0ede6","textColor1":"0d0d0d","textColor2":"1e1d1c","textColor3":"3a3938","textColor4":"484745"},"artistName":"Maya Beiser","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/maya-beiser-x-philip-glass/1568523593","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Avant-Garde","Minimalism","Cello"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-07-23","name":"Maya Beiser x Philip Glass","recordLabel":"Islandia Music","upc":"860002653747","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Islandia Music","playParams":{"id":"1568523593","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"With just her cello and an array of looping and layering effects, US musician Maya Beiser harnesses the expressive power of minimalist composer Philip Glass.

But it’s in the extracts from Glass’ soundtrack to the 2002 film <i>Naqoyqatsi</i> where Beiser uses her digital tools with greatest subtlety, crafting intimate, often eerie soundscapes that sit beneath a soaring, lamenting solo cello.
