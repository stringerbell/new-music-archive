Roughly translated, the term means “tactics and strategy,” but the idea of Maiden’s shape-shifting mascot, Eddie, in full samurai regalia was immediately appealing. “Let's face it, we've plundered a few cultures over the years with Eddie,” Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson tells Apple Music. “We had a Mayan Eddie and we've had a sci-fi one. We've had a space monster Eddie, an Egyptian Eddie, a mummy Eddie. We actually did have Eddie with a samurai sword on the <i>Maiden Japan</i> EP, but that was years and years ago. The band has always been quite popular in Japan, which is a pretty exotic place with a very rich samurai history. But most of the songs are unrelated.” Below, Dickinson comments on some of the album's highlights.<br />\n<b>“Senjutsu”</b>\n“This starts out with some ominous drumbeats from what is intended to sound like those big Japanese taiko drums. Then Nicko [McBrain] comes in with this beat which is not the Keystone Cops, because I think we've got to the point where we feel confident enough that we can be dramatic without being in a hurry about it. And ‘Senjutsu’ has got drama all over it. To me, it builds and builds and builds. There’s a vocal fugue in the middle with echoes going over the top and then another vocal line. It resolves beautifully into this really magisterial vocal line as you get towards the latter half of the tune. Does it have a chorus? No. There's millions of different ones, all strung together. For the most part, the vocal is done in a two-part harmony. It's one of my favorite tracks, and it's going to be a great way to open a set live.”<br /> \n<b>“Stratego”</b>\n“Stratego is a board game. I’ve never played it, but it’s kind of similar to chess. I was doing a little bit of searching and discovered that Stratego was based on a French board game from the 19th century. That game was based on something called military chess. Japanese military chess, in turn, is a game called shogi. The characters are basically flat stones with Japanese calligraphy on them, each denoting a warrior of some description. You’ve got a black side and a white side, but it’s entirely possible for characters to change sides. Not only that, but they can also transform into a different character. It’s a game of strategy and tactics, but also betrayal and intrigue.”<br /> \n<b>“The Writing on the Wall”</b>\n“The song is basically in two parts, and the intro sets the scene. When I first heard it, I was thinking, ‘This is a bit Tarantino here. It’s a little bit desert.’ I could see a Mad Max scenario opening up. I think [guitarist] Adrian [Smith] already had the title and a great riff, so we worked the body of the song around that. I thought it was a great title for what’s going on in the world now. There's lots of things coming up like objects in the rearview mirror—they may be closer than they appear. There’s a lot of choices people need to make about what kind of world they want to live in. I wrote the song without trying to preach, but to say, ‘You can’t bury your head in the sand. This stuff will bite you if you don’t do something about it.’”<br /> \n<b>“Lost in a Lost World”</b>\n“At the beginning, you would believe that you accidentally wandered into The Moody Blues or Pink Floyd doing something in about 1973, with the layered vocals and things like that. We’ve never done anything as explicitly detailed as that before. But it doesn't last for that long before some fiend comes out and hits you over the head with a mallet and the track kicks in. And then it takes you on a journey to a fantastical world that has ceased to exist.”<br />\n<b>“Days of Future Past</b>\n“This track is as close as you're going to get to <i>Piece of Mind</i> or <i>Powerslave</i>-era Maiden. Four minutes, super high-energy riff, big anthemic chorus, big vocals—all that. Incredible riff from Adrian, and basically no guitar solo. The lyric is a reimagining of the graphic novel <i>Constantine</i>, particularly the movie version with Keanu Reeves. It’s kind of an interesting setup, because there’s always the assumption that God is the good guy. In this scenario, God seems to be a manipulative narcissist. He’s almost like a psychopath: ‘I'm going to do all this horrible stuff to you, and then you just have to love me.’ How does that work? That’s what the song asks.”<br /> \n<b>“Darkest Hour”</b>\n“‘Darkest Hour’ refers not to just the movie about Winston Churchill—it’s about him as a person as well. A lot of people criticize Churchill because he made a lot of mistakes and did things people didn’t approve of. He was almost certainly a full-blown alcoholic, but a functioning one. He said horrible things about women. He did all these things that he would aptly be condemned for. But the bit that people forgive all that for—certainly, I do—is that he stood up to the Nazis and said, ‘No, these are barbarians. Even though the odds are stacked against us, we as a nation are going to resist.’ Half of his cabinet and government would’ve sided with the Nazis and done a deal. But he inspired the nation to do the right thing.”<br /> \n<b>“The Parchment”</b>\n“You really have to be careful about this one if you’re one of these people who likes flotation tanks and you’re going to put this one on in the headphones. It’s a processional, really. The end sounds like the emperor coming back, the prodigal son returning home after a long journey. But the whole middle section is absolutely hypnotic. It’s a monster track, but it's layer upon layer upon layer of different iterations and repetitions. If you get under the skin of it, it's really complex. I think Steve locked himself away for days to come up with this one. We had to learn it in pieces because it was the only way possible.”<br /> \n<b>“Hell on Earth”</b>\n“Steve is quite an unconventional personality. He's not an extroverted person—except onstage when he goes raving mad with a bass. But I think he feels a lot of things really deeply about the world he's in. The English band Blur had an album called <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>, and I think Steve would concur with that sentiment and say, ‘What kind of world are we creating? Maybe I should just go to sleep. And then if I pass into the next life, maybe I'll come back and it's going to be better—because this place is hell on earth.’ But I don’t think he’s recommending accelerating your passage into the next world, because we’ve got a tour to do. But he’s genuinely concerned about stuff.”","short":"“Let's face it, we've plundered a few cultures over the years with Eddie.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4bBIsMKf6EmHRlhBwtC33N"}},{"id":"1584218327","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584218327?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/80/5b/07/805b070d-28f7-67ca-0c79-a91201a12737/21UMGIM70562.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3d44","textColor2":"161f26","textColor4":"373e45","textColor1":"1a1e24","bgColor":"bab9c1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jhay Cortez","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/timelezz-apple-music-edition/1584218327","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Timelezz (Apple Music Edition)","recordLabel":"N&E Entertainment LLC","upc":"00602438804382","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Universal Music Latino; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1584218327","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Jhay Cortez started out as a secret-weapon songwriter behind the scenes for Latin music’s hottest hitmakers.

While being in this coveted position might have prompted a less ambitious artist to take a relatively conservative approach to their next album, he sets out here to make <i>Timelezz</i> live up to its name. A decidedly different effort than 2019’s galvanizing full-length <i>Famouz</i>, Cortez’s follow-up pushes reggaetón and Latin trap forward from an innovative leadership position while exploring other sonic avenues for growth. On that latter point, he embraces the rapturous sounds of clubland on Tainy’s techno-fueled “Tokyo” and the Skrillex electro-house collab “En Mi Cuarto.” Still, he makes time for the traperos on “Nos Matamos” and the scorching “Kobe En LA 2.0.” His passion for perreo endures as well, evident on “Dale Como Es” and the explicit “Ropa Interior” with Kendo Kaponi. There’s an immersive epic quality to tracks like “Mi Vicio” and the Anuel AA team-up “Ley Seca,” reinforcing that we’ve scarcely scratched the surface of reggaetón’s full potential—and Cortez’s as well.","short":"The Puerto Rican star pushes trap and reggaetón in exciting new directions."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1576884277","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576884277?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/6e/7d/46/6e7d463a-4030-aef3-abc9-93fe763aa9c0/21UMGIM52812.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d8e1e4","textColor2":"c9d8f4","textColor4":"aec2e1","textColor1":"fefff8","bgColor":"416b96","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lauren Alaina","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sitting-pretty-on-top-of-the-world/1576884277","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Sitting Pretty On Top Of The World","recordLabel":"19 Recordings, Inc./Mercury Nashville","upc":"00602438463442","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A 19/Mercury Nashville Release; ℗ 2021 19 Recordings, Inc., under exclusive license to UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1576884277","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/50rJgPQvYLeiC3Ub9c5tGJ"}},{"id":"1561184260","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1561184260?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/08/14/88/0814883a-444f-6447-3eec-6753eb129d5e/5056167162674_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":2000,"textColor3":"e5d7c4","textColor2":"f5e899","textColor4":"deca7a","textColor1":"fdf8f5","bgColor":"845000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Little Simz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sometimes-i-might-be-introvert/1561184260","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Sometimes I Might Be Introvert","recordLabel":"AGE 101","upc":"5056167162674","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 AGE 101 MUSIC under exclusive license to AWAL Recordings Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1561184260","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Sometimes I’ll be in my own space, my own company, and that’s when I'm really content,” Little Simz tells Apple Music. “It's all love, though. There’s nothing against anyone else; that's just how I am. I like doing my own thing and making my art.” The lockdowns of 2020, then, proved fruitful for the North London MC, singer, and actor. She wrestled writer’s block, revived her cult <i>Drop</i> EP series (explore the razor-sharp and diaristic <i>Drop 6</i> immediately), and laid grand plans for her fourth studio album. Songwriter/producer Inflo, co-architect of Simz’s 2019 Mercury-nominated, Ivor Novello Award-winning <i>GREY Area</i>, was tapped and the hard work began. “It was straight boot camp,” she says of the <i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</i> sessions in London and Los Angeles. “We got things done pronto, especially with the pace that me and Flo move at. We’re quite impulsive: When we're ready to go, it’s time to go.”<br />\nMonths of final touches followed—and a collision between rap and TV royalty. A interest in <i>The Crown</i> led Simz to approach Emma Corrin (who gave an award-winning portrayal of Princess Diana in the drama). She uses her Diana accent to offer breathless, regal addresses that punctuate the 19-track album. “It was a reach,” Simz says of inviting Corrin’s participation. “I’m not sure what I expected, but I enjoyed watching her performance, and wrote most of her words whilst I was watching her.” Corrin’s speeches add to the record’s sense of grandeur. It pairs turbocharged UK rap with Simz at her most vulnerable and ambitious. There are mediations on coming of age in the spotlight (“Standing Ovation”), a reunion with fellow Sault collaborator Cleo Sol on the glorious “Woman,” and, in “Point and Kill,” a cleansing, polyrhythmic jam session with Nigerian artist Obongjayar that confirms the record’s dazzling sonic palette. Here, Simz talks us through <i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Introvert”</b>\n“This was always going to intro the album from the moment it was made. It feels like a battle cry, a rebirth. And with the title, you wouldn't expect this to sound so huge. But I’m finding the power within my introversion to breathe new meaning into the word.”<br />\n<b>“Woman” (feat. Cleo Sol)</b>\n“This was made to uplift and celebrate women. To my peers, my family, my friends, close women in my life, as well as women all over the world: I want them to know I’ve got their back. Linking up with Cleo is always fun; we have such great musical chemistry, and I can’t imagine anyone else bringing what she did to the song. Her voice is beautiful, but I think it's her spirit and her intention that comes through when she sings.”<br />\n<b>“Two Worlds Apart”</b>\n“Firstly, I love this sample; it’s ‘The Agony and the Ecstasy’ by Smokey Robinson, and Flo’s chopped it up really cool. This is my moment to flex. You had the opener, followed by a nice, smoother vibe, but this is like, ‘Hey, you’re listening to a <i>rap</i> album.’”<br />\n<b>“I Love You, I Hate You”</b>\n“This wasn’t the easiest song for me to write, but I'm super proud that I did. It’s an opportunity for me to lay bare my feelings on how that [family] situation affected me, growing up. And where I'm at now—at peace with it and moving on.”<br />\n<b>“Little Q, Pt. 1 (Interlude)”</b>\n“Little Q is my cousin, Qudus, on my dad's side. We grew up together, but then there was a stage where we didn't really talk for some years. No bad blood, just doing different things, so when we reconnected, we had a real heart-to-heart—and I heard about all he’d been through. It made me feel like, ‘Damn, this is a blood relative, and he almost lost his life.’ I thank God he didn’t, but I thought of others like him. And I felt it was important that his story was heard and shared. So, I’m speaking from his perspective.”<br />\n<b>“Little Q, Pt. 2”</b>\n“I grew up in North London and [Little Q] was raised in South, and as much as we both grew up in endz, his experience was obviously different to mine. Being a product of an environment or system that isn't really for you, it’s tough trying to navigate that.”<br />\n<b>“Gems (Interlude)”</b>\n“This is another turning point, reminding myself to take time: ‘Breathe…you're human. Give what you can give, but don't burn out for anyone. Put yourself first.’ Just little gems that everyone needs to hear once in a while.”<br />\n<b>“Speed”</b>\n“This track sends another reminder: ‘This game is a marathon, not a sprint. So pace yourself!’ I know where I'm headed, and I'm taking my time, with little breaks here and there. Now I know when to really hit the gas and also when to come off a bit.”<br />\n<b>“Standing Ovation”</b>\n“I take some time to reflect here, like, ‘Wow, you're still here and still going. It’s been a slow burn, but you can afford to give yourself a pat on the back.’ But as well as being in the limelight, let's also acknowledge the people on the ground doing real amazing work: our key workers, our healers, teachers, cleaners. If you go to a toilet and it's dirty, people go in from 9 to 5 and make sure that shit is spotless for you, so let's also say thank you.”<br />\n<b>“I See You”</b>\n“This is a really beautiful and poetic song on love. Sometimes as artists we tend to draw from traumatic times for great art, we’re hurt or in pain, but it was nice for me to be able to draw from a place of real joy in my life for this song. Even where it sits [on the album]: right in the center, the heart.”<br />\n<b>“The Rapper That Came to Tea (Interlude)”</b>\n“This title is a play on [Judith Kerr’s] children's book <i>The Tiger Who Came to Tea</i>, and this is about me better understanding my introversion. I’m just posing questions to myself—I might not necessarily have answers for them, I think it's good to throw them out there and get the brain working a bit.”<br />\n<b>“Rollin Stone”</b>\n“This cut reminds me somewhat of ’09 Simz, spitting with rapidness and being witty. And I’m also finding new ways to use my voice on the second half here, letting my evil twin have her time.”<br />\n<b>“Protect My Energy”</b>\n“This is one of the songs I'm really looking forward to performing live. It’s a stepper, and it got me really wanting to sing, to be honest. I very much enjoy being around good company, but these days I enjoy my personal space and I want to protect that.”<br />\n<b>“Never Make Promises (Interlude)”</b>\n“This one is self-explanatory—nothing is promised at all. It’s a short intermission to lead to the next one, but at one point it was nearly the album intro.”<br />\n<b>“Point and Kill” (feat. Obongjayar)</b>\n“This is a big vibe! It feels very much like Nigeria to me, and Obongjayar is one of my favorites at the moment. We recorded this in my living room on a whim—and I'm very, very grateful that he graced this song. The title comes from a phrase used in Nigeria to pick out fish at the market, or a store. You point, they kill. But also metaphorically, whatever I want, I'm going to get in the same way, essentially.”<br />\n<b>“Fear No Man”</b>\n“This track continues the same vibe, even more so. It declares: ‘I'm here. I'm unapologetically me and I fear no one here. I'm not shook of anyone in this rap game.’”<br />\n<b>“The Garden (Interlude)”</b>\n“This track is just amazing musically. It’s about nurturing the seeds you plant. Nurture those relationships, and everything around you that's holding you down.”<br />\n<b>“How Did You Get Here”</b>\n“I want everyone to know <i>how</i> I got here; from the jump, school days, to my rap group, Space Age. We were just figuring it out, being persistent. I cried whilst recording this song; it all hit me, like, ‘I'm actually recording my fourth album.’ Sometimes I sit and I wonder if this is all really true.”<br />\n<b>“Miss Understood”</b>\n“This is the perfect closer. I could have ended on the last track, easily, but, I don't know, it's kind of like doing 99 reps. You've done 99, that's amazing, but you can do one more to just make it 100, you can. And for me it was like, ‘I'm going to get this one in there.’”","short":"“I like doing my own thing and making my art.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0DBoWQ52XUHtrZQdfAqOVj"}},{"id":"1583876941","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1583876941?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/7b/87/5b/7b875b14-8911-5d6c-2b0d-e515b080a114/21UMGIM87491.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"1b2f07","textColor2":"112803","textColor4":"214802","textColor1":"0a0909","bgColor":"5eca00","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lady Gaga","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dawn-of-chromatica/1583876941","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Dawn Of Chromatica","recordLabel":"Interscope","upc":"00602438850785","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Interscope Records","playParams":{"id":"1583876941","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3OevODyllQCrhudfLLnV3y"}},{"id":"1584028017","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584028017?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/10/65/95/10659531-5d0c-9f20-4c56-cf072fc74a84/5059449046853.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfc960","textColor2":"b5fa58","textColor4":"a9c87a","textColor1":"d1fc39","bgColor":"7a00ff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"MIKE DEAN","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/echoplex-live-2021/1584028017","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"ECHOPLEX (LIVE 2021)","recordLabel":"M.W.A","upc":"5059449046853","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 MIKE DEAN","playParams":{"id":"1584028017","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When the pandemic hit, MIKE DEAN—the legendary Southern hip-hop producer and Kanye West collaborator—found himself with more studio time on his hands than he was used to. So he turned his attention to the racks of keyboards around him and began indulging in the kind of noodly, arpeggiated, minor-key synthscapes that people often associate with singular film composers like John Carpenter and Goblin. It was DEAN looking inward while also broadcasting his improvisations to a growing number of fans watching on his social feeds. Truth is, DEAN has been making this kind of music for himself since the beginning of his career. “I just never do it with artists,” he tells Apple Music. “When you're producing for an artist, you need to scale things back. You've got to think more about the song. You can't go crazy on the synths.” Those extended jams would form DEAN’s first solo album, <i>4:20</i> (released on 4/20/20—yes, he's an avowed cannabis connoisseur). His second LP of synth, guitar, and drum machine experiments—<i>4: 22</i>—came a year later. But while those LPs are entirely different beasts from his production work for the likes of Travis Scott, Frank Ocean, or Beyoncé, they reveal something deeper about how his sound—moody, dark, searing, noisy, always staring into the abyss—has pushed hip-hop and R&B further into left field with each new record he’s involved in.<br /> \nCut to August 2021, when DEAN, holed up in the bowels of Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium amid what would become one of the most bizarre, and riveting, album rollouts of all time—for West’s <i>Donda</i>—was still working out the details for his first-ever solo stage show, which he announced just weeks before, at the comparatively minuscule Echoplex in LA. “We basically planned it in a week and a half before the show,” DEAN says. He and Kanye were still tinkering with <i>Donda</i> as the world watched on. “I was definitely scared I wasn't going to finish the album in time to make it to my show,” he says. Some of what makes up <i>ECHOPLEX (LIVE 2021)</i>—which was assembled from recordings over August 21 and 22, 2021—may sound familiar, but the vast majority of it is the artist in his element, creating on the fly. “It was a real challenge to do,” he says, “because both of my albums were all improv. So it's kind of hard to go back and learn it to recreate it, especially with a lot of analog [synthesizer] sets, because you're just turning knobs. You can't recreate that every day.” The biggest surprise here, though, may be the guest appearance of Christine and the Queens, whose upcoming album DEAN is in the process of producing. “We both like to do real nerdy, intricate music,” he says of their collaboration, the first glimpse of which is “RAHIM LIVES.” “We're going crazy on everything.”","short":"“I was scared I wasn't going to finish Donda in time to make it to my show.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0RpaEPeXzZyIfxBQAGG9HK"}},{"id":"1583485009","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1583485009?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/27/68/25/27682578-e549-cd2e-f219-ae66a335606c/21UMGIM79983.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2b2b2b","textColor2":"282828","textColor4":"484848","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"cccccc","hasP3":false},"artistName":"BIG30","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/king-of-killbranch/1583485009","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-02","name":"King Of Killbranch","recordLabel":"Bread Gang/N-Less","upc":"00602438661091","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Bread Gang/N-Less","playParams":{"id":"1583485009","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1NDrL1t8NNB233FRqbzzoK"}},{"id":"1578976907","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578976907?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b8/32/7f/b8327f56-ef97-b221-44f9-2c8b66fb6671/Fatboy_Slim_-_Everybody_Loves_A_Mixtape_-_Volume_4.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":2000,"textColor3":"362f2c","textColor2":"383028","textColor4":"5f564c","textColor1":"040000","bgColor":"fcefdd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Fatboy Slim","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everybody-loves-a-mixtape-vol-4-disco-dj-mix/1578976907","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Disco","Music","R&B/Soul","Dance","House"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Everybody Loves a Mixtape, Vol. 4: Disco (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381814410","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1578976907","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1575772342","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575772342?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d4/ed/a0/d4eda068-4307-781e-1415-933c686f5553/21UMGIM61686.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"4e4d4d","textColor2":"561f2d","textColor4":"784c57","textColor1":"212021","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"LANY","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gg-bb-xx/1575772342","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"gg bb xx","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438585526","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records Release; ℗ 2021 Side Street Entertainment LLC, under exclusive licence to Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1575772342","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/20tgAhlplT42WnAAC8Xndk"}},{"id":"1569656212","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569656212?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b8/83/89/b8838922-ea6a-4bb7-71d4-f32c0104bb0c/21UMGIM42122.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":4000,"textColor3":"23282a","textColor2":"0e1011","textColor4":"2a2f32","textColor1":"050707","bgColor":"9aacb6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Baby Queen","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-yearbook/1569656212","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"The Yearbook","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438332953","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records Release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1569656212","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Baby Queen named her debut mixtape <i>The Yearbook</i> because she wanted it to feel like a coming-of-age film. \"This whole body of work was written during a time of my life that was so developmental,\" the artist born Bella Latham tells Apple Music. \"When I listen to it now, it sounds like all the different characters you play when you're growing up, and all the intense emotions you feel, like extreme happiness and extreme pain. I wanted people to feel like they could grow up with me listening to the music.\" The South Africa-born East Londoner says she always knew this savagely honest and personal body of work was a mixtape rather than a traditional album. \"For me, an album is something that is incredibly sonically cohesive, whereas these songs were sort of written as singles,\" she says. \"Each song has its own character and we followed specifically what it wanted in terms of production—not necessarily what the project as a whole wanted.\"<br />\nFor this reason, <i>The Yearbook</i> serves as a catchy showcase for the breadth of Baby Queen's spiky alt-pop sound, pinging between synthy anthems (\"Raw Thoughts\"), melancholic midtempo (\"Dover Beach\"), and chugging guitar pop (\"American Dream\"). Along the way, there are also affecting spoken-word interludes that matter hugely to an artist who takes palpable pride in her lyrics. \"I liked the idea of breaking up this mixtape with poetry because it's really nice to have a moment where the words can just completely shine through,\" she says. Read on for Latham’s track-by-track recollections on <i>The Yearbook</i>.<br />\n<b>\"Baby Kingdom\"</b>\n\"This was originally a poem I wrote about the desire to rebel against the way people want you to fit a certain mold and life. I guess it's a manifesto about freedom and finding a space that is entirely yours. That's what the ‘Baby Kingdom’ is for me, and what being Baby Queen has really brought to life.\"<br />\n<b>\"Raw Thoughts\"</b>\n\"I think this song is going to haunt me for a really long time because it's just a really good song. And annoyingly, it came [to me] in about 15-20 minutes. I started writing it after a really crazy night out in East London, when I was honestly so hung over. I was going through a really bad breakup at the time—my ex was in LA with this beautiful supermodel and I was living this sort of broke-ass gremlin life running around London getting wasted. So this song is really about the confusion of being so heartbroken but also having all this newfound freedom.\"<br />\n<b>\"You Shaped Hole\"</b>\n\"This is about the same breakup. I can remember writing the melody while walking through the park. I don't know where I was going, but I just started singing, 'There's a hole inside of me and it's shaped like you,' into my voice notes. I love the concept of having this hole that was cut out of my body that I was trying to fill by cramming with so many things. But because the hole was shaped like one particular person, all these things could never reach the corners. I was trying to fill the hole with alcohol, kissing people, new experiences—all the stuff you do during a breakup to try and escape your feelings. At that point in my life, I was just on a rampage.\"<br />\n<b>\"American Dream\" (feat. MAY-A)</b>\n\"I came up with the concept when I went on a writing trip to this farm in Bath—it was just one horse, one cow, and me. And I had this idea of comparing the desire to be with someone—and the dream or illusion that you have of someone—with the American dream, which is something that people also have such preconceived notions about. In both cases you think something is going to be a certain way, but it often isn't what you expect, and that was a really interesting concept to me.”<br />\n<b>\"Narcissist\"</b>\n\"This song is very specific and opinionated. I don't think anyone else could sing these words but Baby Queen, which is why I like it so much. My generation, Gen Z, is criticized for being narcissistic, but there are very specific reasons why we are this way. We grew up with social media and the internet, being fed this message: 'Focus on yourself, obsess over yourself. It's all about aesthetics and how you're perceived.' I wanted to take back ownership of that word and say, 'Yeah, I am a fucking narcissist, but here's why: You started it.' Because if you don't accept your flaws, how can you even begin to work through them?\"<br />\n<b>\"Dover Beach\"</b>\n\"One of my favorite poems as a kid was ‘Dover Beach’ by Matthew Arnold, so it was always this really romanticized place in my head. So when I had time for another writing trip, I was like, 'I'm going to Dover!' It was a pretty amazing experience to write a song called 'Dover Beach' when you're actually there. There's something very magical about the white cliffs and the sea air and seeing the ocean in front of you. The concept of this song is very romantic in a way. It's about going to a place you've dreamed about your whole life, but instead of experiencing it fully and having a great time, everything you see is taken over by the object of your affection. So it's a bit like: ‘Fuck you! Now you've even stolen Dover Beach from me!’\"<br />\n<b>\"Dover Beach, Pt. 2\"</b>\n\"This is a poem I wrote at the same time about the same person—it’s a continuation of the story that adds depth to those feelings. Originally we were going to outro ‘Dover Beach’ with the piano sound you hear here, but I remember saying: 'This feels like something else; I think there's room for another story here.' So I went through my notebooks and found these ideas that became the lyrics.\"<br />\n<b>\"These Drugs\"</b>\n\"This song really changed my career because it's so starkly honest and seeing people respond to that was incredible for me. I've never been addicted to anything really, but I have definitely had a bad relationship with substances and partying—especially during this dark time of my life where I felt like a failure. Because I hated myself so much, I would go out partying all night so I could reach this point where it was like I could switch off my brain. Really, this song is about my deep self-hatred and realizing you can't block out that feeling with anything, because if you do, you wake up feeling worse and it becomes this vicious cycle. I felt like I had a duty to tell this story, which is a really great feeling to have when you're writing a song, because it drives you to say something that feels really important.\"<br />\n<b>\"Fake Believe\"</b>\n\"I find it really hard to speak about social issues online. The best way for me to say something is through my songs. I wrote this last year when so many Black Lives Matter protests were happening and Donald Trump was in power and I felt really fucking powerless about what was happening in the world. The way that I deal with things is through satire, so this song is written from the perspective of someone who would go to a BLM march with an 'All Lives Matter' sign, or someone who would go to a Pride march and say, 'You're going to hell because you’re gay.' I want to laugh at them because being laughed at is what they would like the least.\"<br />\n<b>\"I'm a Mess\"</b>\n\"Lyrically, this is my favorite song I've ever written. It details what it's like to have depression, because at the time, I felt like I couldn't even be bothered to get out of bed. It's kind of weird for me to listen back to this song now, because it's like: 'Wow, that was a really bad place for me to be in.' I'm sure there will be moments where I go back to feeling that way again, but putting those thoughts out there definitely helped me. I think being honest allows you to take responsibility and own your faults, so you can kind of become one with them. From that point on, at least you're not deceiving yourself anymore.\"","short":"“It sounds like all the characters you play when you’re growing up.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5AxHpSJXhis5BFb1AA24pe"}},{"id":"1571956564","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571956564?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/14/19/f0/1419f01c-f595-b99d-18f2-5770ea633c27/190296619373.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":4000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"d5d5d5","textColor4":"aaaaaa","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rudimental","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ground-control/1571956564","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Ground Control","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records UK","upc":"190296619373","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An Asylum Records UK release, ℗ 2021 Warner Music UK Limited.

But as has been the way for the London dance collective for over a decade, during which they’ve become one of the UK’s biggest acts, it only hardened Piers Aggett, Amir Amor, Kesi Dryden, and Leon “Locksmith” Rolle’s resolve. “It was that feeling of wanting to be in an environment where you can hear loud music and have subs playing loud; that was the thought process behind this album,” Aggett tells Apple Music.<br />\n<i>Ground Control</i> is the quartet’s most focused record. The flip side of not touring through most of 2020 and 2021 was that, for the first time since becoming huge, the group could put their full concentration into making an album. “We’ve actually had the most productive year we’ve ever had as a band,” says Aggett. “The last three albums were all done on the road in between tours.” What’s emerged is an album that celebrates dance music in all its forms, from drum ’n’ bass to house to UK garage to jungle and more, the interlinking theme that this is music designed to bring people together, to evoke the exhilaration of that communal experience. <i>Ground Control</i> is ready for takeoff. Aggett takes us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Come Over” (feat. Anne-Marie & Tion Wayne)</b>\n“It’s almost like we remixed ourselves. In the garage days, you used to get these 1990s R&B tunes and then a garage producer like MJ Cole or someone would remix it. And we basically had an R&B idea with Anne-Marie and L Devine—who was the other writer in the room—and we wrote that. It was like 110 BPM, or maybe slower, a little slow vibe. And then in the first lockdown, we sped it up and produced the garage beat on it. It kind of set the tone for the rest of the album, I think.”<br />\n<b>“Jumper” (feat. Kareen Lomax)</b>\n“This is another track in that garage world. It was a song we wrote in 2018 with John Ryan, who wrote ‘These Days’ with us. We were looking for a vocalist and we knew Kareen Lomax from Diplo’s ‘Looking for Me.’ She was in Atlanta and we sent her the beat, she vocaled it. She just brought an amazing, amazing emotion to it; it really encapsulated the vibe of the song. It’s an Afro-centric, garage-inspired kind of mash-up—it’s got a lot of energy to it.”<br />\n<b>“Straight From the Heart” (feat. Nørskov)</b>\n“We wanted to rework a garage classic. We all grew up in London around a lot of them tunes, and Amir actually got mentored by [‘Straight From the Heart’ artists] Doolally in Camden at his youth center. It was just a special tune. We reworked it and put it in a modern context. Anne-Marie was on <i>The Voice</i> and met contestant Leona, whose artist name is Nørskov. We loved her voice and wanted to try her on the song.”<br />\n<b>“Ghost” (feat. Hardy Caprio) [Refix]</b>\n“This is another one of us remixing ourselves. Because in the pandemic, we had to really work with what we had. There were no sessions, no writing camps, no flying around taking inspiration from around the world or hooking up and doing sessions. So again, we remixed our own song that we’d put out on the [2019] <i>Distinction</i> EP. It didn't quite really kick off, but it was more of an EP filler track. So we got the vocal and put it into this garage relay and then got Hardy Caprio. It's a classic example of us reworking our own stuff to make these records work in an environment where you have to work with what you've got.”<br />\n<b>“Remember Their Names” (feat. Josh Barry) [with MJ Cole]</b>\n“We were in a studio with Josh Barry and we wrote an idea; it was around the time of the Black Lives Matter protests. We wrote this idea and then, separately, MJ Cole made this drum and bass tune with him on piano. And then we started singing the song that we’d written before over it because it was in the same key. We do that quite a bit, actually, because you write an idea and it doesn't always come out or the production isn't quite there for whatever reason. And then we sing our own songs over our newer beats.”<br />\n<b>”Be Somebody” [with James Vincent McMorrow]</b>\n“This was a kind of online pandemic collab where he had this idea, and James Vincent McMorrow sent it to us in the early days of the pandemic. We just needed something to work on when we were in lockdown. He had the song pretty much there; it was more about producing it and adding the elements. We kind of wanted to create something like a ‘Not Giving In’ Part 2, something that has the essence of the previous albums on this new record. And he's got a great voice, James.”<br />\n<b>“Be the One” (feat. MORGAN, Digga D & TIKE)</b>\n“We’ve set up a record label and publishing company called Major Toms, and this one is an example of the family. MORGAN is signed to our record label and TIKE is on our publishing company. This was a Afrobeat tune that they've also put out together, but we sped it up and put it into the <i>Ground Control</i> realm. And then we got Digga D, who is a really hot rapper. It's a feel-good, summery garage tune.”<br />\n<b>“Handle My Own” (feat. Ella Henderson)</b>\n“I'm going to talk again about the Major Toms family. Ella Henderson is one of the artists signed, and we've been writing lots with her over the last few years. On this tune, we wanted to tap into the whole soulful disco element. It's a sample from a disco record by The Jones Girls. I took a sample of a nine-minute disco tune, but it's just a core structure that I really liked and then we wrote a whole song over it. It's kind of got an Angie Stone feel to me.”<br />\n<b>“So Sorry” [with Skream]</b> \n“Skream is an old friend. We actually met Anne-Marie and Skream on an Annie Mac tour in 2012 and we all got on really well. I've been chatting to him for years saying we should do a collab and we finally got in the studio. He sent me the idea—he had a MIDI file idea that he hadn't really developed, but we then sent it to Anne-Marie, she wrote the vocal and sent it back to us. And then we all got in the room and finished it and put it through some synths in the studio. It's just a deep, emotional kind of rave-y tune. I think it's going to be one of them ones that we're going to play at 4 am in a club and then leave.”<br />\n<b>“Distance” (feat. Maverick Sabre & Kojey Radical)</b>\n“‘Distance’ was a bit of an older idea, maybe 2017, even 2016. It was an idea we wrote with Maverick Sabre. He's one of the best songwriters from this generation; he's such a great lyricist. I remember him writing the lyrics while we were making the beat and I was sitting down with him and we were talking about the song. And then he put the ‘Inner City Life’ by Goldie video on mute. He was thinking about the system and feeling caught in a system, the system that we're all in, and the feeling of that. And I think he really captured it, and then we got Kojey Radical in. He was the perfect person to put that to lyrics in a fast tempo. It's one of the ones you have to listen to on a loud system as well.”<br />\n<b>“Instajets” (feat. BackRoad Gee)</b>\n“This was a funny, interesting one. In 2014, we did a writing session with Ed Sheeran and The Game in LA. And we made six tunes, which are still not released. But we then went back and nicked a vocal from one of the tunes and crafted a new beat and then sent it to D Double E. I said, ‘Do you want to jump on this?’ And he jumped on it and then we got BackRoad Gee on it at the middle to end of last year. It was kind of another example of us playing with old ideas on our hard drive and mixing around vocals. And then we had to call The Game and say, ‘Hi, do you remember us? We met six years ago…’ That was a bit of a process, trying to get ahold of him!”<br />\n<b>“Krazy” (feat. Afronaut Zu)</b>\n“There was about 10 of us in the room, and there were lots of vibes in that room. I think we were drinking and just enjoying ourselves and listening to music. And then we just made that tune and it was kind of something more on the jazzy edge of garage. And Afronaut Zu, he's an artist to watch. He's got an amazing voice. Some tracks do take a long time, and you don't always nail the production every time, but ‘Krazy’ is an example of something that probably took about three hours to make.”<br />\n<b>“Make You Move” (feat. Nørskov & Keeya Keys)</b>\n“This is another track in the garage realm. It was a song that we wrote out on an LA trip with Tove Lo. We got Leona from ‘Straight From the Heart’ to sing it. And we brought in Keeya Keys, who's really a pioneer in that new garage sound as well, mixing Afrobeat and garage—part of that kind of NSG crew. And he's just a sick rapper. It really put us into that kind of 'when MCs jumped on garage' era. It felt like a really good, important moment for the album.”<br />\n<b>“Hostess” (feat. MORGAN)</b>\n“This is a <i>Ground Control</i>-style a remix of an original that MORGAN did; it's one of her songs and we remixed it for the album. We co-wrote it with her, and it's something we thought: ‘Let's go a bit jungle on this album and do something a kind of bit like Missy Elliott.’ I was then like, ‘Let's flip up and bring it into the jungle realm.’”\n<b>“C’est Fini” (feat. Rv & LOWKEY)</b>\n“This one is an example of us really messing with sonics and just having a bit of fun on the production, using the synths that we were using. We had fun with the bass and put it into a real club environment. When we play this at parties and clubs, it's the one that really knocks your head off. No one's really done drill rappers on house before. Our production duo that we signed had a lot of drill rappers in the studio, so we brought them into the other room and said, ‘Do you want to jump on this?’ And they were into it. It was a kind of mash-up of stars. We like to play with genres, and this is an example of that.”<br />\n<b>“Keep Your Head Up” (feat. Hamzaa & House Gospel Choir)</b>\n“Our foundation is positivity, and we’ve all had a really tough year, so we’re bringing a positive to a negative in this tune. We wanted to do a tune with House Gospel Choir, who are amazing. We wrote it with 2fox, who are an Afro-house production duo.

Coming to prominence as part of the playful lo-fi house scene that also birthed the likes of Ross From Friends, DJ BORING, and Mall Grab, Jakobsson released his debut LP, 2017’s <i>Time Spent Away From U</i>, to critical acclaim for its nuanced and deeply felt take on deep house compositions. For his second long-player, <i>Mirrors</i>, the introspection increases, bolstered by hundreds of hours spent honing his production skills. An amalgam of the Swedish producer’s varied influences, tracks range from the UK garage melancholy of “She Loves Me” to the anthemic synths of “Someday” and the chugging eternal crescendo of “Song for the Lonely”—and they’re all held together by a melodic touch that straddles the dance floor as much as private play. “This is a crossroad of sorts—a reflection of where I am, as well as where I’m going,” he says. Read on for Jakobsson’s thoughts on the album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“She Loves Me” (feat. Stella Explorer)</b>\n“I wanted to write a track with a 2-step feel to it and at the time of making ‘She Loves Me,’ I was also listening to a lot of music by Little Dragon, especially their tune ‘Twice.’ I was thinking, ‘What would Todd Edwards sound like mixed with Little Dragon?’ Stella Explorer is on the vocals, and she had this beautiful interpretation of the theme of the track, which is when you’re in a relationship with someone and, suddenly, you feel this paranoia that they might lose their feelings for you. It’s probably my favorite song on the album.”<br />\n<b>“Walking With Ur Smile”</b>\n“I’ve been very inspired by the recent UK garage revival, and I love the Korg M1 synth sound that populates those tracks, so I wanted to have hints of it throughout the record. For the vocal samples, I just found this random a cappella cover of an Anita Baker song on YouTube by an R&B group that only had around 300 views. It’s a goldmine—a beautiful vocal that I could write a thousand different melodies to.”<br />\n<b>\"U Already Know” (feat. Teira)</b>\n“This references my recent EP releases and also nods to my Italo-disco influences. I wanted to release this as a single during the summer, in time for the festival season to be taking off again, since it’s a really happy track inspired by people like Todd Terje, and I hoped it would give listeners an optimistic lift when they heard it on the dance floor or in a field.”<br />\n<b>“The Right Place” (feat. Teira)</b>\n“This was one of the first tracks I made for the album. It was extremely layered and intricate, since I wanted to make something that had a very obvious emotionality to it but that also referenced the atmospheres and textures that Four Tet has in his music. I met Teira after she booked me for a warehouse party she threw in LA, and we got along really well. When I told her I was starting work on this album, she began sending me vocals and we ended up with lots of different versions of the track. We went with this iteration in the end, because it treads the line between a pop and underground sound really well.”<br />\n<b>“Home Calling”</b>\n“‘Home Calling’ was the last addition to the album. I worked through around 15 different drafts of the album in total, but this was submitted just before the final tracks were sent for mastering. It felt like the record needed an ambient interlude and, luckily, I had written this a while ago and it just fit perfectly. I’m happy that it’s there, as it acts like a break before the record builds up again to its closing tracks.”<br />\n<b>“These Things Will Come to Be”</b>\n“This track is built around the same formula that was used a lot during the lo-fi era, where you would recontextualize a vocal sample in the midst of a track. It’s a really fun way to write, and so here I used a voice message I found online as the center around which the melodies are layered. It’s hopefully something that is upbeat but also works as a listening experience.”<br />\n<b>“Tell Me One More Time”</b>\n“I wanted a track on the record that was aimed obviously for the dance floor and which would get straight to the point for listeners. When I’m writing, I’m essentially just sitting on my bed and working on the laptop all the time. I don’t really have a structure or process—I just make music whenever I feel inspired, and so ‘Tell Me One More Time’ is a snapshot of that feeling of wanting to make people move.”<br />\n<b>“Someday”</b>\n“I rarely feel like I know how to make an anthemic, epic track, but this melody just came into my head and it had that feel to it, along with a breakbeat reference that was in the same vein as Orbital or Bicep. I’m really excited to see how dancers react to this when I play it out, since I haven’t had the chance to yet.”<br />\n<b>“I Feel Better”</b>\n“I came across this vocal sample from an Italian artist who was a part of a remix competition I found online. There were lots of EDM remixes that were being submitted, but his voice and melody had quite a poppy feel to it, which appealed to me. I was on the verge of not putting this track on the record because it is such a deviation from what I usually make, but the people who were involved with the track selection convinced me to keep it and I’m really glad I did.”<br />\n<b>“Song for the Lonely”</b>\n“This is the final crescendo of the record. It has a trudging, galloping momentum to it, since I wanted to make something quite epic to close out the album. The high-pitched vocal sample that I use has a Burial feel, and when I was writing the song, I just had an image of people in the club, losing it to this as the final track of the night, closing out the dance floor.”","short":"“I wanted to get back to raw emotionality for this record.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7FvnTARvgjUyWnUT0flUN7"}},{"id":"1580992696","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580992696?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/22/36/a1/2236a131-5f14-749b-aea3-4f3c39d977d5/5060913704759.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"353430","textColor2":"32322e","textColor4":"585751","textColor1":"060605","bgColor":"f0edda","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beautiful-presents-beautiful-vol-1/1580992696","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-31","name":"Beautiful Presents: Beautiful, Vol. 1","recordLabel":"BEAUTIFUL","upc":"5060913704759","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 BEAUTIFUL","playParams":{"id":"1580992696","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vxquNykZOqoSU3MR7UJ0G"}},{"id":"1581530424","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581530424?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a0/a6/a8/a0a6a872-81c4-b5a9-8e8e-e3fefb9dedbd/artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c47149","textColor2":"e2762b","textColor4":"bd6427","textColor1":"ec8755","bgColor":"281d19","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cocoa Sarai & BlvkM0nd4y","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sugarcane-ep/1581530424","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Reggae","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Sugarcane -

He was certainly the genius among geniuses of the period and maybe in all of music history, but what this album shows is how awesome some of his contemporaries also were. And how wrong it is to neglect them and only focus on the big names.” And so with Mozart’s visionary <i>Piano Sonata No. 14 in C minor, K. 457</i> and the charming, deceptively simple <i>Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major Sonata, K. 545</i>, Ólafsson brings alive the worlds of Baldassare Galuppi and Domenico Cimarosa—both of whose music has a beguiling sincerity—plus works by Mozart’s friend and mentor Joseph Haydn and his hero C.P.E. Bach (“Bach is the father, we are the children!”, Mozart is once said to have exclaimed). Just as important as the music itself is the way Ólafsson takes his listeners on a journey, his instinct for tonalities and moods creating a magical, seamless whole. “I think of this album like I do all my albums—as a collage composition,” he says. “Of course, I didn’t write the music. But when you create that kind of musical searching through an album, it kind of becomes a composition in itself. It has to tell a story.” Read on as Ólafsson guides us through that story in-depth.<br />\n\n<i>”Piano Sonata No. 9 in F minor”\n“I love the idea of starting a Mozart album with somebody else, here Baldassare Galuppi. This piece is very interesting, because it’s kind of without melody and it’s very modern in that sense. It’s made up of these incredibly beautiful arpeggiated chords, and this kind of dream-like atmosphere that seems to be way ahead of its time, almost like Schubert. It’s got this altered state of consciousness between being awake and being in a dream.”<br />\n\n<b>”Rondo in F Major, K. 494”</b>\n“I had to think long and hard about what the album’s first Mozart piece should be. This rondo seems to me to be the essence of Mozart. Every time we hear the really simple, angelic theme, Mozart brings something completely different to it. There are all of these incredibly subtle variants and variations within it that make Mozart Mozart. It’s also quite operatic.”<br />\n\n<b>”Rondo II in D Minor, H. 290</b> \n“I just love this piece [by C.P.E. Bach]. It’s so daring harmonically and it’s so wild. He’s such a wild cat. Mozart is always so polished and C.P.E. Bach isn’t polished very often, so he’s kind of a musical bad boy in that sense. There’s something so modern about it, almost neo-classical—it could almost have been by Stravinsky. It has the most incredible modulations.”<br />\n\n<b>“Sonata No. 42 in D Minor”</b>\n“When I first played the original version of this piece [by Domenico Cimarosa], it was pretty unspectacular and very much a musical skeleton. But the melody stayed with me, because it’s an amazing <i>bel canto</i> melody; Cimarosa was one of the most famous operatic composers of Mozart’s time. So I harmonised it, added some parts and changed the melody in one instance. I kind of recomposed it, but called it an arrangement!”<br />\n\n<b>”Fantasia in D Minor K. 397 (Fragment)”</b>\n“I've known this piece for a very long time, but I've never been happy about the ending. I don’t like how the D Major section just ends like it does. It’s so inconclusive. Mozart, however, didn’t finish it, and I think whoever it was, one of his contemporaries, finished it really unsuccessfully. I didn’t want to compose a new ending because this is Mozart, after all, so I decided to end with the minor section and link the piece to the ‘D Major Rondo’. So I created my own little ‘Fantasia and Rondo’ setup! I recorded this track on two different pianos. At the start, I use a very dark, beautiful-sounding piano, but for the violent outbursts, I use a different Steinway.”<br />\n\n<b>“Rondo in D Major K. 485”</b>\n“I play this considerably faster than many other recordings out there. But I just feel it’s Mozart, the pianist or keyboard master, who’s really writing this piece. It’s extremely virtuosic, and it’s written to please and to inspire awe. But it’s not a terribly serious piece of music. It’s like Mozart is showing off these wild modulations and his incredible keyboard skills.”<br />\n\n<b>”Sonata No. 55 in A Minor” (Arr. Ólafsson)</b>\n“This piece [by Domenico Cimarosa] wasn’t originally part of the album, but in the studio in one of the breaks, it was a melody that I just kept hearing in my head. So I sat down and transcribed it there and then with the microphone on. I just arranged it in real time and recorded it in real time. It’s a little bit like a Vivaldi sicilienne. It has a gorgeous golden melody.”<br />\n\n<b>”Piano Sonata in B Minor, Hob. XVI:32\"</b>\n“I love this sonata [by Joseph Haydn] because it looks both forwards and backwards. It gazes into the Baroque period with this incredible minuet in the second movement and it foreshadows Beethoven in the ‘Presto’ finale. It appeals to me on so many different levels. Haydn is pushing more and more at the boundaries. It's a small sonata, yes, but it still has a weight to it.”<br />\n\n<b>“Kleine Gigue in G Major, K. 574”</b>\n“Another of Mozart’s totally anachronistic pieces, written on a pilgrimage that he made to Leipzig to visit the grave of Johann Sebastian Bach. It was one of the most difficult periods in Mozart’s life, when everything seemed to be against him. I think he wanted to take refuge from what was happening around him. And he writes this ‘Kleine Gigue’ in just one day in Leipzig. It feels, again, like Stravinsky and Bach, too. It’s so chromatic and just incredible.”<br />\n\n<b>“Piano Sonata No. 16 in C Major, K. 545 ‘Sonata facile’”</b>\n“This is the first Mozart sonata I ever played. Everything in it is somehow perfection, so much so that pianists are afraid to play it. There are relatively few recordings of this piece and hardly any good ones, which took me by surprise. I think it’s because a lot of pianists learn it when they’re seven or eight. I was eight or nine when I learned it. Recording it for this album was the ultimate challenge, coming back to it in adulthood, freeing myself from my preconceptions about Mozart. In the first movement everything is so perfectly proportioned. The second movement is my favourite. It’s music of the most painful searching. And then it ends with this perfect little finale.”<br />\n\n<b>“Adagio in E-Flat Major (Arr. Ólafsson from String Quintet No. 3 in G minor, K. 516”</b>\n“This might be my favourite chamber piece of all time, for any medium, including all of the piano repertoire. Everything about it is unbelievable. It’s a little bit like Mozart’s <i>Symphony No. 40 in G Minor</i>—it speaks to me on the most fundamental level. When I play it in this arrangement, I feel like Mozart composed it for the piano. It has a Schumann-esque lyricism, but it’s also like Schubert in the way that the harmonies simply stop, and we don’t know where we are.”<br />\n\n<b>“‘Larghetto’ from Piano Sonata No. 34 in C Minor”</b>\n“I also added this piece in at the last minute. It’s usually played very differently to the way I play it and the notation is a little bit different, too. But I found in it this kind of icy tranquillity. It’s winter music for me, almost like a meditation.”<br />\n\n<b>“Piano Sonata No. 14 in C Minor, K. 457”</b>\n“This is Mozart’s biggest piano piece—the seed for the 19th-century. It’s inconceivable, for instance, that Beethoven would have composed his <i>Pathétique Sonata</i> without hearing the first movement. Mozart pushes the limits of the instrument, which he often did in the late works. You have these huge dynamic contrasts and incredible experimentation with regards to performance markings in the score. It’s very unlike anything else he wrote for the piano. The second movement is one of Mozart's most expansive in all his keyboard music. The third movement for me is very operatic—the character is so defined. It’s full of apprehension and incredible contrasts. It’s interesting to see what Mozart would have written had he had a more powerful piano because he’s really pushing the limits of what was possible at the time.”<br />\n\n<b>”Adagio in B Minor, K. 540”</b>\n“In many ways, this piece is a kind of string quartet, but I wanted it to be an antithesis to the string quintet arrangement just before it. It’s one of Mozart’s most special works and the way it melts into B major in the last half-minute or so is amazing. It sort of wanders off, but you really don't know why.”<br />\n\n<b>“Ave verum corpus, K. 618 (Trasncr. Liszt for Solo Piano)”</b>\n“In his transcription, Liszt takes the key down a third to B major and it fundamentally changes the piece. It becomes darker and brighter at the same time. It’s one of his best transcriptions because he doesn't try to add too much to it. He's just presenting it in a new medium without adding superficial arpeggios and other effects. He lets the music be exactly what it is. I wanted to end the album with the myth of Mozart—Mozart as seen by Franz Liszt as the greatest of geniuses.”<br /></i>","short":"“I tried to rid myself of my preconceptions about Mozart.”\n"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/61uCT2FhtJuCG4XsCaX0N1"}},{"id":"1575101204","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575101204?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/37/d5/0e/37d50e96-30f3-6dea-8fba-d77a6f2340a0/UGdaacEcRVKAddRbrbp3_AC_TK_Artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdbe93","textColor2":"8bdec0","textColor4":"80c2a5","textColor1":"ecd9a9","bgColor":"53503d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ashland Craft","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/travelin-kind/1575101204","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Travelin' Kind","recordLabel":"Big Loud Records / 50 Egg Records","upc":"193436265874","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Big Loud Records / 50 Egg Records","playParams":{"id":"1575101204","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"There are many young artists carrying the torch for old-school country music, but few do so with the conviction or chops of Ashland Craft. The fiery South Carolina-bred singer-songwriter wears her passion for the genre on her sleeve across her debut album <i>Travelin’ Kind</i>, both in her spirited, often soulful vocal performances and in the detail-rich narratives she crafts in her lyrics. The Jonathan Singleton-produced project eschews modern genre conventions—you won’t hear any drum machines here—in favor of organic, almost rootsy arrangements, marrying Craft’s raspy twang with an appropriately analog sound. As its title suggests, <i>Travelin’ Kind</i> is the work of a wild, rambling spirit, one who, freewheeling nature be damned, should have serious staying power.","short":"A fiery introduction that carries the torch for old-school country music."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4p3L8B0Y6E2L8ZDWXFcHqI"}},{"id":"1573577827","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573577827?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2a/bb/19/2abb1996-acf5-ea81-b702-2cf1aca378da/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2a66f","textColor2":"3babd4","textColor4":"308fb4","textColor1":"f1c97d","bgColor":"061d35","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Night Flight Orchestra","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aeromantic-ii/1573577827","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Aeromantic II","recordLabel":"Nuclear Blast","upc":"0727361573362","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Nuclear Blast","playParams":{"id":"1573577827","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2EruEBw8awLTVzwhSd4yqt"}},{"id":"1578538487","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578538487?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/53/55/d9/5355d9aa-4d89-1a4b-e7c8-9ea49ee56653/8718723178136.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"e6cdcd","textColor2":"ffe7e4","textColor4":"e6b9b8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"840608","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dustin Zahn","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hand-over-control-ep/1578538487","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Hand Over Control -

Opening track “In Deeper” draws you into the world of the album one layer at a time, evoking a sentimental atmosphere with its enveloping blend of electronic beats and effects with piano, vocals, and flute. “We’re in the quicksand, gripping to vices/We could understand, but we’re all divided,” Jo Loewenthal sings, setting the existential, reflective tone for the album. “Why Won’t You Wait” follows, a soft, bare reflection on the fear and challenges associated with long-distance relationships.<br />\nElectronic rhythms may sew this record together, but its most impactful moments come from the soulful, R&B-influenced vocal-focused tracks. Byron Bay singer Angie Hudson guests on “Fire Apartment,” her captivating voice drawing attention through its delicacy. It’s the first of three vocal collabs—Molly Nicholson and Asha Franco feature on “How Long” and final track “Metanoia,” respectively, their vocals adding a mesmerizing tone to each track’s already immersive sound. “Put Down Your Phone” sees Loewenthal asking a partner to focus on the important things. Over an understated, bouncy rhythm, he sings: “Put down your phone for a second so I can have your attention/Put down your phone for one minute so we can have a conversation/I don’t wanna be another mistake that you make when you are running off in another state of mind.”","short":"An introspective third album from the Australian electronic-R&B group."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3JQs8Qu80vtIekyP8JIrDH"}},{"id":"1581205092","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581205092?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/14/19/57/14195782-c4ea-8853-37b6-a8a943445ea6/196292258042.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbd1d7","textColor2":"c3e5e5","textColor4":"acc9cb","textColor1":"eaeff3","bgColor":"515a64","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Alex Campos","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/renovado/1581205092","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Renovado","recordLabel":"MV RECORDS","upc":"196292258042","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Alex Campos","playParams":{"id":"1581205092","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1QYdQ7rrTYVgJxlESi80zC"}},{"id":"1567580664","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567580664?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/24/56/a5/2456a53a-bf13-a83f-496f-082fa6de1c7e/5696.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"33120b","textColor2":"130604","textColor4":"3f170f","textColor1":"030100","bgColor":"f15838","hasP3":false},"artistName":"SUUNS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-witness/1567580664","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"The Witness","recordLabel":"Joyful Noise Recordings","upc":"753936907584","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Joyful Noise Recordings & SUUNS","playParams":{"id":"1567580664","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4UqiUZuZyxnwLQPyJflsjl"}},{"id":"1571802700","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571802700?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9c/12/ab/9c12ab04-8ede-91b1-4a26-faab10d57ccb/20973.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"beae9b","textColor2":"c8b3a6","textColor4":"a08f84","textColor1":"eddac2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Botany","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/portal-orphanage/1571802700","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Portal Orphanage","recordLabel":"Western Vinyl","upc":"617308008920","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Botany & Western Vinyl","playParams":{"id":"1571802700","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3V3IzfeASsfPT5aVxhonh0"}},{"id":"1574879082","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574879082?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b1/c9/a0/b1c9a092-d50d-5086-76d2-896295fd697f/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9c7c2","textColor2":"c4e3d6","textColor4":"a1b9b0","textColor1":"e3f5ec","bgColor":"13111c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Connie Constance","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/prim-propa-ep/1574879082","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Prim & Propa -

It is, by turns, warm, introspective, melancholy, and comforting. “Nocturne 1” radiates serenity like a calm sea lapping at the shore, while chords in “Nocturne 5” combine and clash as if two ominous bells. “Nocturne 7\" hangs in the air, a fleeting dream, “Nocturne 9” evokes a restless mind, and from “Nocturne 11,” Armstrong brings peace, his final chapter allowing the sun to glimmer through the window.","short":"Multilayered music for two pianos, composed entirely after nightfall."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3BIqJlmJo2IQAGuz3h0RQE"}},{"id":"1572353547","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572353547?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c5/5b/2c/c55b2c48-b7bd-8fb4-cc23-473dadd709ad/829619227253.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":4000,"textColor3":"d5be8a","textColor2":"eac69a","textColor4":"cbac85","textColor1":"f6dba0","bgColor":"524733","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Chris Renzema","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/get-out-of-the-way-of-your-own-heart/1572353547","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["CCM","Music","Christian"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Get Out of the Way of Your Own Heart","recordLabel":"Centricity Music","upc":"829619227253","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Centricity Music","playParams":{"id":"1572353547","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3y3U3aqz1O3I9M5ugDAAb4"}},{"id":"1572830715","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572830715?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1517,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d6/b1/4a/d6b14a95-6711-17f9-f96f-f0eb1ee38ff9/4260547941457.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1517,"textColor3":"b69cbd","textColor2":"59b5e3","textColor4":"4796b7","textColor1":"e4bce9","bgColor":"001d0b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/two-tribes-volume-two/1572830715","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Afro-Beat","Music","African","Electronic"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Two Tribes Volume Two","recordLabel":"Agogo Records","upc":"4260547941457","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Agogo Records","playParams":{"id":"1572830715","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PonDOfAzfIAPh9Cp96i7T"}}]}
