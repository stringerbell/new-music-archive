Because I've been in this game for 10 years, man. I felt like this is the year that I really want mine because I sit in the studio by myself with a producer and try to remain a top artist.” <i>Expensive Pain</i> is where Meek Mill's effort pays off.<br />\nLong heralded as one of the most preternaturally talented MCs in rap, Meek is bars-up consistently across <i>Expensive Pain</i>, delivering the kind of endless couplets that people who re-watch Funkmaster Flex freestyles live for. But he’s also expanded his repertoire to include the kind of Auto-Tuned harmonizing (see “On My Soul,” “Love Train,” and “Love Money”) that dominates contemporary hip-hop playlists. Getting there, he admits, was no small task. “Through quarantine, I sat back—even through a big writer's block—just trying to learn melody for months and months until I got confident enough,” he says. “And when I got back into the studio, my confidence just took me in a way where I felt like I could do anything in the booth.”<br />\nWhat he does across <i>Expensive Pain</i> is tell us what life is like for Meek Mill in 2021. “How would you feel?/When you so lit that you can’t tell if the love real,” he asks on Lil Uzi Vert collaboration “Blue Notes 2.” In addition to Vert, he’s called on Lil Baby and Lil Durk, A$AP Ferg, Moneybagg Yo, Kehlani, Brent Faiyaz and maybe most notably London MC Giggs, to help him talk about how being rich and famous isn’t always all it’s cracked up to be. But while “Mo money, mo problems\" is concept as least as old as the Notorious BIG song, Meek also needs us to know that he’s never far from what made him. “I always try to stay close to my hood,” he says. “Not hang in the hood, because I can't, but just to get the feeling and the understanding of never forgetting where I come from and what the people go through, so when I deliver my music, it's still got real feel to it that people can actually feel inside instead of just dance to.”\n","short":"The Philadephia hero’s Championships follow-up has arrived."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3cLQ49Ll3nGRkw3HSSk92K"}},{"id":"1579361847","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579361847?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/a2/d9/d3/a2d9d330-dc46-cef9-cdbb-07e1152c9f5a/21UMGIM68376.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"43352e","textColor2":"502623","textColor4":"6f4c46","textColor1":"180904","bgColor":"eee5d6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-for-sale/1579361847","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Love For Sale","recordLabel":"Columbia Records/Interscope Records","upc":"00602438700677","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Columbia Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment /Interscope Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1579361847","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Tony called me right after <i>Cheek to Cheek</i> came out and had gone No. 1,” Lady Gaga tells Apple Music, explaining the decision to follow up their successful duet album of Great American Songbook covers with an LP devoted solely to the music of Cole Porter. “He said, ‘I want to make this record with you, and it will be all Cole Porter songs,’ and I just thought it was a brilliant idea.” Gaga and Bennett breathe new life into some of Porter’s most timeless classics—“You’re the Top,” “Night and Day,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” and of course the heartbreaking title track.<br />\nGaga takes a solo turn on “Do I Love You,” and as she tells it, Bennett provided her with the confidence to approach the recording booth alone: “Tony gave me the inspiration and permission to hold court in the studio again,” she says. “He reminded me that I am the artist.” But the real magic happens when the two come together. “I know he’s 95 years old, but I see a young boy every time I sing with him,” Gaga dotes. “It makes the experience so freeing to have two souls singing together.”\n","short":"“It makes the experience so freeing to have two souls singing together.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6hBQkPnq5u1BwZncSEDEgs"}},{"id":"1587807899","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587807899?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/95/41/12/954112b3-9b64-ed09-e8f5-11ab39db8987/21UM1IM20132.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"43484a","textColor2":"202120","textColor4":"41494a","textColor1":"211f20","bgColor":"c8e9f2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lil Wayne & Rich The Kid","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trust-fund-babies/1587807899","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Trust Fund Babies","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602438975761","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Young Money Records, Inc.

Will their fanbases ever get to see this live? It’s hard to say. Both MCs are established enough in their own right that it’s unclear what a co-headlining tour would do besides lessen each one’s payout, but as <i>Trust Fund Babies</i> proves, Wayne and Rich have fun together. The pair just seem happy to be around each other, with Wayne sounding particularly inspired across “Feelin’ Like Tunechi,” “Still,” and “Buzzin’.” As far as airspace is concerned, Rich sort of yields to his OG, but the younger MC shines on “Admit It,” doling out hilarious observations like “She fucked me so good that I woke up late.”","short":"Two of rap’s finest braggarts revel in their respective net worths."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2gDny6NDG26azxuTbtNxgq"}},{"id":"1577159552","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577159552?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/0e/83/6f/0e836f03-ca3c-0688-d813-385658d909ca/075679786333.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"0497c7","textColor2":"00abe6","textColor4":"048fbf","textColor1":"00b4f0","bgColor":"182126","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Brandi Carlile","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-these-silent-days/1577159552","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"In These Silent Days","recordLabel":"Low Country Sound/Elektra","upc":"075679786333","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Low Country Sound/Elektra Records release.

It's a question: What did you learn? What did you make of yourself? What did you lose? What happened to you in this time? I want to invite people to reflect, because it's such a pivotal time in human history, and a real spiritual upheaval for so many people in really positive and really negative, complicated ways.”<br />\nCarlile herself was in a deeply retrospective—and stationary—place when she started working on her seventh album. After the resounding success of 2018’s <i>By the Way, I Forgive You</i> (which earned her three Grammys), the folk-rock singer-songwriter and her collaborators Phil and Tim Hanseroth (affectionately known as “the twins”) spent much of the two years following its release on the road, pausing only to record the 2019 debut record from The Highwomen, Carlile’s country supergroup with Maren Morris, Amanda Shires, and Natalie Hemby, and for Carlile to co-produce <i>While I’m Livin’</i>, the comeback album for outlaw country queen Tanya Tucker. The pandemic forced a slowdown in 2020, and that’s when Carlile started writing—the songs that would eventually wind up on <i>In These Silent Days</i>, but also her memoir, <i>Broken Horses</i>.<br />\n“Writing that book gave me this really linear understanding of ‘here's how I started and here's how I am, and these are the things in between that made it so,’ and it was such clarity,” she says. “This was the first time that I knew what I was writing the songs about while I was writing them. I had so much more to pull from, so much more sensory material, than this abstract half-truth.”<br />\n<i>In These Silent Days</i> meets the standard Carlile has set for her own songwriting: Piano-laden power ballads abound, from the sweeping grandeur of album opener “Right on Time” to the Elton John-channeling “Letter to the Past” through to “Sinners, Saints and Fools,” which gives any rock opera climax a run for its money. Fingerpickin’ folk anthems (“Mama Werewolf”), acoustic meditations (“When You’re Wrong”), and straightforward rock (“Broken Horses”) round out the album and recall the intimacy and intensity that have come to define her live shows. It’s both a companion piece to her memoir and a separate musical autobiography: This is how Carlile spent her silent days, and she wouldn’t have had it any other way.<br />\n“I realized how much affirmation I get from strangers—that life-affirming response that you get from an audience when you perform,” she says of her new perspective gleaned from this transformative time. “If everybody could just have a job where they just go to scream and stomp all the time, I think they would probably find themselves a little more well-rounded.”","short":"“I always want to engage the listener in a

Even though I had the title before the book came out, I know to wave the white flag when I’m dealing with an ex-president.” Never at a loss for inspiration, Jourgensen pivoted to the equally dental-themed <i>Moral Hygiene</i>. With a propulsive industrial sound reminiscent of Ministry’s 1992 classic, <i>Psalm 69</i>, the album sees Jourgensen railing against climate-change deniers, anti-vaxxers, and general disinformation—complete with guest appearances from Jello Biafra and Billy Idol guitarist Billy Morrison. Below, he discusses each track.<br />\n<b>“Alert Level”</b>\n“We’re all living on alert right now. From climate change to vaccine conspiracies, it’s getting ridiculous. Especially here in California with the fires. Last summer, it came within a mile and a half of my house—this year we might get hit. I know there’s no quick fix, but we have to at least acknowledge that climate change is a fact. But at least 25 percent of this country won’t do that. So, we have a problem here, as they say in Houston.”<br /> \n<b>“Good Trouble”</b>\n“Congressman John Lewis’ legacy and career is just unbelievable. The fact that he was prescient enough to write his famous letter and make sure that it didn’t get released until after he died—if he wasn’t a hero to me already, then he certainly was at that point. I’m just fingers-crossed that his Voting Rights Act gets through. But it might not, because we’re living under tyranny by the minority—which, maybe, should’ve been the title of this record.”<br /> \n<b>“Sabotage Is Sex”</b>\n“I’m really persnickety about the lyrical content and the message I want to send, but also vocal technique, effects on the vocals, and such. I wasn’t really happy with the vocal I did on this, so I thought, ‘Let’s give Uncle Jello a call.’ I’ve known Jello Biafra for decades, and I know his perspective is very similar to mine on almost everything. Within two days, he sent back ‘Sabotage Is Sex.’ He sounds amazing—in rare, true form, actually—but if you want to know what it’s about, you’ll have to ask him.”<br />\n<b>“Disinformation”</b>\n“This is all about conspiracy theories. Here’s the deal: It starts with education. In many of the Nordic countries right now, they’re already teaching kids how to spot bullshit on the internet—starting in first grade. We don’t have anything near that here. It’s like playing whack-a-mole right now, because social media is not regulated in any way. I think this entire problem could go away if people had to use their real names on the internet. And if you make a statement, you’re on the hook for it. But I doubt that would fly.”<br /> \n<b>“Search and Destroy”</b>\n“When we did this Stooges cover, Iggy was the first person I sent it to. I would not have put it on the record if he didn’t give it a thumbs up. But the whole backstory is that I did the song at a benefit concert for teen suicide run by Dave Navarro and Billy Morrison. I got really stoned before we played and ended up singing the song in half-time. The entire band had to accommodate me, and I was really embarrassed about it. I called Billy the next day to apologize, and he said it was the most awesome version he’d ever heard and that we should record it. So, we did.”<br /> \n<b>“Believe Me”</b>\n“This is just about mistrust—not only in our political figures, but in personal relationships as well. It almost ties in with ‘Disinformation,’ where you really need to listen and process everything that’s being told to you by an individual, even within relationships. Obviously, there’s a Trump element to it because he’s a grifter and his followers believe everything he says—even though he doesn’t give a shit about his followers. He just cares about money and his bottom line. So, it’s basically about being wary of people that you suspect of being grifters.”<br />\n<b>“Broken System”</b>\n“This is number seven on the track list, and it pretty much sums up all the preceding songs on the album. It talks about everything from climate change to corruption to the kleptocracy we live in now. How do we get out of it? I don't have the answers entirely, but I do think there’s still some people who aren’t aware that this is a broken system, and those people need to maybe pay attention. So, it kind of ties everything up with a bow.”<br /> \n<b>“We Shall Resist”</b>\n“This was actually written for a documentary coming up called <i>Haunted Painting</i>. It’s about a painting that was found in a garbage can in Los Angeles, but it’s also basically about how eBay got started. The person who found the painting said it was haunted and sold it. Then it exchanged hands a few times over the years, and the price kept going up. It wound up in some big shot’s collection for $30 million or something. It’s a ridiculous story, but it’s really about the predatorial nature of internet auctions on uneducated people.”<br /> \n<b>“Death Toll”</b>\n“It’s the human toll of the pandemic. We still have all these deniers out there who keep getting proven wrong. It goes back to the tyranny of the minority—these people are stopping mask mandates and vaccine mandates even though we had no problem with vaccines for polio, smallpox, measles, or whooping cough. All the kids had to be vaccinated against this stuff before they went to school, and hardly anyone complained. But now, this is a problem suddenly, so we have all these needless deaths piling up for no good reason.”<br /> \n<b>“TV Song #6” (Right Around the Corner Mix)</b>\n“This song is basically saying that what’s happening in ‘Death Toll’ is not over, even though the media is telling us the pandemic is over. So, I’ve actually set it up for a sequel with our next record, clever little boy that I am.”","short":"“There’s still people who aren’t aware that this is a broken system.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2GV4nMhDaSu4BUshdfQUK5"}},{"id":"1585882380","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585882380?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ab/d4/ea/abd4ea82-e884-44a0-0ca3-cb012167175d/1963620156559_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"332b27","textColor2":"20201f","textColor4":"424140","textColor1":"0d0500","bgColor":"ccc6c6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Justin Morales","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/l%C3%ADricas-de-oro/1585882380","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Líricas De Oro","recordLabel":"Rancho Humilde","upc":"1963620156559","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Rancho Humilde","playParams":{"id":"1585882380","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0gXdxNdLAdxnqITRqOaMYX"}},{"id":"1581856276","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581856276?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/1b/b7/ef/1bb7ef3c-5b00-45fa-f703-c35285414a76/093624879404.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7bab6","textColor2":"d6bdbf","textColor4":"ad9b9e","textColor1":"e3e4dd","bgColor":"0a151b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"JoJo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trying-not-to-think-about-it/1581856276","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"trying not to think about it","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624879404","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1581856276","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3pqGPovRqsz0IYfWsfR5CL"}},{"id":"1582730738","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582730738?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2c/27/18/2c27186a-10e6-8625-6fc3-a6f07cc987b8/21CRGIM27692.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a5a5a5","textColor1":"f3f3f3","bgColor":"181818","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Graeme Revell","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-crow-original-motion-picture-score-deluxe-edition/1582730738","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":40,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"The Crow (Original Motion Picture Score / Deluxe Edition)","recordLabel":"Varèse Sarabande","upc":"00888072285323","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Crowvision, Inc., Under exclusive license to Varèse Sarabande Records, LLC, a Concord company.

In hindsight, it brought me out of my comfort zone.” The result was his self-titled third album, which features “I See You” and “Worse for Me,” both of which he rerecorded in a pared-back style for this Home Session. “I love when you can scale back on the music production, listen to the song raw, and have an even more intense feeling of what the song is about,” he says. “This process just solidified the fact that these are great songs.” Included in those great songs is a cover of Justin Bieber’s “Off My Face,” which Shaw calls “a tribute to my fellow Canadian pop artist I wish I would have written myself. It’s just really beautiful, especially when stripped back.”<br />\nDuring the last year and a half, Shaw realized his value as an artist. “It reminded me why I love music,” he says. “When everyone was in lockdown and things were feeling uncertain, we all turned to the arts for healing and calm. This pandemic was an equalizer, because it wasn’t partial to any group, age, race, religion, or creed. It inspired me to really be introspective and write songs about matters of the heart and themes that are really universal. I experimented with new sounds and new ways of creative writing because I had to.” He took that experimentation even further on his Home Session. “When I recorded ‘I See You,’ my daughter was sleeping next to me in the studio while I was cutting vocals,” says Shaw. “I was singing this song to her, and it’s a message I really want her to remember as she grows up.” “Worse for Me,” he explains, “is one of the few ballads I’ve written and recorded that isn’t necessarily all lovey-dovey and about romance; instead, it's about the heartache that comes with heartbreak. It brought me into a deeper space when I originally recorded it, and I went right back to that place when recording it again.”","short":"“This process just solidified the fact that these are great songs.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1581655253","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581655253?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/3b/0d/29/3b0d294e-0c57-a364-3157-09c4ef395a78/470.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbab5d","textColor2":"f8c54e","textColor4":"cba443","textColor1":"f8cd6e","bgColor":"192019","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Andy Mineo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-land-ii/1581655253","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-17","name":"Never Land II","recordLabel":"Reach Records","upc":"814509014747","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Reach Records/Miner League","playParams":{"id":"1581655253","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YB6qDZLtFID4wyBXvVSbL"}},{"id":"1579790634","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579790634?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ad/39/17/ad3917a8-c2a9-9048-b4fa-37d2d6dcbb10/21UMGIM70936.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6b686","textColor2":"c4bd9a","textColor4":"a39a7e","textColor1":"f0dfa4","bgColor":"1f1110","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Doobie Brothers","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/libert%C3%A9/1579790634","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Liberté","recordLabel":"Island Records","upc":"00602438577873","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 DB Entertainment, LLC, under exclusive license to Island Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1579790634","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2n0oR2fuj2Wzmv6r4LM1tn"}},{"id":"1579363460","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579363460?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c1/15/8d/c1158d0e-b229-4d4f-6e16-1c7a9ac063d8/849320056102.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"d1c1b8","textColor2":"f3e1d6","textColor4":"c9b9b0","textColor1":"fdebe0","bgColor":"231c16","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Asking Alexandria","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/see-whats-on-the-inside/1579363460","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Metal"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"See What’s on the Inside","recordLabel":"Better Noise Music","upc":"849320056102","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Better Noise Music","playParams":{"id":"1579363460","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Sharpening their melodies, the York band lean further into classic hard rock."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/11gvWPhkQyVoYIJgVsojmm"}},{"id":"1573540836","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573540836?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/66/f6/16/66f616fd-bc42-2cd2-a74e-fd00aa1a9d87/850022840579_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7b25a","textColor2":"a0bfd4","textColor4":"869eb2","textColor1":"f1d765","bgColor":"201d2e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Logan Mize","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-prairieville/1573540836","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Welcome to Prairieville","recordLabel":"Big Yellow Dog Music, a division of Big Yellow Dog, LLC.

The project's centerpiece, “Void,” is an invitation to forget about the things that zap the magic from a moment, as the songs around it oscillate between hesitancy and conviction. “I can't decide if I'm in or out of love,” he admits on “Deflect,” a mournful acoustic ballad that chronicles the ways in which a person's indecision can break their own heart long before another.

It’s decidedly lo-fi—not the sort of album that actively invites you in. And yet, like its predecessor—her acclaimed 2018 debut LP, <i>Devotion</i>—this is naturally intimate music, alt-R&B that offers brief meditations on the coming together of both bodies (“Tectonic”) and collaborators (“Hive Mind,” which, in addition to seal-like background effects, features vocals from touring bandmate and South London artist Coby Sey). Working again alongside longtime friend and collaborator Mica Levi, Mastin sounds free here, at ease even as she obfuscates. On “Beating,” as she sings to her partner over a skittering drum machine and a layer of gaseous hiss, she stops for a moment to clear her throat, as if in quiet conversation late at night. “You got me/I got you,” she sings. “We made life/It’s beating.”","short":"On her second LP, the London singer-songwriter brings us even closer."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Uu5MAL65d04IDQ3h1waXy"}},{"id":"1585030627","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585030627?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/9d/86/23/9d8623be-aa5b-e820-58bd-3d03505a410c/4250101428791_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"d1d7db","textColor4":"acb1b3","textColor1":"fcfcfc","bgColor":"181715","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Damiano von Erckert","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/space-diversity-no-limits-ep/1585030627","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Space, Diversity, No Limits -

There are biographical moments, with reflections on traveling, meaningful encounters, and thought-provoking conversations. There are observations on modern life, ancient mythology, gentrification, and tourism. There are wild improvisations taken from frenzied jam sessions, collaborations with artists near and dear to the band, ideas drawn from other creative minds and works, with lyrics that bounce from profound to funny to delightfully absurd. All in all, <i>9</i> feels like a series of musical vignettes, often focused entirely on a single person, thought, memory, or moment. Below, frontman Nick Allbrook talks through each song on the record.<br />\n<b>“Song for Agnes”</b>\n“A tribute to Agnes Martin, with none of her zen delicacy—sorry. Took some lyrics from a letter she wrote to her art dealer which I thought was brilliant. [French artist] Maud Nadal did the ‘frail as people’ bit, which I love. A lot of this album’s lyrics are kind of biographical.”<br />\n<b>“Human Touch”</b>\n“One time a woman was smashing up a car outside my house, begging me to help her steal it. She was wired but kind of sweet in a scary way. Her dog, named Josie, was sitting in the passenger seat being very cute and fluffy. GUM [Jay Watson]’s loop started it all musically.”<br />\n<b>“America’s Cup”</b>\n“1987 was the year Fremantle was televised to the world and gentrification began in earnest. There are still relics of the pre-cup history floating around. It’s also about large, massive champions gathered outside a gym in London, who I thought were funny. The first line is lifted from [Icelandic artist] Ragnar Kjartansson, and the music came from a super fun jam. Hadn’t done that in ages and it was a gas.”<br />\n<b>“Take Me Avalon I’m Young”</b>\n“When I was 17—cue strings—I went to England for my traditional Australian ‘gap year,’ to try and become worldly and feel like you’re bigger and better than your home. I went to Glastonbury, met some hippies and got trippy and slept on Glastonbury Tor. Turns out there’s a lot of wild mythology about that place if you look it up. The song’s about age, decay, changing, and the golden dream of England. I wanted to make a song with the drumbeat like the one that comes in at the end of ‘3 Legs’ by Paul McCartney. [Pond drummer] Ginoli and me did that. [New York-based artist] Jesse Kotansky did some mind-buggering strings on this one, and a couple others on the album. Champion.”<br />\n<b>“Pink Lunettes”</b>\n“This came from another one of Jay’s crusty loops. Mainly him and Ginoli turned it wild and I just looked at my notebook and garbled over the top in a one-take vomit of pretentious art school tripe. It’s a chopped and screwed mosaic of once-coherent material from Leonard Cohen and Richter and Documenta X and some other things.”<br />\n<b>“Czech Locomotive”</b>\n“More biography. Emil Zátopek and his incredible story totally squashed me. I’ve been running a lot recently, and his enormous heart and romantic soul and talent and strength and will killed me dead. The music came from the aforementioned improv sesh.”<br />\n<b>“Rambo”</b>\n“An ode to the ‘unenlightened.’ I had a chat with a translator of very expensive poems who said you can’t make real art unless you’ve read Rimbaud, and I thought that was the most hilarious thing I’d ever heard in my life, and that person thought I was super cool for disagreeing. All very confusing really, but it made me not want to read another book ever again. ‘I should run and hide or die in the generational divide’ seems to be the mantra of the album, like ‘I might go and shack up in Tasmania’ was for [2019 album] <i>Tasmania</i>.”<br />\n<b>“Gold Cup / Plastic Sole”</b>\n“Basically this is about the most well-trodden subject of the year—shit getting fucked-er and fucked-erer. I’m aging, and truths like slave labor producing my favorite slippers are turning every once-frivolous pleasure sour. Seeking solace in nature, Deia, love. There’s a really fantastic chord progression written by [Pond guitarist] Shiny Joe, ameliorated by brilliant twisted piano by [Melbourne artist] Evelyn Ida Morris and Jesse Kotansky strings.”<br />\n<b>“Toast”</b>\n“Another ripper Joe chord progression. His demo was called ‘Toast’ and I think he was imagining warm, slightly burnt bread, but I wrote about the tourists in Broome watching the sunset and seeing the apocalypse and how I could never spend enough time with my love to make said apocalypse feel right.”","short":"The psych-rock band looks around at memories, people, places, and things."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3flX72PpF0OuV53f5HrKoS"}},{"id":"1581131205","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581131205?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9f/fe/72/9ffe726c-09e6-f122-15ec-a796d2042ff4/5060263725961.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3c3b","textColor2":"1e1e1f","textColor4":"464647","textColor1":"111110","bgColor":"e7e8ea","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wiki","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/half-god/1581131205","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Half God","recordLabel":"Wikset Enterprise","upc":"5060263725961","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Wikset Enterprise","playParams":{"id":"1581131205","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1sVKmvl9cQPV2pW1XWTCyR"}},{"id":"1584973428","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584973428?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/36/e8/20/36e82020-3218-0e51-53e7-5436b7ffa133/5056467316791_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"d0d1d1","textColor2":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"a7a8a7","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"1a1c1b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tim Reaper","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/meeting-of-the-minds-vol-7-ep/1584973428","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Jungle/Drum'n'bass","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Meeting of the Minds, Vol. 7 - EP","recordLabel":"Future Retro London","upc":"5056467316791","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Future Retro London","playParams":{"id":"1584973428","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1570535704","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570535704?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c9/57/2d/c9572d7a-f810-bf30-2b4b-f3180a06d9d5/196006635138.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"454344","textColor2":"28282c","textColor4":"46474a","textColor1":"252324","bgColor":"c2c5c4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Hovvdy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/true-love/1570535704","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"True Love","recordLabel":"Grand Jury Music","upc":"196006635138","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Grand Jury Music","playParams":{"id":"1570535704","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1rUuIrTj6F1PHo3v9Vlbl6"}}]}
