He sounds plenty in touch with his vices across the project, but maybe more pertinent is how frequently he volunteers that living fast and chasing women has changed his perspective on the world, expecting nothing in return for his efforts. “You'll hear all type of emotions, and different little stories or renditions throughout this album,” Toliver says. “<i>Life of a Don</i> is just me giving you whatever I can possibly give you for my life in 16 songs, and whatever you take from it is what you take from it.”","short":"Cactus Jack’s most anticipated artist is excited to be doing him."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1588043759","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588043759?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/25/64/b3/2564b343-943a-68b2-4c55-ee2e14464cf0/21UMGIM83128.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2e2e","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"0a0a0a","bgColor":"c0c0c0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Justin Bieber","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/justice-the-complete-edition/1588043759","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Justice (The Complete Edition)","recordLabel":"RBMG/Def Jam","upc":"00602438796380","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Def Jam Recordings, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1588043759","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1582024378","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582024378?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/8b/4d/54/8b4d545d-feee-c91c-992c-cecd16677f6e/093624879381.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"202c28","textColor2":"2c1e13","textColor4":"423931","textColor1":"000e09","bgColor":"9da5a7","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cody Johnson","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/human-the-double-album/1582024378","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Human The Double Album","recordLabel":"CoJo Music/Warner Music Nashville","upc":"093624879381","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 CoJo Music LLC under exclusive license to Warner Music Nashville LLC.","playParams":{"id":"1582024378","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Country singer-songwriter Cody Johnson is especially beloved for his live shows, which pair long set lists with a crack band and rowdy energy. For <i>Human The Double Album</i>, Johnson attempted to recreate the feel of those shows, pulling together 18 tracks and sequencing them as he would a live set. The opening title track shows a newfound vulnerability from Johnson, also evident on “God Bless the Boy (Cori’s Song),” which is dedicated to his young daughter, and “Made a Home,” which he cut for his wife. Other standouts include “Sad Songs and Waltzes,” a Willie Nelson cover on which Nelson himself appears; a cover of Vince Gill’s “Son of a Ramblin’ Man”; and “Cowboy Scale of 1 to 10,” a clever, playful tune reminiscent of Charlie Daniels. Below, Johnson shares insight into several key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Human”</b>\n“It's by Tony Lane and Travis Meadows, two of the most incredible songwriters in the world. And the fact that this song hasn't been cut in country music is baffling to me. But it also kind of speaks to the place that country music is in. I think that certain people would rather sing songs with a certain beat or a certain subject matter to get certain notoriety rather than taking the chance of singing a song that is vulnerable. And I also think that ‘Human’ is a song that you have to have lived in order to sing. I did live that, you know, all the late nights playing, all the highways, all the midnights, all the whiskey—that's what I did.”<br />\n<b>“Sad Songs and Waltzes” (feat. Willie Nelson)</b>\n“I'd been covering that song for quite a long time. We were in San Angelo, Texas, and it was before I could even afford a merch guy—I would play my set, and then I would run out there to the merch booth and sign autographs, and just basically sit there till the club closed, just trying to make any money I could. I got back to the hotel that night, about 3:00 in the morning, like, ‘What am I doing? Am I doing the right thing? I miss my wife. I don't have a normal life.’ I turned on my TV in that little podunk hotel room and it was <i>Austin City Limits</i> on PBS and Willie Nelson was playing. I'm not sure what year it was recorded in, but you could tell he was fresh out of Nashville. He said, ‘I sat down in front of the record man and I played all my songs, and the record man told me, ‘Well, those are good, son, but I hate to tell you sad songs and waltzes ain't selling this year.’ And he said, ‘So I went home and wrote this song.’ And in that moment I felt such encouragement. It gave me a new drive and a new fire, a new set of goals to just be myself and to not compromise and to continue on my path.”<br />\n<b>“God Bless the Boy (Cori’s Song)”</b>\n“There's a certain character of man in that song that I want my daughters to find. I take my girls on dates together. I open the door and I pull their chair out, and I ask them where they want to go and I treat them. I tell them, ‘This is how a man is supposed to treat a woman.’ It's not about the kissing and the hugging. It’s about respect. And it's about lifting that woman up. I want to instill that in them; that way hopefully, by God's grace, I can give a good example of the man that they're supposed to find.”<br />\n<b>“Son of a Ramblin’ Man”</b>\n“When you think about Vince Gill, you think about the many No. 1 hits, and that one just kind of got lost somewhere. It wasn't ever really one of his focal-point songs. I thought, ‘What a great rowdy yet clean song.’ I think it's funny how he says, ‘Ain't a thing in the world I don't love without a woman. I'm going to try to love them all.’ It's just kind of a cocky, Allman Brothers, ZZ Top-ish sound. So me and my band, we started playing it years ago, and it started to take on its own feel.”<br />\n<b>“I Don’t Know a Thing About Love”</b>\n“It’s probably one of my favorite songs on the record, because I've never gotten to let loose like that on a track. I think you get to see a different side of me. You get to hear those soft, intimate moments, and then all of a sudden it's just a scream. I mean, if that song don't make you move back and forth, you need to check your pulse.”<br />\n<b>“Made a Home”</b>\n“People think you get married and there it is. It's not. It's hard work. It's give and take and it's push and pull, and it's a lot of talking and it's a lot of listening. And there's a lot of good moments and bad moments. And I think that song really characterizes it.”<br />\n<b>“Cowboy Scale of 1 to 10”</b>\n“I walk in the door to Trent Willmon’s house, and Trent and David Frazier are sitting there writing. And I said, ‘Well, don't let me bother you guys. I'll go out to the back porch or something.’ They're like, ‘No, we're halfway into this song and we kind of want your take on it. It's called “Cowboy Scale of 1 to 10.”’ And it's this talking, kind of Chris LeDoux, Marty Robbins, Charlie Daniels-type thing. And it's got a little bit of a cocky element to it, but it also has a way of saying, ‘Let's be real, guys. What are you on the scale?’ It's not a ‘you are or you aren't’ kind of thing. It's just where you fall. And I think there's some humor in that.”<br />\n<b>“By Your Grace”</b>\n“You start the project with ‘Human,’ and I'm still learning to be human. And when you end the project, it's just that while we're all still learning to be human, at least for me, it's because of His grace that I have the things in my life that I have. I'm not a perfect man. I fall short every day, whether it's as a husband or as a leader or as a father. I was in a place in 2020 where my job had been taken away from me. I was at home having to address things about myself, and kind of looking in the mirror and wondering, ‘Where do you go from here? What if this is it?’ I'm asking for the courage to make a change, and that kind of courage you're not going to find within yourself a lot of times. A lot of times you have to look to your higher power and say, ‘I need help. I'm just a man.’ But I have to remind myself that we have hope. By your grace, I have hope.”","short":"“I was home, looking in the mirror, wondering, ‘What if this is it?’”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1576618878","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576618878?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/08/f1/6d/08f16d90-6fe6-5375-ed60-3de756544c49/21UMGIM64692.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"42302d","textColor2":"280909","textColor4":"4c312e","textColor1":"1b0708","bgColor":"ddd5c2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"James Blake","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/friends-that-break-your-heart/1576618878","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Friends That Break Your Heart","recordLabel":"Republic Records / Polydor Records","upc":"00602438577828","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc. (A Republic Records / Polydor Records Release)","playParams":{"id":"1576618878","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Fifth records are actually a lot of people’s best records,” James Blake tells Apple Music. “You’ve had all the practice of making albums, taken a few different directions, and by then have usually reached your thirties where you’ve got a bunch of stuff out of your system. So you finally decide to just be yourself. And suddenly, everyone’s thrilled.” <i>Friends That Break Your Heart</i> is Blake’s fifth album. While he’s too coy to personally anoint it his best work, the record does feel invigoratingly apart from the North London-born, Los Angeles-based artist’s first four. There’s the emotional payload of any Blake enterprise, but here he detonates through an earthier and more unguarded sonic arsenal. “It’s the most direct songwriting of anything I’ve done,” he says. “Whether it’s a sad song or an uplifting song, each emotion I’ve gone for is a more raw version of that thing on at least the last two records. I was working stuff out on those records, and I am here, too, but at 32, I’m starting to become more sure of myself in lots of ways. This record is very sure of itself.”<br />\nThe title here suggests a twist on a classic breakup album—a documentation of how we negotiate non-romantic partings. “There doesn’t seem to be a protocol for how to treat someone who’s breaking up with a friend,” he says. “We’re expected to move on pretty quick from deep lifelong friendships. But you can’t make old friends, as they say.” Can the COVID-inspired events of 2020 and 2021 take the blame for the demise of certain relationships? “I think what’s happened partly makes the topic of this album so pertinent,” he says. “We lost some of the parameters that kept friendships together. And it’s been a time for analyzing and reflecting what the qualities in friends that you actually need in your life are—and facing up to your own failings as one. Being an infantilized C-list pop star doesn’t really set you up to be the best friend in the world. But also, when I needed them and help most, I realized that most of those people just didn’t know what to do.”<br />\nBlake has been candid about requiring that help in the past, and fortunately, the various COVID lockdowns proved beneficial to the creation of this record—which had a positive knock-on effect for his mental health. “I realized that I actually have a lot of control over my mental health,” he says. “What the lockdowns did was force me to say, ‘I can actually do this. I can actually block this out, and actually lift myself out of certain things.’ Previously I’d relied on other means. And I think that allows music to flow easier because being present and overcoming mental ill health is good for creativity.” Below, Blake takes us through his beautiful album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Famous Last Words”</b>\n“I don't agonize over tracklisting. I think it's like a DJ set, and a DJ set needs its peaks and troughs and moments of reflection. I spend so long writing the actual song and producing the song, by the time it comes to sequencing the tracklist, I'm like, ‘Oh god, just put it in an order, man.’ This isn't a love song. But it is kind of a love song. It's kind of a breakup song. It's weird. I think it blurs the line between friendship and romance. With friendships, it’s not necessarily that the feelings are romantic, but you can genuinely love someone and it hurt like that.”<br />\n<b>“Life Is Not the Same”</b>\n“You meet some people and they can just have an effect on you. It could be that they just sparkle, and you’ve got no idea why, but you’re doing things differently, or saying different stuff to impress them, and it doesn’t mean you’re weak or easily influenced—well, maybe it means you’re easily influenced a little bit—but it takes a special person to do that. I can take accountability for being willing to bend for someone. Certain people, for example, have taught me that I needed to develop a thicker skin and that I was too ready to give up control to someone else. I clearly needed to have more self-belief, because if I was so easily swayed then maybe I’d miscalculated my own self-worth.”<br />\n<b>“Coming Back” (feat. SZA)</b>\n“I was doing a session with [US artist and songwriter] Starrah, who casually mentioned SZA was going to come by the studio. So I played her a bunch of stuff, she sang over it, and we hit it off straight away. It took a while to figure out how to produce what we landed on, though. Long story short: My production wasn’t hitting. You could hear that SZA and I sounded good together—but I hadn’t figured out how to best support her vocal because it was a song with no chorus. We are used to those structures as a society, so when you start taking apart those structures, you’ve really got to replace it properly. A bit like gluten-free bread. I realized I needed to put a donk on it, essentially. I just had to make it more banger-y. I tried doing the ambient thing, I tried making it really beautiful, and it didn’t work. I have it in my locker, and occasionally that power needs to be drawn upon.”<br />\n<b>“Funeral”</b>\n“This song is all me, done on a very sunny but slightly miserable day. I was thinking about how it feels not to be heard, and to worry that people have given up on you. During lockdown I specifically felt that. It had been many years since I had really popped up and done forward-facing stuff like interviews.”<br />\n<b>“Frozen” (feat. JID & SwaVay)</b>\n“Quite a spooky instrumental, and my vocals come in a little off-kilter, a little creepy. JID and SwaVay kill it over a beat I actually originally wrote for JID. It ended up not really fitting his record, which I found very lucky because secretly I wanted it for myself. It felt a bit like when you set someone up to cancel on you—my favorite feeling. Jameela [Jamil, Blake’s partner and co-producer on the album] suggested putting SwaVay on it because I’d been working with him for a couple of years. Totally right. Good A&R instincts.”<br />\n<b>“I'm So Blessed You're Mine”</b>\n“The album is sort of split between these Frankenstein’s monsters that were very exciting to put together and songs that happened very quickly. This was somewhere in the middle, and I got to work with some of my favorite people on it—Khushi, Dominic Maker, Josh Stadlen, Jameela. I want to get out of the way so we end up with the best piece of music we can make. And maybe have a nice chat about something before we start. There was no chatting back on album one, say, because I had way too much social anxiety.”<br />\n<b>“Foot Forward”</b>\n“Metro Boomin is back! He knows I’m often into his more esoteric stuff so played me this piano sample he’d made on the MPC [music production center] that sounded like it was from the ’70s but had this Metro-y bounce on it. I started improvising in the studio, and I remember seeing him dancing in the booth because it sounded so up. It felt very anthemic. Eventually I turned it into a song with Frank Dukes and Ali Tamposi—another genius who wrote the chorus melody.”<br />\n<b>“Show Me” (feat. Monica Martin)</b>\n“Monica is an incredible singer and incredible person—she’s fucking hilarious, and we’ve become friends. The song felt quite bare without her. It needed someone to step in, and it had to be exactly the right person, otherwise it’s not going to work. Again, Jameela made the suggestion. She came into the studio with Khushi and I, did the take in exactly the way I imagined, and it was glorious. I was just so excited, she was excited, it was a lovely moment.”<br />\n<b>“Say What You Will”</b>\n“Ah, those those dreamy ’60s vibes. This is my favorite song I’ve written in years. It’s the song that carries the most meaning in terms of my overall life. It’s more representative of my headspace as a whole, and I like songs that have a wider commentary baked into them. I was pleased with the reaction to it because I really tried to communicate where I am right now in an authentic way. At this point in my career, it can’t be any other way. The formula to putting a song out has never changed. A good song will out in every single scenario. It needs to resonate with people, or it will disappear. And I know that feeling—I have released songs that for whatever reason have not resonated with people.”<br />\n<b>“Lost Angel Nights”</b>\n“It’s about a lot of things, but primarily it’s about worrying that you’ve missed your shot. And <i>maybe</i> there’s a little bit of finger-pointing in there as well. The way people take your original essence, copy it and move on, really. I’ve been super lucky in my career, but I think there was a time where there was a lot of looking at what the shiny new thing is, doing that, then moving on. You don’t need them anymore. It happens to a lot of people, but you have to contend with being a permanent person, a permanent artist. I want to be here for as long as I can and be as naturalistic and true to myself as I can be, and what other people do doesn’t affect that.”<br />\n<b>“Friends That Break Your Heart”</b>\n“Perhaps weirdly, it was album title first, then this song. I wrote the melody in the car on the way to meet [US songwriter and producer] Rick Nowels. There were a couple of others that we didn’t put onto the record, but this one was just standout right away. It was a really fun process, because he just played the keys and I was left to singer-songwriter duties for once. The line ‘I have haunted many photographs’ is something we can hopefully all relate to—well, hopefully not, actually, because that would be terrible, but I feel like that’s a common feeling.”<br />\n<b>“If I'm Insecure”</b>\n“I like to go out on something either where it’s all harmonies or it just feels huge. This is the latter. It’s an apocalyptic love song—the world is ending, but you’re in love, so it’s all right. Which maybe captures where we are as a society in 2021, so perhaps I’ll come to think of this record as one big externalization of my COVID experience, but that wasn’t the original intention. I make a load of music and then eventually realize, ‘Oh, yes, roughly, it was about this.’”","short":"“This is the most direct songwriting of anything I’ve done.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1579592586","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579592586?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/6a/2f/c9/6a2fc9af-ff72-2872-2d44-fd55d894cc50/194690430633_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8b9b7","textColor2":"f7b071","textColor4":"c68d5b","textColor1":"f9e7e5","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Aaliyah","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-care-4-u/1579592586","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2002-12-10","name":"I Care 4 U","recordLabel":"Blackground Records, LLC","upc":"194690430633","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2002 Blackground Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1579592586","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580902692","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580902692?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ea/a4/db/eaa4dbe1-cb80-3214-7db8-096d419e502c/886449461394.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2c2b2f","textColor2":"313132","textColor4":"505152","textColor1":"040307","bgColor":"cbcfd0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Old Dominion","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/time-tequila-therapy/1580902692","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Time, Tequila & Therapy","recordLabel":"Arista Nashville","upc":"886449461394","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment.

The latter is evident on lead single “I Was on a Boat That Day,” a breezy, beachy kiss-off to a lover who walks away. And on standout “No Hard Feelings,” the group taps into their more vulnerable side, presenting a nuanced look at finding platonic harmony after a difficult breakup. The band wrote and recorded the LP in Asheville, North Carolina, where they spent a stretch of time during the pandemic working at the city’s famed Echo Mountain Recording. “We thought it would be a cool thing to try to get outside of Nashville and make a record somewhere else,” lead vocalist Matthew Ramsey tells Apple Music. “We have all kinds of obligations and responsibilities here, and no matter how much you try to separate yourself from that, when you're in Nashville, that's always going to be there.” Below, the band talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“No Hard Feelings”</b>\nGeoff Sprung (bassist): “I think it's kind of the ideal. We don't always get there, but that is kind of, hopefully, the goal any time any kind of relationship ends.”<br />\n<b>“All I Know About Girls”</b>\nMatthew Ramsey: “That was the last one we wrote, actually, in the whole trip. And at that point we're kind of [running] on fumes, wondering if we're going to have anything, or energy even to do it. And then, of course, Brad [Tursi] walks in with this guitar lick and we're all like, ‘Man, that's super cool.’ I remember we were just sort of kind of joking around on that ‘yeah, baby, now, baby, whatever you want, baby’ part of it. And then you land on the hook: ‘I don't know nothing at all.’ And then it's like, ‘Wow, what a true statement.’”<br />\n<b>“Lonely Side of Town” (feat. Gladys Knight)</b>\nRamsey: “We were standing in the hallway at the studio, because we were in Asheville making this album, and we found out that [Knight] lives there. And we came up with the idea of her singing on it before we realized that she lived right down the street. So we're talking to the studio manager, who knew her, and we were like, ‘Make sure to tell her that we actually are legitimate, we have hits on the radio, and that we've won some awards.’ So they called and she was like, ‘Of course. I don't even need to hear the song. I know these guys. I know their music.’ And we were like, ‘Oh, oh, oh, okay.’”","short":"“We thought it would be a cool thing to try to get outside of Nashville.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1588102955","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588102955?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ad/11/73/ad117314-ac36-9c0b-2d27-56eeda450f50/Fatboy_Slim_-_Everybody_Loves_A_Mixtape_-_Volume_9.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2000,"textColor3":"bcb0a2","textColor2":"dfcabd","textColor4":"b3a297","textColor1":"ebdcca","bgColor":"030000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Fatboy Slim","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everybody-loves-a-mixtape-vol-9-big-beach-boutique/1588102955","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance","Breakbeat"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Everybody Loves A Mixtape, Vol. 9: Big Beach Boutique Revisited (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381817206","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1588102955","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1579600835","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579600835?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/56/67/1c/56671c95-321c-954e-8a0c-9d5c31409253/194690430510_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"373836","textColor2":"36251e","textColor4":"5e504b","textColor1":"050604","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Aaliyah","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ultimate-aaliyah/1579600835","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2005-05-10","name":"Ultimate Aaliyah","recordLabel":"Blackground Records, LLC","upc":"194690430510","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2005 Blackground Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1579600835","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1580064968","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580064968?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a8/33/7a/a8337ad9-5c5d-14ff-8fb3-c88c72076d4e/075679776815.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"9ca9af","textColor2":"cfa465","textColor4":"af8851","textColor1":"b8cedb","bgColor":"2e1501","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Trivium","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-the-court-of-the-dragon/1580064968","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"In The Court Of The Dragon","recordLabel":"Roadrunner Records","upc":"075679776815","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Roadrunner Records","playParams":{"id":"1580064968","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Add this album to your library now."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1588978289","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588978289?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/11/df/3b/11df3b89-5dd5-d6d1-2d2e-6508df5d73a0/5059449050430.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3840,"textColor3":"c6c6c6","textColor2":"c6c6c6","textColor4":"9f9f9f","textColor1":"f6f6f6","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Listening Planet & Mädchen Amick","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/meditation-stories-a-journey-through-water-costa-rica-ep/1588978289","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["New Age","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Meditation Stories: A Journey Through Water (Costa Rica) - EP","recordLabel":"The Listening Planet Foundation & Don‘t Mind Me Foundation","upc":"5059449050430","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 The Listening Planet Foundation & Don‘t Mind Me Foundation","playParams":{"id":"1588978289","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Chill out to the blissful nature sounds of Costa Rican waters in this guided meditation culled from the field recordings of Martyn Stewart.

Bach’s <i>The Art of Fugue</i>, completed largely by 1742, as a dry collection of densely constructed fugues that do little more than prove the composer’s unassailable mastery of counterpoint. Counterpoint was an essential tool for any composer writing liturgical music, as Bach did. “Polyphonic music was often viewed by the church as one of the ways that we can see the logic in the universe—a way to prove the existence of God,” pianist Daniil Trifonov tells Apple Music. But <i>The Art of Fugue</i> is much more than musical posturing. Within it are flashes of the warmth, beauty, and humanity that characterize so much of Bach’s other music. In a rare display of pride, for instance, Bach writes himself into the final fugue, its countersubject based on his initials B – A – C – H (in English notation: B-flat – A – C – B).<br />\nIn <i>BACH: The Art of Life</i>, Trifonov aims to reinforce this human side of J.S. Bach, preluding his performance of <i>The Art of Fugue</i> with music by the composer’s children alongside selections from the <i>Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach</i>—pieces used by J.S. Bach for teaching music in his household—and one of J.S. Bach’s most personal works, the <i>Chaconne</i> for solo violin, arranged here for piano by Brahms. And so <i>Bach: The Art of Life</i> becomes a portrait of Bach’s character—the family man, the husband, the devoted churchgoer. “He had an extraordinary life,” says Trifonov, “which was reflected in his music. The <i>Chaconne</i>, for example, is believed to have been written as a lament after the death of his first wife, Maria Barbara. It’s one of his most emotionally powerful works—you can almost feel the tragedy.” Here, Trifonov takes us through the music on <i>BACH: The Art of Life</i>.<br />\n<b>Sonata No. 5 in A Major, Op. 17, No. 5</b>\n“This piece might have influenced Mozart quite a lot—J.C. Bach was already well-established, whereas Mozart was still in the early stages of his musical career. Although there are only two movements, structurally very different from Mozart, J.C. Bach’s music has a fantastic communicative style and a real sense of light.”<br />\n<b>12 Polonaises, F. 12: No. 8 in E Minor</b>\n“I love all of W.F. Bach’s polonaises. But the polonaise at that time was very different from the polonaise of Chopin’s period. In W.F. Bach’s time, the polonaise was not regarded as dance music but as pieces to be performed and listened to, and so they were a lot more lyrical, although this one is quite melancholy. It might even have had an influence on Chopin—he could well have been aware of this music.”<br />\n<b>2 Clavier-Sonaten, 2 Fantasien und 2 Rondos für Kenner und Liebhaber, Wq. 59: IV. Rondo in C Minor, H. 283</b>\n“C.P.E. was the most innovative of all the Bachs. He tried to push musical language so far that nothing like it had ever been heard before. It was so experimental. In certain ways, this music almost feels like it was composed by a Stravinsky of the 18th century. C.P.E. Bach uses a really creative compositional process in the way he uses short musical elements and plays around with them so much.”<br />\n<b>Variations on ‘Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman’</b>\n“J.C.F. Bach is less known than his brother because he didn’t write so much for keyboard. He wrote this piece later in his life, completing it in 1792—already 42 years after the death of his father. It was a completely different era, and one in which Beethoven was writing the first of his piano concertos. These variations are on a popular tune; other composers also wrote variations on it, including Mozart. J.C.F. Bach’s variations are quite varied in style and include Sicilian and German influences. They’re quite innovative.”<br />\n<b>Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, 1725</b>\n“This collection of music is a peek into the domestic life of a family. The <i>Notebook</i>, used for teaching, is made up of pieces from different periods of Bach’s life, including some that were written by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Some of the pieces are not even titled and many of them are anonymous. I could have included more music from the <i>Notebook</i> by Bach’s sons, but I wanted each piece on this album to have a tonal relationship from one to the next, and also to include pieces by Petzold and Stölzel. Stölzel’s ‘Bist du bei mir’ is an aria from an opera, and it’s quite telling that Bach should have included it in this collection, with its themes of love.”<br />\n<b>5 Studies, Anh.1a/1: V. Chaconne (After Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, BWV 1004 by J.S. Bach, Arr. for Piano)</b>\n“This is one of my favorite Bach transcriptions. There have been wonderful transcriptions of the <i>Chaconne</i> by different composers, from Liszt and Feinberg to Busoni. But this particular transcription, by Brahms, is very close to the original in many ways, because he simply transfers the material from one instrument to the other. Bach allegedly wrote this piece for solo violin after his wife died. I think that’s quite evident in this music—it shows Bach in grief. When I play <i>The Art of Fugue</i> in concert, this is the piece I like to play beforehand to set the scene, as I have done here.”<br />\n<b>The Art of Fugue, BWV 1080</b>\n“<i>The Art of Fugue</i> is quite incredible. It’s a testament to the genius of Bach that, within very strict parameters and rules of polyphony, he was able to create such complex yet such beautiful music. Sometimes, for the sake of complexity, Bach breaks the rules of harmony, but the way he arranges the fugues in this order feels like he’s telling some kind of a story. So, of course there’s the scientific aspect to this music, but there’s also a lot of drama, and a lot of it feels very contemplative. There’s a debate about which instrument <i>The Art of Fugue</i> was written for, but I believe Bach intended it to be played on more than one—his son C.P.E. Bach wrote that composers should compose keyboard pieces that would sound good on more than one instrument, whether harpsichord, piano, or clavichord.”<br />\n<b>Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, Cantata BWV 147: Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring (Transcr. Hess for Piano)</b>\n“Myra Hess’ arrangement of this cantata movement is very beautiful. In the original score to <i>The Art of Fugue</i>, there’s a chorale at the end, but I really like this particular transcription and I wanted to include it. I think it’s one of Bach’s finest works.”","short":"“Bach had an extraordinary life, which was reflected in his music.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580154469","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580154469?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a7/e7/60/a7e76041-4919-5e8d-60d0-fa45bf22ce4f/21UMGIM66207.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"423433","textColor2":"3a1403","textColor4":"614235","textColor1":"130201","bgColor":"fdfdfd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Reba McEntire","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/revived-remixed-revisited/1580154469","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":30,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Revived Remixed Revisited","recordLabel":"MCA Nashville","upc":"00602438632152","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An MCA Nashville Release; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1580154469","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578777962","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578777962?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9a/f1/f4/9af1f46f-65a2-fd9b-a3b0-73a50bf605ab/21UMGIM44469.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdc6bf","textColor2":"f2efe9","textColor4":"c5c2be","textColor1":"fdf4eb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sam Fender","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/seventeen-going-under-deluxe/1578777962","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Seventeen Going Under (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438696437","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records Release; ℗ 2021 Sam Fender, under exclusive licence to Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1578777962","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In spring 2020, Sam Fender had nowhere to go. When the first lockdown descended, an existing health condition required him to isolate and shield inside his home for three months. It was a frustrating turn for a BRIT Award-winning singer-songwriter who’d drawn inspiration for his debut album, 2019’s <i>Hypersonic Missiles</i>, from lives and conversations around him in his home of North Shields on England’s northeast coast. When you can’t go out, you eventually look in, and Fender’s songwriting began to dig through memories of his childhood, analyzing his internal wiring and reflecting on behaviors and insecurities that troubled him. “Writing was therapy before I got therapy,” he tells Apple Music. “That was always my starting point. A lot of things that you pass off as insignificant parts of your life end up becoming very significant parts of your character. Therapy gave me the tools to articulate what was going on in my life as a kid and to understand how that has affected me and why I am the way I am in certain situations.”<br />\nFender has too much empathy for <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> to be entirely introspective, though. The pandemic also exposed the struggles and poverty faced in towns such as North Shields, and his ire at the government’s handling of COVID and Brexit—as well as his dismay at an opposition party that seemed to have abandoned working-class communities—burns through “Aye” and “Long Way Off.” Forthright in message and poetic in delivery, his words are set to a sound that continues to explore Americana and indie rock, funneling everything through big-hearted choruses. “I feel like it is a celebratory record,” he says. “It’s a triumph over adversity. Celebrate the loves and friendships that you have over the journey of your life and celebrate those who aren’t here anymore.” Read on as he talks us through all of the album’s main tracks, plus some of the extra songs on this deluxe edition.<br />\n<b>“Seventeen Going Under”</b>\n“It’s completely autobiographical. When I was 17, my mother was being hounded by the DWP [Department for Work and Pensions]. She had fibromyalgia and she was suffering from other ailments and mental health issues. But she got sent to court three times to prove that she wasn’t fit to work. This is a woman who’s worked for 40 years of her life as a nurse. She’s not a liar and she’s not a benefit cheat. She was a hard-working, fantastic, empathetic, incredible woman. And they dragged her through the mud and made her ill. I saw how the government was treating good, honest working-class people who have fallen on their back. They ripped apart every safety net for people in that position. I was old enough to understand what was going on, but I wasn’t old enough to be able to do anything about it.”<br />\n<b>“Getting Started”</b>\n“I had my outside life as a kid, and then I’d go back home and see my mother in turmoil. ‘Getting Started’ is about a conversation between us, me going like, ‘This is shit, but I need to just be a kid, to go out and live my life. I’ve just turned 18. I want to go out to the pub, to see my mates.’ I needed my escapism. These stories, they’re mine, but that frustration with the DWP—how you’re trapped as a person who’s fallen on a hard time by your government—is a unanimous story for so many millions of people in this country.”<br />\n<b>“Aye”</b>\n“On the first album, I talked about politics as if I knew what I was talking about, but I realized I don’t. This record, I’m like, ‘I don’t know what I’m talking about, but I fucking hate those bastards over there who’ve got the hedge funds—whose taxes I’m paying, who come after my mum, who come after the disabled, who come after all of these people, plunging them into poverty and plunging kids out onto the streets. Yet they’re getting away with that tax-dodging.’”<br />\n<b>“Get You Down”</b>\n“It’s about insecurities, how jealousy and feelings of emasculation and low self-worth can really, really destroy a relationship—and had done with my relationships. The worst thing about it was I could see the way I was acting, and I knew why, but I couldn’t stop it. That’s why I started doing therapy. I was coming back home after being started on by a bunch of lads but not doing anything about it because I was on my own. So I’d punch walls and stuff. I used to do that all the time in my early twenties. It’s toxic behavior. You can’t do that. I’m on a path of self-discovery and trying to heal a lot of that.”<br />\n<b>“Long Way Off”</b>\n“This is about political polarity and how the working classes feel, or how I felt, abandoned by a lot of the left wing. There’s a sect of snooty liberalism in the media world that completely alienates working-class people. Blyth Valley [a constituency a few miles from North Shields] went Tory [in the 2019 general election]; it’s been a Labour seat since its inception. That’s not good, but we’re in a dangerous, dangerous place, politically. It was the arrogance and incompetence of politicians thinking that they could sail through [Brexit]. They’ve fucked the country completely. There should be trials—for the lies, for the deception of a nation. My family members who voted for it voted for it because they thought that they were going to get money for the NHS. They’d seen their mothers pass away in the arms of people who worked for the NHS. They’d seen their family members on wards suffering. And they thought, ‘I’m going to vote for that.’”<br />\n<b>“Spit of You”</b>\n“It’s about my dad. It’s about our inability to communicate about emotions because of the way we were raised. Our inability to have an argument without wanting to kill each other. It’s toxic masculinity at its finest. But it’s also about how much I love him, how I saw him as a son. My grandmother was a really small woman, and when she was dying, she looked like a child. He kissed her. I was reminded that I’m going to be that person one day—saying goodbye to him, potentially with another young kid behind me looking at me thinking the same thing.”<br />\n<b>“Last to Make It Home”</b>\n“At the beginning, I’m talking to the Virgin Mary, a Mary pendant. I’m realizing I need to get ahold of myself. In the second half, Mary becomes personified. She becomes just some girl on Instagram. It’s that like desperate, horrible shit line of ‘Hit the ‘like’/In the hopes I’d coax you out of my derelict fantasy.’ In the hopes that I’d be noticed. It’s really an anthem for losers—because we’ve all been a loser once. I’ve been a loser hundreds of times.”<br />\n<b>“The Leveller”</b>\n“This is about depression and rising out of it. It’s a fighting song. But the leveler is the lockdown itself. It leveled everything.”<br />\n<b>“Mantra”</b>\n“You find yourself in the company of sociopaths in this business. And you sometimes worry that maybe that means you are too. And I don’t think I’m a sociopath. Got too much empathy for that one. I think I’m a vulnerable narcissist at worst. This song’s about figuring out that you can’t pay so much attention to these people who genuinely don’t care about you and they’re only there to bolster themselves. I’ve had low self-esteem for a long time. I’ve always tried to seek validation from people that aren’t actually that nice.”<br />\n<b>“Paradigms”</b>\n“It’s a roundup of all of the things that I’ve thought about in the album. So it’s a self-esteem rock song. People shouldn’t live miserably, they shouldn’t have to. I lost another friend to suicide last year. And I got all of my friends from home, some of them who knew him as well, to sing that last line, ‘No one should feel like this.’ It’s a choir of people from Shields. I think it’s a really powerful moment.”<br />\n<b>“The Dying Light”</b>\n“This is a sequel to ‘Dead Boys’ [2018 track examining male suicide]. It’s in the perspective of somebody who’s actually thinking that they might take their own life. I wanted it to be the triumph over it—in the moment when you decide, ‘No, I’m not going to do this, or I can’t leave those behind.’”<br />\n<b>“Better of Me”</b>\n“This is about somebody you thought you were over coming back in your life. It’s very dramatic. That was because someone came back into my life and it was like, ‘Oh, fuck. I’m not over you at all.’”<br />\n<b>“Pretending That You’re Dead”</b>\n“‘Pretending That You’re Dead’ is about my relationship when I was 16. It’s that feeling when you’re a teenager, when you have that breakup and someone’s cheated on you. You’re so dramatic. Your world comes crashing down after your first relationship.

Inspired by the countryside around her Virginia home, Renée Fleming sets off on her own exploration of human experience through nature, via songs by 19th-century composers Grieg, Fauré, Liszt, and Hahn. Hahn’s “L’heure exquise” expresses a couple’s wonderment at the sight of the moon, while Grieg intertwines feelings of love with the promise of spring. Three beautiful yet alarming songs by modern composing talents Nico Muhly, Kevin Puts, and Caroline Shaw add a modern perspective, reflecting on the fragility of Earth in the face of human activity. Fleming’s rich, sumptuous voice brings tenderness and drama to this absorbing program, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin a versatile and sensitive pianist.","short":"An absorbing study of the human experience through nature."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1586296320","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586296320?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/34/b8/43/34b843cb-4047-d9b7-5c0f-e1cd6e9be965/5060913706098.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"272728","textColor4":"525253","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bored Lord","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-illusion-ep/1586296320","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"The Last Illusion - EP","recordLabel":"T4T LUV NRG","upc":"5060913706098","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 T4T LUV NRG","playParams":{"id":"1586296320","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1577631857","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577631857?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/cf/b1/19/cfb11924-4de7-bade-50d0-e7494468f3ff/196292089622.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccb29f","textColor2":"dbb182","textColor4":"b9916d","textColor1":"f4dac1","bgColor":"30121a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Joshua Ray Walker","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/see-you-next-time/1577631857","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"See You Next Time","recordLabel":"State Fair Records","upc":"196292089622","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 State Fair Records","playParams":{"id":"1577631857","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1573107489","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573107489?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/05/89/77/058977b3-48ed-08fe-030c-06b1e954442e/191404117651.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"2c2c2a","textColor2":"232324","textColor4":"484847","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"dcdcd2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"BADBADNOTGOOD","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/talk-memory/1573107489","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"Talk Memory","recordLabel":"XL Recordings","upc":"191404117651","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 XL Recordings Ltd. / Innovative Leisure","playParams":{"id":"1573107489","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The identity of Toronto fusionists BADBADNOTGOOD has largely been shaped by the company they keep. This is, after all, a group with the stylistic fluidity and instrumental dexterity to bring Ghostface Killah’s ’70s-funk fantasias to life, turn up the heat on Charlotte Day Wilson’s slow-burning R&B ballads, and allow Future Islands’ Samuel T. Herring to channel a past life as a cabaret soul singer. But in contrast to 2016’s star-studded <i>IV</i>, BADBADNOTGOOD’s <i>Talk Memory</i> is conspicuously lacking in vocal features. Rather, the group’s first album in five years is an all-instrumental affair that puts the focus squarely on their most crucial quality: the ever-present tension between compositional sophistication and freaked-out improvisation. That said, <i>Talk Memory</i> still boasts the sort of enviable guest list only BADBADNOTGOOD could assemble. They built a dream team of instrumentalists—including Brazilian composer Arthur Verocai, ambient icon Laraaji, electro-psych voyager Floating Points, and Kendrick Lamar saxophonist Terrace Martin—to infuse their grooves with a cinematic grandeur (and also help fill the space vacated by keyboardist Matty Taveres, who left the band in 2019). But while the album’s lustrous string arrangements and psychedelic harp flourishes speak to the group’s ever-expanding musical vision, <i>Talk Memory</i> is also fueled by a primal energy that’s more conducive to head-banging than chin-stroking—when bassist Chester Hansen activates his fuzz pedal and starts shredding on the colossal nine-minute opener “Signal From the Noise,” BBNG practically resembles a free-jazz Death From Above 1979. “We come from a background of listening to a lot of rock music when we were younger,” Hansen tells Apple Music. “When we started to play our instruments, [saxophonist] Leland [Whitty] was learning Iron Maiden solos, and [drummer] Alex [Sowinski] was playing a bunch of Rush and Led Zeppelin, so it's nice to be able to incorporate some of those elements on this record.” Here, Hansen talks us through his memories of <i>Talk Memory</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Signal From the Noise”</b>\n“In the years of playing shows [after <i>IV</i>], we did a lot of improv stuff, and the intro to this song was a bass interlude we did on stage—I would essentially play stuff that sounded like this. And then when we were writing stuff for this album, we wanted to build it into a full song. So we added the arrangements and the bass solo, and our engineer Nic [Jodoin] made a tape loop that he faded in over the end. We also had some additional production from Floating Points at the very end to make it even more psychedelic.”<br />\n<b>“Unfolding (Momentum 73)”</b>\n“I think the idea behind this title was that the human body is 73% water. And the 'unfolding' part refers to the fact that the main sax part sounds like it's actually unfolding. Leland had the first arpeggio that you hear on sax, and we wanted to build a song around that. We finished the song right before the pandemic, and then, over the last year, we sent it to Laraaji, who's a legendary ambient artist. He has vocal songs but he also plays zither and other instruments, so we thought it'd be a cool twist to get him to play zither on this.”<br />\n<b>“City of Mirrors”</b>\n“A lot of our favorite records have incredible string arrangements on them, but logistically it's sometimes difficult to work them in. We've been really lucky in the past because Leland plays violin and viola, so previously, we'd just record him a hundred times stacked on top of each other to make an orchestral sound. But for this album, we were able to reach out to Arthur Verocai, who's a massive influence on us and a true legend. So we sent him every song and then he sent back all the string arrangements that you hear, which really took everything to the next level.”<br />\n<b>“Beside April”</b>\n“Mahavishnu Orchestra was a big influence on this song. In the past, we haven't really had a lot of songs with riffs like this, so it's cool to be able to include some stuff that has a lot of riffs. It made sense for us to release this as a single before the album came out, because it has a pretty epic energy. Karriem Riggins played on this with us. He came by when we were running through it in the studio, and liked how it sounded. He's obviously an amazing drummer, but for this one, he was like, 'Just give me a snare drum!' So Alex played the drum kit, and then Karriem had a snare drum with brushes and we just set up a mic for him. He was making sounds that I had never heard from just a single drum before. It was really amazing.”<br />\n<b>“Love Proceeding”</b>\n“I was out of town, and Leland and Alex got together and jammed an early version of this. One interesting thing about this album is that it's the first thing we've done with just the three of us, because Matty—our keyboard player and founding member of the band—went his own way a couple years ago, so this is us trying to figure out what we're going to do, and if we can cover all the parts. For this one, Leland played guitar for the first half and then ran over to the sax to play the solo, and we did it like all in one take, which was pretty fun.”<br />\n<b>“Timid, Intimidating”</b>\n“Another difference about this album in general is that we would bring in stuff that we had written individually and take it to the next level with the rest of the group, instead of being there for every part of the writing process all together. I was trying to write songs that had crazy riffs in them, basically. I had a really funny MIDI demo version of this that got deleted, so I had to remember it and teach it to the other guys. And then it turned into what you hear. It was just a really good framework for a couple of solos. It has a Steely Dan vibe now that I hear it—I wasn't really thinking of them at the time, but they're a big influence on us.\"<br />\n<b>“Beside April (Reprise)”</b>\n“Before we had recorded the original version of 'Beside April,' I was visiting my mom and I was playing on her piano and came up with this alternate version of it. We had some extra studio time one day, so I just recorded the piano part and then Verocai did his thing on it.”<br />\n<b>“Talk Meaning”</b>\n“It was one of the last days in the studio and Terrace Martin came by for a couple of hours. We had run into him a lot on the road, but never got to do anything together in the studio. He was very generous with his time. Leland and Alex wrote the main melody and the chords for this, and then we wanted to play it in a jazz context, so we just showed Terrace the melody. This song had the most old-school mic setup: There's maybe a couple mics on the drums, one mic on the bass, and then one mic for both saxophones. So Leland and Terrace were both standing behind a baffle, and they had to move [toward the mic] and back depending on who was taking the lead. Then we added some keyboards and Verocai put an amazing arrangement on it. And for the finishing touch, we sent it to Brandee Younger, who's an amazing harpist, and she really took it to the next level and played a beautiful outro. It's really the most in-depth collaboration on this record.”","short":"The Toronto trio brings a primal rock energy to their jazz-funk fusion."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1567629121","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567629121?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9f/af/e4/9fafe478-3328-918a-f27a-03320d0a7cf4/21UMGIM02108.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cab704","textColor2":"ff9e4f","textColor4":"d07f3f","textColor1":"f7e305","bgColor":"160702","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Emily D'Angelo, das freie orchester Berlin & Jarkko Riihimaki","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/enargeia/1567629121","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Vocal"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-08","name":"enargeia","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948605408","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1567629121","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A very different and highly imaginative debut album from Italian-Canadian mezzo Emily D’Angelo blends ancient and modern to wonderful effect.
