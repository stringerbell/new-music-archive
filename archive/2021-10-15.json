In Coldplay’s case, that means starting every album with an agreed-upon title that dictates the project’s direction, from songwriting to production style to visuals. “It allows us a little bit of discipline in the studio knowing what we're trying to build,” bassist Guy Berryman tells Apple Music. “If you're building a building without any kind of architect's drawings, you would just start piling bricks on top of each other.” This preparation particularly came in handy in the case of a paralyzing global pandemic. Since 2019's <i>Everyday Life</i> was always intended to be stripped-down and introspective, without the customary world tour, the band already had a trove of songs earmarked for a proper larger-than-life affair and a vision for their use. They knew it would be called <i>Music of the Spheres</i> and they knew it would be helmed by Swedish über-producer Max Martin (no relation to frontman Chris), a partnership they kicked the tires on with the <i>Everyday Life</i> track “Orphans.” “He's just so talented and everything just meshed together so well with everybody's personalities in the studio,” Berryman says. “We had thought ahead to playing in big stadiums.”<br />\nLead single “Higher Power” could not have made those blockbuster intentions clearer or been a better showcase for (Max) Martin’s trademark pop sheen. The entire project is so imbued with youthful spirit that five tracks have emojis as titles. “Let Somebody Go” features Selena Gomez, while “My Universe” boasts none other than K-pop phenomenon BTS, who could always use some brains to pick as they learn how to navigate megastardom. “I think they're bigger than us,” Berryman says. “We should have been asking them.” Read on for behind-the-scenes tales of making <i>Music of the Spheres</i>.<br />\n<b>“\uD83E\uDE90”</b>\n“That’s an intro piece called ‘Music of the Spheres.’ We always make albums as a whole, and we started putting interludes and musical sections between songs, almost like palate cleansers.”<br />\n<b>“Higher Power”</b>\n“I think people needed to have something uplifting. We wanted to put out this optimism and positivity into everything on this album. The famous story which is going around about this song is how Chris kind of was tapping out the drum pattern on a bathroom sink, and he recorded it on his phone and then went and wrote the song on top of it.”<br />\n<b>“Humankind”</b>\n“You can sketch ideas out in the studio sometimes, and that was one we were really kind of struggling with before Max took the reins. It didn't sound very fresh; it had a good energy, but was maybe just a little bit too rock for us, and he really gave it more of a modern shine. It could be from just editing the basic song and the song structure or it could be adjusting slightly the rhythm pattern to make it all stick together better.”<br />\n<b>“✨”</b>\n“It's an interlude.”<br />\n<b>“Let Somebody Go” (feat. Selena Gomez)</b>\n“It's just a really lovely ballad. And quite early on we realized it needed a female counterpart to the vocal. And we were very grateful that when we asked Selena to sing on it, she loved the song and was happy to do so. Collaborations in general are something that we've done more of recently. We never really used to do it before. When we were younger, we kind of locked ourselves in a room and felt we had to prove everything ourselves. But I think as time has gone on, it's become more interesting for us to work with other people from different parts of the world, different genres. It just adds color and character to the music.”<br />\n<b>“❤️” (feat. We Are KING and Jacob Collier)</b>\n“We love the way that sound shaped up with all the stacked layers of vocals; it's almost like a modern-sounding gospel song in some ways. Sometimes as a musician, it's my job to step in and say, 'Actually, the best course of action for me is to not play anything at all, because what we created here has a much more unique sound.' You have to take your ego out of the picture and understand that the best job you can do is leave something alone. Because then it allows the other songs around it to sound bigger and fuller.”<br />\n<b>“People of the Pride”</b>\n“We started the song probably over 10 years ago and couldn’t really finish it. Again, this was one which Max really helped shape sonically. The way we had it before, it sounded a little bit old-fashioned, almost like glam rock. What Max managed to do was take the energy and layer in a way which preserved that feel but also made it sound very modern at the same time.”<br />\n<b>“Biutyful”</b>\n“That's quite an interesting song from a production point of view, because it's really kind of pushing the boundary for us in terms of vocal identity. The manipulated voice is almost like an alien character singing this song. Is it Chris' voice? That is highly, highly confidential. Nobody will ever know. It's going to be a big old secret.”<br />\n<b>“\uD83C\uDF0E”</b>\n“It’s an interlude.”<br />\n<b>“My Universe” (feat. BTS)</b>\n“BTS were asked in an interview who they'd like to collaborate with, potentially, and a couple of the guys said they'd love to collaborate with us. A lot of the themes on this album are about bringing people together and taking away divisions and walls and boundaries and all of these human constructs that keep people apart. So we felt like this would be great because it's an unusual collaboration between people who are known to come from a different genre and completely different part of the world.”<br />\n<b>“♾️”</b>\n“That is not an interlude, it’s a longer piece—a collaboration with an old friend of ours who has been on our albums before, Jon Hopkins. He's an unbelievably talented musician, piano player, and arranger. He works in an electronic genre on his own music, so he has the ability to create these very beautiful landscapes in a way that none of us can really do.”<br />\n<b>“Coloratura”</b>\n“Each album can quite easily be defined by the singles you release on the radio, and it's always important to us when we make albums to include many different moods and textures and styles. So it was important to us, as a counterbalance to some of the poppier songs, to have something which was unashamedly long and complicated. It started off with more of a conventional song structure, then Chris came in one day and showed us the arrangement including all these interludes and sections between the parts we were already familiar with; it was a big challenge to piece it all together. Max's involvement on that song was extremely minimal; if he got hands on it, I think it would be chopped up into something a lot shorter, the chorus 10 seconds in.”","short":"“We thought ahead to playing in big stadiums.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1589526929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589526929?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/b7/de/9a/b7de9a4f-9ace-7777-bcdc-47340e7f1daa/886449641352.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d2c2e","textColor2":"121212","textColor4":"373737","textColor1":"060508","bgColor":"c8c8c8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Slimelife Shawty","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/better-living/1589526929","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-13","name":"Better Living","recordLabel":"Alamo","upc":"886449641352","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Alamo Records, LLC/Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1589526929","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1582541991","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582541991?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5f/ff/9a/5fff9a6a-bb13-6507-5e68-2793ef798834/21UMGIM61121.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"f1efdf","textColor4":"c1bfb2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Beatles","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-be-super-deluxe/1582541991","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":57,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"1970-05-08","name":"Let It Be (Super Deluxe)","recordLabel":"UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)","upc":"00602438575947","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"This Compilation ℗ 2021 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)","playParams":{"id":"1582541991","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The dissolution of The Beatles was a famously unpleasant situation: By 1968, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were sometimes working simultaneously in separate studios; only about half of the White Album’s songs featured the full band. Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back”; George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue”; the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was McCartney’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.<br />\nThis Super Deluxe edition features an updated stereo mix of the album as well as a mix in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos—engineered by Giles Martin—for a fully immersive listening experience. Additionally, there are previously unreleased takes (“Get Back,” “One After 909”) and Glyn Johns mixes (“I Me Mine” and “For You Blue”), a recording of “Don’t Let Me Down” from the band’s legendary 1969 rooftop concert on Savile Row, and more.","short":"Their iconic final LP, reissued with rarities—plus a remix in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1585686346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585686346?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/83/77/5b/83775bbf-8f36-f373-6af9-cb7c0bfa2d49/093624879787.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"392d12","textColor2":"030d4f","textColor4":"35304b","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"ffbf38","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mac Miller","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/faces/1585686346","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Faces","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624879787","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 McCormick Family Trust under exclusive license to Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1585686346","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Mac Miller released <i>Watching Movies With the Sound Off</i> in 2013, he'd turned a corner personally and creatively. The bright, chipper style that marked the earlier part of his career pivoted to darker moods. Its follow-up <i>Faces</i>, released the following year, continued down that path, with the Pittsburgh rapper both basking in his growing profile and respect—“did it all without a Drake feature” and “did it all without a Jay feature,” he quips on the triumphant “Here We Go”—and grappling with his mortality. The declaration that he “might die before [he] detox[es]” on “Malibu” is haunting in hindsight, but in the moment, it was precisely that kind of rawness that made him so compelling.<br />\n<i>Faces</i> captures Miller in transition. It's a collage of contrasting realities, a mind as capable of creation as it is annihilation. The woozy anxiety of “Friends” captures the pride of winning with the people who've been there all along and the demons that have been there, too: “My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got/I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks.” Such clever turns of phrase make the project a kind of choose-your-own-adventure odyssey. Do you want to hear Miller as an agile wordsmith and producer fine-tuning the intricacies of his craft, as a blossoming artist defining success on his terms, or as a troubled young adult already beginning to see the writing on the wall? (“I inherited a thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it,” he admits on the spaced-out “San Francisco.” “I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages or what it means to be American.”) All would be true, and all are the bedrock and brilliance of <i>Faces</i>. Miller's generosity and willingness to evolve in front of an audience—a commitment to searching that extended from his beats and lyrics to his lived experiences—remains one of his greatest gifts to the world.","short":"The late rapper’s 2014 mixtape arrives on streaming."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1579352655","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579352655?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/10/75/23/107523a8-f705-f95d-9374-62f0eb24b782/21UMGIM70157.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bcbac3","textColor2":"d1caef","textColor4":"a7a1bf","textColor1":"ece9f4","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"FINNEAS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/optimist/1579352655","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Optimist","recordLabel":"OYOY, Inc., under exclusive license to Interscope Records","upc":"00602438652662","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 OYOY, Inc., under exclusive license to Interscope Records","playParams":{"id":"1579352655","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The thing about FINNEAS’ full-length debut is that it doesn’t feel like a debut at all: As longtime producer and co-writer to his sister, Billie Eilish, he’s had a hand in shaping some of the most popular and influential music of the new century—and winning, in the space of a few years, more Grammys than he could hold at one time. But few producers have successfully made the leap to solo careers—Kanye and Pharrell among them—and fewer still have done it after such a seismic first impression. Marking the first time we’ve really heard the LA native entirely on his own, singing his own songs, <i>Optimist</i> functions as a kind of formal reintroduction. “It’s very hard to prioritize your own music, because it's more excusable to let yourself down than to let other artists down,” he tells Apple Music. “The biggest challenge in making an album for myself is having to actually always look inward and be like, ‘Is this how I want it to sound?’ I'm not trying to please anybody with it except myself.”<br />\nIt opens with the sound of applause and “A Concert Six Months From Now,” a straight-ahead strummer that erupts—briefly, like a controlled explosion—into a lovesick rock anthem that doubles as a tribute to the magic of an evening spent at the Hollywood Bowl. On “The 90s,” he sends a simple but elegant synth-pop tune into a series of festival-ready spasms, suggesting that, in longing for the now distant past (or fretting over a future apocalypse), we’re watching the present pass us by. Both songs have a sense of scale and dramatic timing that checks out for any artist who’s already helped engineer a massive mainstream response or started branching out into scoring films. But like much of <i>Optimist</i>—and Eilish’s <i>Happier Than Ever</i>, which he finished work on months earlier—they’re also ballads at heart, with a natural emphasis on intimacy and quiet. About what you’d expect from a singer-songwriter working in lockdown. “When I listen back to it now,” he says, “I was writing a very introspective album. And I think that’s what a year of sitting at home and thinking will do to you.”<br />\nHe can be angry (“The Kids Are All Dying”) and self-aware (“Happy Now?”), contemplative (“Peaches Etude”) and scared (“Love Is Pain”), capable of channeling the melodic smarts of Chris Martin (“What They’ll Say About Us”) and the ambient dread of Trent Reznor (“Around My Neck”) in the span of a few minutes. Above all, he offers a deep appreciation for living right now, free from the news or spiraling social media feeds. “I think, sometimes, when stuff is finished and sits on a shelf for a while, you look up at it and you’re like, ‘I don’t know how well that’s aging,’” he says of his work. “When I listen, I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, this is how I was feeling and this is how I’ve felt my whole life about certain things.’ I think this album is honest enough that it doesn’t really matter how it ages because it’s how I feel.”","short":"“This is how I was feeling and this is how I’ve felt my whole life.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1587060922","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587060922?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ae/c0/64/aec064da-83cc-4ce9-fcdc-19bd62800109/190296429699.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"6d9eae","textColor2":"9eb9c8","textColor4":"7f95a1","textColor1":"87c5d8","bgColor":"050306","hasP3":false},"artistName":"PinkPantheress","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/to-hell-with-it/1587060922","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"to hell with it","recordLabel":"Parlophone UK","upc":"190296429699","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Under exclusive licence to Parlophone Records Limited, ℗ 2021 PinkPantheress","playParams":{"id":"1587060922","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"With her incisive lyrics and gift for harnessing classic UK garage samples, PinkPantheress very quickly became one of 2021’s breakout stars. Her debut mixtape, <i>to hell with it</i>, is a bite-size collection of moreish pop songs and a small slice of the 20-year-old singer and producer’s creative output over the nine months since her first viral TikTok moment. “I basically put together the songs that I put out this year that I felt were strongest,” she tells Apple Music. “I sat in the studio with my manager and a good friend from home whose ear I trust, and I said, ‘Does this sound cohesive to you? Are the songs in a similar world?’”<br />\nThe world of <i>to hell with it</i> is one of sharp contrasts existing together in perfect balance: sweet, singsong vocals paired with frenetic breakbeats, floor-filler samples through a bedroom pop filter, confessional lyrics about mostly fictionalized experiences, and light, bright production with a solidly emo core. “They’re all vividly sad,” PinkPantheress says of the 10 tracks that made the cut. “I think I've had a tendency, even on a particularly happy beat, to sing the saddest lyrics I can. I paint a picture of the actual scenarios where someone would be sad.” Here, the Bath-born, London-based artist takes us through her mixtape, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Pain”</b>\n“In my early days on TikTok I was creating a song a day. Some of them got a good reception, but ‘Pain’ was the first one where people responded really well and the first one where the sound ended up traveling a little bit. It didn't go crazy, but the sound was being used by 30 people, and that got me quite excited. A lot of people haven’t really heard garage that much before, and I think that for them, the sample [Sweet Female Attitude’s 2000 single ‘Flowers’] is a very palatable way to ease into garage breakbeats, very British-sounding synths, and all those influences.”<br />\n<b>“I must apologise”</b>\n“This track was produced by Oscar Scheller [Rina Sawayama, Ashnikko]. I was trying to stay away from a sample at this point, but there’s something about this beat [from Crystal Waters’ 1991 single ‘Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless)’] which drugged me. When we started writing it, Oscar gave me the idea for one of the melodies and I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this actually is probably going to end up being one of my favorite songs just based off of this great melody that he's just come up with.’”<br />\n<b>“Last valentines”</b>\n“My older cousin introduced me to LINKIN PARK; <i>Hybrid Theory</i> is one of my favorite albums ever. I went through the whole thing thinking, ‘Could I sample any of this?’ and when I listened to ‘Forgotten’ I just thought: ‘This guitar in the back is amazing. I can't believe no one's ever sampled it before!’ I looped it, recorded to it, mixed it, put it out. This was my first track where it took a darker turn, sonically. It really is emo through and through, from the sample to the lyrics.”<br />\n<b>“Passion”</b>\n“To me, a lack of passion is just really not enjoying things like you used to—not having the same fun with your friends, finding things boring. I haven’t experienced depression myself, but I know people that have and I can attempt to draw comparisons of what I see in real life. Like it says in the lyrics, ‘You don’t see the light.’ I think I got a lot more emotional than I needed to get, but I'm still glad that I went there. The instruments are so happy, I feel like there needed to be something to contradict it and make it a bit more three-dimensional.”<br />\n<b>“Just for me”</b>\n“I made this song with [UK artist and producer] Mura Masa. I was sat with him, just going through references, and he started making the loop. I’ve never said this before, but I remember being like, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to be able to write anything good to this,’ and then it just came, after 20 minutes of sitting there wondering what I could do. The line ‘When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me?’ just slipped off the tongue.”<br />\n<b>“Noticed I cried”</b>\n“This is another track with Oscar Scheller and the first song I made without my own production. I held back a lot from working with producers, because I like working by myself, but Oscar is really good, so it ended up just being an easy process. He understood the assignment. I think it’s my favorite song I’ve ever released. It’s the top line, I’m just a big fan of the way it flows. I hope that people like it as much as I do.”<br />\n<b>“Reason”</b>\n“Zach Nahome produced this track. He used to make a lot of garage, drum ’n’ bass, jungle, but his sound is quite different to that nowadays. So this was a bit of a different vibe for him. We made the beat together. I told him what kind of drums I wanted, what kind of sound and space I wanted, and he came up with that. With garage music, I just enjoy the breakbeats of it, the drums. It’s also quintessentially British. We birthed it. I think it’s always nice to go back to your roots.”<br />\n<b>“All my friends know”</b>\n“I wanted to try something a bit different, and there were a few moments with this one where I wasn’t sure if I really liked it or not. After I stopped debating with myself it got a lot easier to enjoy it and I ended up feeling like it could actually be a lot of people’s favorite. The instrumental part of it is really beautiful; both producers—my friends Dill and Kairos—did a good job. It’s sentimental in a musical sense, and it’s sentimental in a personal sense as well.”<br />\n<b>“Nineteen”</b>\n“This is a song that stems from personal experience, and kind of the first time in any of my songs where I’m like, ‘I’m actually speaking the truth here, this actually happened to me.’ Nineteen was a year of confusion, emotional confusion. I didn’t want to do my uni course, I wanted to do music. I didn't want people to laugh at me. I didn't want to tell myself out loud and then have it not happen. Internally, I was very sure and certain that it was going to happen, just because I'm a big believer in manifestation. So 19 was that transition year. Once I'd settled down and started doing what I loved, I felt a lot more comfortable, and actually, a lot more safe.”<br />\n<b>“Break It Off”</b>\n“‘Break It Off’ was, I guess, my breakthrough track. It was the first time my name was being chucked around a fair bit. I fell in love with the original [Adam F’s 1997 single ‘Circles’] and I just wanted to hear what a top line would sound like on the track. So I found the instrumental, played around with it a little bit, and then sang on top. I think it got 100,000 likes on TikTok when I wasn’t really getting likes in that number before.

Brimming with incredible, strong melodies, its journey is fueled by themes of hope and love, thanks, in part, to this album’s title, which came to Moccio early on in its production. “I was looking for a word that would best describe perhaps a knight in shining armor,” Moccio tells Apple Music. “‘Lionheart’ really summed up who I was and where I was in my life. It sort of drove everything and was maybe a subliminal reason why I intentionally went for strong melodies.”<br />\nMoccio doesn’t shy away from themes of loneliness and regret. Yet there is a sense of this album gazing towards a bright future, with its touching musical tribute to Moccio’s daughter as she grows up (“Esmé’s Waltz”) and a beautiful, sweeping portrait of Monet’s garden (“Le Jardin de Monsieur Monet”), its dreamy film-score harmonies full of optimism. “As much as there are still some dark, reflective, introspective pieces on <i>Lionheart</i>,” he explains, “there is still more of a feeling of rebirth and hopefulness. I’m a huge fan of the filmmaker Ken Burns, who once said that it was important to lead your audience into hell and then lead them out. And I took that very seriously. I feel this is my best work. It’s my most focused, intentional, melodic work.” Here, let Moccio guide you through <i>Lionheart</i>, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“My Beloved Twin Flame…”</b>\n“‘My Beloved Twin Flame…’ is like the beginning of a narrative, a little like the track ‘Il Était Une Fois’ that begins <i>Tales of Solace</i>. It brings to mind this romantic notion of someone writing to his lover with a quill. As I was listening to it, the music felt like it should be in a period film, and that it was something that film composer Alexandre Desplat might compose. It’s probably the only track where I concocted its title based on what it sounded like.”<br />\n<b>“Lionheart”</b>\n“‘Lionheart’ has such a strong sensibility to it. I thought it was too strong a melody, too strong a performance, to open the album. I always like to reel people in gently, so I intentionally placed it as the second track. It conjures up determination, courage, and a steadfast belief in something and just going after it. It’s a knight with a sword, not trying to hurt anybody, but trying to do what’s right and righteous. There’s a nobility to it.”<br />\n<b>“Havana 1958”</b>\n“The rhythms I use here made me think of Havana and its vibrant colors, particularly in the Cuban city’s golden age. I came up with 1958 because that year was during the good times before Fidel Castro came into power. The muted piano adds a certain distance to it as well as a Dave Brubeck-esque sexiness. The track also serves as a bit of a palate cleanser after ‘Lionheart.’”<br />\n<b>“Myrtle”</b>\n“The word ‘myrtle’ symbolizes, for me, a lot of different things. I always go out of my way to name at least one piece on my albums after a specific color. <i>Tales of Solace</i> featured a track called ‘Burgundy.’ And because I possess synesthesia [where music can be ‘seen’ by some people as colors], the colors element to my writing is so key. The music here had such a positive vibe—light and hopeful—and it reminded me of the color myrtle. This track was one of the pieces that was done in one take.”<br />\n<b>“Castles in Spain”</b>\n“This track is utopian more than anything—you can't really access it in real life. I've never been to Spain, believe it or not, so this track is a way of saying, ‘I want to go to Spain!’ I actually composed and performed ‘Castles in Spain’ for <i>Tales of Solace</i> but I didn’t feel it was right for <i>Tales</i> because it was too Spanish-sounding—the album was more a reflection of a guy going through a cathartic experience. But it turned out that it was perfect for <i>Lionheart</i>.”<br />\n<b>“Le vent et la jeunesse”</b>\n“I'm heavily influenced by Debussy, Satie, and all those great Impressionist composers. This track felt like I was a little child, like I was feeling the wind on my face and looking through blades of grass as I was laying sideways on a hot summer day. There's an innocence and a lightness to it that cleanses the palate after ‘Castles in Spain,’ which is in a dark minor key. I treat keys like colors, and these two tracks seemed to go well together. I take the sequence of my tracks very seriously.”<br />\n<b>“After Midnight”</b>\n“This is the only abstract piece on the album, I would say. It reflects what it feels like to be lonely with my thoughts at 3 am. There’s an angst to it, tonally, but there’s also reflection, introspection, a bit of darkness, and also hope. It feels to me very much like a Thomas Newman film score. I’m a big fan of Newman because he has this unique talent to combine all textures of emotion in a piece of music, from tension to hope. And sometimes there's a somber side to it, too.”<br />\n<b>“Le Jardin de Monsieur Monet”</b>\n“I have an obsession with books, and I particularly like beautiful coffee table books. During the recording process, I often just pollute my environment with beautiful art books. Visual arts really affect me. Although this piece just came out of my fingers, I had a book of Impressionist art open on a piece about Giverny, Monet’s garden in France. To me, this track is literally a bouquet of flowers. It's just so hopeful—so bright and so vivid. And I’m deeply affected by Impressionist music, by Debussy, Ravel, Satie, and all those French composers of that period.”<br />\n<b>“Esmé's Waltz”</b>\n“Years ago, my first album <i>Exposure</i> [released in 2006] was a dedication to my two children. My daughter's nickname is Esmé, and, as she’s now really becoming a teenager, this is another ode to her. There’s a hopefulness to the music, as I watch her navigate through life, but there are all the traps and the darknesses of life in there, too.”<br />\n<b>“Alice’s Wonderland”</b>\n“There’s a psychedelic element in this track’s harmonic palette, and I felt it was a little like Alice looking up at things in the forest. It has the sensibility of a film score. I’m a big Tim Burton fan and loved his interpretation of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. I also love this piece for how it sounds so different from the rest of the album.”<br />\n<b>“The Past Is Never Gone”</b>\n“If I’ve learned anything, it’s that you need to confront your past head on, which is part of the creed behind <i>Lionheart</i>. If you think that running away is going to solve things, it’s not. This piece also felt like it was the part of a film where the protagonist figures out that they have to be courageous and confront their demons. Life is only about moving forward—that’s the only direction that you can truly see. If you look back too much, you are never going to progress and evolve. But you can’t ignore the past, either.”<br />\n<b>“Agape”</b>\n“Agape is the highest form of love, meaning you’ve sacrificed a lot of yourself. It has a benevolence to it and is in C major, which is the purest key in a lot of ways. It makes me think of all the people I love the most and who have been nothing but kind and patient. It could be my family or my friends. To get to where I am, it’s taken a lot of sacrifice and a lot of patience from the people around me. This piece is like giving something back to those people.”<br />\n<b>“Halston”</b>\n“This track feels like the soundtrack to a European movie, like something by Michel Legrand or Nino Rota. Before <i>Halston</i>, the Netflix series starring Ewan McGregor, came out [in 2021], there was a documentary about [the legendary American fashion designer, real name Roy Halston Frowick] directed by Frédéric Tcheng. Halston designed some beautiful dresses for the most powerful women of the time. He lived life hard: the sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll, everything. And then he eventually sold his name to [US department store chain] JCPenney and lost control of what made him great. His story is a bittersweet tragedy, and I think you can hear that in this piece.”<br />\n<b>“Fireflies”</b>\n“‘Fireflies’ has a beautiful four-chord progression—a sense of uplift and hope. And this is my Ken Burns moment. With ‘Halston’ I kill my audience with the dark piece. And then with ‘Fireflies’ I try to leave them feeling that there is still something right in this world. If you’ve ever seen a field of fireflies, you’ll know how stunning it is. It’s beautiful in how it glows. And this track has that, modally and musically. It’s got a U2-esque, Coldplay-esque influence where it’s kind of classical and kind of pop—but none of those things, either. I’m thinking maybe, being a pop producer, I may eventually write a song to it as well. I really do love this piece of music.”","short":"“I feel this is my most focused, intentional, melodic work.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1582050000","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582050000?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/f0/77/68/f07768cd-706c-9b2c-d594-fd4e630f0993/093624877516.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a7ab8e","textColor2":"cccfbf","textColor4":"a4a699","textColor1":"d0d5b2","bgColor":"050400","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Zac Brown Band","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-comeback/1582050000","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"The Comeback","recordLabel":"Home Grown Music/Warner Music Nashville","upc":"093624877516","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Home Grown Music under exclusive license to Warner Music Nashville LLC","playParams":{"id":"1582050000","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For Zac Brown Band, the title <i>The Comeback</i> has layers of meaning. Sonically, it’s a return to form for the band, who experimented with pop and electronic music on earlier releases like 2015’s <i>Jekyll + Hyde</i> and 2019’s <i>The Owl</i>. It also finds the band, like the rest of the music industry, emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic ready to return to the stage, with tracks that will surely lend themselves to dynamic live shows. Highlights include the anthemic opening track “Slow Burn,” which recalls the arena-ready country rock of the band’s earlier albums, and the playful “Fun Having Fun,” which, as its title suggests, celebrates the small, often silly moments that make life meaningful. Hit single “Same Boat” appears too, with its sentiment of unity and togetherness echoed on the LP’s title track. “This one was definitely more of an intentional one, because we set out to write everything for this,” Brown tells Apple Music. “And when we boiled down all the songs that we'd written, and we left off a good 10 songs that we didn't record on this to try to make that journey, we knew that the best ones would stick out.” Below, Brown shares insight into several key tracks on <i>The Comeback</i>.<br />\n<b>“Slow Burn”</b>\n“I love how that one turned out. I love playing it live. It's definitely a good intro to everything. We put a lot of thought into how to make it a journey going through the album, and it takes you up and brings you back down again, mixing some of the fun and some of the heavy stuff at the right time.”<br />\n<b>“The Comeback”</b>\n“I love this country. And it was hard to see, this last year and a half, what we were painted as, with the media and the great division and the politics and everything. It was hard for me to see that, because that's not the America that I know. I know that there's pockets of our people are suffering, and I'm not making light of that. So the song ‘The Comeback,’ I feel like it's time for people to put their differences aside and see how we're all the same, rather than how we're different.”<br />\n<b>“Same Boat”</b>\n“It's great to get to play it live. And because it's been picking up traction on the radio, people are getting more and more familiar with it. So now it's just when we play the guitar intro, the people know it's there, it's coming. And hearing people singing it back to us is cool.”<br /> \n<b>“Fun Having Fun”</b>\n“I have this redneck buddy that's in North Carolina and he's always drinking beer. At any given time, he's like 10 Bud Lights into his day. And so when I get to spend time with him, hanging out or whatever, sometimes he'd be like, ‘Hey, Zac, it’s fun having fun.’ Then I thought it needs to be a song. And then I just thought of all the dumb crap that I did when I was a kid and what other kids do.”<br />\n<b>“Closer to Heaven” (feat. Gregory Porter)</b>\n“I'm just a massive fan of Gregory Porter. And then, as that song started to have a little bit more of an R&B/soul feel to it, I was like, ‘Man, what if I ask Gregory to sing on it?’ I love that cross-pollination that happens. I think he's going to come out and do some shows with us. He is so good. That first album, ‘Real Good Hands,’ that's an unbelievable record. And I want more people to know about the good stuff.”","short":"“We put a lot of thought into how to make it a journey.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1585729125","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585729125?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d0/d4/a2/d0d4a26c-d441-597c-1dcb-b4e173698f68/194690613104_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"33312f","textColor2":"5d0c29","textColor4":"73344a","textColor1":"0d0908","bgColor":"cbd5cd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Offset Jim","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rich-off-the-pack/1585729125","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Rich Off The Pack","recordLabel":"Play Runners Association / EMPIRE","upc":"194690613104","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Play Runners Association / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1585729125","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1575352102","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575352102?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/22/32/70/223270e0-1b53-5fbb-a9e1-324db0ea5529/886449420520.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c59627","textColor2":"f23c29","textColor4":"c23021","textColor1":"f7bc31","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Judas Priest","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reflections-50-heavy-metal-years-of-music/1575352102","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Reflections - 50 Heavy Metal Years of Music","recordLabel":"Sony Music CG","upc":"886449420520","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment UK Limited","playParams":{"id":"1575352102","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“It’s a bit like going into the Judas Priest museum of metal.” That’s what Priest vocalist Rob Halford says about the band’s career-spanning box set <i>50 Heavy Metal Years of Music</i>. While the massive 42-disc collection includes all of the beloved heavy metal band’s studio and live albums alongside a treasure trove of unreleased material, the stand-alone <i>Reflections</i> compilation, distilled to a lean 16 tracks, avoids the obvious hits to reveal the depth and nuance of Judas Priest’s impressive catalog over the course of five decades and countless cultural shifts and trends. “We wanted to make something really special for our fans that laid out a slightly different perspective of the work we’ve been creating for the last 50 years,” the Metal God tells Apple Music. “The feeling was that we wanted to do something a little bit out of the ordinary. The result is a very special one-off experience.” Below, he details some key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Let Us Prey / Call for the Priest”</b>\n“This is from the [1977] <i>Sin After Sin</i> album, our first endeavor with a big, worldwide label. It's like a rallying cry or a battle cry, if you will. It's calling all the metal forces together and pulling them into focus. Priest’s great journey through the decades is about to proceed. It’s a great opening sequence to prepare you for what's coming next.”<br /> \n<b>“You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise”</b>\n“The [1980] <i>British Steel</i> album has obvious choices like ‘Living After Midnight’ and ‘Breaking the Law.’ As great and as iconic as those tracks are, ‘You Don’t Have to Be Old to Be Wise’ is pretty potent in terms of a message. ‘I grow sick and tired of the same old lies’ is a reference to youth seeing the way forward, but it’s also just a really cool song. In the broad aspect of <i>British Steel</i>, this has a really cool groove that resonates—especially the chorus sequence.”<br /> \n<b>“Fever”</b>\n“This is from [1982’s] <i>Screaming for Vengeance</i>, and the great thing about these particular tracks is that they show you the variety of textures that Priest has always been seeking out. We’re still a band that’s really hard to pin down. We are a heavy metal band, first and foremost, but as far as where we're going to take you, anything can really happen. And that includes going into this very sexy, ethereal type of vibe. ‘Fever’ is an unusual song, especially when it breaks open in the middle section. From my angle, the vocal texture is kind of a seeking moment.”<br /> \n<b>“Eat Me Alive”</b>\n“The lyrics from yours truly came from a drunken night in Ibiza, in the old town, and staggering back to the studio and deciding to do some work—which can either pay off or turn into a car wreck. But the song itself is extremely potent. It’s almost got a kind of comic caricature aspect to it, like <i>Squid Game</i>. And this song has that kind of graphic noir texture, lyrically. But I just love the structure of the song—it’s a relentless, in-your-face piece of music, with quite a complex arrangement.”<br /> \n<b>“All Guns Blazing”</b>\n“The [1990] <i>Painkiller</i> album is special in a lot of ways. We’d just come out of a very difficult time, and yet we were still determined to reinforce that we believed in ourselves musically. We wanted to see if we had the chops to make a relentless, potent heavy metal album, from the first track to the last. And I think ‘All Guns Blazing’ is a statement for the whole record. It’s full of metal ferocity, and it’s really about the attitude of the metal community. It’s a very tough rallying cry for Priest—and for metal.”<br /> \n<b>“Never the Heroes”</b>\n“Throughout Priest's history, there are two parameters: hooks and melodies. We've always understood that having a strong hook in a song is vital. And it's not easy to get them—you have to work at it, even when you’ve been doing this for decades. With the [2018] <i>Firepower</i> album, we felt we wanted to make songs that were an overview of the classic qualities of Priest, and that’s what ‘Never the Heroes’ is about musically. But it’s also got a very deep lyric about the atrocities of war and people that are drawn into that experience.”<br /> \n<b>“Out in the Cold” (Live)</b>\n“Throughout the [1986] <i>Turbo</i> album, we utilized the dreaded guitar synthesizer and put it to its best abilities. We were one of the first bands to have one delivered to us while we were recording out in Marbella, Spain. I remember Glenn [Tipton] was playing around with those notes that open up ‘Out in the Cold’ and I said, ‘That’s the sound.’ It’s such a melancholy, atmospheric song that talks about something we’ve all been through in terms of relationships, where you can’t sleep because you’re wondering where somebody is at night.”<br /> \n<b>“Victim of Changes” (Live at the Agora Theatre, Cleveland, 1978)</b>\n“That was one of the very first songs that Priest put together. I’ve always said that it’s definitive of Priest and definitive of our metal. First, it starts with those dual guitars, which was one of the first times in metal you’d have heard that. Then you’ve got this thundering, relentless riff that kicks in. Then you’ve got the story, the breakdown sequence, and a glorious lead from Glenn. And then the outro is thundering metal riffage. You’ve got all of those layers in one tune. It’s one of our ultimate statements.”<br /> \n<b>“The Green Manalishi (With the Two Pronged Crown)” (Live from Hammersmith, London, 1981)</b>\n“This was a follow-on from the great experience that we had with the Joan Baez song ‘Diamonds and Rust.’ Our label was able to get us traction in American rock radio with that particular track, so we were seeking other chances to cover great pieces of music. We’re all great Fleetwood Mac fans—especially with the late, great Peter Green. There’s a bunch of early Fleetwood Mac songs that were just crying out for a metal attack, and we put our boots all over this one. We recently played this in Kentucky, and Kirk Hammett came out to join us because it’s one of Metallica’s favorites as well.”<br /> \n<b>“Beyond the Realms of Death” (Live at the Mudd Club, New York, 1979)</b>\n“I always love when we have a more textured delivery—whether it's ‘Beyond the Realms of Death’ or ‘Last Rose of Summer’ or any number of those Priest songs where we kind of dial it down a little bit. This song really references the adventure you can have with that type of emotion. It’s a beautiful song, the way it starts so delicately. And then it picks up into those really big grooves before another glorious Tipton lead break. Lyrically, it’s got a strong emotional message with an anti-suicide theme: You’ve had enough, you can’t take anymore, but you’ve got to push beyond the realms of death and stay alive.”","short":"“It’s a bit like going into the Judas Priest museum of metal.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580629266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580629266?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c6/40/0d/c6400dba-8606-6c4c-f6de-b90ac6ebdd6b/196292221756.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"43435e","textColor2":"171d3f","textColor4":"404562","textColor1":"1c1a3a","bgColor":"e2e6ef","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/georgia-blue/1580629266","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Georgia Blue","recordLabel":"Southeastern Records","upc":"196292221756","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Southeastern Records marketed and distributed by Thirty Tigers","playParams":{"id":"1580629266","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1583190969","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1583190969?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/b5/31/ab/b531ab65-2394-c9fd-84c0-a374e3f6950d/4062548029161.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"77b973","textColor2":"6fdc75","textColor4":"5db561","textColor1":"90e28c","bgColor":"171611","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Disclosure","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/disclosure-dj-kicks-dj-mix/1583190969","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Disclosure: DJ - Kicks (DJ Mix)","recordLabel":"!K7 Records","upc":"4062548029161","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 !K7 Music","playParams":{"id":"1583190969","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Disclosure may have made their name as canny pop-dance hybridists on their debut album, but before that, Guy and Howard Lawrence cut their teeth on the house and garage tunes that had circulated in London clubs while they were still children. That classic, four-to-the-floor sound constitutes the essence of the duo’s <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix. Most of the tracks in the set were released between 2019 and 2021, but their selections feel older, channeling the moody chords and silky disco samples of ’90s and 2000s house. (The UK group Slum Science’s hypnotic “Mezmerized,” from 2005, is one of the few relatively vintage cuts here, and it’s a wonderful discovery: a loopy, shuffling descent into tech-house that sounds simply timeless.) After a gentle, ambient opener from the Spanish producer Pépe, the Lawrence brothers dive into dreamy synths with Harry Wolfman’s “LOTF,” a new exclusive; hint at the French touch with the spangled synths of Cleanfield’s “Conflict With Clayton”; and then drop their own exclusive cut “Deep Sea,” a chiming, pulsing groove channeling warehouse-party-at-sunrise vibes. They keep up that blissed-out, heads-down intensity for the majority of the set, dialing up the intensity with the playful “Observer Effect,” another of their own cuts, before closing out with a gently ecstatic slice of ambient jungle from Arfa x Joe.","short":"The Lawrence brothers travel back to their house-music roots."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1583303050","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1583303050?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/21/47/be/2147bee9-b831-cffd-1463-e5e9d114aefe/21UMGIM91838.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"321929","textColor2":"1e0e19","textColor4":"421f35","textColor1":"0a070a","bgColor":"d564a6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-velvet-underground-a-documentary-film-by/1583303050","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"The Velvet Underground: A Documentary Film By Todd Haynes (Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Polydor","upc":"00602438846115","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Republic Records release; This Compilation ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1583303050","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When The Velvet Underground’s first album, <i>The Velvet Underground & Nico</i>, came out in early 1967, it was part of a continuum with Beat poetry, pop art, and French New Wave filmmaking: movements that stripped away myths about expertise and put art in the hands of whoever wanted to make it. The producer and ambient-music pioneer Brian Eno would famously say that, while the band’s debut may not have sold many copies at the time, everyone who bought one went on to start a band themselves. Their attitude and influence traveled beyond music: When Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Todd Haynes first heard it as a freshman in college, he was inspired, too. “I felt like I was entering this zone that that music and that album created, and it was a place I wanted to stay in,” he tells Apple Music. “It made me feel like I could do something myself, and that it could be film. It diminished the difference between the artist and the listener.”<br />\nFor his Apple Original documentary <i>The Velvet Underground</i>, Haynes tells the story of the band through their music and the music that influenced them—from The Diablos and Bo Diddley to La Monte Young’s The Theatre of Eternal Music. But Haynes goes further in contextualizing what made them so unique, exploring the ways in which the band’s inherent queerness distinguished them from other parts of ’60s counterculture, which he thinks has become overlooked as the music’s become canonized over time. “That was more than just a sexual preference,” he says. “That was an attitude and a way of seeing things. It was an aesthetic distinction. I wanted to hear how these people who weren't necessarily gay were going to put that into words themselves.”<br />\nHaynes considers the film a kind of prequel to his 1998 excavation of ’70s glitter-rock <i>Velvet Goldmine</i>. And on its soundtrack—which he curated himself—Haynes brings together songs both definitive (“Venus in Furs”) and lesser-known (“Ocean”), including a blistering, 19-minute live recording of “Sister Ray” and “The Ostrich,” a rare 1964 novelty single that marked the first collaboration between Lou Reed and John Cale, as part of The Primitives. “I just felt it was really important to maintain the context of The Velvets’ music with as many selections of other music around it,” he says. “The biggest surprise is that La Monte Young let us include an excerpt of one of his pieces of music, which I didn't think he would let us do. But it is so important to have it on the record, and to be able to hear it next to a Velvets track.” Here, Haynes shares his thoughts on some of the band's—and soundtrack's—highlights and how they played into constructing the film itself.<br />\n<b>“Venus in Furs”</b>\n“The entire first act of the movie excavates the elements of their sound—the different musical influences that John Cale brought versus Lou Reed, the collecting of the key members of the band almost like in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, with the formation of the foursome before they go down the Yellow Brick Road. When we finally do come around, and the members of the band are in place, John starts to talk about the way the music gets conceptualized: as dream music, or with that line: ‘how to be beautiful, how to be brutal, and how to be elegant.’ That kicks off ‘Venus in Furs,’ and you feel like you've come full circle through that whole trajectory to get to the song.”<br />\n<b>“Heroin”</b>\n“The sound, the quiet passages, the thunderous parts of the chorus, the way it kind of breaks open and then comes back together in its phases: You really feel like you're moving through a narrative experience that's entirely its own. It's like a little Greek drama unto itself that has its own formal integrity to it, and a powerhouse piece of music that tells an incredibly complicated story that is also a story that doesn't have a positive resolution, but a troubling one. But it has a force that's victorious—so many things going on at once.”<br />\n<b>“The Ostrich”</b>\n“It's an essential part of The Velvets’ story. It occupies a sense of volume and violence, but it’s of course the moment where John and Lou are brought together, and basically, almost in the tradition of The Monkees, cast artificially as bandmates based on how they looked. The authenticity and the artifice of that story is so mixed up. But the wild thing about ‘The Ostrich’ is that it's Lou tuning every string of the guitar to the same note, so he could play fiercely and just improvise lyrically over it. But that's exactly what John Cale was doing with the drone music. One is rhythmic and based on rock ’n’ roll, and the other is avant-garde and minimalist and based on duration, but it’s the same idea.”<br />\n<b>“Sister Ray” (Live)</b> \n“It's on their more—as John would say—aggro side of things. But it's just one of the great explosions of hardcore music that preceded punk rock and all other hardcore music. You have to keep remembering how early it was when it came out in 1967—it’s really ahead of its time. But it’s also really raw, it’s witty, it's erotic, it's fierce, it's something else. We use this live version as our foundation in the film. It's really hard because the album cut is insanely brilliant and great, but the live cut is incredible, and it has a kind of energy and a rawness that really allows you to enter into that space.”<br />\n<b>“Foggy Notion”</b>\n“In the ’80s, living in New York City, those two outtakes compilations [1985’s <i>VU</i> and 1986’s <i>Another View</i>] were revelatory. An entire album's worth of unreleased recordings of The Velvet Underground that's just been sitting there—it felt like such rare treasures. And ‘Foggy Notion’ is riveting, engaging, and, yes, lighter than certainly anything on <i>White Light/White Heat</i>. It has more ferocity than anything on the third record that we associate more with Doug Yule and the new sound of The Velvet Underground after John Cale left. I think it's one of Jonathan Richman's personal favorites of the band, and it was played regularly in concert.”<br />\n<b>“Ocean”</b>\n“It’s just a beautiful, gorgeous piece of music. You feel like time is passing within that song, the way it might in an ocean or in a body of water that has its own sort of timelessness and darkness. And we also braid three versions of ‘Ocean’ together in the film: an album cut, a demo, two different demos. One that's just a solo demo of Lou Reed performing it on acoustic guitar. That's how we end our version of it in the film that's incredibly haunting and the final strains of it are so exposed and resonant.”<br />\n<b>“Sweet Jane”</b>\n“As a rock ’n’ roll standard, 'Sweet Jane’ has more resonance than really almost anything they composed under the banner of The Velvet Underground. It's infectious, it's celebratory, it’s also describing a kind of post-counterculture. The couple in ‘Sweet Jane’ are trying to figure out how to have a marriage. They used to be hippies, but they're moving forward out of that era into a transitional period that's going to be post-1960s. It has a sort of retrospective quality about it, but it's really forward-looking. 'Where do we go from here?' is what it is, and that's exactly what Lou Reed is talking about at the very end of The Velvets, as he’s about depart into a solo career.”<br />\n<b>“Pale Blue Eyes”</b> \n“It's so simple, it's so contained and controlled and minimal. It's the way Neil Young's early classics like <i>After the Gold Rush</i> and <i>Harvest</i> are never overproduced—he never does more drum rolls than needed. There's a spareness that takes real confidence. But it’s also a song weirdly that Lou wrote before the first Velvet Underground record—and there's early demos of him doing it with John Cale in demo version. There's some contention about who he wrote the song about. I think his girlfriend Shelley—who appears in the movie—has claimed that it's about her, even though she doesn't have blue eyes. But it occupies a unique sort of blurry historical place in the trajectory of the band, and this version is so perfect, part of that whole reduced soundscape that's true to the whole third record.”","short":"Director Todd Haynes takes us inside the soundtrack he curated

Hurd makes good on that three-year absence, delivering an LP that plays to the strengths shown on that early single: sultry lyrics heavy on wordplay, radio-ready hooks, and vocals that land somewhere between a soulful rasp and a poppy twang. Opening track “Pass It On” is a laidback ode to sharing life’s kindnesses, big or small, originally written for Hurd’s wife, Maren Morris. Morris joins him on “Chasing After You,” a smoldering ballad about the kind of love you just can’t quit. “You dream about this moment your entire life,” Hurd tells Apple Music. “This is the only job I’ve ever wanted since I was 11 years old. So, thinking about somebody who’s listening to my debut album, I hope it’s something that they can listen to from top to bottom and find something that they can see themselves in.” Below, Hurd walks Apple Music through several key tracks on<i>Pelago</i>.<br />\n<b>“Pass It On”</b>\n“‘Pass It On’ is a song that I wrote with Maren and Hardy and Jordan Schmidt. Originally, we were aiming for Maren’s album, and as we were writing it, we all kind of figured out that it sounds like a guy should be singing this song. It’s unabashedly positive, and I think the message is something that will be very welcomed by people in the times that we live in. And I just think the song is really fun and great, and I love that Ilya Toshinsky is in the first moment you hear, asking, ‘How country do you wanna go?’ It just feels like it fits.”<br />\n<b>“Chasing After You” (feat. Maren Morris)</b>\n“I think the only reason that we get to do a full-length album is because of ‘Chasing After You’ and the success that it’s had. You always hope that a song that you put out is a hit, but to see it actually happen is really incredible. And getting to work with Maren—I knew that having her be a part of this song in an official capacity, that’s a big ask of any artist, and especially one whose career you very much need to continue going in the right direction. It wasn’t something that I did lightly, and I don’t take for granted how special that is having her being a part of it. I’m more relieved, I guess, that she’s on it and it wasn’t a massive flop.”<br />\n<b>“June, July, August”</b>\n“I feel like, especially in the Eastern part of the country, spring break or spending a week at the beach is very common, no matter where you live. I grew up on the water in Michigan, and I grew up going to Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with my family. It was such a huge part of my life, and it still is, but this sort of feel-good nautical theme that I have running through this whole album is just something that felt really natural for me. And not wanting summer to be over—the older I get, the harder it is every single year to say goodbye to it.”<br />\n<b>“Tab With My Name on It”</b>\n“I feel like it is a very cinematic version of a song that’s been written a lot in Nashville. I think that just seeing the range of emotions that one person can go through missing somebody, even in one night, I loved being specific with that. And I loved seeing this person come in and out of hope. It’s not something I see myself in as much as you might think. That song has a huge string section attached to it, and I just felt it added to the cinematic quality of the song and really made it hammer home what we were trying to get across emotionally.”<br />\n<b>“Hell Is an Island”</b>\n“That’s Maren’s favorite song on the album. I love titles that sort of explain the whole thing. ‘Hell is an island without you’—I mean, that’s just a poem in itself. I think that even in the most beautiful place in the world, if you’re not there with the right person, it doesn’t matter.”<br />\n<b>“I Never Said I’m Sorry”</b>\n“It really is, I think, a special emotion to say, ‘I don’t regret moving on, but I regret the way I did it.’ And I’ve had that emotion a handful of times, whether in my personal life or professional life. And I’ve had to go back to people and say, ‘I’m sorry that I did that.’ Not ‘sorry if I hurt you’ kind of shit; it’s, ‘No, I’m really sorry that I did that to you.’ To me, the songs that go together the best on the whole album are ‘Pass It On’ and ‘I Never Said I'm Sorry,’ because I think those are extremely human emotions that we don’t talk about enough: being unabashedly positive not just for its own sake, and then actually apologizing to people.”<br />\n<b>“To a T”</b>\n“I imagine this album to be tracks one through 11. So, it starts with ‘Pass It On’ and it ends with ‘I Never Said I'm Sorry.’ But the cool part about releasing music right now is, digitally, it can be whatever the hell you want it to be. And so, putting it out on the streaming version or the digital version, I feel like if you listen to this album top to bottom, and if you’ve never heard of Ryan Hurd, it’s a really great representation. Then, if you get into the extra songs that are a little bit older, you get some context as far as who I am and where I’ve come from and my entire musical journey. So, ‘To a T’ was my first-ever gold single. And that was my only goal when I signed a record deal. Looking back on that song, it’s such a huge part of my journey, and it got me to ‘Chasing After You,’ which got me into <i>Pelago</i>. So, I don’t think you can tell my story without including that song.”","short":"“This is the only job I’ve ever wanted since I was 11 years old.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1585447941","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585447941?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a8/11/e7/a811e765-d409-53d0-b95d-9c194e50f2c4/21UM1IM09398.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ae9d54","textColor2":"cdb361","textColor4":"a59154","textColor1":"d9c161","bgColor":"020d1f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pok%C3%A9mon-25-the-album/1585447941","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Pokémon 25: The Album","recordLabel":"Capitol Records","upc":"00602438662135","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Capitol Records;

performed entirely by the Austrian cellist, down to the percussion. Multi-tracked until Soltani creates an orchestra of cellos, the music here is by some of today’s leading film composers, including Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore, and John Powell. The range of sounds and textures that Soltani conjures up is remarkable and there’s an impressive sense of atmosphere. The <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> and <i>Lord of the Rings</i> suites are thrilling, while the music from <i>Perfume</i>—by Tom Tykwer, Reinhold Heil, and Johnny Klimek—is beautifully done. Soltani’s own two pieces, “Intermezzo: A Scene from the Past” and “Cello Unlimited,” ooze confidence.","short":"The cellist celebrates his passion for the movies on this remarkable album."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1587688456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587688456?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/86/a0/e7/86a0e750-9881-23cf-0bbb-72509715a154/093624876588.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"9ba5b1","textColor2":"acc2df","textColor4":"8b9cb3","textColor1":"c1cddc","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Troy Cartwright","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/halfway-to-houston-ep/1587688456","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Halfway To Houston - EP","recordLabel":"Warner Music Nashville","upc":"093624876588","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2020, 2021 Warner Music Nashville LLC","playParams":{"id":"1587688456","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1588292150","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588292150?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/52/b2/02/52b20229-1539-00da-930a-acc61acf6fce/21UM1IM21504.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"be76a9","textColor2":"dc7dd1","textColor4":"b564a7","textColor1":"e794d4","bgColor":"1a0000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Karma's World","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/karmas-world/1588292150","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Karma’s World","recordLabel":"Def Jam Recordings","upc":"00602438991631","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Karma’s World, LLC, under exclusive license to UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1588292150","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1577450329","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577450329?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/76/f0/d0/76f0d0db-ca71-5636-acee-5489a9c9af3e/21CRGIM27427.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a5adb5","textColor2":"afbac6","textColor4":"8f97a2","textColor1":"cbd6de","bgColor":"0d0c11","hasP3":false},"artistName":"ICE NINE KILLS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-horrorwood-the-silver-scream-2/1577450329","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Welcome To Horrorwood: The Silver Scream 2","recordLabel":"Fearless Records","upc":"00888072261860","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Fearless Records, Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1577450329","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1572808859","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572808859?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/95/49/57/954957a3-5757-5ce1-5e64-9ca4f51dabd8/887828048267.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"513132","textColor2":"0b2648","textColor4":"3a403f","textColor1":"281237","bgColor":"f5aa1d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Hayden Thorpe","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moondust-for-my-diamond/1572808859","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"Moondust for My Diamond","recordLabel":"Domino Recording Co","upc":"887828048267","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Domino Recording Co Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1572808859","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"As he was writing his second solo album, Hayden Thorpe began organizing what he called “salons,” a series of hybrid shows in which the former Wild Beasts frontman would improvise on piano and vocals, in the midst of a gong bath or breath workshop, his audience on their backs. “That was a really powerful experience to sing and play to people in rhythm to their response, their bodies, and their kind of surrender,” he tells Apple Music. “Everyone’s improvising—the breath practitioners and the people on the floor, too. Everyone’s like, ‘I don’t know where this is going.’ The main message of the record is to give yourself permission, to explore what real can be, to allow for the wonder of this.”<br />\nIt is, “if we’re being old-fashioned about it,” Thorpe says, a foray into “aspects of hippiedom” and the outright mystical. But <i>Moondust for My Diamond</i> is also a deep, synth-driven exploration of the ways in which we self-mythologize, crafting the story of who we are through a loose patchwork of ancient and modern signifiers—“a bit of that yoga, a bit of that rock ’n’ roll, a bit of that God-fearing sort of Catholic stuff,” he says. Though it was written mostly pre-pandemic, it was finished in Thorpe’s boyhood home, in the mountains of Northern England’s Lake District. “It’s made up of a lot of the stranger, more experimental aspects of my life over the past couple of years,” he says, “as I was dabbling in unknown practices. I had a rugged Northern upbringing, and for me, bringing in aspects of Eastern mysticism made me realize, ‘You know, maybe I don’t have to tell the story of myself quite in the same way that I thought I had.’ It feels like an adventure.” Here, Thorpe guides us through the entire album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Material World”</b>\n“A song that I’m really proud of because it was a grand experiment. I didn’t chase it down. We live under the culture of control where we deem ourselves the architects of whatever we want, and I didn’t want for that song. I went forth in faith that it would turn up for me, and in doing so, the words came. I had to be alert and together enough to allow them to come. One day, I just spat it out, that line: ‘It’s only real if I make it.’”<br />\n<b>“The Universe Is Always Right”</b>\n“It’s a slogan song, which is kind of interesting because my greatest hero is Leonard Cohen, and he despised slogan songs. He criticized Lennon and ‘Give Peace a Chance’-type songs as being cheap and derivative of marketing music. I thought it was a bit dirty for me, but I was also interested in what a slogan is: a spell. And a spell is a spelling, an arrangement or alignment of letters and words that creates an emotional response. So, it kind of felt like casting a spell, that chord together with those words.”<br />\n<b>“No Such Thing”</b>\n“The spoken-word aspect, it’s kind of like a pepper-and-salt situation. Clearly, my singing voice is kind of a committed one. And some words you disguise by singing—the singing gives them too much thrust, and actually, the purity and the beauty is in the words themselves rather than the delivery. There’s only so much of myself I can tolerate, and I probably found myself more tolerable in that moment. But a lot of craft, really, as a lifelong pursuit, is really removing all the performance and kind of doing more with less.”<br />\n<b>“Parallel Kingdom”</b>\n“I think those salon gigs were definitely a prologue to the record. Some of the language is inferred in the record and the line in ‘Parallel Kingdom,’ when I sing, ’Allow for the wonder of this,’ came straight out of that. It’s to say, ‘Just let it come to be.’”<br />\n<b>“Golden Ratio”</b> \n“A golden ratio is kind of a mathematical phenomenon, like a Fibonacci sequence, a shell, an arrangement of sunflower seeds. It’s a perfect equation where one thing fits within another. It explains the symmetry of the universe, from the smallest subjects to the grandest. My operatic moment here is that science is a grander force that we can live by, that will rescue our souls. Because it has revealed to us the miraculous—the miracle that we are.”<br />\n<b>“Metafeeling”</b> \n“It’s the feeling you feel about what you’re feeling. I think we live in a society that leaves us stranded within our own emotions, because we’ve become beholden to them. In an individualistic society, you must hold your own emotions to be so crucially important, because all you have is yourself. But really, they’re just kind of passing weather systems. Through various lifelong ways of dissolving that relationship to my own emotions, I kind of realized maybe it wasn’t all that bad or wasn’t that serious. So, it’s a song about surrender, to say, ‘I don’t know what I think, and I don’t know everything anymore. Maybe I don’t have to.’”<br />\n<b>“Supersensual”</b> \n“I like the line ‘808 upon my chakra.’ That, to me, summed up a lot of the record and came about from watching an interview Letterman did with Kanye, who spoke about the resonance of the 808 kick drum stimulating the sacral chakra—the sex chakra—and the hyper masculinity of hip-hop and R&B kind of hitting your sex organs simultaneously. It was a real enlightening moment for me. I just thought it was absolutely incredible, this meeting of the kind of corporate end of the music business with Eastern mysticism with, in my opinion, a visionary maker. I think that mysticism is entering our daily psyche—and we are more beholden to it than we dare realize or allow ourselves to believe.”<br />\n<b>“Hotel November Tango”</b> \n“Hotel November Tango is HNT—Hayden Norman Thorpe. It’s a song I wrote to myself about myself. In some respects, incredibly indulgent. But the point being, we’re all alone in ourselves. We were born into this body, and we somehow have to make it work. And we get it wrong until we get it right. It’s a lifelong quest to get out of ourselves, to get out of our heads. That’s maybe a big part of desire and a big part of the miracle of sexuality, which, in ways, is the grand releaser of our own skin. To kind of become another, and for another to become us.”<br />\n<b>“Rational Heartache”</b> \n“It’s coming from the fact that we medicalize sadness in our society. We deem it to be an un-useful state of being. So, we drug it, we ostracize it, we stigmatize it. And in doing so, we lose its value. That’s not to say that I disagree with forms of therapy and antidepressants. I don’t—I’ve been there, they work. But it’s to say, ‘Hey, maybe I feel like shit and it’s a really rational way to feel.’ We deem sadness as an experience of madness, and maybe it is. But I wanted this to be, in a strange way, a kind of Happy Mondays tune, imagining myself just grabbing the maracas and dancing the shit out of it until I felt better.”<br />\n<b>“Spherical Time II”</b> \n“I think the record needed a breath—just to allow that last section to happen. It’s a kind of look beneath the hood of the record—it’s accidental music. Because you’re on such a mission when you’re making records, you pass through many spaces that are actually of real value and really beautiful work.”<br />\n<b>“Suspended Animation”</b>\n“I think it started from that line, ‘Now that I got what I was asking for, I don’t want it so much anymore.’ It’s the lived experience of having won, having lived some dreams, and having achieved certain things—and not getting the transformation that I expected. I think we kind of associate success with virtue now, don’t we? Certainly, success in relationships, success in jobs and careers. But success doesn’t necessarily mean virtue. Success just means, literally, a succession of fortuitous events. I realized that when I didn’t quite go through the kind of awakenings I expected, it’s just like, ‘Oh man, no, that didn’t fix anything. That was just a different time.’”<br />\n<b>“Runaway World”</b> \n“I would say it was a buzz when ‘LMAO’ came to my lips. That song was the only one that was written in lockdown, as it was the only one that wasn’t finished before the world changed. I guess it was kind of a beautiful moment: The cosmic joke has happened and the end of the world we’d all been preparing for was happening. Those of us who are occupying an inner landscape and make work out of it and kind of have to deal with ourselves a lot in that space were like, ‘Oh yeah, man, I’m ready for this. I’ve got the survival pack. Let’s go.’ But I ended up back in the bedroom that I grew up in as a boy, back in the town I grew up in. We all had various tricks played on us, and that was the one played on me.”","short":"“It feels like an adventure.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578012319","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578012319?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5d/5c/4a/5d5c4a6b-b624-180b-5a14-415f74f8c9de/21UMGIM62547.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"35332f","textColor2":"202829","textColor4":"454b46","textColor1":"0c0b0d","bgColor":"d8d4b7","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mac Powell","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-creation/1578012319","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-15","name":"New Creation","recordLabel":"Sparrow (SPR)","upc":"00602438088423","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Sparrow Records;

From there, the duo decamped to locked-down London and got to work on their fourth album. Titled <i>Sticky</i>, it’s a record that pairs the feeling of triumph from the UK Top 5 success of their third album, 2019’s <i>End of Suffering</i>, with a punky defiance, offering up snapshots of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic, and mid-pandemic Britain in the form of anthemic, rattling rock. “I was constantly writing about energy and everything that was lost,” says Carter. “I always wanted it to be more of a celebratory album rather than a lockdown album. That was the most fun part: figuring out what I wanted to talk about that I was really fucking excited about getting back in my life—essentially all the ways that you can get sticky.”<br />\nMaking a record while the world was at a standstill had an effect in other ways. It’s Carter and Richardson’s most collaborative effort, featuring guest appearances from Primal Scream’s Bobby Gillespie, IDLES’ Joe Talbot, experimental pop artist Lynks, and Essex rocker Cassyette. “We saw the opportunity to be like, ‘If we call people now, they won’t be on tour, they’re at home,’” says Richardson. “I produced the record, so we had the ability to stay late and get someone down. We had no restrictions.” Let the duo take you through the world of <i>Sticky</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Sticky”</b>\nFrank Carter: “This is about me doing this slow transition from the countryside to Hoxton, London, in the middle of a pandemic. Moving further away from my family but closer to my work—and moving into the belly of the beast at a time when there was no one else around. The song takes a pretty brutal look at who I was when everything was taken away from me, just kicking around with too much time on my hands, up to no good at three in the morning with all the other fucking foxes. If you’re going to put that anywhere on the record, you might as well put it at the front.”<br />\n<b>“Cupid’s Arrow”</b>\nFC: “This is about falling in love with someone a little bit quicker than they fall in love with you—and by that, I mean they never do. We've all had those weird dating app dates where you find yourself at one in the morning having a panic attack in someone’s bed, like, ‘Have you got any CBD or anything?’ It’s about how emotions are thoughts and feelings but they can feel so physical.”\nDean Richardson: “This is one of the ones that came from the early cabin sessions. When we made it, we were like, ‘This is what this record should sound like.’ It got us really excited.”<br />\n<b>“Bang Bang” (feat. Lynks)</b>\nFC: “It’s about how class A drugs just have such a tremendous effect on your life in good and bad ways. I was writing it from the perspective of this office worker who’s just biding his time, gets to Thursday and he’s already tipping a bit, and by Friday at 8 pm, he’s already off the rails, and then 8 am Monday morning, he’s still off the rails, but he’s back in the office. Lynks just got it. His lyrics are some of my favorite on the album, and that is incredibly frustrating.”<br />\n<b>“Take It to the Brink”</b>\nDR: “This one technically predates the album. We’d written this wild psychedelic version of the verse, and took a second dive at it when we were in the midst of everything and got it to feel like it fits in the world of <i>Sticky</i>.”\nFC: “The song is about doing too much all the time and how if there’s one thing you’re consistently good at, it’s pushing it over the edge—and that’s us all the time.”<br />\n<b>“My Town” (feat. Joe Talbot)</b>\nFC: “I was trying to find a decent analogy for the collective mental health of not just London, but all the smaller towns that I was nipping to and from during the pandemic to see family or pick up my daughter. Without life, you could really start seeing those places fall apart, and that was a good reflection of how everybody in those towns was feeling. I reached out to Joe Talbot because I really needed someone to help me push it.”<br />\n<b>“Go Get a Tattoo” (feat. Lynks)</b>\nDR: “We always have one every record and it’s always the main single. For whatever reason, we are gluttons for punishment and we fight against it, but it finds its way on.”\nFC: “The resistance is because we just know: We can hear that it’s probably the closest we’ll get to a hit, that’s got all the right things in the right place. Francis Bacon used to dismantle and destroy his most perfect paintings. Set it on fire and throw it in a bin.”<br />\n<b>“Off With His Head” (feat. Cassyette)</b>\nFC: “It’s about the patriarchal chokehold on the world and how brutal it is to watch in yourself. It’s so ingrained in me and I’m having to do quite a lot of work to undo it all the time and there are times where I completely fail and it is really frustrating. So naturally I was like, ‘We’ve got to do it with a really strong female vocal, or at least someone that is actively trying to chop up the patriarchy every day.’ Cassyette is walking, talking rock ’n’ roll. She’s got the greatest voice, the greatest look. She just embodies it. She rocked up at 9 am, smoked a fag, and just went in and started howling. She nailed it and I hadn’t even had my breakfast.”<br />\n<b>“Cobra Queen”</b>\nFC: “This kind of goes hand in hand with ‘Cupid’s Arrow.’ It’s about when you’re chasing down this unrequited love and falling in love with the wrong people. You never know when that’s happening until it’s happened. It’s about the intoxication, it’s like a cobra being in the room. It’s beautiful. It’s fucking deadly, but you just don’t take your eyes off it.”<br />\n<b>“Rat Race”</b>\nFC: “‘Rat Race’ is about the first year of lockdown and how savage and <i>Groundhog Day</i> it was for everybody. The pandemic was an equalizer for most humans. When we get to the end of the pandemic, it’s as if every rat has completed the race and now they’ve got a choice: Do you want to go back in the maze or do you want to go into something else?

In 2018, the same orchestra, along with Bernstein pupil Marin Alsop, returned to the work to celebrate the composer’s centenary. The star of the evening, recorded live and heard here, is Canadian soprano Jane Archibald, whose “Cunegonde!” is fearlessly and wittily sung, with diamond-cut precision. Leonardo Capalbo is a fine Candide and Anne Sofie von Otter has a lot of fun as The Old Lady. As Dr. Pangloss, the great baritone Sir Thomas Allen calls on every ounce of his acting chops—and he delivers with terrific panache. Follow the story with Apple Music’s lyrics feature.
