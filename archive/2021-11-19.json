This album is something that clearly required a few deep breaths for Tottenham’s most celebrated export. “There were moments when I was writing these songs, and even when I was mixing them and stuff like that, where I was like, ‘Maybe I don't need to put this album out,’” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Like, ‘Maybe I should write another.’ Just because music is my therapy. I'm never going into the studio to be like, ‘Right, I need another hit.’ It's not like that for me. When something is more powerful and overwhelming [to] me, I like to go to a studio, because it's normally a basement and there's no fucking windows and no reception, so no one can get ahold of me. So I'm basically running away. And no one would've known I'd written that record. Maybe I just had to get it out of my system.”<br />\nBut, almost two years after much of it was completed, Adele did release <i>30</i>. And remarkably, considering the world has been using her back catalog to channel its rawest emotions since 2008, this is easily Adele’s most vulnerable record. It concerns itself with Big Things Only—crippling guilt over her 2019 divorce, motherhood, daring to date as one of the world’s most famous people, falling in love—capturing perfectly the wobbly resolve of a broken heart in repair. Its songs often feel sentimental in a way that’s unusually warm and inviting, very California, and crucially: <i>earned</i>. “The album is for my son, for Angelo,” she says. “I knew I had to tell his story in a song because it was very clear he was feeling it, even though I thought I was doing a very good job of being like, ‘Everything’s fine.’ But I also knew I wasn’t being as present. I was just so consumed by so many different feelings. And he plucked up the courage to very articulately say to me, ‘You’re basically a ghost. You might as well not be here.’ What kind of poet is that? For him to be little and say ‘I can’t see you’ to my face broke my heart.”<br />\nThis is also Adele’s most confident album sonically. She fancied paying tribute to Judy Garland with Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson (“Strangers By Nature”), so she did. “I’d watched the Judy Garland biopic,” she says. “And I remember thinking, ‘Why did everyone stop writing such incredible melodies and cadences and harmonies?’” She felt comfortable working heartbreaking bedside chats with her young son and a voice memo documenting her own fragile mental state into her music on “My Little Love.” “While I was writing it, I just remember thinking of any child that’s been through divorce or any person that has been though a divorce themselves, or anyone that wants to leave a relationship and never will,” she says. “I thought about all of them, because my divorce really humanized my parents for me.”<br />\nThe album does not steep in sorrow and regret, however: There’s a Max Martin blockbuster with a whistled chorus (“Can I Get It”), a twinkling interlude sampling iconic jazz pianist Erroll Garner (“All Night Parking”), and the fruits of a new creative partnership with Dean Josiah Cover—aka Michael Kiwanuka, Sault, and Little Simz producer Inflo. “The minute I realized he [Inflo] was from North London, I wouldn’t stop talking to him,” she says. “We got no work done. It was only a couple of months after I’d left my marriage, and we got on so well, but he could feel that something was wrong. He knew that something dark was happening in me. I just opened up. I was dying for someone to ask me how I was.”<br />\nOne of the Inflo tracks, “Hold On,” is the album’s centerpiece. Rolling through self-loathing (“I swear to god, I am such a mess/The harder that I try, I regress”) into instantly quotable revelations (“Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get”) before reaching show-stopping defiance (“Let time be patient, let pain be gracious/Love will soon come, if you just hold on”), the song accesses something like final-form Adele. It’s a rainbow of emotions, it’s got a choir (“I got my friends to come and sing,” she tells Apple Music), and she hits notes we’ll all only dare tackle in cars, solo. “I definitely lost hope a number of times that I’d ever find my joy again,” she says. “I remember I didn’t barely laugh for about a year. But I didn’t realize I was making progress until I wrote ‘Hold On’ and listened to it back. Later, I was like, ‘Oh, fuck, I’ve really learned a lot. I’ve really come a long way.’”<br />\nSo, after all this, is Adele happy that <i>30</i> found its way to the world? “It really helped me, this album,” she says. “I really think that some of the songs on this album could really help people, really change people’s lives. A song like ‘Hold On’ could actually save a few lives.” It’s also an album she feels could support fellow artists. “I think it’s an important record for them to hear,” she says. “The ones that I feel are being encouraged not to value their own art, and that everything should be massive and everything should be ‘get it while you can’… I just wanted to remind them that you don’t need to be in everyone’s faces all the time. And also, you can really write from your stomach, if you want.”","short":"“Some of the songs on this album could really help people.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1592233403","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592233403?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/17/bd/10/17bd10fa-9ab2-6e46-1c46-720d19d8a242/886449633654.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"609db3","textColor2":"58bee0","textColor4":"499ebf","textColor1":"74bcd2","bgColor":"0e1f3a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"French Montana","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/they-got-amnesia/1592233403","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"They Got Amnesia","recordLabel":"Epic/Bad Boy Entertainment","upc":"886449633654","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1592233403","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"It’s no secret that French Montana works well with others. His catalog is steeped in blockbuster collaborations with heavyweights like Drake, Swae Lee, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, and The Weeknd. Over the course of an exceptionally prolific career, his voice has appeared alongside friends so often that one could be forgiven for forgetting that the Bronx-hailing MC is perfectly capable of holding it down by himself. When he decided to call his fourth proper album <i>They Got Amnesia</i>, however, French Montana’s mood was anything but forgiving. The project’s title could be related to an October 2021 Twitter spat where user Sticktalkz challenged followers to “name FIVE French Montana songs without features.” French himself responded, rattling off 14 of his favorite solo records. Still, if French’s aim was to make the case that he doesn’t actually need anybody’s help, <i>They Got Amnesia</i> is maybe not the best evidence. <br />\nThe project’s guest list reads like a who’s who of hip-hop playlisting, including Rick Ross, Kodak Black, Lil Durk, Pop Smoke, Doja Cat, Saweetie, Fivio Foreign, Coi Leray, Ty Dolla $ign, and Latto, to name a few. It is produced largely by the ever dependable hitmaking producer Hitmaka. Topically, <i>They Got Amnesia</i> is the French Montana fans have long loved (“Business,” “Bag Season,” “Striptease”), but also with a tiny chip on his shoulder (see “I Don’t Really Care” for an eyebrow-raising audit of the MC's tabloid-worthy dating history). It’s a project that declares French is going to continue doing him, without or without help, even in the instance that he might be needled by a little internet trolling. He distills his philosophy most appropriately on “Appreciate Everything” when he raps, “I don’t count the haters, make the haters count.”","short":"Twenty-one tracks of Bronx-bred hits to remind you."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1578783072","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578783072?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/6a/2a/cc/6a2acc5e-d935-81e0-0bc0-b34badccb281/21CRGIM27837.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d9dadf","textColor2":"e6cd97","textColor4":"c7b590","textColor1":"fcfcfa","bgColor":"4c5574","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Robert Plant & Alison Krauss","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/raise-the-roof/1578783072","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Raise The Roof","recordLabel":"Rounder","upc":"00888072270350","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Rounder Records., Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1578783072","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Robert Plant and Alison Krauss’ 2007 collaborative album <i>Raising Sand</i> remains, nearly a decade and a half after its release, a landmark record in roots music. The LP earned Plant, of Led Zeppelin fame, and reigning bluegrass queen Krauss five Grammys at the 2009 ceremony, including the coveted Album of the Year trophy, among many other accolades. The album also offered a new vision for how artists could work within an already nebulous genre, with the two recording favorite songs new and old for a collection that still sounds timeless.<br />\nPlant and Krauss reconvene on <i>Raise the Roof</i>, seeming, somehow, to pick right back up where they left off. Still present are the pair’s intimacy, their contrasting but complementary vocal styles, and, notably, the gentle hand of producer T Bone Burnett, who also helmed <i>Raising Sand</i>. While much remains the same, <i>Raise the Roof</i> is a decidedly larger affair than its predecessor, even in its quieter moments, thanks likely to each artist’s growth via work with other projects (Band of Joy and Sensational Space Shifters for Plant; longtime band Union Station for Krauss) in the intervening decade-plus. Covered artists include Calexico (“Quattro [World Drifts In]”), Allen Toussaint (“Trouble With My Lover”), and Merle Haggard (“Going Where the Lonely Go”), with the album’s tracklist revealing a catholic breadth of influences.

Beyond the black-sand beaches and North Atlantic water, Esja, a volcanic mountain range, cuts across the skyline. Around it, the Icelandic weather regularly puts on a show. “It’s always extreme there,” Albarn tells Apple Music. “It doesn’t exist in a meteorological platitude.” Toward the end of 2019, Albarn gathered an orchestral ensemble to sit at his window and chart the landscape, wildlife, and climate in music. Three sessions were recorded before the pandemic stalled the project. Relocating to his UK home in Devon, Albarn found he just couldn’t let those musical improvisations lie dormant until lockdown loosened. “They were such a strong thing,” he says. “It’s like a potion—I kept taking the cork top off to sip for a minute, maybe just smell it. At one point, I was like, ‘I’m just going to drink this now and use it to do something.’ So, I did like Asterix, and I made <i>The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows</i>.”<br />\nAssisted by longtime collaborators Mike Smith and Simon Tong, Albarn transformed the music into his second solo album—11 unhurried reflections on loss and fragility. “The fragility is the humans’ place within nature,” he says. “And the loss is the transferal of everything. Nothing’s lost. The thing changes, it doesn’t actually disappear—it just has a different state or form.” With its vivid sense of place and transformation, the record recalls two of Albarn’s recent projects: Gorillaz’s <i>Meanwhile</i> EP and The Good, the Bad & the Queen’s <i>Merrie Land</i>. “The older you get, depending on your circumstance, the more acutely you feel these things,” he says. “I’m making music for young people at a rather advanced age for someone making music for young people. People of my own age, it’s kind of, ‘Yeah, well, that’s how I feel as well.’ Whereas for younger people, it’s like, ‘Well, that’s a strong flavor,’ but it’s not a bad thing.” Here, he takes us through the album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows”</b>\n“I’d had that phrase for a while and thought that was a good working title for the Icelandic project. It was only in Devon at the end of [2020] that I realized where it had come from fully—I’d obviously read the poem [John Clare’s ‘Love and Memory,’ adapted here] at some point. And that poem just felt like it worked weirdly with the nature. John Clare was a very natural poet, working-class. [What I was getting from the poem] was ‘the dark journey,’ and you can’t just wipe out the memory of somebody. It’s a very emotional negotiation you go on when someone’s left your life: You’ve lost something, but you retain what you choose to retain, and that can be a beautiful thing as well.”<br />\n<b>“The Cormorant”</b>\n“For years, I was scared of swimming out into the bay [in Devon]. I sort of conquered that fear at the beginning of lockdown and started to do it as a daily meditation. Sometimes I got myself in quite a lot of trouble because it was too rough. I did have one point where I thought, ‘I’m going to drown.’ But I love doing it, because although the fear of being devoured by a shark or whatever has diminished, it’s still there a little bit, so it’s quite an edgy thing to do every day. That’s just the first two lines of that song. It’s a deep song, a whole novel in itself really. I was sitting on the beach, and I had my phone. I recorded the whole of the vocal line, music and words, without really anything in my head. It was more of a sung conversation with myself and the cormorant and the water and everything that’s taken place on that beach over 25 years. I love that about the beaches—I’m there on my own, I can just bring everyone who’s ever been there with me and all the thoughts I’ve got. It's important for all of us to have somewhere where you can somehow gather your thoughts.”<br />\n<b>“Royal Morning Blue”</b>\n“[When rain turns to snow], suddenly everything goes in slow motion and beautiful geometric patterns start to appear and the world feels reborn in a way. Even the most desolate of landscapes after a big snowfall are perfect. It’s such an ephemeral thing though. It’s the same water but transformed for a moment.”<br />\n<b>“Combustion”</b>\n“This is part of a much bigger thing. I think it’ll be developed more when I do it with the orchestra in February [2022] and I’m reunited with my musicians from Iceland. The record will transform again, the space in between the singing will be much greater, to return it more to its meditation on this perspective that musicians and myself were allowed by being there and playing in real time.”<br />\n<b>“Daft Wader”</b>\n“[It’s inspired by] Zoroastrian sky burials. And the public mourning of martyrs. It’s a very big part of Shia religion, martyrdom. Problematic. And same with Sunni. It’s problematic, but it just struck me how it was very beautiful seeing communities all sitting together, drinking fruit juice and coffee, and being really peaceful publicly. Because it’s always kind of invested with such drama and violence, their religious festivals—we’re taught to fear them, and not understand it and not be sympathetic. I’m very lucky: I’ve been to Iran, and it has its issues, but it’s a very civilized place.”<br />\n<b>“Darkness to Light”</b>\n“Dawn is so much later in the winter [in Iceland]. It’s like half-10, maybe even 11 o’clock. Dawn is in the working day. So, it’s a lot of time making this record in that state, which is something I grew to understand more about when I was doing <i>Dr Dee</i> [a 2011 opera about Elizabethan polymath John Dee] because the time between dusk and night, and night and dawn, was the favored time of the day to commit to magical practice. That’s where all the good spells are cast.”<br />\n<b>“Esja”</b>\n“This is the outline of the mountain, and it moves with the contours around a certain harmonic destination. You’ve got to give [the musicians] some sort of harmonic destination. Once you start saying, ‘Play in a certain way,’ you’re missing the point. It’s how they feel once they start to tune in to just staring, and not thinking about what you’re playing. So, listening, being sensitive to each other. It’s like everyone’s got a paintbrush—and how do we keep moving but somehow inhabit our points of view? When I was writing over the top, it made it easier having this harmonic reasoning behind all of this abstract stuff.”<br />\n<b>“The Tower of Montevideo”</b>\n“I’ve made it. I’ve swum past the buoy to the uncharted cruise ship [first mentioned in ‘The Cormorant’], and I’ve met fellow musicians, or stowaways or refugees, emotional refugees, and we’ve formed a band and we’re playing these songs to nobody. I’ve had a bit of an obsession about music in empty clubs for a long time. To make music for an audience is a true joy, but be careful, because modern consumption of music is killing us musicians slowly. It’s a long, protracted death, but it’s happening.”<br />\n<b>“Giraffe Trumpet Sea”</b>\n“This is a song about flying back to London and looking down—there were a few clouds, a night city—and feeling like I was at the bottom of some ocean, that it was gold treasure. Giraffe trumpets are the cranes. When they’re resting, they look like they’re sort of giraffes. Half-giraffe, half-trumpet, sending out beautiful sounds to the universe. But I left out all the words. I think it was too distracting at that point in the record to go off on another tangent and another story, but I liked the music and I liked the title.”<br />\n<b>“Polaris”</b>\n“‘Polaris’ reminds me of that anxiety I felt in the ’80s around Greenham Common [RAF air base housing cruise missiles under Britain’s Polaris nuclear weapons program]. That understanding that we had as kids of that age, that nuclear war was a very real thing, and we were quite scared. ‘Polaris/Watching the embers fall.’ That’s after a nuclear attack. And then the next bit—‘Joining the saline to start the inspection’—is me zoning in on the oystercatchers in Devon when the tide goes out. Seeing them in an <i>Animal Farm</i> kind of way: They’ve become the rulers. They’re black and white, and their red eyes—kind of this uniform. And waiting for the saline to clear so they can eat. And the other birds have to wait in their line before they’re allowed to go and do anything. So, ‘Polaris’ is an ominous word. But it’s the Polar Star as well, which is something that’s been used by anyone who’s gone to sea. It’s saved many people.”<br />\n<b>“Particles”</b>\n“[A rabbi Albarn met on a flight] was fleeing certain particles. But she said the particles are looking for you in the universe. They are attracted to you. You cannot stop anything. We moved on to the conversation of Trump, and she said he’s a perfect example of a particle in that you can’t escape it, but it’s benign in a sense because it’s just going to come and cause great disruption and then disappear, and other things will come out of it. And that is true of the universe. Firstly, nothing disappears; it just changes. And secondly, there is no sadness because everything is evolving. And it’s only us who want to find some meaning to it. And that’s why we become sad—because when we can't find meaning to things, we’re sad. And that’s just being a good old-fashioned Homo sapien.”","short":"“There is no sadness because everything is evolving.

Still processing the grief of losing a loved one, he imagined that making his second solo album would be a way to get through and move on. Instead, he learned that life doesn’t work that way. Grief has long legs. “I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, this is going to be the journey through grief, from it being there and unbearable to it all being solved,” Fred Gibson, the man behind the handle, tells Apple Music. “By the end, I was like, ‘This is an ever-going thing, and this is just one chapter of it.’” Following up on his debut, <i>Actual Life (April 14 - December 17 2020)</i>, released in April 2021, it’s a soulful and emotional dance record. Blending euphoric bangers and atmospheric electronica, it confirms the producer who’s collaborated with Headie One, Stormzy, Romy, Ed Sheeran, and FKA Twigs as an exhilarating artist in his own right.<br />\nLike its predecessor, <i>Actual Life 2 (February 22 - October 15 2021)</i> uses snippets and samples from real-life events and conversations as the foundation for intricate soundscapes. “As soon as I make a song, I start dragging in shit from my iPhone, a bunch of voice notes that I’ve recorded from around the world,” says Gibson. “I just love the way that feels, so much more than opening up some dry synth and playing some notes.” Gibson says Actual Life is an ongoing project, each LP a snapshot of his life in that particular era. “I’m going to do this forever now. It’ll be like chapters. I’m obsessed with it.” Let Fred again.. guide you through this phase, track by track.<br />\n<b>“February 2nd 2021”</b>\n“It’s the first sample I found. It’s picking up from where the last album ended, beginning to try and move on from a thing. It felt very clearly like it needed to be at the beginning.”<br />\n<b>“Catrin (The City)”</b>\n“I thought this lyric was just really beautiful and very much resonated with me. I adore London, and I always have, and I always will. I make most of my music just out in the city, just on benches or in museums. My real brother on this record felt like the city. It just felt very clear and honest to me that this was how the album needed to begin. I only sing four lines in this tune, but they’re like flashbacks. I see them as being montage flashbacks at different moments from last year. And then it moves forward again.”<br />\n<b>“Roze (Forgive)”</b>\n“This is a sample I’d found on Instagram—someone in his bedroom singing this song. To me the feeling of it was it’s still not moving forward, it’s still reflecting on the past. But it was at least a step in there being a nostalgia over it—it wasn’t present tense. It was like, ‘This is what’s happened.’ The main breakthrough on that was finding the thing of doing it with the strings. I’m going to record a version of it actually with a string orchestra, which will be fun.”<br />\n<b>“Gigi (What You Went Through)”</b>\n“This is [London singer-songwriter] Gigi Moss, a sample of her singing at a pub. Sometimes it’s very much as simple as just stumbling across someone saying what I’d want to say and then I’ll be like, ‘OK, thank you for holding my hand through that. You need to carry on helping me, and I can sample it so I can sing around it.’ I find it hard to go from a white, blank page to singing it myself off of nothing. But if there’s someone else there singing it with me, I see it as a safety blanket.”<br />\n<b>“Kahan (Last Year)” [feat. Kodak Black]</b>\n“For a while, there was a version of this where I wanted it to feel like I was out of my mind, chaotic and claustrophobic. Then my brother, who I work with on lots of music, was like, ‘What if you make the opposite interpretation, just a piano?’ As soon as it was on piano, it was able to breathe. And then I was like, ‘OK, I would want to sing on this now. I need to tell my part of the story.’ It becomes more of a duet. The whole record is very much in memory mode of the previous year, and I think this song summarizes that.”<br />\n<b>“Tate (How I Feel)”</b>\n“The lyric is saying, ‘I don’t know how I feel’—just that over and over again. The music sounds more positive, which I think was just how I was feeling. I couldn’t work out if it was a good or a bad thing. I think, in hindsight, it was just a pending thing. I thought I was through it. I was like, ‘We’re getting to the good bit and to a good state of mind.’ But that was definitely, definitely not the case.”<br />\n<b>“Hannah (The Sun)”</b>\n“It’s in the same portion of time [of ‘Tate (How I Feel)’], of that feeling of thinking the sun’s coming through, there’s an optimism here. It was short-lived but real. I like things when the answer isn’t, ‘Yeah, and then that was that and that’s it, done.’ I like it more when it’s like, ‘It really felt like it was that, but it was a total fallacy, and you were totally wrong two weeks later.’ I’m into that side of it; it feels more human.”<br />\n<b>“Carlos (Interlude)”</b>\n“Carlos is the OG. He’s the first person I met that I sampled. And I adore him and feel forever indebted to him. I’m going to try and track him down at the beginning of next year when I’m in America. Every album will sample Carlos somewhere. I like the challenge of finding new ways of using this little, 14-second video I have with Carlos. I’ve made 20 songs out of it.”<br />\n<b>“Faisal (Envelops Me)”</b>\n“This is probably the song that means the most to me on the record. The verse is very much about the traumas of the year before, but I think the chorus is representing a hug of the beautiful people I have around me. I think I was coming out of the short-lived sun moment and realizing that this would be a lifelong thing. I think traumas and grief, it gets less frenetic and <i>there</i>—but then it just becomes part of you. It doesn’t just disappear. It just becomes you. And that’s not a bad thing; it’s just a true thing. I was making peace with the fact that there would be no leaving this behind.”<br />\n<b>“Tayla (Every Night)”</b>\n“I love this sample. It’s of this amazing singer called Tayla Parx. It’s a song that we actually wrote together a time ago, but it was a ballad—it’s a song I’ve made quite a few versions of. This one felt right for this moment in this record. Before it picked up, I wanted it to have this stiller, more washed, padded moment of just a few lyrics before it starts to get some momentum.”<br />\n<b>“Tanya (Maybe Life)”</b>\n“This is the beginning of a form of optimism. I like it sounding like all these loads of different voices, loads of different chops, loads of different people around you trying to help in different ways. There’s a chop of Tanya going, ‘Maybe life ain’t as bad as it seems.’ There’s a chop of Romy from The xx going, ‘You can lean on me, you can lean on me.’ There’s a chop of a whole host of other stuff, and they were representing the different people around me and the different approaches that—they’re all love, but just the different aspects of the people around me.”<br />\n<b>“Marco (And Everyone)”</b>\n“I love making these reprise songs that summarize all the samples that you’ve heard in the record. On the last record, the reprise song was over this washy pad, and it was very ambient and still, so I was like, ‘OK, let’s try doing that same thing of finding a song that can incorporate everything you’ve heard, but in the opposite way of a super-driving beat.’ Also, I was like, ‘We’re picking up now; I want to be building a momentum.’”<br />\n<b>“Billie (Loving Arms)”</b>\n“This is the real climax of the feeling of letting people help you, the most visceral incarnation of that. It feels like a pinger to me—just a proper, undiluted serotonin hit of falling into someone else. After a year of that whole aspect of things being gone, I think those things are even sweeter. This song felt like the pinnacle of allowing people in.”<br />\n<b>“Billie (Interlude)”</b>\n“I knew that the record had to end with ‘Mollie’ because I was absolutely adamant it didn’t end with ‘Loving Arms.’ It was so insincere for it to end on ‘Loving Arms’ because that so isn’t the truth of the end of the journey—not that there is an end. I wanted to end ‘Loving Arms’ in a way that it could get into ‘Mollie’ without it being too rogue. It needed to just pause for a second to allow it the space to breathe so it could go into that last song.”<br />\n<b>“Mollie (Hear Your Name)”</b>\n“If ‘Loving Arms’ is the Saturday night, the reality is much more of a Sunday afternoon. That ‘Loving Arms’ serotonin hit isn’t a sustainable state of mind. It’s more like ‘Mollie’—‘OK, actually we are more here, and this is our cruise pace and that’s OK, and we’re going to try and marathon this out as opposed to some little sprint of a gassed-up pinger’s life.’”<br />\n<b>“15th October 2021”</b>\n“This is literally just me, very ill in my bed, finishing the record. It’s just a message to someone, a little minute of stillness after ‘Mollie.’”","short":"“I’m going to do this forever now.

He’s often using his own compositions as source material himself, referencing the jazz-sampling methods of hip-hop producers in the process. On <i>Deciphering the Message</i>, McCraven’s debut for Blue Note, it isn’t his own work he is chopping up but rather the label’s extensive archives. The result is an astounding homage to the jazz lineage, as well as a continuation of its inventive ethos. Throughout, McCraven highlights Art Blakey’s group The Jazz Messengers, flipping saxophonist Hank Mobley’s “A Slice of the Top” into a boom-bap opener, while trumpeter Kenny Dorham’s “Sunset” is transmuted into a sludgy funk and guitarist Kenny Burrell’s “Autumn in New York” receives a new rhythmic shuffle. McCraven’s hand is subtle yet self-assured, adding to these compositions rather than subsuming them. He illustrates that if jazz is an improvised music, then any sense of tradition must encompass continual, intuited change. Perhaps that is the message to be heard.","short":"On his Blue Note debut, McCraven reworks the label’s archives."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1576574360","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576574360?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/a8/d9/6a/a8d96aff-0053-9af1-1e85-5d7c398c69a5/44003246010.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c58e66","textColor2":"db9870","textColor4":"b07b5b","textColor1":"f5b17e","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ultra Q","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/get-yourself-a-friend-ep/1576574360","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Get Yourself A Friend - EP","recordLabel":"Royal Mountain Records","upc":"044003246010","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Royal Mountain Records","playParams":{"id":"1576574360","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1594231447","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594231447?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/68/06/2b/68062b97-8ecd-9bbb-2634-00d743f634ef/21UM1IM39774.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ce4965","textColor2":"fd272d","textColor4":"cd1f36","textColor1":"ff5c69","bgColor":"0c005a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ashley Kutcher","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/one-eighty/1594231447","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"One Eighty","recordLabel":"Darkroom/Interscope Records","upc":"00602445180547","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Darkroom/Interscope Records","playParams":{"id":"1594231447","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1594463838","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594463838?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/ac/cb/f3/accbf323-a631-12eb-3977-0563254dd89e/mza_8588403352509644499.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2000,"textColor3":"cdcaae","textColor2":"dcdcdf","textColor4":"b1b1b4","textColor1":"fffcd8","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tiësto","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ti%C3%ABsto-at-edc-las-vegas-2021-kinetic-field-stage-dj-mix/1594463838","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"trackCount":44,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-23","name":"Tiësto at EDC Las Vegas 2021: Kinetic Field Stage (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381819118","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1594463838","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1592147267","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592147267?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/59/ea/4c/59ea4c83-a976-dba5-92f6-578333ce959c/1308.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1bfa3","textColor2":"f9c272","textColor4":"d9ac68","textColor1":"eedabc","bgColor":"5c5241","hasP3":true},"artistName":"remy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-only-call-when-you-want-something/1592147267","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"you only call when you want something","recordLabel":"Hopeless Records","upc":"790692654161","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 remy, under exclusive license to Hopeless Records, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1592147267","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1587374522","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587374522?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c8/5d/63/c85d6376-14d2-9d1b-ecc4-66ef72bc60f2/21UM1IM20057.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cda685","textColor2":"e79869","textColor4":"c18265","textColor1":"f5c590","bgColor":"2c2b57","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kiss","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/destroyer-45th-anniversary-super-deluxe/1587374522","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":61,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Destroyer (45th Anniversary Super Deluxe)","recordLabel":"UMe Direct 2","upc":"00602438922949","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Universal Music Enterprises release;

Ezrin actually wore a whistle around his neck and had a cardboard box he used to hit with a drumstick to keep Peter [Criss] in time, which made Peter furious. And then Paul [Stanley] and I would just tune our guitars with our ears, but Ezrin showed us how to tune harmonically.”<br />\nWere it not for Ezrin, <i>Destroyer</i> would have been a very different album. As heard here on the 45th Anniversary Super Deluxe edition, Simmons and Stanley recorded demos for more than a dozen songs that didn’t make the final cut. “He tore apart our songs,” Simmons recalls. “I wrote a song called ‘Mad Dog,’ but Ezrin only liked one riff. So he stuck that riff into ‘Flaming Youth.’ Quite a number of the songs were Frankenstein songs like that, but it’s like the difference between a caterpillar and a butterfly. They look completely different, but at the core they’re the same insect. It’s just that the butterfly evolved. That’s what <i>Destroyer</i> is—the caterpillar’s still in there, but we sprouted wings and color.” Below, Simmons comments on each track.<br /> \n<b>“Detroit Rock City”</b>\n“Paul and I were writing separately in those days, and we each found these little studios to make demos in. Paul came up with ‘Detroit Rock City’ at the studio he was working at. He had the A and B parts, but the song didn’t breathe. The lyrics went one right into the other without the space. It was Ezrin who added the space between the vocals—‘I feel uptight on a Saturday night,’ and then the space for the bass part. The confession is that Ezrin came up with that bass part. And the entire solo with the drums going off on their own, Ezrin sang the melody as well as the harmony parts. He was a real tour de force—a visionary.”<br /> \n<b>“King of the Night Time World”</b>\n“This was a demo by Kim Fowley that Bob found. He saw the anthemic quality of it—even the title. We said, ‘Well, we don't do other people's material,’ so he met us halfway. We sort of kicked the tires here and there, but there was certainly an original version of ‘King of the Night Time World.’ This is great, though. The arrangement, with the kind of feedback thing before it hits—it’s fairly symphonic. Less rock, if you see what I mean.”<br /> \n<b>“God of Thunder”</b>\n“Paul and I started making fun of each other about the kinds of songs that we write. He’d say, ‘Gene, you're always writing about monsters and stuff like that.’ And I'm going, ‘Paul, cut it out with using words like “love” in song titles. I'm so sick of that.’ So, Paul comes in with this song called ‘God of Thunder.’ Ezrin listens to it and goes, ‘That’s very good. Gene is going to sing that one.’ And Paul just about had a heart attack: ‘Why?’ And Ezrin said, ‘Because you’re not the god of thunder.’ That was harsh, but I have to say Ezrin was right, because—respectfully—I couldn’t imagine Paul singing this one. It’s like a different persona. It would be like Ozzy singing ‘Like a Virgin.’ The words have to sound like they’re in your lexicon.”<br /> \n<b>“Great Expectations”</b>\n“I’d always written songs and never thought about whether they’re Kiss or not, and ‘Great Expectations’ came from a song I’d started writing called ‘I Am a New Man.’ It went, ‘I am a new man, born in the ashes of ruin, born in the meadows of lies.’ Same chords, same melody. And then, for whatever reason, I rewrote it as an afterthought about a fan. ‘Great Expectations’ was nothing I thought we’d ever do, but I showed it to Ezrin with my stack of 30 or 40 songs, because I’d always overwrite. Ezrin liked it and put the children’s choir on it.”<br /> \n<b>“Flaming Youth”</b>\n“As it happened, Ezrin rented an apartment across from Paul's place in New York. He had a piano there, and we'd gather around the piano. ‘Flaming Youth’ and ‘Shout It Out Loud’ were written around the piano. Both Paul and I would just start strumming guitars and then figure out what it was going to be called later.”<br /> \n<b>“Sweet Pain”</b>\n“I was always fascinated with the idea of sadomasochism. Like, ‘I get the shit beaten out of me and I sure love it.’ I’m going, ‘What are you talking about?’ So that’s where it came from—‘Sweet pain, my love will drive you insane’ just rolls off the tongue, and then the rest of the song wrote itself. Dick Wagner played the solo because Ace [Frehley] was in a card game at his place in upstate New York. It’s like, ‘The dog ate my homework.’ It just doesn’t get better. And if I didn't love Ace so much, I'd be furious. But, of course, he was much more furious that everything didn't stop just because he was flaking out up there with whatever else.”<br /> \n<b>“Shout It Out Loud”</b>\n“It bears noting that in the previous band Paul and I were in, Wicked Lester, there was a song that The Hollies, of all people, were going to record—and did not. It was a song called ‘We Want to Shout It Out Loud.’ It was about a secret love affair. Then, when we were sitting around the piano with Bob, the melody came up. And I remember singing the chorus, and then we’d just throw out lines. Suddenly, it wasn’t a song about a relationship anymore, but just about the exuberance of life. A stand-and-deliver kind of a thing, as the English say.”<br /> \n<b>“Beth”</b>\n“We played Flint, Michigan, and Peter and I were in one limo, and Ace and Paul were in the other. We were going to Cadillac, Michigan, to do Kiss Day with the entire town coming out in full makeup. On the way there, Peter starts singing this song, ‘Beck, I hear you calling…’ et cetera, et cetera. I’m going, ‘That’s really nice. What song is that?’ He said it was a song he wrote called ‘Beck.’ I suggested he sing it for Ezrin, and I suggested he change the name to ‘Beth,’ because it’s a much easier-sounding word than ‘Beck,’ which was short for ‘Becky.’ Ezrin loved it, played it on keyboards and added a Mozart piano concerto in the middle that was in the public domain. And that became ‘Beth.’ But Peter had nothing to do with writing that song. It was written by a guy named Stan Penridge, who was the guitar player in a group called Chelsea [that Peter was in].”<br /> \n<b>“Do You Love Me”</b>\n“This also came in from a Kim Fowley demo. Ezrin reacted to ‘You really like my limousine/You like the way the wheels roll/You like my seven-inch…’ and then there’s a pause before ‘leather heels.’ That’s just rock, you know? And then we rearranged it, of course. It bears noting that there was an original ‘Do You Love Me’ written by Berry Gordy for the Contours. Nothing to do with this version, of course. But we still do this live, as a second encore out of three.”","short":"“The caterpillar’s still in there, but we sprouted wings and color.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1588939019","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588939019?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/45/ba/7e/45ba7e38-e1a6-0d15-3f79-97629e0cda7b/4062548036268.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"c4d6da","textColor2":"edc9bb","textColor4":"bdb3ad","textColor1":"f6f6f3","bgColor":"005977","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jessy Lanza","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dj-kicks-jessy-lanza-dj-mix/1588939019","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":26,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"DJ -

Picking the guests for each song is just intuitive. Some tracks are more aggressive or more mellow, so I go with my gut feeling, and then I reach out to people.” Below, he comments on a few key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Black Hearse Cadillac” (feat. Hank von Hell, Anders Odden)</b>\n“Initially, I wanted Iggy Pop to sing on that one. I’m good friends with his managers—they’re actually my neighbors in Warsaw, believe it or not. They told me it’s not impossible, but it’s all about timing. You send him tracks and then you wait. But I needed people I could make plans with, so I reached out to Hank, who loved the track. He liked that it wasn’t more punky stuff that would be reminiscent of Turbonegro. To me, his delivery is the closest Me and That Man gets to rap. And then, Anders added some amazing guitars.”<br /> \n<b>“Under the Spell” (feat. Mary Goore)</b>\n“I really wanted to do something together with Tobias [Forge, of Ghost] for a long time, but we couldn’t use his name because of politics—and that’s all fine with me. I love it when guys from metal bands do non-metal projects outside their comfort zone, which is why I think ‘Under the Spell’ came out so good. It’s probably one of my all-time favorites from Me and That Man. By the way, this was the only face-to-face collaboration I did on the record. We were able to have that creative dialogue, and I learned a lot just by working with Tobias and observing him.”<br /> \n<b>“All Hope Has Gone” (feat. Blaze Bayley, Gary Holt, Jeff “Mantas” Dunn)</b>\n“We did a show in Israel years ago, and Blaze just appeared backstage with his manager. We started talking and it felt like I’ve known this guy for 20 years. Then I wrote this ballad that reminded me of ‘Blood and Tears’ by Danzig, but then it also had Gary Moore blues vibes as well. I thought Blaze would be a great voice for the song, and then he wrote his own lyrics. He’s singing his life story here, about his wife passing. It’s fucking heartbreaking. And then, add on top of that Mantas and Gary Holt shredding. So, you’ve got Maiden, Slayer, and Venom in one song that’s not even fucking metal. I can officially die happy.”<br /> \n<b>“Losing My Blues” (feat. Olve Abbath Eikemo, Frank the Baptist, Chris Holmes)</b>\n“We recorded the instrumental for this during <i>Vol. 1</i>, but I wasn’t quite sure of the other ingredients yet. I’m friends with Abbath, who has Bömbers, his Motörhead tribute band, so I asked him to do his Lemmy imitation. The first time he did it, he was drunk, and all the stuff he sent was out of control. But he did it again, and I love the result. And then we got Chris Holmes because I had already got Doug [Blair] from the new W.A.S.P. incarnation on the record, so I thought it’d be awesome to have the original W.A.S.P. guitarist on the same record, because I’m a huge W.A.S.P. fan.”<br /> \n<b>“Year of the Snake” (feat. David Vincent)</b>\n“I’ve been trying to do a collaboration with David Vincent for ages. I reached out to him during the <i>Apostasy</i> era of Behemoth because I wanted him to sing ‘Inner Sanctum’ with us. He was into it, but he asked for a certain amount of money.

Here, much-loved Baroque violin concertos are given a 21st-century revamp. Swedish violinist Christian Svarfvar happily acknowledges Richter’s inspiration and asked Johan Ullén to recompose these four Bach concertos in a similar spirit. The result is thrillingly imaginative. Taking a phrase, reharmonizing it, playing it upside down or backwards, yet never losing sight of the original, Ullén has done a terrific job, and Svarfvar and the London Philharmonic Orchestra play it with enormous spirit. A genuinely invigorating act of veneration that crosses the ages.","short":"Beloved Baroque violin concertos are given a thrillingly imaginative revamp."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1591653802","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591653802?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9c/be/e4/9cbee4e2-45c2-e603-8eb5-20e54845abea/840200508346_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"392728","textColor2":"231111","textColor4":"3c2b2b","textColor1":"1f0c0d","bgColor":"a19795","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bergsonist","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/toxic-materialism-ep/1591653802","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Toxic Materialism -

Born in 1944 in Boa Esperança, Brazil, Freire gave his first public recital at the age of five. From there, nothing seemed to stop him. Major competition prizes and studies with legendary teachers shaped him into a thoughtful musician possessing a rare sensitivity and a dynamic range envied by his fellow pianists. In this recording celebrating 70 years on the concert stage, Freire pays homage to some of the most renowned pianists of the early 20th century, including fellow Brazilian Guiomar Novaes, the extraordinary virtuoso Leopold Godowsky, and the magisterial Arthur Rubinstein. But he also takes us back in time to his childhood, and pieces that captivated the young Nelson and sent him on his way. Here, he guides us through the works he’s chosen to play.<br />\n<b>Orfeo ed Euridice, Wq 30 Melodie (Arr. Sgambati)\nBy Christoph Willibald Gluck</b>\n“If there’s one piece that feels totally magic, it’s this one. I’ve played it many, many times as an encore; these days, it almost seems to play itself. It used to be very popular on the concert stage: The great Brazilian pianist Guiomar Novaes used to perform it—as did Rachmaninoff. And then it was forgotten. Nowadays, more young people are discovering it.”<br />\n<b>Hornpipe in E Minor, Z.T685\nBy Henry Purcell</b>\n“I also got to know this hornpipe through Guiomar Novaes. She played it as an encore at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall in 1967. I was there. She wanted to make some sort of gesture for England, so she played this charming, simple piece by Henry Purcell. Audiences love it.”<br />\n<b>Sonata in D Minor, K. 64, and Sonata in B Minor, K. 377\nBy Domenico Scarlatti</b>\n“I included these two sonatas because I wanted to pay homage to my past, not just to historic pianists. I played both of these in recitals when I was very young—when I was around 10. And so I felt it was important to include them here.”<br />\n<b>Aspirations, Op. 39: 1. Vers l’azur\nBy Zygmunt Stojowski</b>\n“I encountered Stojowski, again, through Novaes. When she arrived in New York in the first half of the 20th century, she wanted to study with the great pianist Paderewski, but because he was traveling so much, he suggested Stojowski instead. When Novaes died, I was given many of her scores, and one of them was Stojowski’s ‘Vers l’azur.’ He’s a forgotten composer now, but this little piece is very beautiful.”<br />\n<b>Miscellanea, Op. 16: 4. Nocturne in B-Flat Major\nBy Ignacy Jan Paderewski</b>\n“Paderewski’s nocturne is a beautiful, soft little piece. For years, it was completely forgotten, but I think people are now beginning to play it more. This is another of my homages to Guiomar Novaes, who recorded the piece in the 1920s. I’ve got it at home—it’s a wonderful recording.”<br />\n<b>6 Lieder, Op. 17, TrV 149: 2. Ständchen (Arr. Godowsky)\nBy Richard Strauss</b>\n“There’s a 1957 recording of Novaes playing this—it’s one of her best, and what she does with it really is a work of art. It’s clear why she was regarded as part of a golden age of pianists. Godowsky’s arrangement of Richard Strauss’s ‘Ständchen’ is wonderful.”<br />\n<b>Lyric Pieces\nBy Edvard Grieg</b>\n“I like to play the <i>Lyric Pieces</i> whenever I’m at the piano, although I’ve not played many of them in public yet. I love them so much—they’re so unpretentious and so inspiring, and so full of character and inspiration. I first fell in love with Grieg’s piano pieces after hearing the great pianist Walter Gieseking play them.”<br />\n<b>Melody in F, Op. 3, No. 1\nBy Anton Rubinstein</b>\n“I know Rubinstein’s ‘Melody’ thanks to a recording by Josef Hofmann. It’s a very popular melody—even those who don’t go to concerts will perhaps know it. It’s a lovely piece. Hofmann’s pupil Shura Cherkassky has made a wonderful recording of it, too.”<br />\n<b>2 Poèmes, Op. 32: 1. Poème in F-Sharp Major\nBy Alexander Scriabin</b>\n“Scriabin’s ‘Poème’ is my modest homage to pianist Vladimir Horowitz. It’s a very sensual piece, with a lot of character. I adore it.”<br />\n<b>13 Preludes, Op. 32\nBy Sergei Rachmaninoff</b>\n“I played both of these preludes in a concert in Rio de Janeiro when I was young. I find that as I get older, I get closer to my early years. It almost seems as though the past life is tricking you.”<br />\n<b>3 Fantastic Dances, Op. 5\nBy Dmitri Shostakovich</b>\n“I had very good teacher in Brazil who always wanted me to play different styles of music. I played these three pieces when I was seven, I think, in my first recital in Rio, alongside Mozart and Chopin. The Shostakovich was quite modern for me at that time! A friend of mine heard me play it recently and said, ‘You play it like a child.’ That’s because it's a piece that belongs to my very early childhood.”<br />\n<b>Goyescas - Suite: 4. Quejas ó la maja y el ruiseñor\nBy Enrique Granados</b>\n“Rubinstein used to play this piece a lot. It’s a piece my teacher gave to me when I went to Vienna. She wrote a dedication on the score: ‘Nelson, this piece was written for you.’ And that was a constant reminder that I had to play it. That's why it’s on this recording.”<br />\n<b>Scènes d’enfants: 5. Jeunes filles au jardin\nBy Federico Mompou</b>\n“My teacher back in Brazil, Nise Obino, used to play this, and of course I wanted to play all the pieces that she played. In 1959, Mompou was in Brazil and I asked him to autograph my score. He told me that he had composed so many pieces, but that people only knew this one!”<br />\n<b>España, Op. 165: Tango in D Major (Arr. Godowsky) and Navarra (Compl. Sévérac)\nBy Isaac Albéniz</b>\n“Novaes recorded the tango in the 1920s and I loved it when I heard it, and I now play it quite often as an encore. The Godowsky transcription is sophisticated but also very beautiful. It’s one of his best. ‘Navarra’ was one of Rubinstein’s war horses—I started playing it when I was 13. I don’t play it often as an encore, but I remember in Paris I performed de Falla’s ‘Nights in the Gardens of Spain,’ and because it ends so quietly, I had to play something else. So ‘Navarra’ became part of my encore repertoire!”","short":"The great pianist talks us through pieces that inspired and shaped him."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1590088957","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590088957?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/27/28/dc/2728dcc9-55a7-d77e-80b7-b5b4d192a607/634457080928.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"bfcce1","textColor2":"e2e5f6","textColor4":"b4c6ee","textColor1":"efebe6","bgColor":"004ccc","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mr Twin Sister","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/al-mundo-azul/1590088957","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Al Mundo Azul","recordLabel":"Twin Group","upc":"634457080928","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Twin Group","playParams":{"id":"1590088957","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1591300936","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591300936?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2f/94/cb/2f94cb43-4cff-b7e9-7f60-1473f9d4100f/840200508322_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"00be5e","textColor2":"fbbc04","textColor4":"c99603","textColor1":"00ee76","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Deekapz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/super-funk-ep/1591300936","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"Super Funk - EP","recordLabel":"Deekapz / Selva Discos","upc":"840200508322","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Deekapz / Selva Discos","playParams":{"id":"1591300936","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1591306948","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591306948?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/aa/0e/09/aa0e09b0-6477-6a8e-a92c-100d70fb5f7a/196292719741.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"31280d","textColor2":"161614","textColor4":"42381a","textColor1":"010303","bgColor":"f1c032","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Petey","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lean-into-life/1591306948","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-17","name":"Lean Into Life","recordLabel":"Terrible Records","upc":"196292719741","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Terrible Records","playParams":{"id":"1591306948","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}}]}
