Now, DJ Khaled has a special holiday gift for you: a year-end megamix of the biggest tracks of 2021. “Something that I love to do when I make records is putting the best people all on one record,” Khaled tells Apple Music. “So for this mix, it was real great to be able to put the top hits—the best of the best—all on one mix. You know what I'm saying? The dream team. All-Star Weekend. But in music.” Hear all your favorites this year in one place, and read on to see what Khaled says about a few key tracks.<br />\n<b>DJ Khaled, “EVERY CHANCE I GET” (feat. Lil Baby & Lil Durk)</b>\n“Maybe I'm biased because it's my record, but me, Lil Baby, and Lil Durk—the record, it got a certain energy. It's for sure one of the rap anthems of the year. And for sure for the summer, because the fans was playing it like crazy. But it just connected with people in so many ways. It just was so anthematic.”<br />\n<b>Drake, “Way 2 Sexy” (feat. Future & Young Thug)</b>\n“I love that record, because I feel like they talking about me, you know what I'm saying? If it wasn't his record, that should have been my record. That's how much I love that record. It survived.”<br />\n<b>Justin Bieber, “Peaches” (feat. Daniel Caesar & GIVĒON)</b>\n“From R&B to hip-hop or whatever—these the biggest records of the year. But ‘Peaches’ by Justin Bieber, that was big. I love that record, I love the video.

Following the federal incarceration that threatened to derail his once-burgeoning career, he put in the considerable time and effort it takes to earn such a distinction.<br />\nAcknowledging the sonic and thematic similarities shared between his previous two albums, <i>Real Hasta la Muerte</i> and <i>Emmanuel</i>, for his latest full-length he turned his gaze outward beyond the trap and reggaetón worlds he’d been operating in as an elite artist. In this, he found a kind of existential kinship in the stories of others, an instantly recognizable slate of icons from beloved ballers Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant to contentious fighters Muhammad Ali and Conor McGregor and even GOAT rappers Drake and 2Pac. “When I was at my lowest, I started to think about these legends that really inspired me,” he says. “They all reached legend status, but they all went through a lot of things.”<br />\nThrough their infamously lived experiences—both the ups and the downs—Anuel saw parallels to his own tumultuous life and translated those to creative ends. “I went through hell and back—and that's how I found this concept,” he says. “I found my strength and my faith and hope in these legends.” Spending a seemingly inordinate amount of time in the studio without actually releasing much in the way of new music, he pondered struggles and successes alike, ultimately resulting in this revelatory album that reflects what he describes as “a new phase” in his life and his art. “I see myself fighting for my life, fighting for my career, fighting to be the best, fighting for the culture, fighting to make this Spanish industry bigger,” he says. Below, Anuel explains the stories and inspirations behind some of his favorite songs on <i>Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren</i>.<br />\n<b>“Real Hasta la Muerte”</b>\n“I really wanted that type of intro like when Meek Mill did ‘Dreams and Nightmares.’ Where I'm from in Puerto Rico, the last song I could remember that really had a big impact in the streets was a diss song by Hector El Father dissing Don Omar. It was almost the same concept, but that was more reggaetón. He had the voices; I just did it with trap. It's been a long time since I put out what I feel is like savage music, the savage music I used to do back then. Thank god I went through this process with my probation; I finished my probation. So there's a lot of things I could express through my music, a lot of things that happened daily in the streets, and not getting problems by saying it just because I'm rapping about what happens in the streets every day. I could talk about anything I want to. I think I got lost in the process and I found myself.”<br />\n<b>“North Carolina”</b>\n“First off, Eladio Carrión, right now he's my favorite Spanish trap rapper. I've worked with a lot of people, and sometimes people ain't used to working with somebody that works like [me]. I work really fast. It's a lot of years of experience. And working with Eladio, it was legend. I know he gonna be here for a while, because he works like a professional. He just be dropping bars and going in. More important than everything else, he mad humble.”<br />\n<b>“Dictadura”</b>\n“I had a big record that was really special in my career, in the beginning, when I only had trap records, before I went to prison. It was called ‘Ayer.’ It was my first song on the radio, so it helped me a lot with getting more parties, more shows. And ‘Dictadura,’ it has that essence. It has that Anuel from ‘Amanece,’ from ‘Hipócrita,’ that original Anuel, the one everybody loves, that natural me.”<br />\n<b>“Llorando en un Ferrari”</b>\n“That's the last song I recorded for the album. Me and Mora did it together in the studio. When we started to work on the first two, three bars and the type of beat it had, I was like, nah, this got to go [on]. I just got to keep the balance with the first singles, with the trap music, and the reggaetón side with my fanbase, and it's going to be lit. For real, I've never felt so secure with a song in the mainstream area since 'China.' So, god willing, it’s going to be big.”<br />\n<b>“Pin”</b>\n“This one is my favorite song. It is a really special song to me. It's really deep. It was something about that piano. Lately, I've been sitting down writing my songs, like how I used to do back then. So I focus a lot on the bars. What makes it more special is, if you listen to it and you know about my music career, you listen to that beat and it's going to remind you of 'Sola.' That was the biggest hit I had when I was in prison. And we got Bad Bunny at the end. All of a sudden, nobody expects it. He's legendary in the end singing one of his most legendary, iconic hooks in his whole career. The fans gonna love it.”<br />\n<b>“Leyenda”</b>\n“I feel like I'm just starting. I've accomplished a lot of things in Puerto Rico, but I really think everything is just starting for real. I want all the smoke. I'm focused, working a lot. The team is bigger now. It's more powerful, a lot of positive vibes.”","short":"“I went through hell and back—and that's how I found this concept.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MTtBjQEt7i752hISXjKqA"}},{"id":"1590035691","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590035691?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/73/6d/7c/736d7cfb-c79d-c9a9-4170-5e71d008dea1/886449666430.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4cbc5","textColor2":"dfd1b4","textColor4":"bcb6a1","textColor1":"eaebe2","bgColor":"2d4b53","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Adele","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/30/1590035691","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"30","recordLabel":"Columbia","upc":"886449666430","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Melted Stone under exclusive license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1590035691","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Right then, I’m ready,” Adele says quietly at the close of <i>30</i>’s opening track, “Strangers By Nature.” It feels like a moment of gentle—but firm—self-encouragement. This album is something that clearly required a few deep breaths for Tottenham’s most celebrated export. “There were moments when I was writing these songs, and even when I was mixing them and stuff like that, where I was like, ‘Maybe I don't need to put this album out,’” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Like, ‘Maybe I should write another.’ Just because music is my therapy. I'm never going into the studio to be like, ‘Right, I need another hit.’ It's not like that for me. When something is more powerful and overwhelming [to] me, I like to go to a studio, because it's normally a basement and there's no fucking windows and no reception, so no one can get ahold of me. So I'm basically running away. And no one would've known I'd written that record. Maybe I just had to get it out of my system.”<br />\nBut, almost two years after much of it was completed, Adele did release <i>30</i>. And remarkably, considering the world has been using her back catalog to channel its rawest emotions since 2008, this is easily Adele’s most vulnerable record. It concerns itself with Big Things Only—crippling guilt over her 2019 divorce, motherhood, daring to date as one of the world’s most famous people, falling in love—capturing perfectly the wobbly resolve of a broken heart in repair. Its songs often feel sentimental in a way that’s unusually warm and inviting, very California, and crucially: <i>earned</i>. “The album is for my son, for Angelo,” she says. “I knew I had to tell his story in a song because it was very clear he was feeling it, even though I thought I was doing a very good job of being like, ‘Everything’s fine.’ But I also knew I wasn’t being as present. I was just so consumed by so many different feelings. And he plucked up the courage to very articulately say to me, ‘You’re basically a ghost. You might as well not be here.’ What kind of poet is that? For him to be little and say ‘I can’t see you’ to my face broke my heart.”<br />\nThis is also Adele’s most confident album sonically. She fancied paying tribute to Judy Garland with Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson (“Strangers By Nature”), so she did. “I’d watched the Judy Garland biopic,” she says. “And I remember thinking, ‘Why did everyone stop writing such incredible melodies and cadences and harmonies?’” She felt comfortable working heartbreaking bedside chats with her young son and a voice memo documenting her own fragile mental state into her music on “My Little Love.” “While I was writing it, I just remember thinking of any child that’s been through divorce or any person that has been though a divorce themselves, or anyone that wants to leave a relationship and never will,” she says. “I thought about all of them, because my divorce really humanized my parents for me.”<br />\nThe album does not steep in sorrow and regret, however: There’s a Max Martin blockbuster with a whistled chorus (“Can I Get It”), a twinkling interlude sampling iconic jazz pianist Erroll Garner (“All Night Parking”), and the fruits of a new creative partnership with Dean Josiah Cover—aka Michael Kiwanuka, Sault, and Little Simz producer Inflo. “The minute I realized he [Inflo] was from North London, I wouldn’t stop talking to him,” she says. “We got no work done. It was only a couple of months after I’d left my marriage, and we got on so well, but he could feel that something was wrong. He knew that something dark was happening in me. I just opened up. I was dying for someone to ask me how I was.”<br />\nOne of the Inflo tracks, “Hold On,” is the album’s centerpiece. Rolling through self-loathing (“I swear to god, I am such a mess/The harder that I try, I regress”) into instantly quotable revelations (“Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get”) before reaching show-stopping defiance (“Let time be patient, let pain be gracious/Love will soon come, if you just hold on”), the song accesses something like final-form Adele. It’s a rainbow of emotions, it’s got a choir (“I got my friends to come and sing,” she tells Apple Music), and she hits notes we’ll all only dare tackle in cars, solo. “I definitely lost hope a number of times that I’d ever find my joy again,” she says. “I remember I didn’t barely laugh for about a year. But I didn’t realize I was making progress until I wrote ‘Hold On’ and listened to it back. Later, I was like, ‘Oh, fuck, I’ve really learned a lot. I’ve really come a long way.’”<br />\nSo, after all this, is Adele happy that <i>30</i> found its way to the world? “It really helped me, this album,” she says. “I really think that some of the songs on this album could really help people, really change people’s lives. A song like ‘Hold On’ could actually save a few lives.” It’s also an album she feels could support fellow artists. “I think it’s an important record for them to hear,” she says. “The ones that I feel are being encouraged not to value their own art, and that everything should be massive and everything should be ‘get it while you can’… I just wanted to remind them that you don’t need to be in everyone’s faces all the time. And also, you can really write from your stomach, if you want.”","short":"“Some of the songs on this album could really help people.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21jF5jlMtzo94wbxmJ18aa"}},{"id":"1595216366","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1595216366?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/cc/ff/4e/ccff4e86-715f-2aea-1303-968f41b033c6/886449747429.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3839","textColor2":"39231c","textColor4":"5d4b45","textColor1":"0d0c0d","bgColor":"ede9e6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bryson Tiller","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-different-christmas/1595216366","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Christmas","Music","Holiday"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"A Different Christmas","recordLabel":"TrapSoul/RCA Records","upc":"886449747429","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 RCA Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1595216366","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In Bryson Tiller's hands, Christmas music gets a sexy and soulful twist, nostalgic but decidedly modern. Perhaps that's why his holiday offering is titled <i>A Different Christmas</i>—there are few standards and no bells or holly, but the singer nevertheless captures the spirit. Songs like “be mine this christmas” and “presents,” which features Kiana Ledé, check off all the lyrical staples of the season while also doubling as the kind of R&B songs that have replay value long after the tree is taken down. Elsewhere, his take on “i'll be home for christmas,” a dulcet a cappella ballad, and “winter wonderland,” a wholesome duet with his daughter Halo, maintain their familiarity without sacrificing personal touch. There are few clichés here despite the conspicuousness of the theme, and true to memorable holiday albums of the past, Tiller's take ultimately feels true to the artist who made it.","short":"Christmas music gets a sexy, soulful twist."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52QMK9SFNjiuz3ipkuVVZu"}},{"id":"1595703335","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1595703335?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/dd/38/37/dd3837f7-de99-eb8a-234d-3fe8f5d8ea12/886449666621.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"6ca3d8","textColor2":"5bbce8","textColor4":"5099ce","textColor1":"7ec9f5","bgColor":"240c65","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trolls-holiday-in-harmony-ep/1595703335","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Holiday","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-26","name":"TROLLS Holiday In Harmony - EP","recordLabel":"RCA Records Label","upc":"886449666621","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ This Complilation (P) 2021 RCA Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1595703335","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1592233403","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592233403?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/17/bd/10/17bd10fa-9ab2-6e46-1c46-720d19d8a242/886449633654.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"609db3","textColor2":"58bee0","textColor4":"499ebf","textColor1":"74bcd2","bgColor":"0e1f3a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"French Montana","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/they-got-amnesia/1592233403","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-19","name":"They Got Amnesia","recordLabel":"Epic/Bad Boy Entertainment","upc":"886449633654","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1592233403","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"It’s no secret that French Montana works well with others. His catalog is steeped in blockbuster collaborations with heavyweights like Drake, Swae Lee, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, and The Weeknd. Over the course of an exceptionally prolific career, his voice has appeared alongside friends so often that one could be forgiven for forgetting that the Bronx-hailing MC is perfectly capable of holding it down by himself. When he decided to call his fourth proper album <i>They Got Amnesia</i>, however, French Montana’s mood was anything but forgiving. The project’s title could be related to an October 2021 Twitter spat where a user challenged followers to “name FIVE French Montana songs without features.” French himself responded, rattling off 14 of his favorite solo records. Setting the record straight online was easy enough, but with <i>They Got Amnesia</i>, French is making sure we know what he’s capable of in real time. <br />\nThe project’s guest list reads like a who’s who of hip-hop playlisting, including Rick Ross, Kodak Black, Lil Durk, Pop Smoke, Doja Cat, Saweetie, Fivio Foreign, Coi Leray, Ty Dolla $ign, and Latto, to name a few. It is produced largely by the ever dependable hitmaking producer Hitmaka. Topically, <i>They Got Amnesia</i> is the French Montana fans have long loved (“Business,” “Bag Season,” “Striptease”), but also with a tiny chip on his shoulder (see “I Don’t Really Care” for an eyebrow-raising audit of the MC's tabloid-worthy dating history). It’s a project that declares French is going to continue doing him, with or without help, even in the instance that he might be needled by a little internet trolling. He distills his philosophy most appropriately on “Appreciate Everything” when he raps, “I don’t count the haters, make the haters count.”","short":"Twenty-one tracks of Bronx-bred hits to remind you."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0dMCnf42bF5BSLhDr2EMyl"}},{"id":"1594970189","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594970189?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/13/04/f0/1304f082-8bbc-12b5-ecff-743c98f2b385/21CRGIM29161.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d413c","textColor2":"432b18","textColor4":"364e46","textColor1":"381b0b","bgColor":"00dbff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"KIDZ BOP Kids","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kidz-bop-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-ep/1594970189","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-26","name":"KIDZ BOP All I Want For Christmas Is You - EP","recordLabel":"KIdz Bop","upc":"00888072291508","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Kidz Bop Enterprises LLC., Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1594970189","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1592739844","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592739844?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/16/73/5a/16735af1-6a9c-8a4a-1664-cf806b2d9bc3/093624874232.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"3a3837","textColor2":"5b0f12","textColor4":"7c3f41","textColor1":"090706","bgColor":"fefefe","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Michael Bublé","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-deluxe-10th-anniversary-edition/1592739844","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Holiday","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2011-10-14","name":"Christmas (Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition)","recordLabel":"Reprise","upc":"093624874232","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"This compilation, ℗ 2021 Reprise Records.","playParams":{"id":"1592739844","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Michael Bublé’s yuletide collection takes some of the season’s most popular songs and invests them with verve.

I also came up with ‘Forever and a Day’ around the same time, so I had the guys come back out to work on them with me. Lyrically, it could be about me or something that happened to somebody I know, or it could be something I made up. It’s like when Black Label says they’ve sold more albums than The Rolling Stones and The Beatles combined. It’s not true, but we dream about it. It’s like George Costanza says: ‘It’s not a lie if you believe it.’”<br /> \n<b>“Destroy & Conquer”</b>\n“This is the whole Black Label mindset. It’s like when you’ve got a large pie with garlic and mushroom from Joe & Pat’s on Staten Island. You destroy and you conquer. When you’re finished doing the dishes, you’ve destroyed. Then you can make your bed and conquer. That’s basically it.”<br /> \n<b>“You Made Me Want to Live”<b>\n“I was reading all these comments that people were making about a guy who had recently passed away. Someone said, ‘You made me want to live.’ And I just thought that’d be a cool title for a song. This person put a bright spot in your life and was a positive influence. And the lyrics are basically from all the comments. I just started piecing together all these cool things people were saying about the guy. Who was he? I’m not giving it away.”<br /> \n<b>“Forever and a Day”</b>\n“There’s always some Beatles floating around in there somewhere. We talk about that all the time. To me, they’re like Goliath casting his shadow upon everything. I had been listening to some singer-songwriter type stuff on the radio, and I was just pedaling on this note on the piano. When I had enough for a song, we had the guys come back out to record some more.”<br /> \n<b>“End of Days”</b>\n“People are like, ‘The video has nothing to do with the song,’ and I always say, ‘Exactly.’ I’m not sure what it’s about, but it’s awesome. Whenever my wife says to me, ‘What are you doing to me down there?’ I always go, ‘Don’t worry. It’s awesome.’ But I don’t really wanna spell out the lyrics. They’re about whatever connection you have to the song. It could be about going to the proctologist. It’s the end of days for my rectum.”<br /> \n<b>“Ruins”</b>\n“As far as the riffs on this song, for me it’s all about the Mount Riffmore of hard rock, which is Cream, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple. So, if you’re writing riffs and you come up with anything remotely close to the zip code of any of those guys, we’re in business. Whether it’s ‘Sunshine of Your Love,’ ‘Into the Void,’ ‘Whole Lotta Love,’ or ‘Smoke on the Water,’ that kind of stuff can be the spark that lights up the whole song. Because once you’ve got a riff, you’re already there.”<br /> \n<b>“Forsaken”</b>\n“This is kinda the same as the last one—once I had the riff, it was on. I just came up with a midtempo thing and then went into a Jimmy Page type thing with a Danelectro on the clean guitars. But the lyrics are about nothing. Like, the last song could be about cleaning your room—it’s in ‘Ruins.’ So, you clean your room and make your bed—you ‘Destroy and Conquer’—but while you’re doing it, you might be ‘Forsaken.’ And the whole thing takes ‘Forever and a Day.’”<br /> \n<b>“Love Reign Down”</b>\n“I wrote this song when my mother passed away when I was doing the <i>No More Tears</i> album with Ozzy. I was just sitting around at the piano at A&M Studios in Los Angeles and came up with it. So, it’s been sitting around since, like, ’90 or ’91. We did a heavy version of it on <i>Stronger Than Death</i> with the same lyrics but a different melody. We were gonna put this one on the box set because we recorded it then, but we decided to save it and put it on the album.”<br /> \n<b>“Gospel of Lies”</b>\n“When my wife says, ‘I’m pretty sure that’s not 12 inches you’re installing inside my body,’ I go, ‘Trust me—it is.’ But she’s never seen it and I’ve never unveiled it. So, then she says, ‘This rhetoric of yours is nothing but a gospel of lies.’ So, that’s where it came from.”<br /> \n<b>“Shelter Me”</b>\n“I tried to keep that descending riff as simple as possible because that’s how all the iconic riffs are. It’s like if you have a box of 64 crayons and I take 60 away—you’ve got to make something with just four. Or those cooking shows where they give everybody a basket with just a couple of ingredients. Everyone pretty much comes up with their own thing. It’s just a matter of where your imagination can take you, which is the beauty of it.”<br />\n<b>“Gather All My Sins”</b>\n“Obviously, this has the Lord Iommi influence with the flat 5. With Black Label, there’s always some kind of Sabbath floating around in the soup. I was just writing riffs one morning and came up with this one. But the song is basically just two parts—the riff and the chorus section. ‘Paranoid’ is pretty much the same way—just two parts. Just make it as simple as you can.”<br />\n<b>“Farewell Ballad”</b>\n“This one’s been sitting around since 2009 or so. I originally recorded the intro for <i>Guitar Techniques</i> magazine in the UK—they asked me to write something people could solo over. So, I did this thing that’s D minor to C to B-flat to A major, just something people could improvise over. And then I was getting tagged on Instagram for years with people playing their version of that piece of music. So, I decided to take that original piece and write a song around it, and that’s how we closed the record.”</b></b>","short":"“It’s about
