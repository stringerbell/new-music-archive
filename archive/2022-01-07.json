You’ve been in the dark for way too long. It’s time to walk into the light and accept your fate with open arms. Scared? Don’t worry. We’ll be there to hold your hand and guide you through this painless transition. But what’s the rush? Just relax and enjoy another hour of commercial ‘free yourself’ music on 103.5 Dawn FM. Tune in.”</i> \nThe Weeknd's previous album <i>After Hours</i> was released right as the world was falling into the throes of the pandemic; after scrapping material that he felt was wallowing in the depression he was feeling at the time, <i>Dawn FM</i> arrives as a byproduct of—and answer to—that turmoil. Here, he replaces woeful introspection with a bit of upbeat fantasy—the result of creatively searching for a way out of the claustrophobic reality of the previous two years. Using the experience of hosting and curating music for his very own Memento Mori radio show on Apple Music as his guiding light, <i>Dawn FM</i> is crafted in a similar fashion, complete with a DJ to set the tone for the segments within. “It’s time to walk into the light and accept your fate with open arms,” the host, voiced by Jim Carrey, declares on the opening track. “Scared? Don't worry.” <br />\nIndeed, there is nothing to fear. The Weeknd packs the first half with euphoric bursts that include the Swedish House Mafia-assisted “How Do I Make You Love Me?” and “Sacrifice.” On the back half, he moves into the more serene waters of “Is There Someone Else?” and “Starry Eyes.” Despite the somewhat morose album cover, which reflects what many feel like as they wade through the seemingly endless purgatory of a life dictated by a virus, he’s aiming for something akin to hope in all of this gloom.","short":"The singer jump-starts the year with a new collection in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2nLOHgzXzwFEpl62zAgCEC"}},{"id":"1603748074","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1603748074?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/03/d0/bb/03d0bbde-4315-8bbb-8880-866fc6fdef6d/810043689243.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"23272b","textColor2":"1d2126","textColor4":"363c41","textColor1":"04080a","bgColor":"9ca5ac","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Gunna","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ds4ever/1603748074","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-01-07","name":"DS4EVER","recordLabel":"300 Entertainment","upc":"810043689243","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Young Stoner Life Records / 300 Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1603748074","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The final installment of the infamous Drip Season franchise has arrived."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02uWB8Kekadkl3yGBoOOcx"}},{"id":"1600999504","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600999504?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/fe/12/23/fe1223c3-b31a-f4fe-5e53-e5e86f324216/21UMGIM35852.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfaf84","textColor2":"e6a25d","textColor4":"be854e","textColor1":"fad6a1","bgColor":"211312","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Halsey","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/if-i-cant-have-love-i-want-power-extended/1600999504","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power (Extended)","recordLabel":"Capitol Records","upc":"00602445363810","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Capitol Records; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1600999504","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“It happened by accident,” Halsey tells Apple Music of their fourth full-length. “I wasn't trying to make a political record, or a record that was drowning in its own profundity—I was just writing about how I feel. And I happen to be experiencing something that is very nuanced and very complicated.” Written while they were pregnant with their first child, <i>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</i> finds the pop superstar sifting through dark thoughts and deep fears, offering a picture of maternity that fully acknowledges its emotional and physical realities—what it might mean for one’s body, one’s sense of purpose and self. “The reason that the album has sort of this horror theme is because this experience, in a way, has its horrors,” Halsey says. “I think everyone who has heard me yearn for motherhood for so long would have expected me to write an album that was full of gratitude. Instead, I was like, ‘No, this shit is so scary and so horrifying. My body's changing and I have no control over anything.’ Pregnancy for some women is a dream—and for some people it’s a fucking nightmare. That's the thing that nobody else talks about.”<br />\nTo capture a sound that reflected the album’s natural sense of conflict, Halsey reached out to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. “I wanted cinematic, really unsettling production,” they say. “They wanted to know if I was willing to take the risk—I was.” A clear departure from the psychedelic softness of 2020’s <i>Manic</i>, the album showcases their influence from the start: in the negative space and 10-ton piano notes of “The Tradition,” the smoggy atmospherics of “Bells in Santa Fe,” the howling guitars of “Easier Than Lying,” the feverish synths of “I am not a woman, I’m a god.” Lyrically,  Halsey says, it’s like an emptying of her emotional vault—“expressions of guilt or insecurity, stories of sexual promiscuity or self-destruction”—and a coming to terms with who they have been before becoming responsible for someone else; its fury is a response to an ancient dilemma, as they’ve experienced it.<br />\n“I think being pregnant in the public eye is a really difficult thing, because as a performer, so much of your identity is predicated on being sexually desirable,” they say. “Socially, women have been reduced to two categories: You are the Madonna or the whore. So if you are sexually desirable or a sexual being, you're unfit for motherhood. But as soon as you are motherly or maternal and somebody does want you as the mother of their child, you're unfuckable. Those are your options; those things are not compatible, and they haven’t been for centuries.”<br />\nBut there are feelings of resolution as well. Recorded in conjunction with the shooting of a companion film, <i>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</i> is an album that’s meant to document Halsey’s transformation. And at its conclusion is “Ya’aburnee”—Arabic for “you bury me”—a sparse love song to both their baby and partner. Just the sound of their voice and a muted guitar, it’s one of the most powerful songs Halsey has written to date. “I start this journey with ‘Okay, fine—if I can't have love, then I want power,’” they say. “If I can't have a relationship, I'm going to work. If I can't be loved interpersonally, I'm going to be loved by millions on the internet, or I'm going to crave attention elsewhere. I'm so steadfast with this mentality, and then comes this baby. The irony is that the most power I've ever had is in my agency, being able to choose. You realize, by the end of the record, I chose love.”","short":"“I happen to be experiencing something very nuanced and complicated.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1587071645","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587071645?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/cd/19/c7/cd19c7b6-8d0e-9c49-00fc-314fc918e881/196292641325.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f1d1d","textColor2":"2a170e","textColor4":"4b2b25","textColor1":"070504","bgColor":"cd7c81","hasP3":false},"artistName":"RuPaul","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mamaru/1587071645","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-07","name":"MAMARU","recordLabel":"RuCo, Inc","upc":"196292641325","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 RuCo, Inc","playParams":{"id":"1587071645","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0a2shuL3OZFJ8SzWPz7Egh"}},{"id":"1599161074","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599161074?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/68/0c/71/680c7107-f7c2-6e55-8ea9-09b935620654/5056321637703.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"3b3938","textColor2":"2e2e2d","textColor4":"545352","textColor1":"100d0d","bgColor":"ebeae6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Burial","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/antidawn/1599161074","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-01-06","name":"Antidawn","recordLabel":"Hyperdub","upc":"5056321637703","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Hyperdub","playParams":{"id":"1599161074","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Burial’s music has always been steeped in atmosphere; the omnipresent sounds of vinyl hiss, rainfall, and cavernous reverb are as much a part of his signature as cut-up breakbeats and mournful vocal melodies. But until <i>Antidawn</i>, the UK producer’s work had almost always remained rooted in dance music. This five-song, 44-minute EP—long enough to qualify as his third album, if he wanted it to—definitively breaks with the club. Like 2017’s <i>Subtemple / Beachfires</i>, <i>Antidawn</i> strips away virtually everything resembling a beat, save for a few brief rhythmic flourishes, so muted they’re barely noticeable beneath the static. What’s left is a purely ambient swirl of brooding synthesizers, crackling white noise, and eerily processed vocal snippets. It can be pretty doleful going: “Nowhere to go,” murmurs a voice in the opening “Strange Neighbourhood.” “I’m in a bad place,” intones another in “Antidawn.” But as is usual for Burial, even the blackest cloud is ringed with blinding light: Church organs suggest a hint of uplift, and many of his chords are major, rather than minor. All five tracks unspool like discrete parts of a single overarching composition; they’re murky enough that it can become easy to feel lost in the fog, casting about for a recognizable landmark. But even at his bleakest, Burial’s world radiates a sense of calm. The overall effect is as hypnotic as it is haunting: Burial distilled to his most desolate essence.","short":"An ambient masterpiece from the bass-music mood setter."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7LtQeOwb04n1ovSnFax21b"}},{"id":"1593932402","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593932402?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/71/d4/24/71d424f1-e941-ffec-9f78-b29b9c8a090a/196292844474.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"464747","textColor2":"292826","textColor4":"4e4e4c","textColor1":"20201f","bgColor":"e0e4e7","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Eric Nam","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/there-and-back-again/1593932402","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-07","name":"There And Back Again","recordLabel":"The Eric Nam Company, Inc.","upc":"196292844474","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 The Eric Nam Company, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1593932402","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/643X6WW2ijEwMLaNjp1dk1"}},{"id":"1598877130","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598877130?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/70/5f/1f/705f1fba-b94d-abaf-9feb-dfec85dcb03f/21UM1IM19576.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d8d3e2","textColor2":"c0db72","textColor4":"a8b773","textColor1":"fcfefd","bgColor":"472878","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cocomelon","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cocomelon-fun-learning/1598877130","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-01","name":"Cocomelon Fun Learning","recordLabel":"Moonbug Entertainment Ltd","upc":"05056467307409","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Treasure Studio Inc","playParams":{"id":"1598877130","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1603111217","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1603111217?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/29/33/f4/2933f406-55a6-c412-fd88-068d959ca503/Cobra_Kai_Vol._1_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4b587","textColor2":"efa252","textColor4":"bf8142","textColor1":"f5e2a9","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Leo Birenberg & Zach Robinson","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cobra-kai-season-4-vol-1-all-valley-tournament-51-soundtrack/1603111217","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["TV Soundtrack","Music","Soundtrack"],"trackCount":32,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-07","name":"Cobra Kai: Season 4, Vol. 1 \"All Valley Tournament 51\" (Soundtrack from the Netflix Original Series )","recordLabel":"Madison Gate Records","upc":"043396567764","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Sony Pictures Television Inc., under exclusive license to Madison Gate Records, Inc.

I think it’s what we’re all looking for. To fall into these different worlds, these stories of love, that glow you have when you're in the twilight of meeting someone.” The singer-songwriter’s third album as DOPE LEMON comes at a time when, almost two years into the pandemic, many will indeed cherish something positive and uplifting. Brighter and bouncier than his first two DOPE LEMON records, <i>Rose Pink Cadillac</i> is, Stone says, “a combination of my dreams, experiences, observations, and stories from other people, all about love.” For Stone, music is the outlet through which he can explain love—it’s the place where he can create, explore, tell stories, and create characters that depict it, in all its forms. “I'm able to sort of disappear on these expeditions of my imagination,” he says. Read on as the Australian artist talks through each track on album three.<br />\n<b>“Rose Pink Cadillac”</b>\n“It’s about that feeling when you're in the twilight of meeting someone new. It's almost like you see this glow around a person, and you can see it happening to yourself in the same way. It’s those simple things, just looking at them and the way they move. At the same time, there's also a destructive part of it where you might love somebody but they don’t allow themselves to be loved in the way that they should. I think we all have that—those stops that can block good stuff happening. And we might want that chance to show them, to unlock that part they're stuck on.”<br />\n<b>“Kids Fallin’ in Love”</b>\n“It’s one of those songs that happened really smoothly. Within a few hours we had a structure and a song, it was just firing in all cylinders in the way of flow. I’d been listening to a lot of Bill Withers and Al Green, and I love how once you hit those harmony parts of the song, you sort of lock in, and you can really feel it in your heart. I met someone in a bar when I was in Colorado, watching them sip on a drink—it’s in the lyrics. It's about those first interactions where you start to do the dance of eventually walking up to each other and being like, ‘Hey you're cool, I like you,’ and seeing how the night unfolds.”<br />\n<b>“Howl With Me”</b>\n“It’s a story I wrote about a girl raised by wolves. One day she wants to escape the forest and start a new life. So she builds a raft, pushes it out into the river, and floats down the stream. She’s got a bottle of moonshine, and she sees this big bear on the shore. She waves at him, she waves the bottle at him. He swims up and jumps on and then they float downriver together, and they sort of form a relationship. It's about them sort of falling in love and then coming to a fork in the road where they have to decide whether to stay together or go their separate ways.”<br />\n<b>“Stingray Pete”</b>\n“I wrote this with Brad Heald; he toured with The Vines for ages and he’s been with DOPE LEMON since the beginning. The setting of the song is out in a desert, and Stingray Pete is one of those guys in the bar that you see down the end of it and he's just sitting there drinking, and you know he's full of stories and wild adventures. So it’s tapping into his life, about where the night leads him, where he ends up.”<br />\n<b>“Sailor's Delight”</b>\n“It’s a really sweet song. It’s about new love, falling into each other's universes, that honeymoon time. You’re with them on an island, walking under the stars, along the beach. The lyrics in the chorus go, ‘Should I take your hand and put it in mine, baby?’ And it’s more kind of asking yourself whether you should you take this hand and make it a forever love, whatever that means.”<br />\n<b>“Every Day Is a Holiday” (feat. Winston Surfshirt)</b>\n“It’s about how every day just comes down to your perspective, your outlook on life. Waking up and looking around, and knowing that no matter what situation you're in or what you're going through, it can change if you allow yourself to see the simple things. And to recognize the beauty of what it is to be here and be alive. It’s a bloody miracle. Sometimes, the simplest things you're missing are right at your feet. And it’s about just looking down and being humbled and blessed by that.”<br />\n<b>“Lovesick Brain”</b>\n“It's about young love—about finding that high school sweetheart and how cool it used to be when you’d just be like, ‘Let's meet at the water tower and just kick around together, have a smoke, have a drink.’ You're just doing really simple kid stuff, but you're in love. When I see it now, you can tell that some kids know it, but some don't really appreciate it. It was so simple, and looking back, we’re like, ‘Holy shit, that was so special.’ Everything is better when you're together, you’re just kicking around. You either know it or you don't—and maybe you learn the hard way as you get older.”<br />\n<b>“High Rollin” (feat. Louise Verneuil)</b>\n“I wanted a French singer on the track, and through the label we went back and forth until we found Louise Verneuil. We chatted on the phone and everything was cool, just instantly, she just got it, she loved the song. She's an amazing all-rounder—actress, singer, songwriter. It's interesting how English translates into other languages. Sometimes there's a poetry that happens just in itself, with a very, a simple line. It can just flip into this really cool way of saying things.”<br />\n<b>“God's Machete”</b>\n“We’re getting towards the end of the album and the mood has changed. It’s about those times where you have the darkness. We all feel when it creeps up and gets the best of us. It’s about how, instead of trying to push it down and hide it away, you can let those monsters have their day, let them run wild and get it out of your system, let it do its thing and fuck you up and then learn from it. Or don't, whatever. It’s how I deal with mental health, sometimes. Just let it fucking rip and ride and own it and then destroy it, or just put it away for a rainy day.”<br />\n<b>“Shadows in the Moonlight”</b>\n“When I picture this song, it’s such a strange image, but there’s a guy. He’s sort of creeping along a branch outside this girl's window. He's kind of a Grim Reaper-type character, and he’s dancing to the tune. He's kind of evil, and the girl is scared, but she also wants to take his hand and go with him because she's curious. There’s some really cool imagery in this one. It was fun to record. It was very Halloween-y.”","short":"“I wanted to make this my love

Limited","playParams":{"id":"1593640310","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“In Norway, Edvard Grieg is a very big deal,” the internationally acclaimed soprano Lise Davidsen tells Apple Music. “When I was growing up, all my family knew who he was. And so it was very, very special to be able to record this album. Because this is our music, in a way.” <i>Edvard Grieg</i> is, then, perhaps her most personal recording to date, a collection of Grieg songs performed with fellow Norwegian and pianist Leif Ove Andsnes. Music, of course, transcends boundaries, but there is always something magical about a composer returning to their roots. “Like Lise says, we grew up with this music, and I've played Grieg from when I was six years old,” adds One Andsnes.<br /> \n\nThose familiar with Grieg’s solo piano <i>Lyric Pieces</i> will find even more intimacy and drama in the songs here. “Grieg was a wonderful writer himself, and he loved poetry,” explains Andsnes. “It really inspired him, and in something like the song cycle <i>Haugtussa</i> there is an epic quality to some of the songs. It’s as if the music reaches another dimension. I really do think that this is his greatest music.” There was no way this album could have been anywhere other than Norway, so its creators both retreated to a spectacular music venue in the heart of the Norwegian port town of Bodø. There, in four uninterrupted days, they were able to devote themselves to this beautiful collection. “I'm really proud of this album,” says Davidsen. “I think that's because we reached the point where we did what we wanted to do—what we felt was right.” Read on as Davidsen and Ove Andsnes guide us through their enchanting album in-depth.<br />\n\n<b>”Haugtussa (The Mountain Maid)”</b>\nLise Davidsen: “I think this song cycle, about a young girl’s love for a boy, represents a lot of the Norwegian spirit, with its immediate contact with nature. This acceptance of something that is bigger than us, not in terms of religion, but in this connection to nature and the idea that we have trolls and all these creatures. I’m not saying we believe in them, but we have accepted that they somehow exist.”\nLeif Ove Andsnes: “There are many parallels with Schubert’s great song cycle <i>Die schöne Müllerin</i>, which is also about love and loss. That’s particularly true in the final song, ‘Bed Gjætle-Bekken’, where the girl sits by a stream and talks to it about her sadness of losing her love. I think the drama is really important here, but sometimes it doesn’t happen so much in performances. Lise, however, brings it out wonderfully.”<br />\n\n<b>”6 Songs”</b>\nLOA: “Musically, these two songs are so interesting, but are very different. “No. 4 Med en Vandlilje” has a fluent melodic line and piano accompaniment, while “No. 2, En Svane” is the opposite. It’s very static and the piano just has these chords. But what chords! It’s on a level with the best Schubert songs. It’s only four minutes long, but it’s totally epic.”<br />\n\n<b>”6 Elegiac Songs”\nLOA: “For me, these songs have very Wagnerian harmonies, and they’re kind of strange. They’re very concentrated, but extremely interesting.”\nLD: “It’s really important to read the text too, which is quite simple, but it communicates these very big feelings about lost love.”<br />\n\n<b>”Melodies of the Heart”</b>\nLD: “I can be honest and say that this was the trickiest one to perform, because it’s been done so many times. But it’s such a beautiful song.”\nLOA: “It sits between simplicity and ecstasy. It’s a very early song, very fresh, very spring-like. It’s all about the big intervals and big breath, and it’s only just over a minute long, too. The piano writing is wonderful; in fact, Grieg made a transcription of it for solo piano.”<br />\n\n<b>”5 Songs, Op. 60: No. 5, Og jeg vil ha mig en Hjertenskjær”</b>\nLD: “This is just so straightforward in its message: ‘I would like to meet someone. And I would like it to happen this way please!’ Of course, there’s a lot packed into this song, but it’s like a fresh breeze.”\nLOA: “Yes, it’s straightforward, but right in the middle, Lise stops singing for a line, and the piano just goes off on its own, playing these exulted harmonies. And it doesn't stop!”<br />\n\n<b>”12 Songs, Op. 33: no. 9, Ved Rondane”</b>\nLD: “For me, one of the reasons why so many of these songs, including this one, are famous is that they’re like a musical stamp on Norway. It’s what foreigners think of Norway: the mountains and the nature, and Grieg describes it all so beautifully in his music.”<br />\n\n<b>”5 Songs Op.69”</b>\nLD: “These songs have such variety from the first to the last, and they encapsulate so many aspects, such as a birthday letter, a snail and a mother’s grave. So there’s everything here. And there’s everything in the piano writing as well. It is so well written.”\nLOA: “Grieg encapsulates it all really amazingly. The song about the snail [“No. 4, ‘Snegl, Snegl!’] has this quirkiness about it. And the first one, ‘Der gynger en Båd på Bølge’ is very dramatic. When you first look at this collection, you think, ‘These songs don't belong together, how can they work?’ But it’s one of those things that makes sense simply because of the contrasts. It becomes its own storytelling.”<br />\n\n<b>”9 Songs, Op. 18: No. 5, Poesien”</b>\nLD: “This song is like someone who has stepped into a church pulpit and said, ‘This is how it’s going to be.’ It’s from a different time, and it’s difficult to bring to 2021 in a natural way. So, I think of myself as delivering the text rather than me personally talking about it. But I do love it, and I love the fact that it’s so different from all the other songs on the album.”\nLOA: “For me, it’s just a very enthusiastic, ecstatic song with wonderful harmonies and great piano writing. It’s absolutely wonderful.”<br />\n\n<b>”6 Songs, Op.48”</b>\nLD: “These songs have everything in them, from ‘Gruß’ and ‘Lauf der Welt’ to ‘Zur Rosenzeit’. Grieg has an amazing ability to write all emotions in five or six songs. That, for me, is what makes them so interesting to sing.”\nLOA: “They’re a real highlight. First, we have the simplicity of ‘Gruß’, and then he switches mood immediately for ‘Dereinst, Gedanke mein’ and we’re in the world of Schubert again. This song has been a favourite of mine for a long time. It has that sort of divine quality of the best Schubert songs. It's universal. It's unbelievable. And then you have the next two songs, which are very playful and improvisatory, and then the last two, which are so dramatic again.”<br />\n\n<b>”12 Songs, Op. 33: No. 2, Våren”</b>\nLD: “Maybe this song is an invitation to album number two! For me, ‘Våren’ describes Norway. We have seasons there in a very clear way. And våren [spring] is one of them. And this song describes how it returns, and what it means. In some part of the country it means getting your life back after the darkness and getting into a different emotional state.”\nLOA: “Sometimes in Norway it feels like one could hibernate for a few months and then come back to life. And that's what this song is about. This person gets, once again, the opportunity to experience life and nature, and the spring.”</b>","short":"“It was special to record this album.
