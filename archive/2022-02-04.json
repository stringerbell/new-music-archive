So if <i>Dope Don’t Sell Itself</i> is indeed the final word on the MC’s drug dealer talk, there are much worse ways to go out.<br /> \n“Sold green, sold white, sold lyrics,” he says plainly on “Million Dollars Worth of Game.” The song, like so many others on the project, is both rife with wisdom and sprinkled with random pieces of the 2 Chainz story. He’s admonishing other MCs for talking too much about their own history in the streets on “Vlad TV,” but is willing to tell us about how he once “made a million dollars bootlegging my own mixtape” on “10 Bracelets.” He’ll talk up his sex game on songs like “Neighbors Know My Name” and “If You Want Me To,” but would also like to be acknowledged for all the work he’s put in as an artist on songs like “Bet It Back” and “Lost Kings.” The project’s title is something of a flex as is, and if there’s something to take from it, it’s that 2 Chainz has always been one hell of a salesman.","short":"The veteran ATL MC tells his story.

That trio of alliteratively titled records—2013’s <i>Bad Blood</i>, 2016’s <i>Wild World</i>, and 2019’s <i>Doom Days</i>—made the London-based indie-pop quartet huge, but they had no urge to try to replicate past glories when it came to making their fourth effort. “Going into this, nearly 10 years into being in the band, we just wanted to fuck with the process and try new things,” leader and chief songwriter Smith tells Apple Music. “We’ve come a bit of a way from me making songs by myself on my laptop in my bedroom.”<br />\nTrue to that approach, <i>Give Me the Future</i> is Bastille’s most ambitious and imaginative album to date. It fuses tricks picked up from their symphonic ReOrchestrated project and Smith’s film score work with Bastille’s knack for widescreen pop. Previously, the group’s albums have been a closed shop impenetrable to the outside world, but here they are very much open for business, with guest spots from actor/rapper Riz Ahmed and London-based singer-songwriter BIM, plus writing pair-ups with Ryan Tedder and Rami Yacoub. “I really wanted to take a bit of that into the album process, and it was quite natural for it to be really collaborative,” Smith says. It’s a record that feels like a manifesto for their bold new phase, where electronic experimentation and organic instrumentation don’t just coexist but seep into the fabric of these synth-pop anthems, where the dystopian themes and technological forbearing also feel like Smith’s most personal work. Here, he takes us on the journey through the record, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Distorted Light Beam”</b>\n“We worked on this over Zoom with Ryan Tedder, and we then took it away and took it into the world of digital dreaming. I had a lot of fun writing the lyrics. It’s the plugging-in moment at the beginning; it sets the scene of this dreaming space where literally anything is possible. It was really fun to fuck around with vocal effects and loads of different synthesizers, and I was really keen to have real strings in there as well to give it a cinematic feel and a Bastille feel.”<br />\n<b>“Thelma + Louise”</b>\n“‘Thelma + Louise’ went through a bit of a journey. I wrote the beginnings of it on a Zoom call in the middle of lockdown with Rami Yacoub, who’s an amazing pop writer and a really good friend. I got really obsessed with the idea of it being about Thelma and Louise, this image of these two empowered, strong female characters in this brilliant, feminist film who’ve rejected the lives that they’re not satisfied with and gone off together to escape. Particularly in lockdown, that felt like such a potent, brilliant, and nuanced image of escapism and one that I really wanted to tap into. We wanted to reflect the time of the film and nod to the late ’80s, early ’90s. There’s definitely flavors of Prince in there.”<br />\n<b>“No Bad Days”</b>\n“I wrote this with some friends after somebody in my family had passed away. I wasn’t intending to write a song about that, but we were in the studio, and this just fell out as I was sitting at the vocoder and singing through the vocoder. We wanted to keep it really simple. It’s certainly the saddest song on the album. I guess in an album of songs about potential futures, this is one that addresses what it would be like to not have a potential future.”<br />\n<b>“Brave New World (Interlude)”</b>\n“‘Brave New World’ was arranged with Jonny Abraham, who is in a band called Public Service Broadcasting. We’ve worked with him a lot and toured with him a lot. He helped arrange our ReOrchestrated shows, so we wanted to bring a bit of that into the album and wanted to make something that nodded to old Hollywood and old cinema. We wanted this to be a swirling dream that leads you out of ‘No Bad Days’ and into ‘Back to the Future.’ The interludes serve to help tell the story as we bounce back and forward in time and in and out of digital dreaming.”<br />\n<b>“Back to the Future”</b>\n“I fucking love this song, and it’s another one that I wrote in that evening with Rami. It nods to quite a lot of sci-fi. I guess it’s a song about this madness of reality at the moment and how tempting it is to want to escape somewhere and fantasize that you can jump back in time and fix things and go back to the future. Obviously, it also nods to the film quite heavily. There’s a lot of sci-fi on the album, and there’s a lot of darkness in the lyrics, but what sci-fi films can do really well is have conversations around quite interesting topics, but also just be really entertaining and escapist. We wanted to strike that balance.”<br />\n<b>“Plug In…”</b>\n“‘Plug In…’ was one of the last songs. I wrote it by myself. A bit like with the track ‘Doom Days’ off our last album, it was an opportunity to address and talk about loads of the themes and topics in and around this album that I’ve been researching and thinking about. I wanted to make something really cinematic and contrast these beautiful, live, real strings with a heavily processed lead vocal. It’s just a brain splurge of all of the things that feel fucked up and ridiculous about reality at the moment.”<br />\n<b>“Promises” (feat. Riz Ahmed)</b>\n“We approached Riz Ahmed for this, and I think he really liked that we were making a pop album that was trying to have interesting and slightly difficult conversations in places. When we chatted, I was referencing the track on Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i> where André 3000 just delivers the entire song [‘Solo (Reprise)’]. I very much wanted to do that with Riz, who’s incredibly thoughtful and has a different perspective to me—to have his brain on these topics and see what he had to say about them because he’s an amazing spokesman and an activist and an amazing rapper.”<br />\n<b>“Shut Off the Lights”</b>\n“I love this song. It feels like us slightly channeling Paul Simon’s <i>Graceland</i> era, and it just makes me want to dance. It’s got loads of our really good friends playing brass all over it, Rittipo playing fucking amazing saxophone, all of our live-touring crew doing the backing vocals, which was a really nice moment in the midst of quite a tough couple of years for them not being able to do what they do. I think it feels really uplifting. It’s almost impossible not to dance to it.”<br />\n<b>“Stay Awake?”</b>\n“I guess this song is asking, ‘If you can have these amazing relationships online or all these amazing lives in a digital space, and you’re not happy with how things are outside of that, is it not incredibly tempting to just want to stay in those spaces for as long as possible, and what does that do to us?’ There’s a line about the freaks and geeks ruling the world—it’s fascinating to see the owners of these tech companies being almost more powerful than entire countries. It’s a strange time.”<br />\n<b>“Give Me the Future”</b>\n“I wrote this with one of my best mates, Ralph Pelleymounter, who’s in a band called To Kill a King. He was my roommate at university. We sat down and wrote it one afternoon and wanted to make something that nodded to Phil Collins and epic, strings-based, midtempo with big drums. It’s about the allure of living in a virtual reality and the endless possibilities, but also the totally addictive nature of it.”<br />\n<b>“Club 57”</b>\n“This is a love letter to Keith Haring and the ’80s New York art-party scene. If you could plug in and go anywhere and be anything, what an amazing place to potentially go and be. I think he’s such a wonderful character, such an inclusive artist who just wanted to take art to everybody, and was just so feverishly, obsessively creating all the time. This song is imagining that we are him arriving in New York with all this hope and optimism and finding this amazing art scene. It’s another hopeful, optimistic, organic party moment within this quite digital album.”<br />\n<b>“Total Disassociation (Interlude)”</b>\n“I guess this is the moment where the character in the album completely loses themselves and gives over entirely to being dissociated and living in a digital world. I wanted to make something that was quite hard beats. I did it on my laptop in the kitchen at home. That gives over to this beautiful, epic string piece. It’s like falling backwards into the infinite bliss of giving over entirely to the digital world.”<br />\n<b>“Future Holds” (feat. BIM)</b>\n“I thought it would be funny to spend an entire album pondering over the future and worrying about it and then finish with a song that’s like, ‘Stop fucking worrying about the future. Snap out of it.’ It’s slightly aimed at myself, just telling me to try and get my head out of worrying about things that I can’t control and try and make the best of what I’ve got. It’s a nod towards my love for Kanye West; I wanted to make a piece of future-gospel. It’s trying to find a hope in the humanity and whatever connection you might have in real life if you’re lucky to have a partner or the people close around you that can get you through from day to day. I wanted to end on a hopeful note, but not a wet one, if that makes sense.”","short":"“We wanted to try new things.” Hear album four in Spatial Audio now."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2A3BFOsrRHn0VQuafW2zYs"}},{"id":"1597698924","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1597698924?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/98/d2/a2/98d2a234-19dd-07a7-3019-99691d535b1e/5059449056647.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e3b3b","textColor2":"541109","textColor4":"76403a","textColor1":"0e0a0a","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Adekunle Gold","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/catch-me-if-you-can/1597698924","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Catch Me If You Can","recordLabel":"Afro Urban Records","upc":"5059449056647","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Afro Urban Records","playParams":{"id":"1597698924","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3b5r0ZryUlByiw2byA2IKn"}},{"id":"1604630693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604630693?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/79/52/50/795250ae-d325-f883-49b2-536b53bc3f44/886449094684.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"dcdddd","textColor2":"f5f4df","textColor4":"d4d4c4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"51565a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jennifer Lopez & Maluma","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/marry-me-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1604630693","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Marry Me (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Sony Music Latin","upc":"886449094684","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Universal Studios/Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC","playParams":{"id":"1604630693","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Say I do to this soundtrack by two pop superstars turned movie costars."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7nm6u7mp61RmClng9Okg1t"}},{"id":"1594160236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594160236?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/34/70/20/34702011-c606-a954-2766-8d48056f0f61/21UMGIM61591.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1cfcc","textColor2":"fff107","textColor4":"d1c406","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"1c1206","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Berlin Philharmonic & John Williams","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/john-williams-the-berlin-concert/1594160236","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"John Williams: The Berlin Concert","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948617081","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1594160236","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Movie score albums don’t get much classier, or more thrillingly played, than this.

After the release of 2018’s standout and star-making record <i>Be the Cowboy</i>, she simply had nothing left to give. “I think I was just tired, and I felt like I needed a break and I couldn't do it anymore,” she tells Apple Music. “I just told everyone on my team that I just needed to stop it for a while. I think everyone could tell I was already at max capacity.” And so, in 2019, she withdrew. But if creating became painful, not doing it at all—eventually—felt even worse. “I was feeling a deep surge of regret because I was like, ‘Oh my god, what did I do?’” she says. “I let go of this career that I had worked so hard to get and I finally got, and I just left it all behind. I might have made the greatest mistake of my life.”<br />\nReleased two years after that self-imposed hiatus, <i>Laurel Hell</i> may mark Mitski’s official return, but she isn’t exactly all in. Darkness descends as she moves back into her own musical world (“Let’s step carefully into the dark/Once we’re in I’ll remember my way around” are this album’s first words), and it feels like she almost always has one eye on her escape route. Such melancholic tendencies shouldn’t come as a surprise: Mitski Miyawaki is an artist who has always delved deep into her experiences as she attempts to understand them—and help us understand our own. More unexpected, though, is the glittering, ’80s-inspired synth-pop she often embraces, from “The Only Heartbreaker”—whose opening drums throw back to a-ha’s “Take On Me,” and against which Mitski explores being the “bad guy” in a relationship—to the bouncy, cinematic “Should’ve Been Me” and the intense “Love Me More,” on which she cries out for affection, from a lover and from her audience, against racing synths. “I think at first, the songs were more straightforwardly rock or just more straightforwardly sad,” she recalls. “But as the pandemic progressed, [frequent collaborator] Patrick [Hyland] and I just stopped being able to stay in that sort of sad feeling. We really needed something that would make us dance, that would make us feel hopeful. We just couldn’t stand the idea of making another sad, dreary album.”<br />\nThis being a Mitski record, there are of course still moments of insular intensity, from “Everyone” to “Heat Lightning,” a brooding meditation on insomnia. And underneath all that protective pop, this is an album about darkness and endings—of relationships, possibly of her career. And by its finish, Mitski still isn’t promising to stick around. “I guess this is the end, I’ll have to learn to be somebody else,” she says on “I Guess,” before simply fading away on final track “That’s Our Lamp.”","short":"“We just couldn’t stand the idea of making another sad, dreary album.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4rcinMUHEWOxpIwJo2sf22"}},{"id":"1607584495","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607584495?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/ea/ce/2b/eace2b23-3b2d-543c-9adf-23a2c97a03ca/886449863563.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"292929","textColor2":"313131","textColor4":"505050","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"cecece","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Yo Gotti","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cm10-free-game/1607584495","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"CM10: Free Game","recordLabel":"CMG / Inevitable II Records","upc":"886449863563","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 CMG / Inevitable II Records","playParams":{"id":"1607584495","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IX0jXUhnaOyc7uqJi5DCT"}},{"id":"1588500100","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588500100?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/d9/68/71/d96871ad-7fbb-16b4-b1f0-f099c2dd96fd/887828050161.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7bfb4","textColor2":"e8ddca","textColor4":"beb6a8","textColor1":"f2e9d9","bgColor":"181822","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Animal Collective","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/time-skiffs/1588500100","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Time Skiffs","recordLabel":"Domino Recording Co","upc":"887828050161","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Domino Recording Co Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1588500100","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Animal Collective emerged from the fringes of New York’s underground in the early 2000s, it was hard to imagine they’d become what they did—a big-tent psychedelic band that could handle festival stages while still pushing the avant-garde; an art project that skirts the mainstream while still making music more visionary and unusual than most of their indie peers.

In Cardiff, recording in a house “on a street full of seagulls,” as she tells Apple Music, “I instinctively knew where all the light switches were and I knew all these sounds that the house makes when it breathes in the night.” Created with co-producer Samur Khouja, the album obscures linear nostalgia to confront uncertainty and modern reality, with stacked horns, saxophones, and synths.<br />\n“For a while I was flitting between despair and optimism,” she says. “I realized that those are two things that don't really have or prompt action. So I tried to lean into hope and curiosity instead of that. Then I kept thinking about the idea that we are all forever connected to everything. That’s probably the theme that ties together the record.” Below, Cate Le Bon breaks down <i>Pompeii</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Dirt on the Bed”</b>\n“This song is very set in the house. It's being haunted by yourself in a way—this idea of time travel and storing things inside of you that maybe don't serve you but you still have these memories inside of you that you're unconscious of. It was the first song that we started working on when Samur arrived in Wales. It’s pretty linear, but it blossoms in a way that becomes more frantic, which was in tune with the lockdown in a literal and metaphorical sense.”<br />\n<b>“Moderation”</b>\n“I was reading an essay by an architect called Lina Bo Bardi. She wrote an essay in 1958 called ‘The Moon’ and it's about the demise of mankind, this chasm that's opened up between technical and scientific progress and the human capacity to think. All these incremental decisions that man has made that have led to climate disaster and people trying to get to the moon, but completely disregarding that we've got a housing crisis, and all these things that don't really make sense. We've lost the ability to account for what matters, and it will ultimately be the demise of man. We know all this, and yet we still crave the things that are feeding into this.”<br />\n<b>“French Boys”</b>\n“This song definitely started on the bass guitar, of wanting this late-night, smoky, neon escapism. It’s a song about lusting after something that turns into a cliché. It’s this idea of trying to search for something to identify yourself [with] and becoming encumbered with something. I really love the saxophone on this one in the instrumental. It is a really beautiful moment between the guitars and the saxophones.”<br />\n<b>“Pompeii”</b>\n“This is about putting your pain somewhere else, finding a vessel for your pain, removing yourself from the horrors of something, and using it more as a vessel for your own purposes. It’s about sending your pain to Pompeii and putting your pain in a stone.”<br />\n<b>“Harbour”</b>\n“I made a demo with [Warpaint’s] Stella Mozgawa, who plays drums on the record. We spent a month together at her place in Joshua Tree, just jamming out some demos I had, and this was one of them that became a lot more realized. The effortless groove that woman puts behind everything, it's just insane to me. She was encouraging me to put down a bassline. That playfulness of the bass is probably a direct product of her infectiousness, but the song is really about 'What do you do in your final moment? What is your final gesture? Where do you run when you know there's no point running?'”<br />\n<b>“Running Away”</b>\n“‘Running Away’ was another song that I worked on with Stella in Joshua Tree. It's about disaffection, I suppose, and trying to figure out whether it's a product of aging, where you know how to stop yourself from getting hurt by switching something off, and whether that's a useful tool or not. It’s an exploration of knowing where the pitfalls of hurt are, because you have a bit more experience. Is it a useful thing to avoid them or not?”<br />\n<b>“Cry Me Old Trouble”</b>\n“Searching for your touch songs of faith, when you tap into this idea that you're forever connected to anything, there's a danger—the guilt that is imposed on people through religion, this idea of being born a sinner. Of separating those two things of feeling like you are forever connected to everything without that self-sacrifice or martyrdom. It’s about being connected to old trouble and leaning into that, and this connection to everything that has come before us. We are all just inheriting the trouble from generations before.”<br />\n<b>“Remembering Me”</b>\n“It’s really about haunting yourself. When the future's dark and you don't really know what's going to happen, people start thinking about their legacy and their identity, and all those things that become very challenged when everything is taken away from you and all the familiar things that make you feel like yourself are completely removed. [During the pandemic] a lot of people had the internet to express themselves and forge an identity, to make them feel validated.”<br />\n<b>“Wheel”</b>\n“In one sense, it is very much about the time trials of loving someone, and how that can feel like the same loop over and over, but I think the language is a little bit different. It's a little more direct than the rest of the record. I was struggling to call people over the pandemic. What do you say? So, I would write to people in a diary, not with any idea that I would send it to them, but just to try and keep this sense of contact in my head. A lot of this was pulled from letters that I would write my friend. Instead of 'Dear Diary' it was 'Dear Bradford,' just because I missed him, but couldn't pick up the phone.”","short":"“I tried to lean into hope and curiosity.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0FHU2NxNeg7sw3pjuUHk5w"}},{"id":"1606791678","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1606791678?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/27/70/63/277063a2-be73-412f-c1dd-3374397db497/886449267156.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"362014","textColor2":"070707","textColor4":"362014","textColor1":"070707","bgColor":"f48649","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Winnetka Bowling League","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pulp-ep/1606791678","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"pulp - EP","recordLabel":"RCA Records Label","upc":"886449267156","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 RCA Records, a divison of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1606791678","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1604666557","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604666557?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f8/7f/e4/f87fe4e2-e6fd-2e7b-e877-8ae48a32522d/840200509145_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"0f292d","textColor2":"221618","textColor4":"2b3b41","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"4dd0e2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"AceMo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/castle-of-mana/1604666557","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-01","name":"Castle of Mana","recordLabel":"Sonic Messengers","upc":"840200509145","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 AceMo","playParams":{"id":"1604666557","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1586070259","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586070259?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/3c/22/7d/3c227d89-9ab2-b556-b8f4-c9ce588c2d91/5054429151442.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":6000,"textColor3":"d4d3c8","textColor2":"d4e8f7","textColor4":"c1c8cc","textColor1":"ebf5f1","bgColor":"754b20","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Black Country, New Road","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ants-from-up-there/1586070259","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Ants From Up There","recordLabel":"Ninja Tune","upc":"5054429151442","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Ninja Tune","playParams":{"id":"1586070259","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Traditionally, a band releases their debut album and heads out for an extended stretch on the road, honing their live chops, twisting their songs into new shapes. But when Black Country, New Road released <i>For the First Time</i> in February 2021, that route was blocked off by the pandemic. Instead, the London-based band set out to tweak and tamper with their experimental post-rock sound for a transformative second album. They might not have been able to travel, but their music could. “By the time the first album came out, those songs had existed for so long that we were very keen to change the way we wrote music,” bassist Tyler Hyde tells Apple Music. The material that makes up their second record, <i>Ants From Up There</i>, soon came to life, the group using the labyrinthine “Basketball Shoes,” which had been around before their debut, as a springboard. “We wanted to explore the themes we’d created on that song,” says Hyde. “It’s essentially three songs within one, all of which relatively cover the emotions and moods that are on the album. It’s hopeful and light, but still looks at some of the darker sides that the first album showed.”<br />\nThe resultant record sees the band hit hypnotic new peaks. <i>Ants From Up There</i>, recorded before the departure of singer Isaac Wood in January 2022, is less reliant on jerky, rhythmic U-turns than their debut (although there is some of that), with expansive, Godspeed You! Black Emperor-ish atmospherics emerging in their place. “Fundamentally, we relearned an entirely new style of playing with each other,” says drummer Charlie Wayne. “We learned a lot about how to express ourselves just for each other rather than for anything else going on externally.” Here Hyde, Wayne, and saxophonist Lewis Evans take us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Intro”</b>\nLewis Evans: “This uses the theme from ’Basketball Shoes,’ compressed into these little micro cells and repeated over and over again. It’s just a straight-up, impactful welcome to the album.”<br />\n<b>“Chaos Space Marine”</b>\nTyler Hyde: “In this song, we allowed ourselves to get out all the stupid, funny joke style of playing. It was just our way of saying yes to everything. There are many things across the album—and in previous songs from the last album—that are seemingly good ideas, but they’ve come about through a joke. I think the rest of the album is much more considered than that. It’s our silly song. It’s a voyage. It’s a sea shanty. It’s a space trip.”<br />\n<b>“Concorde”</b>\nCharlie Wayne: “I love how it follows the same chord progression the whole way through, and it’s driven but very soft. It’s got real moments of delicacy, and it’s a song that we all thought quite a lot about when we were getting it together. When you’re restricted to that one-chord sequence, you want it to feel as though it’s going somewhere and progressing, so the peaks and troughs have to be considered.”<br />\n<b>“Bread Song”</b>\nLE: “It’s like two different songs in one. You’ve got this really quite flowing and free track in a melodic and conventional harmonic way, but rhythmically free and flowing accompaniment to Isaac’s vocals. It feels quite orchestral, and the way that we all play together on this recording is so in sync with each other. We were listening to each other so much, so the swells that one person starts making, people start responding to, and everybody is swelling at the same time and getting quieter at the same time. Then it turns into this almost Soweto, kind of township-style pop tune at the end. It’s a really fun ending to an intense, emotional tune.”<br />\n<b>“Good Will Hunting”</b>\nLE: “This is another slightly silly one, and it’s got a really silly ending which actually never made the cut on the album, but it’s heavily driven by the riff on the guitars. I think at the time we were listening to quite a bit of Kurt Vile, especially rhythmically. I can remember a conversation about when we wanted the drums to come in and to be super straight, super driven. Then for the choruses, rhythmically, to completely flip and not feel like they were big at all. So for both the choruses, the drums are just tiny.”<br />\n<b>“Haldern”</b>\nTH: “We were playing at Haldern Pop Festival in north Germany during lockdown. We’d just been allowed to fly for work purposes, and we were doing this session. We did two performances there, and the second one was a livestream, and we weren’t allowed to play songs that weren’t released. At the time, that left us with not very much that we weren’t already bored with, so we decided to do some improv. It was a very lucky day where we were all very in sync with one another. So ‘Haldern’ was totally from improv, which is not how we write ever.”<br />\n<b>“Mark’s Theme”</b>\nLE: “This is a tune written kind of for my uncle who passed away from COVID in 2021. I wrote it on my tenor saxophone as soon as I found out. I just started playing and wrote that. It’s a reflection on him and my feelings towards him passing away and everything being really bleak. He was a massive fan and supporter of the band, so it felt right to put that on the album and to have his name remembered with our music.”<br />\n<b>“The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”</b>\nCW: “For me, this is about as far away as we went from the first album. Aesthetically, where the first album has moments of real dissonance and apathy, ‘The Place Where He Inserted the Blade’ is very warm and rich and quite uplifting. I think it strikes right to the heart of what the album is for me, which is fundamentally being in the room, making music with my friends.”<br />\n<b>“Snow Globes”</b>\nLE: “This is another tune where we really thought about what we wanted from it before we wrote it. We had examples of things we liked, and one of them was Frank Ocean’s ‘White Ferrari.’ We liked the idea of it almost being like two different bands [playing] at the same time. So you’ve got this quite simple but quite heart-wrenching, fugal-sounding arrangement of all the instruments with a drum solo that is just crazy and doesn’t really relate too much to what is going on in the other instruments. We react to the drum solo, but he doesn’t react to us. It’s that kind of idea.”<br />\n<b>“Basketball Shoes”</b>\nTH: “It’s essentially a medley of the whole album. It’s got literal musical motifs that are repeated on different songs in the album. It touches on all the themes that we’ve been exploring, and it’s the most climactic song on the album. It wouldn’t really make sense to not finish with it, it’s so exhausting. It’s such a journey. I think you just wouldn’t be able to pay much attention to anything that followed it because you’d be so wiped out after listening to it.”","short":"“It’s hopeful and light but still looks at some darker sides.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21xp7NdU1ajmO1CX0w2Egd"}},{"id":"1600743444","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600743444?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/2b/59/71/2b597158-b4a3-dbd0-bf6a-f4f550a96e01/21UM1IM55432.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"381e0f","textColor2":"251e1e","textColor4":"4e2f20","textColor1":"0a0909","bgColor":"f07128","hasP3":false},"artistName":"WizTheMc","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/where-silence-feels-good/1600743444","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Where Silence Feels Good","recordLabel":"NHMS Records / Homemade Projects / 10K Projects","upc":"00842812162763","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 NHMS Records / Homemade Projects / 10K Projects","playParams":{"id":"1600743444","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A quick shot of neon-hued pop jams from the “For a Minute” singer."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6nm33G8Jz3vVXvJiI65HLt"}},{"id":"1604512893","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604512893?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/aa/f2/2b/aaf22b20-5051-0553-b653-f0fa63284f45/840200509114_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c95603","textColor2":"f1660f","textColor4":"c0510c","textColor1":"fb6b04","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"WTCHCRFT","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-ooga-booga-ep/1604512893","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"The Ooga Booga -

Completed more than 300 years ago, in 1720, it presents such technical, musical, and emotional challenges that even today’s greatest players spend a lifetime perfecting it—including Greek virtuoso Leonidas Kavakos. “My highest dream was always to record the solo sonatas and partitas,” he tells Apple Music, a dream he has finally realized on <i>Sei Solo</i>. “Not from a career point of view, but simply to be able to arrive at the point where I felt could bring something new to it.”<br />\nKavakos still remembers the first time he fully appreciated the power of Bach’s solo violin music: In his twenties, he was given a recording of sonatas and partitas by the legendary Baroque violinist Sigiswald Kuijken. “I realized that I wasn’t focusing on the playing, but on the music. This wasn’t playing in the way I was taught—it was violin playing in the service of a style, of a time in history.” The experience affected him so much that he stopped playing Bach in public for more than ten years, spending time practicing it and experimenting with authentic gut strings and different bows. “I needed to absorb everything and create an interpretation that I could be happy with,” he adds. This recording, then, is both a document of a remarkable musical journey and the story of a personal reawakening. Read on as Kavakos talks us through it in-depth.<br />\n<b>Violin Partita No. 3 in E Major, BWV 1006</b>\n“I wanted to start with the <i>Third Partita</i> because the opening movement was later transcribed by Bach for the opening sinfonia of ‘Cantata BWV 29.’ The cantata’s title ‘Wir danken dir, Gott’ [‘We thank you, God’] is something we say not only when we pray, but also in everyday life. For me, this was a reason to begin the recording with this partita. But it’s also a good place to start because all of its movements are of a lighter character. The prelude is incredible. The way the music moves through the movement—with its harmonies and changes of mood—is, for me, the highlight of the whole partita.”<br />\n<b>Violin Sonata No. 3 in C Major, BWV 1005</b>\n“The three sonatas are more serious works—each has four movements, including a prelude and a fugue. This prelude has a very repetitive motif that’s relaxing to listen to because it is so mathematical and so perfectly proportioned that it cleans all the emotions. With Bach, you always feel that everything is in the right place. Everything is in harmony. Lasting over 10 minutes, the fugue is the longest Bach wrote and is one of his most incredible. It has the rhythm of a gavotte, and the challenge is to maintain that dancing, swinging feel throughout, even when the fugue itself is traveling in different directions, constantly repeating and reinventing itself. I sometimes feel as though this fugue is like a journey for the soul. Next comes the largo, the kind of piece you can close your eyes and relax to, before the very virtuosic last movement.”<br />\n<b>Violin Sonata No. 2 in A Minor, BWV 1003</b>\n“The first movement is like a narration, as if it’s telling a story, and it’s full of divine beauty. The fugue that follows is, again, very long and dramatic, but it ends in the key of A major, which feels cleansing, as if looking to a brighter future. But what I feel is really amazing about this sonata is the third movement, which has a continuous, repetitive bassline, which gives the effect of two voices sounding together. It’s one of my favorite encores. It’s also in C major, which, because there are no sharps or flats, feels very pure. And because the final movement returns to A minor, it feels even more cleansing.”<br />\n<b>Violin Sonata No. 1 in G Minor, BWV 1001</b>\n“The opening adagio is just so beautiful. Again, it’s like a narrative, and I try to make it sound like an improvisation. The fugue here is the shortest in all the sonatas, but it’s also the fastest. The theme constantly moves from one layer to another while the bass tries to keep up, like a shadow. The siciliana is in a major key, which adds a feeling of joy to the whole sonata, while the final movement creates an illusion of chords through a rapid series of notes. What I find amazing about Bach’s music is how he meanders from the home key—he takes his listeners to incredible places.”<br />\n<b>Violin Partita No. 1 in B Minor, BWV 1002</b>\n“The partitas are generally of a lighter character, consisting of many movements. But this partita has a remarkable structure, in that each movement has a ‘double,’ which means that each movement has a variation—a brother or a sister, if you like. So, the allemanda, for instance, is very ceremonial, very strong, but its double is like an echo or a reflection. In a similar way, the sarabande feels quite stately, but its double is almost like composed silence. Each double presents the ideas of its partner movement in such different ways, challenging it in dimensions, volume, and structure. And so, I would recommend always listening to each movement and its double as a single piece.”<br />\n<b>Violin Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004</b>\n“The <i>D Minor Partita</i> is composed with the same structure as the other partitas, with an allemanda, a corrente, a sarabande, and a gigue, which is a fantastic movement. Of these movements, I really love the sarabande, and violinists often play it as an encore. But then we come to the final movement, ‘Ciaccona.’ It’s a unique piece in all of Bach’s works, a series of variations that has never been equaled. When I say it has a religious quality, I don’t mean in the sense of the church, but a belief in something supernatural, something we can only try to approach. It’s in three sections: D minor, D major, and D minor again. The opening D minor section is like reality, before the middle section, which represents the dream. Finally, as the chaconne moves back to D minor, we’re faced with having to reach that dream. As we began with ‘We thank you, God,’ we end with the Trinity.”","short":"“Bach takes his listeners to incredible places.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1607554460","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607554460?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/5a/1c/97/5a1c9751-7810-fbf0-568f-1624478caf45/886449876518.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2b2b09","textColor2":"2a300c","textColor4":"4a4e12","textColor1":"040400","bgColor":"cbc82d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"SAFE","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/get-home-safe-part-1/1607554460","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Get Home SAFE (Part 1)","recordLabel":"Bando Recordings/RCA Records","upc":"886449876518","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Bando Recordings, Inc., under exclusive license to RCA Records","playParams":{"id":"1607554460","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1DFMDukfXi9x0okLHjDNd9"}},{"id":"1604286147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604286147?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b1/28/df/b128dfe8-ac07-c009-79d3-ecdabae6032f/5060944571184.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"353535","textColor2":"100f10","textColor4":"403f3f","textColor1":"030203","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"MAN POWER","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/closing-the-loop-ep/1604286147","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Closing the Loop - EP","recordLabel":"Throne of Blood","upc":"5060944571184","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Under license to Throne of Blood Recordings","playParams":{"id":"1604286147","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1600724018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600724018?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d4/c7/3d/d4c73dbe-8238-545b-b778-d821ec1b95f4/0616908742326_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a3acb1","textColor2":"b2c3d1","textColor4":"93a3af","textColor1":"c6cfd4","bgColor":"182027","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lara Downes","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reflections-scott-joplin-reconsidered/1600724018","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"REFLECTIONS: Scott Joplin Reconsidered","recordLabel":"Rising Sun Records","upc":"0616908742326","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Rising Sun Music","playParams":{"id":"1600724018","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1607588223","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607588223?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/dd/c1/38/ddc1387e-ee74-f473-aabf-abd223924129/dj.avbjlqme.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"393939","textColor2":"323232","textColor4":"595959","textColor1":"0a0a0a","bgColor":"f8f8f8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Moore Kismet","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/brownies-lemonade-moore-kismet-live-in-los-angeles/1607588223","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Bass","Music","Electronic","Dubstep"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-16","name":"Brownies & Lemonade: Moore Kismet live in Los Angeles, Jun 16, 2021 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381823306","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1607588223","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4S18dTcAuVNQneDd7J3zw1"}},{"id":"1589791548","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589791548?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/57/8f/7a/578f7a73-7f9c-4a27-eeef-918cc78d7fb2/21UMGIM81023.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d6d6d5","textColor2":"b5d4ad","textColor4":"9bb494","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"33342e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ludovico Einaudi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/underwater-video-edition/1589791548","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical","Piano"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-01-21","name":"Underwater (Video Edition)","recordLabel":"Decca (UMO) (Classics)","upc":"00602445042562","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Decca Records Release;

But it wasn’t exactly planned, the album instead emerging gradually during the lockdowns of 2020. “I just wanted to play the piano every day and try out new ideas on it,” Einaudi tells Apple Music. Those ideas, he says, came to him nearly spontaneously, “almost as if I wasn’t doing it myself.” During his months of improvising, Einaudi noticed that every four or five days, he would come up with a melody or a hook that he enjoyed—a seed of a track that just might make the final cut. All the while, he was toying with the idea that we were all experiencing life in another dimension during lockdown. “When you are underwater, when you are swimming underwater, there is a silence that is different,” he says. “The way you hear the sounds, it’s all different. And you perceive everything in a different state.”<br />\n<i>Underwater</i> is full of calm, from the innocence of the opening track, “Luminous,” to the simple, song-like “Temple White” and the mellow, reassuring lilt of “Indian Yellow.” “The music came from a different, quieter world which I enjoyed very much,” says Einaudi. “Usually, you never have the time to really let your brain, let your body, let your life breathe in a proper way. During lockdowns, there was a lot of time to experiment and to try things without rushing.” Much of <i>Underwater</i>’s otherworldly atmosphere stems from the muffled effect he has achieved on his Steinway piano, lining each of the concert grand’s hammers with an extra layer of felt so that the strings could emit a softer, ringing tone. And in contrast to the six hours of his epic series of albums, 2019’s <i>Seven Days Walking</i>, Einaudi’s intention here was to create a shorter, more succinct experience. “At the beginning, I could not see the possibility of staying with 12 tracks, because there were 30 pieces that I wanted to include,” he admits. “But I wanted to keep everything to under an hour—it’s like when you are writing a book and you don’t want to make it longer than 250 pages.” Here, Einaudi guides us through <i>Underwater</i>, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“Luminous”</b>\n“This piece is very lyrical to me—it feels very much like a song. And what I like about it is that it shares some of the moods of songs from the ’60s. There’s a balance in it between major and minor keys that gives it a melancholic feel, something that is always part of my DNA. It’s similar in mood to another piece on the album, ‘Natural Light.’ In fact, this one, ‘Natural Light,’ and ‘Indian Yellow’ all share the idea of light, which is connected with my passion for analog photography.”<br />\n<b>“Rolling Like a Ball”</b>\n“This would be a very beautiful piece to play on guitar. It has all the qualities of a ballad. I ended up with several versions of this piece and I didn’t know how to include them all. But then, I decided to take just two versions and put them together—the first part from one day, and a softer, more lyrical coda that I came up with on another day entirely. The title is very simple: The music came to me, rolling like a ball.”<br />\n<b>“Indian Yellow”</b>\n“‘Indian Yellow’ is a variation on the harmonies of ‘Natural Light.’ But, of course, it has a different character. It tells the same story but in a different way.”<br />\n<b>“Flora”</b>\n“‘Flora’ has a chorale beginning—a Bach-like introduction that’s a homage to my years of studying his music. But at the same time, I didn’t think too much about that: The music came quite naturally to me. After the introduction, I added a second part that features a repeated chord progression that gets gradually louder and faster.”<br />\n<b>“Natural Light”</b>\n“The end of the ‘light’ trilogy of tracks. It’s in song form and is one of the pieces on the album that I love the most, so I spent a lot of time on it. I tried to include all the different versions that I recorded throughout the process—every time I worked on it, I came up with something different! And so, I did a lot of listening and re-listening to see if there was something missing from the final version.”<br />\n<b>“Almost June”</b>\n“This is a very simple piece—I really love the beauty of its simplicity. It’s almost like a song that you can sing to a child, like a nursery rhyme.”<br />\n<b>“Swordfish”</b>\n“This piece is influenced by my love of the French impressionist composer Claude Debussy, and it has some of the same pianistic styles. The beginning part is almost like music from an ancient legend. The second half is like Debussy—I think it’s quite like the first piece, ‘Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum,’ from his suite <i>Children’s Corner</i>.”<br />\n<b>“Wind Song”</b>\n“‘Wind Song’ is like a waltz, with a very melancholic character. But it has that sort of winter feel you have when the days are really windy and the wind takes away all the bad things of the past, cleaning the air for the future.”<br />\n<b>“Atoms”</b>\n“This is very atmospheric. It almost doesn’t have a melody, as it’s very much based on the harmonies. But at the same time, in those harmonies, there are some hidden little melodies that come out. I like it because although it could be seen as an abstract piece, at the same time there’s a sort of fire inside that keeps your attention, that keeps the piece awake. And so, it never actually becomes an abstract, cold piece.”<br />\n<b>“Temple White”</b>\n“One of the last pieces I composed for the album. It’s a simple song in the same style as another of my pieces, ‘Nuvole Bianche’ [from 2004 album <i>Una Mattina</i>], and it’s also in the same key of F minor. ‘Temple White’ is one of the tracks that just came to me during my months of playing and recording. I discovered this melodic line that I then enjoyed developing into the track you hear on the album.”<br />\n<b>“Nobody Knows”</b>\n“This has an aura of the late ’60s about it. Recently, I really enjoyed watching the documentary <i>The Beatles: Get Back</i>—it’s beautiful and extraordinary, and I really feel a connection with their music. I think, like Bach did in his time, The Beatles distilled the different colors and styles of music of their time into one moment. And so, as I reflect a lot on the music of Bach, I also reflect around the music of The Beatles.”<br />\n<b>“Underwater”</b>\n“This track is like a chorale or a hymn. I decided that this would be the album’s title track because it was the first one that stood out and made me realize that I had found a color for the album, a tone around which I wanted to work. ‘Underwater’ is like the experience of slowing down the world, of breathing in a different way. All of us have experienced this during the pandemic.”\n","short":"\"I just wanted to play the piano every day and try out new ideas on it.\""},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1601241944","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1601241944?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/06/1a/39/061a39a4-e833-b2d6-495b-7797ab4a7545/886449297917.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"38aadd","textColor4":"2d88b0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Christian Thielemann & Vienna Philharmonic","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bruckner-symphony-no-2-in-c-minor-wab-102-edition-carragan/1601241944","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral","Romantic Era"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 2 in C Minor, WAB 102 (Edition Carragan)","recordLabel":"Sony Classical","upc":"886449297917","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Wiener Philharmoniker, under exclusive license to Sony Classical, a label of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1601241944","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1607586314","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607586314?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/d7/eb/ce/d7ebce9d-f0df-918b-50a4-f1aad7e92857/cover_kolsch_applemusic_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1440,"textColor3":"9eb2ba","textColor2":"bbd0db","textColor4":"98aab2","textColor1":"c3dae4","bgColor":"0d1112","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kölsch","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cercle-k%C3%B6lsch-at-tour-eiffel-in-paris-france-dj-mix/1607586314","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance","Electronic"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2017-10-16","name":"Cercle: Kölsch at Tour Eiffel in Paris, France (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381823290","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1607586314","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1583012474","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1583012474?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/82/93/fd/8293fd1c-41c3-7745-a775-bd6079fe7257/21UM1IM16139.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0bab8","textColor2":"9cd5ff","textColor4":"80adcc","textColor1":"ece5e5","bgColor":"120e03","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jean-Michel Blais","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aubades/1583012474","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical","Piano"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"aubades","recordLabel":"Mercury Classics","upc":"00602438806041","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Mercury KX Release; ℗ 2022 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1583012474","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Pianist/composer Jean-Michel Blais started his serious pursuit of musical study at a conservatory in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. Feeling restricted by its course of study, he took a step back for several years, moving around the world and devoting himself to social work and teaching. Yet he never lost his desire to play, and after settling in Montreal, he spent two years writing his 2016 debut album of piano improvisation pieces, <i>II</i>, which was named one of <i>Time</i> magazine’s best albums of the year.<br />\nHis third solo album, <i>aubades</i> (rough translation: “dawn serenades”), comes from an entirely different place. “It was lockdown, and I was in the process of getting a divorce, alone at home after spending two-and-a-half years on tour,” Blais tells Apple Music. He began taking early morning runs, and he learned Russian and orchestration. What resulted from that process is “ultimately a collection of essays,” he says. “What emerges from all these compositions is predominantly the notions of ‘light,’ ‘spring,’ and ‘strength.’ It’s a form of therapy I wrote for myself, rather than succumbing to loneliness.” Here, he talks us through each of the album’s compositions.<br />\n<b>“murmures”</b>\n“It’s an old, very minimalist piece, which could sound a bit like Philip Glass. It evokes an awakening, the start of the day, but also a kind of change. It’s still morning, but it’s another morning. Each instrument introduces itself, comes and says hello, and the piece slowly builds up. We placed a mic in front of each instrumentalist, so you can clearly hear the sounds they make while they play, their breathing, etc. Because behind every instrument, there’s a human being. The flute isn’t just a flute—it’s Myriam! ‘murmures’ is my way of introducing each of the individuals who make up the ensemble.”<br />\n<b>“passepied”</b>\n“It’s obviously from Debussy’s ‘Passepied.’ I love how he’s reclaimed that old Baroque tradition. It’s a bit like what we do in neoclassical music, taking up earlier concepts and reworking them in a more modern style. I thought it would be bold to start off with a piece without piano, because the listener’s going to wonder, ‘But where’s Jean-Michel?’ And that’s who Jean-Michel is now—not just a musician who improvises on his piano, but someone who also composes for other instruments.”<br />\n<b>“nina”</b>\n“I was at a cottage with friends and there was a little girl, Nina, there. I was playing piano, but I couldn’t play too loud and that inspired me to write something delicate. In this case, the dawn serenade is not simply a composition to be played at dawn; instead, it’s music that salutes the morning of life. The title is written in lowercase, like all the others, because we’re all on the same level. Here, the oboe is just as important as the double bass, for example, and to me, that brings a certain gentleness and takes away any form of rigidity.”<br />\n<b>“flâneur”</b>\n“It’s sort of a nod to Chilly Gonzales, with a pop and even slightly jazzy sound, which I’m not in the habit of doing. Unlike ‘passepied,’ which is probably the most classical, this one is relaxed and nonchalant, almost sensual. It’s the <i>flâneur</i>, as Baudelaire would have depicted him, wandering the streets of his city during the pandemic and discovering amazing things.”<br />\n<b>“ouessant”</b>\n“During my most recent tour, I had the chance to do a residency with Yann Tiersen, who lives in Ushant, France’s westernmost island. I was struck by the beauty of the landscape, its rocky headlands, the towering waves, the power of nature, or rather the helplessness of humans. In it, there are a few hints of the theme song to the series <i>The Office</i>, which I was watching at the time, my imagination that’s wandering in Ushant, my heart that’s in the Andes, and my roots that are anchored in the traditional Quebec music that courses through my veins.”<br />\n<b>“if you build it, they will come”</b>\n“There’s a double reference here, first to the movie <i>Field of Dreams</i> with Kevin Costner, and second to what God supposedly said to Noah when he was wondering how he’d bring together all the animals in his ark: ‘If you build it, they will come.’ For me, it means that we mustn’t wait, that we need to take things in our own hands and build our ark; in this case, it’s the album. I composed the pieces; it attracted musicians and created a whole. In fact, that’s the entire philosophy behind this project.”<br />\n<b>“amour”</b>\n“It’s a waltz, the dance that opens a ball or wedding. The piano dances first with the strings, then they are joined by some of the woodwinds, and then together they welcome the brass instruments. There’s this desire to bring others into the dance, continuously, and I think there’s no greater sign of love than that reception, that integration.”<br />\n<b>“yanni”</b>\n“We had one of Yanni’s CDs at home when I was little and it’s thanks to him that I discovered orchestral music. He often composes in 7/8 and I adopted that time signature here in his honor. It’s something that’s slightly kitsch, and larger than life, like the Egyptian pyramids, but it’s also vulnerable.”<br />\n<b>“absinthe”</b>\n“A dawn serenade is not always associated with the start of the day. It can also be at the end of a very long day, after an evening that has stretched on until sunrise. We’ve got a bit of Felix Mendelssohn here, but also Joe Hisaishi and even Chopin, and it’s lilting, like Barbara. It’s that sort of mixture, something that’s somewhat indescribable.”<br />\n<b>“carrousel”</b>\n“I’m thinking here of Satie, who is the precursor of this type of neoclassical music that people listen to today. Like on ‘absinthe,’ there’s an atmosphere that takes us back to Paris in the early 20th century. In the first piece on the album, everyone is there, but as it progresses, the musicians start leaving, one after the other. So, here we’re left with only the piano and strings, and they interact in a melody which culminates with an enormous embrace in B major. It expresses at once naivety, simplicity, and beauty.”<br />\n<b>“doux”</b>\n“‘doux’ is the initial break, the one that most resembles the ‘old' Jean-Michel—melancholic and alone at his piano. There are woodwinds, but very ethereal. In fact, the piece evokes the breakup that set everything in motion. You think to yourself that this masquerade of happiness, joy, and spring is all very well, but occasionally you get tears in your eyes, and you realize that there’s maybe a small wound beneath the surface, an underlying sadness to it all, one that you nonetheless contemplate with optimism, with a willingness to turn it into something positive.”","short":"“It’s a form of therapy for myself,
