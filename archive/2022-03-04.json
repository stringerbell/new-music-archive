The Belgian-born, French-speaking singer and producer, known as Stromae, first caught waves in 2009 with “Alors On Danse,” a self-satirizing, electro-tinged track about someone who tries—and fails—to escape their problems on a dance floor. It became an international club hit and cemented Van Haver’s place as a modernist pop force, eager to slip sobering themes (debt, misogyny, racism, death) inside his fizzy bubblegum creations. On <i>Multitude</i>, his first new album in eight years, he continues to find inspiration in contradictions—darkness and light, joy and pain. “L’enfer,” or “Hell,” an early single that yo-yos from soft piano balladry to lunging, skittering bass, explores the artist’s struggles with mental health. “Sometimes I’ve had suicidal thoughts and I’m not proud of it,” he sings. “Sometimes you feel it’d be the only way to silence them.”","short":"Hear the French-speaking artist's first LP in eight years—in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1610820451","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610820451?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/02/a3/ad/02a3adde-d6fa-1c64-602b-78e5efcf0a7d/886449685578.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cf0010","textColor2":"fa1615","textColor4":"cc1211","textColor1":"fe0014","bgColor":"160000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Marc Anthony","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palla-voy/1610820451","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Música tropical","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Pa'lla Voy","recordLabel":"Sony Music Latin","upc":"886449685578","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC","playParams":{"id":"1610820451","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Over the course of a decades-long career, Latin music icon Marc Anthony has broken the language barrier to become one of the most visible and successful artists of his generation.

RZA, then known for fusing cinematic signatures and Five Percent wisdom with grimy boom bap, shocked many when his first proper solo album leaned into a decidedly electronic mode with lascivious lyricism. A new persona inspired by the exploitation films of his youth, Bobby Digital became a profane fixture of his subsequent projects, up to and through 2008’s <i>Digi Snacks</i>.\n \nNearly a decade and a half later, RZA returns to this once-controversial role for <i>Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Theater</i>. In a twist that feels straight out of the movies, Bobby Digital finds himself pitted against RZA in a battle that’s deeper than rap. DJ Scratch, a hip-hop legend in his own right both behind the ones-and-twos and in the studio, tackles all the production here, leaving RZA to focus primarily on emceeing in the voices of the two personas. After an explanatory “Intro,” this existential dichotomy presents itself across standoffs “Fate of the World” and “Pugilism,” showcasing just how refined RZA’s become as a rapper. And with Scratch’s beat selection closer to the <i>36 Chambers</i> sonics than those of <i>Bobby Digital in Stereo</i> or <i>Digital Bullet</i>, it’s one of the most gratifying projects to come from the Shaolin Cinematic Universe in years.","short":"It’s the return of Wu-Tang favorite Bobby Digital, with a twist."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1607219379","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607219379?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d3/97/a1/d397a13e-d253-cc70-c283-adfdd3a9fca1/075679758255.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"cfcfcb","textColor2":"fff600","textColor4":"cfc803","textColor1":"fffffb","bgColor":"11130e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sueco","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/it-was-fun-while-it-lasted/1607219379","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"It Was Fun While It Lasted","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records","upc":"075679758255","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Atlantic Recording Corporation for the United States and WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the United States.

The thriller tells the story of an up-and-coming Nashville songwriter escaping her past, with an accompanying album of the same name offering a fitting soundtrack. Comprising 12 brand-new Parton-penned and -produced songs, <i>Run, Rose, Run</i> brings together Parton’s many influences—country, gospel, bluegrass, roots—for a collection as dynamic as the novel’s heroine. \n\nStandout tracks like “Big Dreams and Faded Jeans” and “Woman Up (And Take It Like a Man)” reflect the ambition and strength of that spirited protagonist, while also echoing Parton’s own journey from poverty to superstardom. Parton tells Apple Music that she’d originally only planned to co-author the book until the story’s vivid characters started bringing songs to life. “One day I was just working on the dialogue with James and I thought, ‘I need to write an album,’” she says. “‘This is a perfect time to write an album about these characters and about Nashville and something I know a little bit about.’ It wasn't planned in our original deal.

But luckily that experience resulted in a fruitful creative outpouring for her. On her first new release since her 2020 debut album <i>Hey u x</i>, BENEE links up with co-writers like Greg Kurstin, Kenny Beats, Rostam, and regular collaborator Josh Fountain to deepen her dreamy sound without losing the confiding quality of her intimate, murmured vocals. The seven-track <i>LYCHEE</i> EP sees BENEE reflect on spending healthy amounts of time by herself while managing the ongoing presence of anxiety. “I’ve spent a lot of time by myself thinking about my friends, my relationships, and my place in this crazy mixed-up world we are living in,” she says. Below, BENEE explains how that sustained self-examination and strong yearning for new musical horizons guided each track on <i>LYCHEE</i>.\n\n<b>“Beach Boy”</b>\n“This is an LA summer fantasy about a no-strings-attached romance where no one gets hurt.”\n\n<b>“Soft Side”</b>\n“It was great to reconnect with Kenny Beats on this track. He’s so cool to work with. I love everything he creates.”\n\n<b>“Hurt You, Gus”</b>\n“This is about caring for someone a lot but not being able to give yourself to them entirely. I wrote it at the start of my last relationship, when I felt like I was pushing away a bit.”\n\n<b>“Never Ending”</b>\n“One of my personal favourites on the EP. It’s a totally different sound for me. Rostam is an amazing producer: I love his ear for alternative flavours.”\n\n<b>“Marry Myself”</b>\n“This carries on the theme from ‘Beach Boy.’ I’m so happy to be strong enough to enjoy being by myself.”\n\n<b>“Doesn’t Matter”</b>\n“This is a pretty personal song about my OCD, and in it I’m really wondering what it would be like if I didn’t have such high levels of anxiety.”\n\n<b>“Make You Sick”</b>\n“I love that this is <i>so</i> different to anything else I’ve done.

Rather, it feels bigger musically, with dense, layered instrumentals; clear-eyed vocals; and gritty, textured arrangements that always seem to settle in the melancholy of minor keys. “Broken Belief,” which was written during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, and the somber “Ordinary Friend” draw more on uneasy alt-rock than the shimmering elements of disco. Even “Time and Time Again,” one of the project’s most danceable numbers, is a tribute to those early-morning hours after the peak of the party has passed, when the night’s heaviness lifts and the music takes on a spiritual quality. “It was inspired by the passing of a dear friend that happened way too soon,” Howie tells Apple Music, adding that he felt the friend’s presence in the room while the song was created. “It was cathartic realizing the connection to this person will always be there.”","short":"The dance-rock phenoms return with their third album of moody bangers."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1611614415","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611614415?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/75/4b/92/754b922d-e4ac-1496-7137-a82eebcbec9d/22UMGIM17667.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"293c59","textColor2":"071f46","textColor4":"2e4261","textColor1":"01193c","bgColor":"cbcbcd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"BlueBucksClan","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/see-the-difference-ep/1611614415","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"See The Difference - EP","recordLabel":"Out The Blue Records/Capitol Records","upc":"00602445619269","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Out The Blue Records/Capitol Records; ℗ 2022 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1611614415","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1610657999","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610657999?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/63/3a/24/633a24bb-7f80-5f73-3bb4-f57176d33599/22UMGIM14923.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d8dfed","textColor2":"70ebe7","textColor4":"6bcfda","textColor1":"f9ffff","bgColor":"5661a6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Chelsea Cutler","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-i-close-my-eyes-deluxe/1610657999","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"When I Close My Eyes (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602445585335","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 CC Ventures LLC, under exclusive license to Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1610657999","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1610640155","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610640155?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b9/7e/0a/b97e0a2e-3d84-e044-c17e-7546178288d1/22BMR0003157.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"4f4a41","textColor2":"272418","textColor4":"524f46","textColor1":"241d12","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Danielle Bradbery","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-between-the-collection/1610640155","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"In Between: The Collection","recordLabel":"Big Machine Records, LLC","upc":"00843930077731","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Big Machine Label Group, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1610640155","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1610641104","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610641104?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/62/03/2d/62032d50-e93d-f20c-71ab-9f7c9908e9b9/22UMGIM16409.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"424243","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e7e6eb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Valley","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-valley-single/1610641104","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Apple Music Home Session: Valley - Single","recordLabel":"Universal Music Canada","upc":"00602445601479","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Universal Music Canada Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1610641104","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Toronto quartet Valley are noted pop omnivores, and that catholic taste is evident even when they’re stripping things down to piano and acoustic basics.

But their lead-off cover of Rodrigo’s pop-punk rager “good 4 u” relocates the song from the mosh pit to the supermarket PA system. “We wanted to reimagine it as an ’80s ballad and really focus on the vocal and the story,” vocalist Rob Laska tells Apple Music. “It’s the ‘good 4 u’ version that plays at the grocery store while you’re shopping on a Thursday evening.” Elsewhere, Valley’s alt-rock homage “Cure”—which quotes the namesake band’s “Boys Don’t Cry”—gets downshifted into the sort of coffeehouse R&B tune you could imagine soundtracking a late-’90s rom-com, while the BFF blood-pact anthem “Last Birthday” is liberated from its yacht-rock groove and left to float toward the heavens. “We always love opportunities where we can take our songs and let them thrive in a new sonic universe,” Laska says. “We enjoy pulling them apart and imagining another artist recording them—it’s like playing dress-up as a kid, but with your own songs.”","short":"The alt-pop quartet strips down their hits and takes on Olivia Rodrigo."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1610834500","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610834500?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/7b/1c/7b/7b1c7b83-5948-45e0-c41c-e69f349852ab/5059449063850.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"f4cbcb","textColor2":"ffb7c3","textColor4":"f4929b","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"cb0000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bryan Adams","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pretty-woman-the-musical/1610834500","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Pretty Woman - The Musical","recordLabel":"Badams Music Limited","upc":"5059449063850","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Badams Music Limited","playParams":{"id":"1610834500","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1611256740","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611256740?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0b/b1/f8/0bb1f8c0-0ed8-b722-99f6-cd3b1bb3ea22/886449735761.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"40403d","textColor2":"1e1b17","textColor4":"46443f","textColor1":"171615","bgColor":"e4e7de","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Yung Bae","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/groove-continental-side-a/1611256740","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Groove Continental: Side A","recordLabel":"Arista Records","upc":"886449735761","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Arista Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1611256740","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If you’ve been following along over the course of his last six albums, you know a couple of things: One, Yung Bae, aka the LA-based, Portland-reared producer Dallas Cotton, doesn’t take himself too seriously.

But he also turns his attention squarely to house music of the past (Parisian, usually): Check out the filter sweeps on “Disco Body Parts” (with AWOLNATION) and see if you can spot the references to Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.” on “L.O.V.E.” with EARTHGANG, Jon Batiste, and Sherwyn.","short":"The LA dance producer takes another joyride through music’s feel-good past."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1607400716","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607400716?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/f4/ea/ce/f4eace1c-fc05-dca3-b9a4-584699346fc5/dj.atfecqzn.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"0c74d1","textColor2":"ff363e","textColor4":"d12e37","textColor1":"088dff","bgColor":"1a121a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Diplo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/diplo/1607400716","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Diplo","recordLabel":"Higher Ground","upc":"810072042170","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Higher Ground","playParams":{"id":"1607400716","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"For his first solo album in 18 years, Diplo settles his gaze on deep house."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1593899354","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593899354?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/a9/4d/65/a94d65a3-6a45-f903-1cec-e56c1de27e8d/886449563654.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c5c1","textColor2":"faeedc","textColor4":"c8bfb0","textColor1":"f9f6f1","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Peach Pit","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-2-to-3/1593899354","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"From 2 to 3","recordLabel":"Columbia","upc":"886449563654","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1593899354","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1611984334","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611984334?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c3/22/09/c32209d4-4a2c-21bd-b479-535702455340/194690783944_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"d0a46f","textColor4":"a68359","textColor1":"f9f9f9","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"King Von","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-it-means-to-be-king/1611984334","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"What It Means To Be King","recordLabel":"Only The Family Entertainment / EMPIRE","upc":"194690783944","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Only The Family Entertainment / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1611984334","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Upon the release of King Von’s <i>What It Means to Be King</i>, nearly a year and a half after his passing, a charting single from Lil Durk entitled “AHHH HA” finds him confronting the frustration of having to forge on without his friend. “Don’t respond to shit with Von!” Durk shouts on the chorus, imploring himself to ignore the near constant mentions of Von’s name that fill the comments of his social media posts. As difficult as it’s been for King Von fans to move on, as “AHHH HA” reveals, it’s been that much harder for those who knew the MC best. <i>What It Means to Be King</i>, though, is where those who did and did not know Von personally may find some semblance of healing. \n \nThe album is packed with former peers and supporters like Lil Durk, 21 Savage, G Herbo, Moneybagg Yo, Fivio Foreign, Tee Grizzley, and Dreezy. Their voices complement Von’s across the board, helping him to lay out Chicago drill culture in the way he’d become renowned for. Von’s personal rap style, excited and ever aggressive, carves through production from frequent collaborator Chopsquad DJ, as well as Kid Hazel and ATL Jacob. The storytelling that gave him some of his first acclaim is fully intact here (“Where I’m From,” “Trust Nothing,” “Get It Done”), as is a romantic side (“My Fault”). But what his fans and even his friends are most likely to take from <i>What It Means to Be King</i> isn’t something they didn’t already know. When it comes to the legacy of dearly departed King Von, the music we got during the MC’s lifetime had only barely scratched the surface.","short":"A celebration of—and reintroduction to—the fallen MC’s potential."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1605201128","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1605201128?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/be/e6/8d/bee68d7f-e72c-8673-d47a-7f65aa0ad5c3/886449816774.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"aaae97","textColor2":"cfbf9b","textColor4":"aa9f81","textColor1":"cfd2b5","bgColor":"17201c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Elevation Worship","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lion/1605201128","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"trackCount":28,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"LION","recordLabel":"Elevation Worship Records","upc":"886449816774","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Elevation Worship Records","playParams":{"id":"1605201128","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Prolific worship favorites Elevation Worship continue their streak of dynamic live music with <i>LION</i>, the ensemble’s 10th live album and the follow-up to 2021’s Maverick City Music collaboration, <i>Old Church Basement</i>.

Her sixth release, <i>Ghost Song</i>, is no less considered. Taking a diaristic approach to recording her time in the coronavirus lockdowns, Salvant produces 12 tracks that encompass everything from startling versions of Kate Bush, Kurt Weill, and Gregory Porter songs to originals that effortlessly switch her voice from soft balladry to metallic precision and chromatic fragmentations. “People think that I sing love songs, but more and more I’m realizing that I sing about yearning and the imagination that comes from wanting something and not having it. That’s really when we’re at our most creative,” Salvant says. Here, she talks through all of <i>Ghost Song</i>’s tracks.\n \n<b>“Wuthering Heights”</b>\n“My first period of deep obsession with Kate Bush was when I was about 16 and my big sister showed me ‘Wuthering Heights.’ During the pandemic, I started listening to it again and it suddenly occurred to me that I could do a version of the song. At the same time, I was listening to all kinds of ornamental vocal music, and this Irish song—‘Cúirt Bhaile Nua’ by Treasa Ni Mhiollain—that was sung in the Sean-nós a cappella style was on repeat on my phone. ‘Wuthering Heights,’ therefore, came out as a mash-up of these two things that I was obsessing over.” \n \n<b>“Optimistic Voices”/“No Love Dying”</b>\n“This was my pianist Sullivan Fortner’s idea, because the end of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i> song ‘Optimistic Voices’ sounds like the beginning of Gregory Porter’s ‘No Love Dying.’ He thought it would work well together, musically, and then I also realized how they are both incredibly hopeful songs. They are sung at the end of someone’s rope, when there’s absolutely no reason to be hopeful and then, suddenly, you have a flash of optimism. I’ve also always wanted to sing a Gregory Porter song, since he is an incredible songwriter. ‘No Love Dying’ is such an effective song, and it’s so moving in its underpinning of melancholy.”\n \n<b>“Ghost Song”</b>\n“The starting point of the album was ‘Ghost Song,’ which I wrote two or three years ago. It felt like a song that I already knew and that I was remembering. I didn’t intend for the album to touch so frequently on death, but this track is a denial of it. It’s the idea that nothing dies, since there are always things that linger. It’s piggybacking on ‘No Love Dying,’ since we’re continuing the motif that nothing can vanish.”\n \n<b>“Obligation”</b>\n“This is inspired by my friend Robyn O’Neil, who I discovered through a podcast she makes called <i>Me Reading Stuff</i>. She has the best taste in poetry and literature that I’ve ever encountered, and she also ends with a statement, which is that ‘expectations are premeditated resentments.’ That statement is a great mantra to go through life with. It had been going through my head for a long time and this song came out of it.”\n \n<b>“Until”</b>\n“‘Until’ is also something that Sullivan Fortner suggested to me, since he had heard the song while watching the rom-com <i>Kate & Leopold</i>, starring Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, and Sting wrote ‘Until’ for the credits. Sullivan knew I would love it, and so he made this great arrangement for it. I love how evocative Sting is in talking about time in a way that doesn’t feel clichéd. The idea of catching the world in an hourglass is beautiful, and then it inspired the imagery for the next song, ‘I Lost My Mind.’” \n \n<b>“I Lost My Mind”</b>\n“‘I Lost My Mind’ feels like catharsis because it’s really nice to be able to say, ‘I feel like I’m losing my mind.’ It’s a great disclaimer when you’re making anything to say that if you don’t like it, don’t worry, I don’t know where my mind is anyway—can you help me find it? There’s almost something exciting about that feeling where you’re slipping away from yourself. It’s extremely scary, but it also feels good not having to explain things through reason and logic.”\n \n<b>“Moon Song”</b>\n“This song heralds the rest of the album, which is not mind-based. It’s based on a place that I don’t understand. A lot of songwriting comes from that place and it’s what I gravitate towards—the tug-of-war between wanting to be completely clear and understood but also not understanding your own self. It’s a sister song to ‘Ghost Song’ because it’s about the wanting of the thing, not what happens once you have it. It is a love song to the moon. You’ll never get it, but you can gaze at it, and you can imagine what it’s like to be on it.”\n \n<b>“Trail Mix”</b>\n“I was messing around on the piano and Sullivan Fortner heard me and said, ‘You should record that.’ It was a green light from one of my favorite musicians, and even though I’ve never recorded a song where I’m just playing the piano, it ended up being fun and it lightened the record up a little bit. It is me pushing myself to do something that I’ve never done before, and if this album is a diary, then it would not be complete without ‘Trail Mix’ in it.”\n \n<b>“The World Is Mean”</b>\n“I am a Kurt Weill obsessive. I love his music and <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>. His sense of humor matches mine totally. ‘The World Is Mean’ is making fun of its own cynicism, and I love the duality of singing two characters—one who’s asking for some joy and the other who is saying that the world is mean and it can’t be helped. I still have fun singing this song, and I’ll never tire of it, since it’s so strange-sounding.”\n \n<b>“Dead Poplar”</b>\n“This is a love letter that Alfred Stieglitz wrote to Georgia O’Keeffe, and I set it to music, mainly because I wanted to remember it and I feel like songs are the best way to memorize anything. I had these quotes from Alfred Stieglitz stuck on my piano for weeks and eventually I started hearing music with them. I love Georgia O’Keeffe and I like the idea of joining him in serenading her. He is spot-on in distilling what it feels like to be in a relationship with someone, and then he ends it with the image of this dead poplar against a dark sky. It’s pure poetry.”\n \n<b>“Thunderclouds”</b>\n“I was trying to be grateful for everything that was happening to me and saying thank you to even the horrible stuff when I wrote ‘Thunderclouds.’ I was at a place where I was finding gratitude even in things that I was complaining about. The pandemic was a rough period for all of us, and that’s ‘Thunderclouds’ in a nutshell. The thundercloud itself is such a beautiful thing, but it’s also an announcer of doom—I wanted to capture that.”\n \n<b>“Unquiet Grave”</b>\n“‘Unquiet Grave’ and ‘Wuthering Heights’ are one track that we split up, and they mirror each other. ‘Wuthering Heights’ is a song about a ghost that comes to visit at the window and haunts the living, while ‘Unquiet Grave’ is about a person who was alive and who goes to haunt the dead in the graveyard. I like the idea of bothering the ghost and the ghost is telling you to go live your life. ‘Don’t stay here in the past in your nostalgia,’ it says. It was really important to end the album on that note.”","short":"“I wanted this album to have the casual intimacy that a diary might have.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1607570807","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607570807?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/3f/44/8d/3f448d5e-a8f3-5a52-0b49-0ac20fee7db9/190296291111.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"c8c394","textColor2":"fabb87","textColor4":"d7a384","textColor1":"e8e49c","bgColor":"484276","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dora Jar","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/comfortably-in-pain-ep/1607570807","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"comfortably in pain - EP","recordLabel":"Original Sin","upc":"190296291111","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Original Sin","playParams":{"id":"1607570807","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1590901485","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590901485?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/20/ff/83/20ff832f-258d-ae1c-6070-549ffef721f0/886449484171.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1a18a","textColor2":"dcad7f","textColor4":"b68e68","textColor1":"e9c5a9","bgColor":"1f110e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Yo-Yo Ma, Leonidas Kavakos & Emanuel Ax","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-for-three-symphonies-nos-2-and-5/1590901485","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Beethoven for Three: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 5","recordLabel":"Sony Classical","upc":"886449484171","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Sound Postings LLC, under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1590901485","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Harking back to a time long before broadcast or recorded music, or even the easy opportunity to hear a full orchestra, this album brings together two Beethoven symphonies arranged for piano trio.

One in particular, Wolfgang Zimmerman, had sparked Bridwell’s imagination to the point that Bridwell found himself sneaking out to make demos with Zimmerman on the sly, away from the rest of the band. “It wasn’t a plot to overthrow the record,” Bridwell says. “But in the end, it did feel a bit like a mutiny.” The result is music that feels less like a departure from the band’s core sound than a

All Rights Reserved.","playParams":{"id":"1591130052","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In the context of Nilüfer Yanya’s second album, the word “painless” has a few different meanings. “I was enjoying the process of making the record, and thinking, ‘Why do you have to beat yourself up in order to make something?’” the London singer/guitarist tells Apple Music. “Obviously, you have to work hard, but often the idea of really struggling is something that people inflict on others, just because it's the idea they sell to them, like, ‘Oh, you need to go through this.’” Yanya felt that she hadn't given herself enough time and space to make her 2019 debut, <i>Miss Universe</i>—a record based loosely, and playfully, around the concept of self-help and wellness, and what happens when you get too in your head about things. \n\nSo, in the thick of the pandemic, she eased into making <i>PAINLESS</i>, writing the songs more collaboratively—mostly with producer Will Archer—than she had been used to. “I kind of felt a bit like, ‘Am I cheating?’ Because you're sharing the work, it feels lighter,” she says. \"But then because of that, I kind of delved in deeper and it got a bit darker.” (The album title actually comes from the “shameless” lyric “Until you fall, it's painless.”) Those depths can be felt both in Yanya's vocal dynamics and the sense of urgency that underpins much of the album, particularly on opener “the dealer” and “stabilise,” the first single. “I think the rhythm plays a big part in these songs,” Yanya says. “You feel like there needs to be an escape somewhere.” Here Yanya talks through <i>PAINLESS</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“the dealer”</b>\n“It's like when someone's hiding behind their layers, or not being honest, but then also you're not being honest with yourself. My favorite lyric is 'I hope it's just the summertime you grew attached to,' because it's like you're lying to yourself. You’re not saying, 'Oh, it was this person that made the difference, or it was this person that I miss.' You're just saying, 'I had a great time,' and you're not being honest about why.”\n\n<b>“L/R”</b>\n“[Producer] Bullion played me this beat, and it had this pitched drum in it. It just made me feel really happy and warm. It had this kind of marching feeling to it, which I really liked. It took us like a year to finish it, but the initial idea came really quickly. I like the almost spoken element to it, because it sounds like you're speaking rather than singing, but then the chorus is very much singing—and it took a while to get that right. It's kind of about so many things. In my notebook at the time, I'd written, 'Do less things'—like, less is more. That was my thinking behind the song: trying to enjoy simple things and not overcomplicate things.”\n\n<b>“shameless”</b>\n“It's a really intimate song. I felt like it was about someone that's trying to run away from stuff in their life, but they kind of don't have much hope. The vocals are very celestial—not something I really experimented with in the past. At first, I was going to kind of speak the words, but it needed a lighter touch, like something even more delicate.”\n\n<b>“stabilise”</b>\n“That was the first one me and Will did together. All the others kind of grew off that song. It's about environments and the way they impact you, and not being able to escape your environment, taking it with you wherever you go. And it kind of becomes your cage or the way you view things. You know when you've been somewhere too long and then it's hard to imagine the world another way? Definitely a very lockdown song.”\n\n<b>“chase me”</b>\n“I really liked the line 'Through corridors your love will chase me,' because it was like the safe feeling you can get when you know you are loved, but you don't necessarily want it. It's almost like an ego song for me. It's very confident.”\n\n<b>“midnight sun”</b>\n“I was digging into more of an overall feeling and a mood. I feel like it's a song about confidence and finding your own voice in order to speak up, whether that's about your own feelings or bigger issues: ‘I can't keep my mouth shut this time. I can't keep my head down. I'm not going along with this anymore.’”\n\n<b>“trouble”</b>\n“That song is so sad—in a beautiful way, if I may say so. It also felt like quite a brave one for me because it's very different. When I was writing, I was like, 'Am I doing a straight-up pop song?' It's not. I think it definitely has that take on it. The vocals needed to be more intimate. Like one voice, and it just all keeps spilling out. It's quite challenging to sing. ‘Trouble’ is one of those words—I think I heard it in a Cat Stevens song—'Trouble, set me free'—and I really loved the way it was being referred to almost like a person. In the lyrics here, it's something that's quite persistent and it's not going away. Something's definitely broken that you can't fix.”\n\n<b>“try”</b>\n“This one is about getting better, and feeling the need to connect on a deeper level, finding new depths and making new connections, but becoming confused, tired, and dejected with the effort it takes.”\n\n<b>“company”</b>\n“It's about giving up and you're not in a happy place. Originally it started out as, like, you're in a relationship that you are just really not sure about and you're trying to give signs across that you're trying to get rid of someone. But I think the song now is definitely about your inner demons, and they're not really going away.”\n\n<b>“belong with you”</b>\n“I did this with Jazzi Bobbi, who's in my band. She does more electronic stuff, so that definitely comes into play. I feel like builds are always my favorite things in songs, and at the beginning we actually tried to overcomplicate the song and there was like a whole other section and it changed tempo and it just wasn't working. And I was like, 'We just need to keep building and that's it.' What it's about is like you're tied into something, but you know you're too good for it or you want to leave. I feel like these are all the songs, in a way. It’s like, escape—but you can't escape.”\n\n<b>“the mystic”</b>\n“It's about watching other people get on with their lives and feeling like you're being left behind. I spend a lot of time doing music, so that's where I put all my energy, and I was like, 'Oh, I thought we were all still doing that.' Other people have got other plans and you're like, 'Oh, you're a grown-up. You're going to move in with your boyfriend,' or, 'Oh, you can drive now.' The verse is really sad, because it's about watching that happen, and feeling very insecure and unconfident.”\n\n<b>“anotherlife”</b>\n“For me, this has a completely different energy. It's kind of like you're admitting you're lost now, but in a parallel universe or in the future, you won't always be lost. It's not always bad to be in that kind of lost, super-emotional, flung-out state. I find sometimes when something bad happens and you get really upset, it's kind of— I don't want to say cleansing, but you see things with this new kind of brilliance and clarity. And that's kind of a beautiful moment.”","short":"“I kind of delved in deeper and it got a bit darker.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1586765145","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586765145?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/03/5e/65/035e65a1-1873-8a3f-b25d-18d9bb3736b6/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"aaafbe","textColor2":"aebcd8","textColor4":"8f9db4","textColor1":"cfd3e4","bgColor":"141e25","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sabaton","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-war-to-end-all-wars/1586765145","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"The War to End All Wars","recordLabel":"Nuclear Blast","upc":"4065629630768","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Nuclear Blast","playParams":{"id":"1586765145","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Swedish power-metal champions Sabaton are known for writing many songs—and concept albums—about war. Their 10th full-length, <i>The War to End All Wars</i>, is a sequel to their 2019 album, <i>The Great War</i>, which focused on World War I. “We felt there were several stories we were leaving behind on the last album, like the Christmas Truce and The Harlem Hellfighters,” vocalist and keyboardist Joakim Brodén tells Apple Music. “We wanted to cover them, but we didn’t have the right music at that time. When we started touring the album, so many people got in touch, telling us about even more World War I stories we did not know about. Then, of course, the pandemic hit in the middle of the tour, when we’d only covered half the world. So, we thought, ‘Hmm…maybe we should do another one.” Below, he tells the often incredible stories behind each song. \n \n<b>“Stormtroopers”</b>\n“Many people have written us, ‘You should make a song about <i>Star Wars</i>,’ but in this case we are talking about German shock troops, or stormtroopers, and these smaller elite groups of soldiers that developed a faster form of warfare. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had the Jägers, and the Italians were experimenting with the Arditi soldiers, but the stormtroopers are the classic example. This is the first proper song on the album, with a faster double kick drum start to get things going.”\n \n<b>“Dreadnought”</b>\n“This is one of my favorites on the album, both musically and the topic itself. The song sounds like it could have been done by Sabaton in 2005 or 2008 or now, but it’s not like a copy of anything else we’ve done, so it’s weird how it feels very Sabaton but very timeless at the same time. We usually write about the human side of warfare, but sometimes a piece of technology is such a game-changer, so we did a song about the Dreadnought battleship and the Battle of Jutland. The name of the ship says it all: fear nothing.” \n \n<b>“The Unkillable Soldier”</b>\n“Adrian Carton de Wiart was Belgian-born and fighting for the British in World War I but had also fought earlier in the Boer War and further back. He was almost like a comic book character, this over-the-top super-soldier who just wouldn’t die no matter what the enemy threw at him. He’s one of the craziest people I’ve ever read about, so we decided to do something different for him. It’s a playful song, somehow.” \n \n<b>“Soldier of Heaven”</b>\n“On <i>The Great War</i>, we felt we didn’t represent the Southern Fronts so well. We were sort of getting lost in the Red Baron and all the low-hanging fruit. So, we decided to dive into the events in the Alps on White Friday and how soldiers are still, to this day, frozen up there, not yet dug out because we don’t know where they are. I think, late last year, archaeologists found another site up there. So, this song is a tribute to the fallen that never came home.” \n \n<b>“Hellfighters”</b>\n“The 369th regiment were The Harlem Hellfighters, the African American and Puerto Rican unit. Back in those days, the Americans wouldn’t really want to fight with them, so they were sort of handed off to the French, who called them the Men of Bronze. They were the unit that served the longest at the frontline. Obviously, people were in World War I for a long time, but you’d rotate in and out of the front every week or two. But these guys were there for six months—that’s just brutal. And you want a heavy metal song title? It doesn’t get much better.” \n \n<b>“Race to the Sea”</b>\n“King Albert of Belgium refused to surrender, even when he only had about five percent of Belgium left to command. So, he decided to flood the area to prevent it from falling into German hands. Then, he fought shoulder to shoulder with his men, and even had his 12-year-old son at the front, delivering messages. For a sovereign to be actively involved in fighting at this time was unheard of.”\n \n<b>“Lady of the Dark”</b>\n“Milunka Savić is probably the most-decorated female soldier of all time. She took her brother’s place going into the war and was known as a badass with grenades. She dressed like a man in the beginning, but eventually she dropped this pretense after being wounded.”\n \n<b>“The Valley of Death”</b>\n“This is the Bulgarians and British fighting it out again and again at the Battle of Doiran. The British finally got through on their third or fourth attempt, and when they got there, the Bulgarians were gone. After the war, the British considered the Bulgarian commander, Vladimir Vazov, a true gentleman opponent. They actually invited him to do a guest lecture at a military college, and he went over to the UK several times after the war.”\n \n<b>“Christmas Truce”</b>\n“On Christmas Eve 1914, on several places along the Western Front, soldiers on both sides waved the white flag and played football and drank beer together. This was actually several unconnected events where they decided, ‘Let’s not kill each other today.’ They even sang Christmas carols and showed each other pictures of their loved ones. And then, they had to go back to killing each other only a few hours later.

Like Stereolab, Broadcast, and Pizzicato Five before her, the Toronto-based singer-songwriter is fluent in musical languages of the past (lounge, old Hollywood soundtracks, ’60s folk-pop) and has a gift for making kitschy, easy-listening sounds feel personal, substantive, even transportive—the latter a quality that gives otherwise ordinary musings a cosmic lightness (“Alone But Not Lonely”). Then you learn that Bussiere played basically all of it herself—the guitars, the bass, the sparkling harp arpeggios and swirling violins—and you get it: She’s not just writing songs, she’s building a place she can retreat to, three minutes at a time.","short":"On her debut LP, Hannah Bussiere builds a place she can retreat to."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1608960008","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1608960008?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/a9/62/6c/a9626cb0-9788-b0c6-6065-531e57a6305e/192641942167_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"b1b1b1","textColor2":"86d6ea","textColor4":"78b8c8","textColor1":"cdcdcd","bgColor":"424242","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Krewella","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-body-never-lies/1608960008","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"The Body Never Lies","recordLabel":"Mixed Kids Records","upc":"192641942167","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Mixed Kids Records","playParams":{"id":"1608960008","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Passions run high on the sisters’ bass- and breakbeat-driven LP.","short":"Passions run high on the sisters’ bass- and breakbeat-driven LP."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1599591120","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599591120?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d8/a4/15/d8a415da-14bc-bd5c-e3ba-b15da994a7ff/Midnight_-_Let_There_Be_Witchery.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"76af7b","textColor2":"a2ca8e","textColor4":"86a674","textColor1":"8fd696","bgColor":"14150f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Midnight","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-there-be-witchery/1599591120","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Let There Be Witchery","recordLabel":"Metal Blade Records","upc":"039841949223","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Metal Blade Records","playParams":{"id":"1599591120","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1608029797","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1608029797?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2608,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ec/2b/cc/ec2bcc76-ef4b-4c39-b908-2514e7b6b930/0880655512932.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2608,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"1e254c","textColor4":"4b516f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Glimmers, Golden Bug, Leroy Hanghofer & The KDMS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lost-gomma-mixes-2022-remastered-ep/1608029797","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Lost Gomma Mixes (2022 Remastered) -

The Sydney singer-songwriter puts one track, “Ain’t Nobody,” as far back as 2007 or 2008. “It’s just come around when it was supposed to, I guess. Mentally, I wasn’t ready, but now I am.” <i>Strength of a Queen</i> takes the sound, heartbreak, and lovingly crafted detail of classic Americana and marries it to raw, earthy rock ’n’ roll, with most of the songs recorded live with Golledge’s longtime band. “A pretty obvious theme in there is love,” says the singer, who was raised in Tamworth, a regional city about five hours’ drive from Sydney, famous for being Australia's country music capital. “There are a few songs that were inspired by other people’s love and other people’s hardships, but for the most part, every song is about love. Which wasn’t on purpose.” Here, Golledge offers a track-by-track rundown of <i>Strength of a Queen</i>.\n \n<b>“Ghost of Love”</b>\n“Every now and then, I get inspired by certain artists in a way where I’m like, I’d like to write a song that, in my head, would sound like that style of music. This song was birthed from Tom Petty or The Traveling Wilburys; I really wanted to write a fun, upbeat song. It ended up being quite a personal song. It kind of covers my whole journey of coming to Sydney from Tamworth, and all the love that came in between.”\n \n<b>“Strength of a Queen”</b>\n“‘Strength of a Queen’ was inspired by the breakup that a band member of mine had. It’s one of those breakups that wasn’t bad at all; it was just a very interesting thing where both people had two different directions. They just drifted into different paths. It seemed to me that they were perfect for each other. I had this idea to write a song about someone who was waiting around for a woman or whatever to kind of make [them] stronger.”\n \n<b>“New Stamp”</b>\n“When I was starting out in music, I was playing a pub where no one would really listen. I was playing ‘New Stamp,’ but I was playing it very differently; it was more of a folky, soft-spoken song. I couldn’t figure out how I could get people’s attention, so I just started belting it out as you hear on the record and made everyone pay attention. I grew up in the country and the song is about a simple boy who’s happy to just be out fishing or running wild, and then having a sophisticated lover. It’s a punching-above-your-weight kinda vibe, just jammed into a blues song.”\n \n<b>“Rescue Me”</b>\n“You can hear Caitlin [Harnett, vocals/banjo] at the start. I think she says, ‘I think we should all come in at the same time.’ Usually, I would [start the song on] acoustic guitar and the band would shuffle in behind me at some stage. And that’s why you can hear me palm-muting on my acoustic guitar at the start, ’cause I just don’t know when the guys are going to come in, so I’m just going to hit the first note on the guitar when Piltzy [drummer Josh Piltz] starts playing. That’s why, again at the end of the song, Caitlin was like, ‘That’s sick!’ It was the first take, and we had no idea what was going to happen.”\n \n<b>“Love Like This”</b>\n“This is one of the newer songs. It’s about meeting my current partner. Sometimes, when you fall in love, you look for somebody that you aspire to be, and my partner is a very strong woman and terribly inspiring. So, that’s why I called the song ‘Love Like This,’ because it’s hard to find a real love without having all these other worries and doubts and other things inhibiting your view on people.”\n \n<b>“Heavy Hand”</b>\n“That was the first breakup song I ever wrote. I was with a woman from about the age of 17 to 27, so that was my journey from Tamworth to Sydney. You know when you break up with your first partner, you always think you’re going to get back together—that’s what that song is about. Or you’re worried they’ll forget about you. It’s all the kind of uncertainty when you’ve left somebody, and it’s somebody you were a kid with and then an adult with. [Writing this] was my process of getting over it. It’s a long song!”\n \n<b>“Carry On”</b>\n“‘Carry On’ compiles all my breakups into one song. Each verse is about a different person I’ve been with, and the same patterns you fall into. I wrote the song with that perspective recently, just for myself, to have it there to realize you’re traveling the right path and making the right decisions, whether it’s in love or anything else. It’s one of my favorite songs on the record.”\n \n<b>“Ain’t Nobody”</b>\n“‘Ain’t Nobody’ is just about getting really drunk. I still remember when I wrote it. I think it was 6 in the morning, downstairs in the garage of a house I had. I just had this idea about a character who was a horrible person, who would travel around getting drunk and causing shit. But deep down, he’s a sensitive person. It’s probably the only fictional song on the record.”\n \n<b>“Dreamin’ of a Highway”</b>\n“[Live], I would play the whole first verse and chorus without the band, and they would kick in on the start of the second verse. But I just had this thing in my head that [we should all come in] together, because in my head it just sounded much better on the record as a song the whole way through. So, I just mentioned to Piltzy to come in at the start and he did, and that was the take we used. I was like, that’s exactly how I thought it would sound in my head.”\n \n<b>“Babe I Think You Think Too Much”</b>\n“I was seeing someone for a short time who thought way too much, to the point where it was terribly frustrating. And that’s fine: People have anxiety, myself included, but it’s how much energy or anxiety do you want to give to every single aspect of your life?”\n \n<b>“Baby Mumma”</b>\n“Growing up in Tamworth, there wasn’t much to do. I kind of spent my life around a bowling club. My old man was playing bowls, so I just spent my teenage years around alcohol and that environment. And you hit 18 in Tamworth and are like, ‘What are we gonna do? I know, we’ll go to the pub and play the pokies,’ and that’s what we did. And I eventually moved to Sydney and slowly formed a severe gambling habit, and the song was written as a cry for help to my partner at the time about having no money. I basically would budget my life around gambling. It’s evolved into a much more fun, upbeat sing-along song considering where it came from.
