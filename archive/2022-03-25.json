Instead, he made the song <i>mainstream sellout</i>’s opening statement: a concussive, cathartic, two-and-a-half-minute rush of early-2000s pop punk whose chorus comes like a freight train, framed by a scream. “Alienate me, I'm not the one you want,” he roars. “I feel so alienated, like I’m the devil’s spawn.”\n\nIn the wake of 2020’s <i>Tickets to my Downfall</i>, the Cleveland native stays close to blink-182’s Travis Barker, who resumes his role here as executive producer and destroyer of snare drums. (The two now also share a “born with horns” tattoo.) What follows is an open-hearted, period-specific pop-punk record as envisioned by an artist with a rapper’s sensibility, from its many guest features (see: blackbear, WILLOW, Gunna, Young Thug, noted rap-rock enthusiast Lil Wayne) to the seemingly natural ways in which MGK makes the heightened, nursery-rhyme-like melodies of vintage blink (or Green Day) sound as though they’ve been a perfect home for raps all along. “Sleepin’ in, faked sick/Smoked a blunt, had a kid,” he sings on “paper cuts,” a song he dedicates to his late father, amid keening clusters of “Brain Stew”-like power chords. “Don’t belong, I’m a punk/Hello, world, you fuckin’ suck.”","short":"In Spatial Audio, MGK’s pop-punk hybrid hits like a bag of hammers."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3sKZHtQoq3tPtkXbT8PJAc"}},{"id":"1599834043","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599834043?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ae/a6/bd/aea6bd15-6642-7568-d10b-99f77e4b29ff/093624874843.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"232221","textColor2":"0f0d0e","textColor4":"2a2827","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"95918e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Michael Bublé","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/higher/1599834043","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Higher","recordLabel":"Reprise","upc":"093624874843","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Reprise Records","playParams":{"id":"1599834043","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Michael Bublé gets lots of praise for his jazzy, nostalgic cover songs, but he’s just as much of a hitmaker in his own right. Here, on his first studio album in three years, the Canadian crooner flexes both muscles, reinterpreting classics made popular by Bob Dylan (“Make You Feel My Love”), Barry White (“You’re My First, My Last, My Everything”), and Paul McCartney (“My Valentine,” which was produced by Sir Paul himself), while also delivering a clutch of fresh original material. The slow-burning ballad “Mother” honors the strong women around him (“Another word for savior/And another word for saint,” he sings), and the impassioned “I’ll Never Not Love You” is classic Bublé romanticism.\n\nBut there’s something large and life-affirming about these songs that reaches beyond first dance fair—they’re pure, lighthearted, unapologetically joyful. Perhaps that is partly because Bublé's now eight-year-old son Noah is five years into remission from liver cancer, which is the sort of thing that makes every tiny moment feel heaven-sent. Proof: The album’s title track was inspired by something Noah casually improvised one night during bath time (“When you go low, I go high…”). A fleeting, run-of-the-mill moment, but for Bublé, it stuck. A few weeks later, he sang it to Ryan Tedder while the pair were writing in the studio. Noah is credited as co-writer on the final track.","short":"It's true: The crooner king sounds even better in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0pC2nDSKjfCdEth7murfOu"}},{"id":"1614983552","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614983552?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9d/60/16/9d6016fd-63f5-eeff-34ff-9804e92f715e/22UMGIM30752.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f2d2a","textColor2":"25231e","textColor4":"43423d","textColor1":"0c0905","bgColor":"bdbdbb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Daddy Yankee","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/legendaddy/1614983552","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"LEGENDADDY","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602445656585","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 El Cartel Records, manufactured and marketed by Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1614983552","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Daddy Yankee wrote this exclusive message to mark what he says will be his last album:\n\n<i>I’m celebrating my 32-year career with my final musical footprint.

I don't know, what are we doing this for? There's no touring.’ It was sort of this free fall of not being able to tour or write towards a direction, and I feel like that freed us up to write about whatever we wanted.”\n\nThe path between her 2019 album, <i>GIRL</i>, and <i>Humble Quest</i> was one of extreme highs and soul-crushing lows, and it was important to her that the full emotional spectrum was represented in each of its songs. Deafening rock anthems (“Nervous”) and fun, flirtatious jams (“Tall Guys”) follow up sage ballads (“Background Music”), determined motivational anthems (“Humble Quest”), and tear-jerking tributes to gone-too-soon friends (“What Would This World Do?”). In spite of the sadness and grief that inspired some of these tracks, Morris finds peace and contentment in where her <i>Humble Quest</i> leads.\n\n“It's two sides of a coin, and darkness is there to make us see light a little bit better,” she said. “When I was listening to all of these songs, I just felt happy. I felt like [the album] was healing me in whatever I was drowning in. Ultimately, you can scream in an echo chamber as long as you want, but eventually the songs have to be heard by somebody besides you. I guess my hope is when people hear this, it will feel therapeutic and light.”","short":"“My hope is it will feel therapeutic and light.” Hear it in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3BEDHGAd2zJh5dUL4dbmiw"}},{"id":"1615636936","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615636936?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/79/c6/58/79c658f3-522d-d191-c808-76c4b3668e55/196589043474.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d7dfe9","textColor2":"f2ebfd","textColor4":"cdd0e8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"376392","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Latto","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/777/1615636936","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"777","recordLabel":"Streamcut/RCA Records","upc":"196589043474","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Streamcut & RCA Records","playParams":{"id":"1615636936","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4vjE6Rgl5z6K2PhrAtIA7O"}},{"id":"1614925309","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614925309?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/87/2b/df/872bdf7c-193a-44fa-e254-5946a73f9d8c/22UMGIM29244.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"334f5d","textColor2":"0f3347","textColor4":"345765","textColor1":"0d2a3c","bgColor":"cbe4e1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"J Balvin & Ed Sheeran","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sigue-forever-my-love-single/1614925309","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Sigue/Forever My Love - Single","recordLabel":"Universal Music Latino / Asylum Records UK","upc":"00602445736591","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Universal Music Latino / Asylum Records UK; ℗ 2022 Colores, LLC, Exclusively Licensed To UMG Recordings Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1614925309","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1613566792","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1613566792?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/7d/ab/50/7dab50b7-b508-124b-69d0-1fd0b6699032/21CRGIM30671.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"002f64","textColor2":"050a2d","textColor4":"053555","textColor1":"00033f","bgColor":"04e0f6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Denzel Curry","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/melt-my-eyez-see-your-future/1613566792","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Melt My Eyez See Your Future","recordLabel":"Loma Vista Recordings","upc":"00888072426801","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 PH Recordings, LLC., Under exclusive license to Loma Vista Recordings.

On their second LP, guitarist/vocalist Dylan Minnette (known for his work as an actor on Netflix’s <i>13 Reasons Why</i>), lead guitarist/vocalist Braeden Lemasters (also an actor, as seen on <i>Men of a Certain Age</i>), and drummer Cole Preston have pushed their sonic palette to new limits, with the help of all-star producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, HAIM, Adele). “It’s an eclectic batch of songs, that is for sure,” Minnette says. “We almost pictured it to be a little lusher, or R&B-leaning, originally, but we ended up liking Ariel's idea of highlighting the band side of us.”\n\nUnlike their first album, which centered around the concept of what Minnette calls “transitioning out of youth into adulthood,” this one is about, he says, “life-changing decisions,” focusing on both beginning and nurturing a relationship and ending and exiting one, and the title reflects that. “‘Tell me that it’s over’—there’s one meaning, like, ‘This could be easier on us if you were to just end this and then all these feelings that go away,’” Minnette explains. “Or it’s the last line [on the album]: ‘I look forward to a little me and you/So now I hope that you don’t tell me that it’s over.’” Below, the band walks Apple Music through their new album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Hard to Believe”</b>\nDylan Minnette: “‘Hard to Believe’ was not always how we pictured this album starting. Once Ariel decided that he could picture it going in a <i>Pinkerton</i>-era Weezer and my bloody valentine direction, it sparked an idea of having these string stabs opening the song, [and it sounded] really interesting. By the end of the album process, we realized it was the most exciting and unpredictable way to open the next Wallows album.”\n\n<b>“I Don’t Want to Talk”</b>\nMinnette: “We fast-tracked finishing this song last year before we were done with the album, because we didn't want to go too long without putting any music out. It felt like the right song to be the first song back, because its identity is very much a classic Wallows song. It is about insecurity—when you're so invested in someone, and if you're in a position where you have to be away from someone that you are pretty freshly in a relationship with, you start to get all these fears of them turning their head. The first three songs are very much rooted in the beginning of a relationship and the insecurity it can bring out of you.”\n\n<b>“Especially You”</b>\nCole Preston: “I don't exactly know what inspired the swampy instruments. I think the specific references are <i>Midnite Vultures</i>, that Beck record, and weird Beatles-y moments. There’s this legendary banjo/steel guitar multi-instrumentalist named Greg Leisz who plays on a bunch of Ariel's records. Ariel had the idea to have him come and play the banjo. We were like, ‘What the hell?!’”\n\n<b>“At the End of the Day”</b>\nBraeden Lemasters: “The song started with Cole and I at a session. The night before, I was listening to <i>Harvest Moon</i> by Neil Young. It was probably 11:00 at night; we had some wine, and I was just playing some music. I went back and listened to three or four little ideas in my voice memos in the other room, and I heard the guitar part that starts with the synth in the song, and I walked back in. I was like, ‘Why don't we try this idea?’ I just envisioned myself singing like Neil Young in the first verse. I like how the song constantly changes. It had kind of The Cure vibe when we started with Ariel. It went from <i>Harvest Moon</i> to The Cure, a really low-acoustic sludge. Then it went to '80s synth-pop, like a Tears for Fears, New Order kind of vibe, which I love. It has all those identities in it.”\n\n<b>“Marvelous”</b>\nMinnette: “It's the newest song on this album. We started demoing a super midtempo version of this. The melody is so frantic in the song now because Cole sped up the demo and pitched it up I don't know how many times. The demo just sounded insane. I had a baby voice, and it was a really different-sounding song. But Ariel sort of pitched it going in a funky direction. He wanted the song to feel like [Deee-Lite's] ‘Groove Is in the Heart.’ It ended up being really quirky and funky, and we were just having fun with it, really.”\n\n<b>“Permanent Price”</b>\nPreston: “I was scrolling my voice memos and stopped at a random one that was not marked. It happened to be the synth intro to the song. It’s actually us playing guitar, but it sounds like a synth. I brought that to the guys like, 'Why don't we make this a song?' Our original idea was a Brian Eno kind of vibe. We started recording the song, and Ariel, his idea was to take it in more of a ‘Sometimes’ by James direction, which happened to be produced by Brian Eno. We started doing that, and then Dylan wrote these optimistic lyrics that were really cool.”\n\n<b>“Missing Out”</b>\nPreston: “This song has a special place, because we were on tour opening for Vampire Weekend in 2019 [in Europe]. We were driving along, and [our bass player] Blake [Morell] was playing songs in the van, and he played ‘When It's Over’ by Sugar Ray. I hadn’t listened to it since I was a kid, and I just remember being so inspired. When we were flying back to the US, we had a session the next day with John DeBold; we were tired, but I was so inspired in the moment.”\n\n<b>“Hurts Me”</b>\nPreston: “The lyrics were very honest about going through a breakup, the months after that, and wondering if you should even consider talking to that person again or if that's actually not good for you. You're not sure what's going on. 'What's best for me at this moment?' The song is about trying to avoid things that are going to hurt, even if they're beneficial in the moment.”\n\n<b>“That’s What I Get”</b>\nMinnette: “Braeden and I had a session at Ariel’s house, but we didn’t meet him or see him or anything. Cut to two years later, we are in his house and actually working on the album with him on this song. It started out as this early-2000s pop-alternative like Aly & AJ or something. And then it became this hype, big, full-band energy. Ariel started talking about Kate Bush, so we started with this cool, reverb-y programmed drum thing, and it became orchestral.”\n\n<b>“Guitar Romantic Search Adventure”</b>\nMinnette: “It’s interesting to conclude here, because the song is about the beginnings of speaking with someone—simple things like texting someone that you are interested in or falling in love with. It’s a nice optimistic note to end on. Originally, the demo was incredibly lush. There were never any drums. It became very synthy and dreamy. All the feelings that you've gone through in this album, you ultimately land on 'I can see a future for us in a family and I hope that this never ends.'”","short":"“It’s an eclectic batch of songs, that is for sure.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5L6fAzbz2x5oF8l0qluSKm"}},{"id":"1600752276","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600752276?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/6d/56/66/6d5666ee-763a-f7e1-8dee-f1856f2d4011/886449076222.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"232527","textColor2":"150d0e","textColor4":"292a2e","textColor1":"0d0705","bgColor":"7a9cb0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Koffee","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gifted/1600752276","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Reggae","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Gifted","recordLabel":"Sony Music UK","upc":"886449076222","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Promised Land Recordings Limited","playParams":{"id":"1600752276","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I know one song won’t change everything, but all I have is my voice,” Koffee tells Apple Music. “So, that’s what I’ll use to speak out. I might not be affected by certain injustices directly, but living in a place like Jamaica, you can’t avoid the truth of it. There’s youths here that have grown up with violence right on their doorstep, and I’m not just representing myself now—I also must speak out for them.” \n \nIn 2019, the world bowed as Koffee—real name Mikayla Simpson—unveiled her innovative blend of reggae, dancehall, and sculpted rap flows on the Grammy-winning EP <i>Rapture</i>. That was a historic victory, too, seeing Koffee become the youngest and first female winner of the Best Reggae Album award. The pandemic could’ve threatened to slow her rise, but she instead leaned into the rich musical heritage of Jamaica (the spirit of Bob Marley is present on “x10,” while “Lonely” is a stunning ode to ’80s lovers rock) and the expertise of her live band to help craft a gorgeous, rich debut album. “It was about recreating those uplifting vibes that I had in my mind,” she says. “And I’m so happy we were able to, especially during a time that people need us to spread this message. I feel honored when I listen back to these songs, perfectly arranged and beautifully done, feeling like, ‘Yeah, I am gifted.’” Read on for her track-by-track guide to <i>Gifted</i>.\n \n<b>“x10”</b>\n“I came up with this song after a show in Antwerp. I was listening to my Bob Marley playlist, with [1980 single] ‘Redemption Song’ on repeat, alone in my room. In Jamaica, he is pretty much a permanent part of the culture. And we all experience his music from a young age, one way or another. I laid these lyrics down that night as a voice note, and the message is still so true. ‘It’s a pleasure to be outside’ was about coming from Jamaica and having my music take me far away overseas to Belgium. I put that down in 2019; now it’s even more relevant, coming off the pandemic. It’s a <i>real</i> pleasure to be back outside now.”\n \n<b>“Defend”</b>\n“In my heart, I didn’t want this project to be too heavy. On <i>Rapture</i>, the songs are more political, but this one is short and simple—and represents for the fans that love that vibe. I also worked [in the studio] with Kendrick Lamar on this track, which was a really dope experience.”\n \n<b>“Shine”</b>\n“The first part of this song tells a story, a real ghetto story. ‘Sun’s rising, gun violence, police sirens’—that’s a regular day for the youths. This song speaks to them, especially with the Jamaican and Caribbean scene right now pushing this vibe of senseless crime. These artists probably think it doesn’t affect anyone, and some don’t even care if it does. So, consider this song here a counter to that: if someone’s coming with that vibe, cool, I’ll come with this vibe and show you what’s good.”\n \n<b>“Gifted”</b>\n“This one’s a little bit more lyrical, but still very fun. It’s a very Jamaican vibe and a self-affirmation, a simple reminder that whatever happens, you’re ‘guided and gifted.’”\n \n<b>“Lonely”</b>\n“I’ve been trying not to ruminate too hard on lyrics lately, just keep the vibe and let it flow. And I was inspired by John McLean’s music, its real lovers rock vibes, and one of my favorites of his: [1988 single] ‘If I Gave My Heart to You.’ I really love his music, and I would listen to this particular song, thinking, ‘Man, I’d love to pull this off in my own style,’ and together with my band, we came up with our version.”\n \n<b>“Run Away”</b>\n“The vibe that runs through this song—escaping to paradise, running away—is probably as we were away at writing camp. Sat by the seaside, literally. I was thinking, ‘What if we could just get on a boat, go out into the ocean, and just live there with everything we need?’”\n \n<b>“Where I’m From”</b>\n“This is a more hardcore, dancehall track dedicated to Jamaica. When I’m away, I miss the warmth—especially in Europe, where it’s freezing. But I also miss the people. There’s a quote from Martin Luther King. He says, ‘In Jamaica, I feel like a human being.’ And it’s because of the way the people relate to everyone and make you <i>feel</i>. There’s a certain warmth to it that I love.”\n \n<b>“West Indies”</b>\n“During the pandemic, I got the chance to link up with [Jamaican producer and DJ] Iotosh, who I’ve been a fan of for a while, and this beat is so sick. This song represents me in the way that, of course, I’m not immune to sadness or frustration, but I also love to laugh and make the best of any situation. This is about having fun, whatever mood you’re in.”\n \n<b>“Pull Up”</b>\n“Trust me, even if it’s not my reality at the time, or there’s no party, I consider myself a happy enough person to find the vibe within me. Making this was a fun experience. I had a session with JAE5; we had just recorded ‘Shine,’ and we both weren’t done. He’s playing me more and more beats, trying to get another one in—and I knew I would find the right lyrics once we found it, the right one, with this beat. This was a really fun experience in London for me.”\n \n<b>“Lockdown”</b>\n“This was a song I wrote during the pandemic, obviously, but it came really spontaneously. Just as my shows were being canceled, it was also a good time to hit the road and connect with people. I received a call from Popcaan, to come by his studio, hold a vibe, and there I met [Jamaican producer and artist] Dane Ray, who’s responsible for some of [Popcaan’s] biggest hits. I already knew exactly what I was gonna do with this one, and it helps that he’s a great engineer too.”tes go here.","short":"“It was about recreating those uplifting vibes that I had in my mind.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3OcgIT5qeI4lZnaUHqLQLi"}},{"id":"1601410595","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1601410595?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d9/cd/d1/d9cdd101-db77-e10f-6529-1eb7c95cd813/5056556104391_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3500,"textColor3":"253131","textColor2":"28150f","textColor4":"3a3731","textColor1":"0f0d0e","bgColor":"80c1bb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Selah Sue","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/persona/1601410595","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Persona","recordLabel":"Because Music","upc":"5056556104391","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Because Music","playParams":{"id":"1601410595","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5EilDjxUUvRqY1iPoX23ix"}},{"id":"1613448555","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1613448555?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2012,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/41/39/99/4139999c-19e1-bd97-4853-867781dfc9b7/194690793448_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2012,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"f8db2a","textColor4":"c6af21","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Key Glock","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yellow-tape-2-deluxe/1613448555","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":30,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Paper Route EMPIRE","upc":"194690793448","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Paper Route EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1613448555","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Key Glock’s <i>Yellow Tape 2</i>—like its predecessor, 2020’s <i>Yellow Tape</i>, and the project that came between those two, 2020’s <i>Son of a Gun</i>—contains no credited features.

He estimates it was around 70 percent complete before he even began to think about what to call it. “I’ve always just been trying to make the best songs and then consolidate,” the Compton rapper tells Apple Music. He describes his recording process as “sporadic,” but really it seems more like alchemy—a collection of minds transforming silence into magic, culture combusting into sound. “I was really just trying to assemble an amazing team of producers and instrumentalists,” he says. “Whether we jam out over a bunch of live instruments, or a producer comes and plays a bunch of different beats, I would just freestyle, catch a vibe instantly, and just double back and flush it into full records.”\n \n<i>Superghetto</i> is some of Buddy’s most engulfing work. His West Coast rap DNA is prevalent, as always, but it sounds more universal than ever, blended with jazz, R&B, and beachy pop. The cadences (“whatever’s on my heart in the moment”) and subject matter (“my day-to-day experience, remembering how things made me feel”) are varied and colorful. Sometimes, it’s the political ferocity of “Black 2”; at other times, it’s the carefree levity of “Happy Hour.” In his exploration and experimentation, he lands on something that signals evolution, both personal and creative. “These songs sound and feel bigger,” he says, “but it still sounds and feels like me at the same time—the instrumentation, the versatility, and the risks that I’m taking this time around.” Below, he explains the inspiration and production behind each of the album’s tracks. \n \n<b>“Hoochie Mama”</b>\n“I just feel [‘Hoochie Mama’] is what is known to be super ghetto. That is the most ghetto song on the album, I feel like. It’s just the essence of what I’m really trying to change the narrative of—because once you get into the album, it just feels a little different.”\n \n<b>“Ghetto 24” (feat. Tinashe)</b>\n“Me and Tinashe was working on music, and we made a bunch of different songs, and it was just one of those moments where we didn’t know what to work on, but we wanted to work on something. I was going through a bunch of beats, and we really liked that beat. It was the homie Axl Folie made that beat. She went in there and did her parts, and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s hard.’ I started writing—I was trying to rap real good and just kind of got into it. I stepped away for a while to get the second verse and fine-tune the first to make it more album-worthy because it felt so current and ready for people to hear. We just caught a crazy vibe that day.”\n \n<b>“Wait Too Long” (feat. Blxst)</b>\n“Me and Blxst, we’ve been overdue to work for a while, and he really just carved his own lane and sound so perfect, it’s crazy. And for me to just resurface and start dropping music again, it just felt so right. It felt serendipitous that the song is called ‘Wait Too Long,’ because I feel like everybody’s been waiting too long for moments like this, for me and Blxst together. Only we can stand in the light that’s there for us. We was kicking it—Hollywood Cole made that beat. It was crazy. And Blxst did the hook. We was just vibing out, watching movies, playing chess, hanging out with a bunch of friends. I had to, again, step away and just really give my verses some love. I think I wrote three different verses just so it would be as good as the hook. I was listening to that hook by itself for a couple of weeks.”\n \n<b>“Black 2”</b>\n“It’s so funny because I don’t know what type of mode I be in when I be making these ‘Black’ records. I just am Black, so I’m always thinking about Black trauma, Black pride, Black enjoyment, Black excellence, Black everything all the time. It was just another day—I think it was during February, so I was just in the mood. The homie Roofeeo made that beat, and it was so tight. I was rapping real good that day, but I just try to talk about it from my perspective, which is less political and just more communal. From where I stand, on the inside looking out, everybody else is always trying to do some Black stuff that we be on in the first place. So, that’s the perspective that I was taking that day. I was working with the homie Kent [Jamz]—he helped me write the hook. We was paying homage to Malcolm X and Paul Mooney.”\n \n<b>“High School Crush”</b>\n“Shout-out to Axl Folie—he made that beat again. It was him and Leon Thomas. I was just in the singing mood that day. I was feeling all lovey-dovey—I don’t know, I might’ve had a new boo thing or something. It was just the same feeling as when you got that high school crush. So, I tried to turn a current event—just bridge it with a memory to capture the whole feeling of interest turning into infatuation into a full-on obsession in the heat of the moment. I just wanted to capsulize it and stay there in that moment forever. I was just rapping hella good. I was trying to sound like André 3000 on the rap.”\n \n<b>“Happy Hour” (feat. T-Pain)</b>\n“I just feel so honored to provide a canvas for such an artist to put some paint where it ain’t. T-Pain is such a legend, and I do enjoy myself a nice happy hour. I remember when I first turned 21, and I even found out about the concept—just being in a position to have my own money, hang out with friends, and just go out and buy food and drink for cheap. I was really just trying to capture that moment. We was for sure drinking when we made that song, and it was a bunch of live instrumentation. D’Mile made that beat, but we had Brody Brown come through with the bass, and then Robert Glasper did some stuff on there, Terrace Martin, Derrick Hodge played some guitar. It just happened so organically. It came together so cold. And then we got the T-Pain vocal, and he T-Pained it—Mr. Bartender, Mr. Buy U a Drank.”\n \n<b>“Coolest Things” (feat. Ari Lennox)</b>\n“I was working with D’Mile, and he made that beat so crazy, he barely talked that day. I was working with Jesse Boykins. He wrote the hook, and it resonated with me so deep. I feel like I’ve been cool before it was cool to be cool, and then cool got oversaturated, and now everybody trying to figure out what is this cool thing that anybody even speaks of because everything is just so watered down and not cool at all. I just was rapping about that and trying to talk about past love and just keep it super vague so people could attach their own moments to the same feelings that I am talking about in my verses.”\n \n<b>“Ain’t Fair”</b>\n“Organized Noize made that beat, and they some legends. They are just legendary producers. They lost the files and remade the beat, and it sounded even better. I was just trying to—it was a stream of consciousness that day when I was rapping. The beat-switch was so crazy. It was two separate beats that we pieced together because it just sounded tight. And I was just talking about how unfair it is to be in the position—just as artists or anybody in the public eye, it just seems like whatever happens, it don’t really make a difference for the consumer or the listener, but it always has to translate into an amazing song or some amazing art. It’s just not taking into account mental health or just a person’s emotions, all the invisible things that nobody really sees. It’s just not a fair position to be in. And everybody else, too, just a crazy, evil world we live in.”\n \n<b>“Bad News”</b>\n“[Production trio] 1Mind came to the studio, and I was just trying to try something different. They was playing a bunch of different beats, but when this one came on, I was just jamming out. The hook was there instantly, and I was like, ‘Hold on. Load this up. We need to do this.’ And then, I started mumbling different cadences for the verse, tried to paint a picture of some ghetto scenario that could happen in this amazing vibe of music. It just sets the tone for fun, but it’s just a crazy story, like how people who ain’t from the hood try to glorify hood shit.”\n \n<b>“Superghetto”</b>\n“I feel like I haven’t really put too much out there about my upbringing or myself in my raps. A lot of my raps are super vague and not really detailed of my story, so I just tried to be more introspective. I really set an intention to talk about things in my personal life that I haven’t talked about for whatever reason and just put it all in the music. I think it came out good. The beat is super—it’s not that many sounds, so it’s a lot of space for people to just hear what I’m saying.”","short":"“These songs sound and feel bigger, but it still sounds and feels like me.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5pwzhZiiGhHgQOUJKbzYuI"}},{"id":"1614063395","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614063395?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b2/b4/7c/b2b47cf9-d8e2-53f6-5c62-c974d665c95b/22UMGIM08994.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"333029","textColor2":"1f1909","textColor4":"4a4431","textColor1":"020000","bgColor":"f7f1d1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rema","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rave-roses/1614063395","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Rave & Roses","recordLabel":"Mavin Records / Jonzing World","upc":"00602445720255","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Mavin Global Holdings Ltd, Jonzing World Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1614063395","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"While on stage at the 2019 Headies ceremony, Rema declared himself “the future” after winning in the Next Rated category of the Nigerian awards show. Whether those words were prophetic or just an audacious estimation of self, the Benin-born musician has delivered on his promise ever since. As a standout talent, Rema has been a critical factor in pushing Afropop into a genre-fluid, futurist epoch that produces a vibrant mosaic of the music—encompassing influences from the hyper-frenzy of trap, reggaetón’s melodic undertone, and the immersive sonics of Bollywood scores. \n \nAll of these influences come to a head on the singer’s debut LP, <i>Rave & Roses</i>, a 16-song set on which he details love, addiction, and fate with pointed clarity. “I swear this album has different moods, different stories,” Rema tells Apple Music. “Just the recording process had different reasons that carried me to the studio, moments that just came out of the blue, but with the same goal. I didn’t have a solid written plan, so I literally approached this album with no fear or pressure. Every project will have different meanings to me, aside from the story they tell—but this one is a sound-sealer, and it’s that bridge to bring the fans closer to Rema.”\n \nWithout sacrificing the romantic impulse that inspires much of <i>Rave & Roses</i>, Rema vocalizes his belief in predestination and examines societal dynamics with contributions from an eclectic cast that includes American singer 6LACK, British rapper AJ Tracey, and French vocalist Yseult. Read on as Rema (Divine Ikubor) guides us through <i>Rave & Roses</i>, one track at a time.\n \n<b>“Divine”</b>\n“‘Divine’ is all about how I was born; it’s about my birth process. It shows the trials and the stress and the worries and the pain my mom had to go through in giving birth to me. Even before she was pregnant with me, she was going through battles, and I came at a very weird time in her and my dad’s life. I spent over 10 months in the womb, but I never caused any pain. She was just worried about if the child was alive because I wasn’t making any movements. Until she fell very ill and went to the hospital, and the doctor just decided to give her enough confidence to give it a little push. And she gave it a little push. It was the easiest birth she ever had. My dad told her to name me, and she called me Divine. I tried my best to squeeze all that detail into the first verse, but the best part of the song shows how far that very divine boy has come—as well as talking my shit. I’ve been fighting battles way before I was born, and I deserve everything I’ve got.” \n \n<b>“Hold Me” [Rema & 6LACK]</b>\n“‘Hold Me’ is literally a mature sense of love. I’m talking about a girl that is not really all about the show, because it’s quite rare in this generation. She’s not about a guy buying her dinner or buying her drinks or getting her gifts. She is just looking for someone to love and respect her, mostly. And it’s just me being that famous guy and observing someone who is quite rare in my generation. Even if I’m famous and all, she doesn’t care about that. She just wants to hold me down and be that real one for me. So, the title represents feeling safe with this woman. That’s what every guy looks for: those quiet moments where you feel safe in this crazy world. I did this song with 6LACK and it’s a masterpiece.”\n \n<b>“Dirty”</b>\n“‘Dirty’ is all about good love—the special times two people can share. I would say it’s a [2021 single] ‘Soundgasm’-type feel. I’d say it’s the next level of the ‘Hold Me’ narrative; that’s how it advances. Also, the last line from that song is mostly directed towards the pleasure of having someone you love. \n \n<b>“Calm Down”</b>\n“With ‘Calm Down,’ I was with some people from the Mavin Academy, and we were just vibing and chilling. We went into one of the studios where we saw [Andre] Vibez. Vibez saw that our energy was up, and we just wanted to freestyle on beats. The next day, I recorded and brought up my experience where I met a girl at a party. I was trying to get her attention and we could only go halfway in the party, but it advanced and we just locked in and loved up.” \n \n<b>“Soundgasm”</b>\n“I made this song on February 14, 2021—Valentine’s Day. And that was a special day, but even if it’s a holiday, I still work. I was at a hotel, actually. London and I just linked up for this.”\n \n<b>“Time N Affection” [Rema & Chris Brown]</b>\n“‘Time N Affection’ is about the time you put into someone you love and how much you give into it. It’s one thing to love and spend money and ball and whatever, but when it loses that main interest, it’s not love anymore. It’s lost. Putting in your time, no matter how busy you are, and putting in your interest proves how much you love someone, and that’s what the song is all about. Chris Brown did his part and that made it a special record. Very graced to have his vocals on my album.” \n \n<b>“Jo”</b>\n“‘Jo’ is just a happy record. In the studio, I was in a very light vibe with that record. ‘Jo’ is the Yoruba word for ‘dance.’ The song is just a happy jam that covers the whole ‘roses’ aspect of the album, attached to love.”\n \n<b>“Mara”</b>\n“‘Mara’ is all about the addiction and madness that comes with love. It’s being obsessed. It’s the next level. According to the arrangement of the songs on the album—from ‘Hold Me’ to ‘Dirty’ to ‘Mara’ and ‘Love’—the love waxes stronger from track to track.” \n \n<b>“Love”</b>\n“It’s really a loved-up album. It’s hype and it’s love. Two great mediums, two great frequencies to tap into, to seal the Rema brand a hundred percent. ‘Love’ is all about love and what it can inspire—and the addiction that comes with love. This is my definition of love. It’s not, ‘I’m in love with you.’ It’s not, ‘Love this or love that.’ It’s just love. It’s my own definition of love and how I embrace my own love life.” \n \n<b>“Addicted”</b>\n“‘Addicted’ speaks about a girl who’s addicted to the lifestyle. Addicted to drugs, fame, partying, whatever comes with the fake life, the clout or journey. Everyone is allowed to have fun, but there should be a balance. I know this girl who actually crossed the limit and had an overdose of this lifestyle. In this record, I deemed it not right at all, because being at the [career] height I am, I know that I can have this life to the fullest, but I still have my laidback time to create a balance. So, this song is literally me telling this girl, ‘Yo, you could have a balance to it. Don’t get carried away by it.’”\n \n<b>“Are You There?”</b>\n“‘Are You There?’ is a wake-up call. We go crazy about the government and [yet] slowly we have accepted their bullshit and we just tend to ignore and only talk when it affects us. We are still complaining about the things our parents complained about. In this song, I complain about certain issues that we face, and the ways I air out my feelings about certain issues in the country. Many things are happening at the same time, and while people are dying, some people are in the club. So, I decided not to care anymore. I just can’t be here focusing on the negativity of the country. Don’t ask me any questions when I’m outside the country and I’m balling.” \n \n<b>“FYN” [Rema & AJ Tracey]</b>\n“‘FYN’ is about this young kid from Benin working his way up, three years back-to-back, and being in this position that I always knew to be the ‘fresh young n****a’ young position from back in the days. When I used to see my big bosses back then, that’s how I labeled them—I’d call them ‘fresh young n****s.’ When I knew I was in that place and when I knew that my bank account was looking good, when I knew that I had worked my way to that status, I felt the need to talk my shit a little bit. With every level that I [reach], I always make sure that I get the matching beats, something that matches the feel and the level at which I want to talk my shit. AJ Tracey killed his verse. His voice was perfect for the beat, and his flow was perfect for the lyricism.”\n \n<b>“Oroma Baby”</b>\n“‘Oroma Baby’ is a jam. It’s just a dance record that still covers the term ‘love’ and how it is attached to the ‘Roses’ side of the album.” \n \n<b>“Carry”</b>\n“‘Carry’ is practically the same idea that I used in my record ‘Lady.’ It’s just pouring praises on the body of an African woman, and on what she’s all about, inside out.”\n \n<b>“Wine” [Rema & Yseult]</b>\n“‘Wine’ is a love record, partly English, partly French. We were trying to bring the French people to connect with this vibe as well. Yseult and I had a huge connection with this record. [<i>Rave & Roses</i> co-producer] London made sure that collab happened; I actually did the song halfway, and then I forgot about it. Then, London did his thing and came back with vocals, and I was like, ‘Who’s this?’ And he was like, ‘Yo, this is Yseult.’ I'm glad he brought her world into my world.”\n \n<b>“Runaway”</b>\n“‘Runaway’ was inspired by my experiences back in the days before fame. We live in a society where boys are hustling, and a guy would just take your babe and stuff like that. I had back-to-back anxiety and a little insecurity about holding such a beautiful girl down, because I was broke and not in the position where I wanted myself to be. So, ‘Runaway’ is literally me telling her that I’m not sure our love could thrive here. It’s just me telling her to run away with me and create our own definition of love.”go here.","short":"The Afropop wunderkind details love and fate on his riveting debut album."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ui8Uj9oHn2yT7Duo0welM"}},{"id":"1613839414","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1613839414?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/45/cd/82/45cd8259-f7d3-ba71-8c1e-a7688f2d5704/075679754646.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"9abd7f","textColor2":"a6d776","textColor4":"87b660","textColor1":"bddf9c","bgColor":"0e330a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Weezer","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sznz-spring/1613839414","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-20","name":"SZNZ: Spring","recordLabel":"Crush Music/Atlantic","upc":"075679754646","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"under exclusive license to Crush Music / Atlantic Recording Corporation, ℗ 2022 Weezer","playParams":{"id":"1613839414","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5dpaxVXET01VAgivwwUac6"}},{"id":"1615112991","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615112991?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/57/4f/dc/574fdcaa-2776-cf57-a5e0-02384c647417/190296144820.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"328fae","textColor2":"6ba9e3","textColor4":"5688b6","textColor1":"3fb2d9","bgColor":"000301","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Charli XCX","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crash-deluxe/1615112991","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"CRASH (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records UK","upc":"190296144820","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An Asylum Records UK release, ℗ 2022 Warner Music UK Limited with the exception of Track 2 & 3  2021 Warner Music UK Limited","playParams":{"id":"1615112991","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3lb7EyEcWhZOK0SpZ2dNpn"}},{"id":"1614984200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614984200?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/85/1d/e8/851de83b-0106-02ea-bf03-a534c9bb3913/22UMGIM30205.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"14272a","textColor2":"2d1e0d","textColor4":"383f35","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"64c3d4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nigo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-know-nigo/1614984200","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"I Know NIGO!","recordLabel":"Victor Victor Worldwide","upc":"00602445684908","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Victor Victor Worldwide; ℗ 2022 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc. & Victor Victor Worldwide","playParams":{"id":"1614984200","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"During his time in the public eye, Japanese fashion icon Nigo has been a man of few words and famously great taste. Both traits are intact across 2022’s <i>I Know NIGO!</i>, a compilation album where the BAPE founder taps a small handful of his favorite hip-hop artists, all of whom have been spotted in the designer’s fashions over the years. The verses, however, are hardly drip-dependent. \n\n<i>I Know NIGO!</i> features multiple appearances from coke-rap devotee Pusha T, Nigo’s BBC and Ice Cream labels business partner Pharrell, and Tyler, The Creator and A$AP Rocky, who, outside of their respective solo outings, deliver a rap-off on “Lost and Found Freestyle 2019” in the tradition of the pair’s 2018 track “Potato Salad.” Elsewhere, there are mosh-pit-ready big-room anthems from Lil Uzi Vert and A$AP Ferg (“Heavy,” “Paper Plates”), one of the most well-enunciated verses of ATL spitter Gunna’s entire career (“Functional Addict”), a little hip-house from Nigo’s own group Teriyaki Boyz (“Morë Tonight”), and a rock-solid reminder of why Pop Smoke remains the face of Brooklyn drill rap a full two years after his death (“Remember”). There’s a lot to digest within the album’s 11 tracks, but Nigo was on the same mission here as he was when creating the BAPE pieces that superfans still scour the internet for: He was making something intended to outlast any single season.","short":"Featuring Rocky, Tyler, Uzi, Cudi, Pusha, Pharrell, and Pop Smoke."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/75T8WnF5n7fgKJ0EC7WRPS"}},{"id":"1614179708","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614179708?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/bc/ac/99/bcac9968-35ae-0cea-ce08-9eb11600532b/RV_Feel_My_Rhythm-Cover_4000x4000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"152732","textColor2":"001e04","textColor4":"143d30","textColor1":"000206","bgColor":"68bae0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Red Velvet","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-reve-festival-2022-feel-my-rhythm-ep/1614179708","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-21","name":"'The ReVe Festival 2022 - Feel My Rhythm' - EP","recordLabel":"SM Entertainment","upc":"888735940774","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 SM Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1614179708","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A celebratory EP with classic hooks and groovy beats.","short":"A celebratory EP with classic hooks and groovy beats."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1611265893","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611265893?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d2/9f/63/d29f638a-0558-42a8-379e-a08fd909f594/22UMGIM16935.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b29a8f","textColor2":"e2bd9c","textColor4":"b9977d","textColor1":"dac0b3","bgColor":"160000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sofia Carson","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sofia-carson/1611265893","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Sofia Carson","recordLabel":"Hollywood Records","upc":"00050087491420","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Hollywood Records, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1611265893","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The pop singer’s smouldering vox fuel an empowering first album.","short":"The pop singer’s smouldering vox fuel an empowering first album."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Y63nlA6F7z3yaqHjF7suD"}},{"id":"1600504657","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600504657?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b8/15/f8/b815f876-0530-aa64-7f66-f96d767ec7aa/1503.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"595854","textColor2":"363331","textColor4":"5d5a57","textColor1":"31312c","bgColor":"f8f6f2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Destroyer","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/labyrinthitis/1600504657","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"LABYRINTHITIS","recordLabel":"Merge Records","upc":"673855078922","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Merge Records","playParams":{"id":"1600504657","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For all the different forms his music has assumed over the years—glam, chamber-folk, yacht rock, dream-pop—you can readily identify any Destroyer song the instant that Dan Bejar opens his mouth to dispense his cryptic yet deliciously dramatic narratives. And no record in his long, winding career puts that theory to the test as gleefully as <i>LABYRINTHITIS</i>, an album that’s essentially the musical manifestation of his famously frizzy, mad-scientist hairdo: It’s bursting with wild sonic ideas that shoot off in every direction, yet it’s always unmistakably him. After luring us in with the warm, shoegazey synth drones and subaquatic bass throb of “It’s in Your Heart Now,” <i>LABYRINTHITIS</i> traps us in its maniacal maze and dares us to find a way out: “June” deviously blurs the line between polyrhythmic post-punk and ’80s adult-contemporary pop before free-falling into a bizarre, voice-modulated spoken-word breakdown; “Tintoretto, It’s for You” is part louche cabaret strut, part festival-EDM meltdown. But <i>LABYRINTHITIS</i>’s boldness of vision also yields rousing moments of release (“Suffer,” “It Takes a Thief”) that infuse the pop elegance of 2011’s <i>Kaputt</i> with a little extra <i>kapow</i>. The instrumental title track provides a welcome mid-album reprieve in which the band crafts a Boards of Canada-worthy pastorale, complete with the comforting sounds of chattering children.","short":"Dan Bejar goes full mad-scientist on his wildest record

Melbourne indie rock trio Camp Cope first emerged on the alt-rock scene with their self-titled debut LP, guitarist/vocalist Georgia Maq, bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich, and drummer Sarah Thompson were celebrated for taking down the inherent misogyny in the independent music scene. (“The Opener” from 2018’s <i>How to Socialise and Make Friends</i> tackled the subject directly and memorably.) Now on their third LP, the band has ventured into folkier territory: The midtempo “Blue” is a depressed confessional supported by ascendent, Chicks-style pop harmonies, while “Jealous” mirrors the oppressive sentimentality that follows a breakup, with Maq’s voice feeling out all the contours of her fractured refrain, a weeping “Oh, no.” The title track, “Running With the Hurricane,” is a fierce surprise: a bluesy, emo-adjacent shout-along single stuffed to the brim with the oppressive rush of a crush: “I get so bored thinking about anyone else!” Thankfully, it doesn’t sound like it.","short":"The Melbourne trio’s third album ventures into folkier territory."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/19hKQ6R5FegB9CDcShFjb6"}},{"id":"1599645461","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599645461?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/2b/56/aa/2b56aab9-194c-d2b8-a7e1-f2c996abc899/4062548039498.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1440,"textColor3":"d9dacf","textColor2":"f1d594","textColor4":"d1bb87","textColor1":"fbfcee","bgColor":"515257","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Juanita Euka","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mabanzo/1599645461","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Mabanzo","recordLabel":"Strut","upc":"4062548039498","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Strut Records -

But this is thrilling music, and Wagner’s album ranges over the gamut of styles. The late Harold Budd’s ambient “La Casa Bruja” follows an impressionistic depiction of rain by electronic music pioneer Suzanne Ciani. Elsewhere, Wagner showcases music by some of today’s brightest young composing talents, including Caroline Shaw, David Lang, and Nico Muhly. Ezio Bosso’s hypnotic, pulsating “Before 6” is a master class in restraint, while two of Philip Glass’ most iconic piano études bring a minimalist flavor to this enticing album. Wagner guides us on her imaginative and rewarding journey with playing of great depth and subtlety.","short":"Beautiful contemporary piano pieces that undeservedly sit on the fringes."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2fflhZ9Fur0MxShCUkIuSu"}},{"id":"1599197924","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599197924?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b1/7d/22/b17d22e0-a8dd-bf0c-3f9b-d82b8e74aff2/0045778785339.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"202020","textColor2":"060606","textColor4":"242424","textColor1":"010101","bgColor":"9f9f9f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Soul Glo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/diaspora-problems/1599197924","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Diaspora Problems","recordLabel":"Epitaph","upc":"0045778785339","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Epitaph","playParams":{"id":"1599197924","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZYhM0LXHZ38te98EizcQW"}},{"id":"1607094923","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607094923?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ad/75/14/ad751424-7df1-dc77-4c77-0b0b3655d645/22UMGIM04425.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cc9b01","textColor2":"f15900","textColor4":"c34801","textColor1":"fdc000","bgColor":"0b0505","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Killing Joke","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lord-of-chaos-ep/1607094923","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Lord Of Chaos -

Recorded beautifully in Berlin’s Pierre Boulez Saal, the album showcases Barenboim’s characteristic range of color. The third of Schubert’s <i>4 Impromptus</i> has real poetry, and Barenboim knows that less is more in Schumann’s “Träumerei” and Debussy’s “Clair de lune.” The Schumann <i>Fantasiestücke</i> are beautifully judged, while the Chopin études show off Barenboim’s still-sparkling technique. Albéniz’s “Tango” is a delicious final note in this charming birthday celebration.","short":"The pianist selects his favorite encores to celebrate his 80th birthday. "},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/61eDyvICInmtuLLXh41BmO"}},{"id":"1593532432","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593532432?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/cb/c4/04/cbc404b4-a78c-1d54-20f7-311fe460aa2a/677517015553.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"cf8184","textColor2":"f37300","textColor4":"c65c03","textColor1":"ffa2a1","bgColor":"120012","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ed Schrader's Music Beat","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nightclub-daydreaming/1593532432","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-07-30","name":"Nightclub Daydreaming","recordLabel":"Carpark Records","upc":"677517015553","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Carpark Records","playParams":{"id":"1593532432","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1612507625","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1612507625?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/3f/c2/35/3fc2354f-b660-9797-7336-e1bb51f27712/859760448771_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdc6b7","textColor2":"fcc27c","textColor4":"cea26b","textColor1":"faefdb","bgColor":"182126","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Austin Burke","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/changed-everything-ep/1612507625","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-25","name":"Changed Everything -
