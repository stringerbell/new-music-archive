So it ain't just speaking of me and Dugg specifically, but like the group of us. Like it might not be no more members like us after.” \n\nDugg and Gee, who hail from Detroit and Louisville respectively, built their fanbases over the past half decade in near lockstep, frequently appearing in the same playlists and also guesting on each other’s projects and those of peers they both enjoy. “We got so many songs together,” Gee says. “Both of us is artists in demand—in our general area, it's like a tie, Michigan and Kentucky. So it just makes sense.”\n\nWith <i>Last Ones Left</i>’s robust 17 tracks, it’s clear the two enjoy making music with each other and are operating on a very similar wavelength. The project contains a handful of back-and-forth verses that express, in tandem, a penchant for forging their own mythology (“Spin,” “All 100s,” “Can’t Be Fucked With,” “Who Hotter Than Gee”), fair warning to their detractors (“Skcretch Sum,” “Everybody Shooters Too”), a considered regard for the people who look up to them (“My Yungin”), and a shared longing for loved ones locked behind bars (“Free the Shiners,” “Free Zoski”). \n\nThough they were unable to coordinate for the interview—Dugg, allegedly having missed three separate flights, dialed in by phone from a Prada store—they know each other well enough that Gee was able to predict (before Dugg joined the call) that he’d name the riotous “Thump Shit” as his favorite song from the project. “That's his theme song,” Gee said. “He wake up in the morning, they just start playing it over his house, as soon as he get up out of the bed.” Dugg confirmed it just as soon as he got on the phone. “If I was wrong, I was going to leave,” Gee added. But he wasn’t, so he didn’t. And they’d have one more thing to joke about the next time they got back in the studio with each other.","short":"Two of the hottest young MCs in street rap unite in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SebJ0t1o6obx2HTesRj6I"}},{"id":"1610834866","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610834866?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b7/e3/2f/b7e32fd7-7ca3-edf6-7df8-861bfcfd6f9a/886449526772.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"dcd9d0","textColor2":"f0d6ba","textColor4":"d3bda3","textColor1":"fcf9f2","bgColor":"5d5747","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Camila Cabello","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/familia/1610834866","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Familia","recordLabel":"Epic","upc":"886449526772","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1610834866","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Camila Cabello’s solo career continues to be one of modern pop’s most worthwhile musical journeys.

It’s not the song’s chorus and you can picture him saying it in the mirror, attempting to reckon with a truth he clearly understands but also maybe doesn’t quite know what to do with. At the time of <i>RAMONA PARK BROKE MY HEART</i>’s release, the Long Beach, California, MC was more popular and financially successful than he’s ever been. So, he chose—beginning with 2021’s <i>Vince Staples</i>—to release some of the most affecting and autobiographical music of his career.\n \nThe decision sounds, across the album, much less a professional risk than a personal one, Staples utilizing production from Mustard, Cardo, and Coop the Truth, among others, to expose his innermost thoughts about turf politics, romantic relationships, and the ways money may or may not be changing him. More than anything else, he aims to honor those who have in some way contributed to his survival, often calling them out by name, holding especially close the memories of those no longer in his orbit. “Tryna make it to the top, we can’t take everybody with us,” he sings on “THE BEACH.” There are few artists who come off as comfortable as Staples does regarding their contributions to music culture at large, but what <i>RAMONA PARK BROKE MY HEART</i> makes abundantly clear is that few things mean as much to Staples’ art as the neighborhood that made him.","short":"“Tryna make it to the top, we can’t take everybody with us.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2G549zeda2XNICgLmU0pNW"}},{"id":"1616671655","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616671655?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/3c/26/32/3c26323f-a8e8-844d-eccb-aa15186a461d/5054197142550.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7a6a1","textColor2":"d6bcae","textColor4":"b39c8f","textColor1":"dbc8c5","bgColor":"281e14","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Natanael Cano","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/natakong/1616671655","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Música Mexicana"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"NataKong","recordLabel":"WEA Latina","upc":"5054197142550","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Distributed By Warner Music Latina, ℗ 2022 Los CT LLC and JHRH","playParams":{"id":"1616671655","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I started this record with a different mentality,” Natanael Cano tells Apple Music. “My personal life got complicated, and just when everything was getting harder, I found a glimmer of hope. That little hope helped me to express everything that was happening to me, and that’s how I finished the album.” The end result is a record as majestic as it is expansive. It begins with moody Latin trap workouts like “Free Nata” and “Kong.” Beginning with “Cuento,” the project’s second half shines with the light of the corridos tumbados sound that Cano pioneered. Regardless of genre, the lyrics evoke the outbursts and contradictions of a personal diary, with references to romantic disappointment and death as a constant presence.\n\n“Whenever I’m in Mexico, I don’t give much thought to the fact that it’s a dangerous land,” he says. “I was born here and continue to move around. Whatever happens will happen. This album describes some realities that only the people close to me can understand.” Here, he guides us through the songs of <i>NataKong</i>, one by one.\n\n<b>“Free Nata”</b>\n“I wrote this while living in Cancun, then finished it in the Dominican Republic. I asked Krizous to send me an R&B trap beat, like the ones we used to do together. At that moment I had no idea what was going to happen with my life, and I recorded a freestyle on my cell phone talking about that. It ended up being the starting point for the entire project.”\n\n<b>“Kong”</b>\n“I never thought I would write a song about death. Sometimes you feel something unconsciously and then express it in your writing. It’s what I was feeling at the time. I felt lost, because I spent a long time in the US and when I came back, I had no idea what Mexico was like. I didn’t know if my friends were still my friends. It’s at that point when I’m thinking, ‘I feel like I’m going to get killed.’ I can’t write songs on command. If I delivered a full album, it was because I felt all these things in my day-to-day and kept recording. In order to write songs, I look for trouble, I find trouble—then I record a song.”\n\n<b>“Lio”</b>\n“Everything is a mess. I wrote this song a year ago. It was so important to me that I never released it. Because my last album was made up entirely of corridos, it stayed there, but I love it. I felt sad when I wrote it. The string arrangement came to us from the very beginning. We never changed it.”\n\n<b>“Tay”</b>\n“Tay is short for Taylor, a girl I met in one of my shows. I fell in love with her and spent two days like that. What’s not meant to be is not meant to be, however, and I ended up writing this song. When all this was happening, I told myself: I know what to do to feel better—just write a song. That’s when I recovered.”\n\n<b>“Estrellas”</b>\n“It’s not about anyone in particular, but it’s still one of my favorite tracks. One of the few I wrote just because I wanted to, thinking about crafting a song that expresses a particular feeling. Maybe it’s not about my life, not about something that happened to me, but I’m talking about something that could happen to anyone.”\n\n<b>“Dinero Digital”</b>\n“A more hardcore trap song. I saved it for a long time, but the subject matter is still timely. The lyrics are all over the place. I talk about digital money and gangsters, [but] also about everything you feel when somebody dumps you.”\n\n<b>“De A De Veras”</b>\n“We always got along well with codiciado. We ended up on the same label, and I identify with him because we share many similarities. He posted a fragment of this song on his personal Instagram and asked: Who should guest on this? I told him, ‘Bro, I love what you’re saying in that song, I need to be there.’ I flew to Guadalajara, we met, and the track was completed very quickly. It’s a personal lyric. We’re both problem children and vented our feelings. People need to listen to our side of the story.”\n\n<b>“Gracias A Dios”</b>\n“We recorded this with Lil Mosey. I was living in Los Angeles; we would bump into each other partying and take a photo together. Then we met up in Miami and decided to record something. I was in a mental war with myself, having issues with friends of mine. Maybe I was drunk at that moment, because I felt depressed. It ended up being a duet with Mosey, which we recorded in about 20 minutes. Even though he speaks English, I can understand a bit of what he’s saying. When things happen naturally, it never feels forced.”\n\n<b>“Quien Va A Caer”</b>\n“This track was started by Tyan G, an artist on the same label as me—but most importantly, a good friend. We started our careers at the same time, and things happened a bit faster for me. Tyan arrived with a fragment of the chorus, and his words made sense. This song is real. You’re at a party, and you don’t know if everyone is getting murdered, or just one person. It could be you, bro. This is Mexico. Many friends of mine have died just like that.”\n\n<b>“Toronto”</b>\n“I wrote this at Drake’s house. A friend invited me to meet Travis Scott’s producer. I arrived at a mansion in Hidden Hills, met the producer, and we started recording backing tracks. Everyone was American and no one spoke Spanish. I started freestyling and they said, ‘OK, I don’t understand what you’re saying, but it sounds good.’ I named this tune ‘Toronto’ because we were hanging out at Drake’s place.”\n\n<b>“Cuento”</b>\n“It’s my favorite song on the album. I don’t know why, but whenever I write songs about love—or the lack of—they always come out in the same style. I call it ‘amor tumbado,’ because it’s a corrido turned upside down with so much love. The lyrics describe a never-ending story. Unrequited love, you cause things to end, but then you’re all dejected. There are a couple of words that are hard to understand, slang from my hometown in Sonora.”\n\n<b>“Brillo”</b>\n“This song came to life in Hermosillo, Sonora, with the same songwriter that I co-wrote ‘Diamantes’ with. We’re like brothers, and it’s only your good friends who really know what’s going on in your life. We were at my house, and suddenly I came up with that sentence: ‘I carry this glow with me, and it bothers them.’ It was the only bit we had. Then we incorporated my car into the lyrics—my Mustang, because it’s a personal song. Some of the things I mention are incoherent, but they’re also real, and at the end of the day I’m not embarrassed to name them.”\n\n<b>“Mochila”</b>\n“I was in Cancun when I wrote this one. I thought it was important to include Junior H—especially since he moved to the city where I was born.”\n\n<b>“Madrid”</b>\n“I arrived at Cancun deeply in love, and I departed armed with a song. Some of the details here I invented. The reference to Madrid, and the back seat of a Mercedes—I don’t even own a Mercedes. I co-wrote this with a friend. I have a bunch of composer friends, but we don’t steal from one another. We all bring so many strengths to the table, it’s a pleasure to collaborate.”\n\n<b>“Periquito”</b>\n“It’s really personal, this corrido. It has the underground touch of Sonora, something that only young people can deliver. At the same time, it could be a nice old corrido by Ariel Camacho. The root of all my love songs takes you back to Ariel Camacho, mixed in with my personal style—it’s a perfect combination.”\n\n<b>“Traigo Ganas”</b>\n“A narcocorrido, Natanael Cano-style. I’m not speaking too much or too little. I don’t mention any names, cities or states—but it’s still about organized crime. At this stage in my life, I don’t need to describe things in too much detail, so it’s a narcocorrido that I wrote while being as moderate as possible.”\n\n<b>“Me Gusta”</b>\n“It’s the same story that happens to so many of us. A man accepting the fact that he loves to party. All of my songs provide an outlet delivering an answer to someone. Maybe she doesn’t know me, she is not aware of what I’m really like. Here I’m describing myself.”\n\n<b>“Nataaoki”</b>\n“A friend of mine tells me that I come from the future, and I’m beginning to believe him. The lyrics of this song are out of control. I don’t know how I came up with them, being so young. I wrote this four years ago but never recorded it. I had the rhyme and nothing else. I was in Vegas and Steve Aoki invited us to his studio. So I arrived fully prepared with this lyric of mine. Steve is such a carefree guy, like a kid. We’re very much alike, and I think we will continue collaborating for a long time to come.”","short":"“I look for trouble, I find trouble—then I record a song.” Hear it in Spatial."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2irmTvrbuG1ox2Qa6R8J1L"}},{"id":"1607593873","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607593873?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/6d/de/02/6dde02ae-a9fe-f96e-e81f-4f18ad13d2f9/886449873302.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8966d","textColor2":"d3a975","textColor4":"ab885f","textColor1":"e4b986","bgColor":"090708","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Orville Peck","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bronco/1607593873","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Bronco","recordLabel":"Columbia","upc":"886449873302","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1607593873","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After releasing his 2019 Sub Pop debut, <i>Pony</i>, the mysterious masked troubadour Orville Peck made the unprecedented leap from DIY-country darling to Sony-supported Shania Twain duet partner in just over a year. But even as his star was on a seemingly unstoppable ascent—in the midst of a pandemic, no less—Peck admits that his signature fringed veil was often concealing sunken eyes and a frown. “When COVID happened, it made me look at my life for the first time and realize that my personal life was kind of a mess,” the Toronto-based artist tells Apple Music. “I had been escaping all my personal problems by just relying on the fact that I had this insanely busy schedule. I fell into a period for about three months where I was deeply, deeply depressed. It was actually the most unhappy I’ve ever been in my life. I kind of considered not ever making any more music.”\n \nBut in his darkest hour, Peck found the will to write and sing his way through the pain—and, before long, the songs started pouring out like a ruptured water main. The result is <i>Bronco</i>, a grandiose, 15-song tour de force recorded with Peck’s <i>Pony</i>-era touring band but given a big-screen production boost by Nashville studio ace Jay Joyce and an added ’60s-pop shimmer courtesy of former indie phenom-turned-Adele song doctor Tobias Jesso Jr., who co-wrote a couple of tracks. Yet for all its added glitz, <i>Bronco</i> does nothing to obscure Peck’s signature qualities: his commanding matinee-idol croon; his uncanny balance of heartache, humor, and homoeroticism; and his innate gift for twangy, tear-in-yer-beer serenades. Here, Peck gives us the stories behind some of the album’s instant country classics.\n \n<b>“Daytona Sand”</b>\n“This is about a cowboy I know who was born in Mississippi and grew up in Daytona, so I wanted to write this kind ode to Florida. And I was listening to a lot of Beach Boys, so I wanted to do my version of a country-surf song. But I wanted people to feel smacked in the face by the lyrics and the newfound confidence in the way that I present them. A lot of the songs on this album are upbeat and playful, but there’s sardonic humor in there because I’m talking about really dark and vulnerable stuff, and I wanted to show the different ways in which I could share that.”\n \n<b>“The Curse of the Blackened Eye”</b>\n“This is about that idea where, no matter what’s going on in your life, how much success you’re having, and how many people are around you at a party saying they love you, there’s always something in the corner kind of watching you or following you around that’s weighing on your mind—whether that’s depression or addiction or abuse. But I wanted to present that in a tongue-in-cheek way. I have a line in there about ‘wishing so many times that I would die,’ but I do it to a soundtrack of tiki-exotica country because I’ve been listening to a lot of ’60s exotica music.”\n \n<b>“C’mon Baby, Cry”</b>\n“Tobias and I wanted this to sound like glossy casino music meets a Bob Fosse musical, wrapped up in country. This song is me giving advice that I received at some point, because I used to find it hard to cry. And now I can’t stop, so I have to make other people join me.”\n \n<b>“Kalahari Down”</b>\n“Everyone thinks I’m Canadian because I lived in Canada for a long time, but I’m not. I was born in South Africa—I grew up in Johannesburg until I was 15. I never talked about where I was from only because I wanted to wait—obviously, I’m a man of mystery and I like to not give everyone everything all at once. I had actually written ‘Kalahari Down’ for <i>Pony</i>, and I decided to hold off on it because it wasn’t sounding the way I wanted it to—I envisioned it really grand, with strings. But I’m finally really excited to share a song about missing my home. There’s a sense of guilt and regret in the song about leaving somewhere that you don’t really want to leave because you have to go make your way in the world. I’m so proud to be South African. I go back there all the time.” \n \n<b>“Bronco”</b>\n“Obviously, I keep within the equestrian species for my album titles, and I only name them after the album is done. So, after I’d finished the first one, I decided to call it <i>Pony</i> because that album was about loneliness and I felt nervous putting myself out there, tentatively. That, to me, felt like a pony—kind of scared and shaking in the corner. And then the EP after that was <i>Show Pony</i> because I finally had this budget and this confidence, but I still felt scared. I was still the same pony, but I had ribbons in my hair, and I was on display. And then, with this album, I felt like I was able to be my true self, just untamed and unbothered, and so <i>Bronco</i> was a natural title. I already had this song written, but it wasn’t called ‘Bronco’ and the hook wasn’t there yet. So, after I decided on the album title, I pivoted this song to make it the title track.”\n \n<b>“Blush”</b>\n“This is about my time living in London. It’s my little homage to London as one of my many homes. There’s a little bit of that Beatles country era in there—like a <i>Help!</i>/‘I’ve Just Seen a Face’ vibe. I wanted to make my homage to that style—like, what would be England’s version of country music.”\n \n<b>“Let Me Drown”</b>\n“Each of these songs feels like getting something off my chest in a way, and I knew I had a song in me that would be about that big culmination of my depression during the pandemic and where I was at in my personal life. This might sound really dramatic and almost ridiculous, but I woke up in the middle of the night and I couldn’t sleep, and I had this melody in my head. And I was so frightened that I was going to forget it by morning that I walked into my studio and turned on my computer and just sang the melody in the microphone, and then went back to bed. And that’s what eventually became ‘Let Me Drown.’ It’s funny: I’m a trained singer, I’ve been singing my whole life, and I’ve sometimes held back on that because I’ve been worried about how it would come off, and felt insecure about it. But with this song, I just didn’t care anymore. I wanted to sing <i>big</i>.”\n \n<b>“Any Turn”</b>\n“I wanted to bring back the tradition of the patter song, like [Johnny Cash’s] ‘I’ve Been Everywhere’ or [R.E.M.’s] ‘It’s the End of the World As We Know It’ or [Billy Joel’s] ‘We Didn’t Start the Fire’ or [Bob Dylan’s] ‘Subterranean Homesick Blues.’ I love wordplay and witty lyrics, and there hasn’t been a patter song like those for a long time. So, I was like, ‘What could be the subject matter that’s frantic and manic and chaotic?’ And tour life was the obvious one. Every single word that I say in this song is a reference to an inside joke or a story or a crazy mishap that’s happened to us on tour.”\n \n<b>“All I Can Say”</b>\n“There’s definitely some Mazzy Star vibes on this one. I really wanted to get [bandmate] Bria [Salmena] on an official duet because we sing so much together in the live show. She’s such an incredible singer, and she’s got so much depth as a songwriter. So, I approached her and [guitarist] Duncan [Hay Jennings] about helping me write a duet. Bria and I were going through something similar in our personal lives, but separately. So, we decided on this concept of two people who are singing with each other about the same thing, but not <i>to</i> each other. It’s like we don’t even know that we’re singing with each other—that’s how we wrote it.”","short":"“I kind of considered not ever making any more music.” Listen in Spatial."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/751FSVdKa8wrR8dEDLLCqb"}},{"id":"1615498403","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615498403?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/e9/4f/74/e94f74ed-156e-a145-e822-2745c9126726/093624870579.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"393633","textColor2":"1d1b1a","textColor4":"3e3c3a","textColor1":"161412","bgColor":"c4bfbb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Omar Apollo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ivory-apple-music-up-next-film-edition/1615498403","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Ivory (Apple Music Up Next Film Edition)","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624870579","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021, 2022 Omar Apollo under exclusive license to Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1615498403","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Omar Apollo seems all but destined for global stardom—a stylish, self-assured heartthrob with a soul-stirring voice and clear artistic vision. But his music is far from the standard, nondescript pop fare; it’s acutely personal and specific, a love letter to his Mexican American heritage and small-town roots. Growing up in Hobart, Indiana, as the child of Mexican immigrants (his parents came to the US from Guadalajara), Apollo took ballet folklórico classes, sang in Spanish mass at church, and listened to folk songs by Mexican musicians like Vicente Fernández and Juan Gabriel. (The latter’s influence can be heard on tracks like “En El Olvido,” which Apollo wrote after watching videos of Gabriel’s performances.) The album’s striking cover art—an aesthetic he developed with Alberto Bustamante, a queer architect and DJ based in Mexico City, where Apollo fine-tuned many of these songs—is a tribute to telenovela actors from the 1950s.\n\nPerhaps it’s no surprise, then, that many of the bilingual singer’s early fans came from the Latinx diaspora. “When I first started doing shows, it was literally all Latina girls,” he tells Apple Music, adding that people would commend him for representing the Mexican American community. “It made me feel like, ‘Wow, this is bigger than just [me and my parents], me being first generation. It meant a lot.”\n\nLike Apollo, most of the songs on <i>Ivory</i> are a melding of sounds and influences; there’s flirty, psychedelic R&B (“Killing Me”); nostalgic, hazy indie pop (“Waiting On You”); and trendy Latin trap (“Tamagotchi”). He’s an artist who appears to bask in complexity, and his style is a study in contrasts—guarded but affectionate, detached yet aching, a mix of electronic textures and bared soul. “Invincible,” a standout duet with fellow Up Next alum Daniel Caesar, is simultaneously romantic and remote, a poetic plea for connection sung from a distance. With choir-like harmonies, digital drums, rap interludes, and strumming guitar, it feels like the album’s creative centerpiece, and asks delicate questions about visibility and queer love. “If I were to go/Tell me, would you notice me?” he asks his love interests, who are both male and female. “I’m not invincible.”","short":"Hopeful, heart-on-sleeve R&B from our Up Next star, here in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1594742869","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594742869?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/31/38/c4/3138c4c7-06c4-2523-6318-5ec4b3aff1bf/887828049660.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5c1c8","textColor2":"dee0df","textColor4":"b5bcba","textColor1":"dde6f0","bgColor":"152e27","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wet Leg","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wet-leg/1594742869","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Wet Leg","recordLabel":"Domino Recording Co","upc":"887828049660","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Domino Recording Co Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1594742869","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A couple of years before she became known as one half of Wet Leg, Rhian Teasdale left her home on the Isle of Wight, where a long-term relationship had been faltering, to live with friends in London. Every Tuesday, their evening would be interrupted by the sound of people screaming in the property below. “We were so worried the first time we heard it,” Teasdale tells Apple Music. Eventually, their investigations revealed that scream therapy sessions were being held downstairs. “There’s this big scream in the song ‘Ur Mum,’” says Teasdale. “I thought it’d be funny to put this frustration and the failure of this relationship into my own personal scream therapy session.”\n\nThat mix of humor and emotional candor is typical of <i>Wet Leg</i>. Crafting tightly sprung post-punk and melodic psych-pop and indie rock, Teasdale and bandmate Hester Chambers explore the existential anxieties thrown up by breakups, partying, dating apps, and doomscrolling—while also celebrating the fun to be had in supermarkets. “It’s my own experience as a twentysomething girl from the Isle of Wight moving to London,” says Teasdale. \n\nThe strains of disenchantment and frustration are leavened by droll, acerbic wit (“You’re like a piece of shit, you either sink or float/So you take her for a ride on your daddy’s boat,” she chides an ex on “Piece of shit”), and humor has helped counter the dizzying speed of Wet Leg’s ascent. On the strength of debut single “Chaise Longue,” Teasdale and Chambers were instantly cast by many—including Elton John, Iggy Pop, and Florence Welch—as one of Britain’s most exciting new bands. But the pair have remained committed to why they formed Wet Leg in the first place. “It’s such a shame when you see bands but they’re habitually in their band—they’re not enjoying it,” says Teasdale. “I don’t want us to ever lose sight of having fun. Having silly songs obviously helps.” Here, she takes us through each of the songs—silly or otherwise—on <i>Wet Leg</i>.\n\n<b>“Being in Love”</b>\n“People always say, ‘Oh, romantic love is everything. It’s what every person should have in this life.’ But actually, it’s not really conducive to getting on with what you want to do in life. I read somewhere that the kind of chemical storm that is produced in your brain, if you look at a scan, it’s similar to someone with OCD. I just wanted to kind of make that comparison.”\n\n<b>“Chaise Longue”</b>\n“It came out of a silly impromptu late-night jam. I was staying over at Hester’s house when we wrote it, and when I stay over, she always makes up the chaise longue for me. It was a song that never really was supposed to see the light of day. So it’s really funny to me that so many people are into it and have connected with it. It’s cool. I was as an assistant stylist [on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Bad Habits’ video]. Online, a newspaper [<i>The New York Times</i>] was doing the top 10 videos out this week, and it was funny to see ‘Chaise Longue’ next to this video I’d been working on. Being on set, you have an idea of the budget that goes into getting all these people together to make this big pop-star video. And then you scroll down and it’s our little video that we spent about £50 on. Hester had a camera and she set up all the shots. Then I edited it using a free trial version of Final Cut.”\n\n<b>“Angelica”</b>\n“The song is set at a party that you no longer want to be at. Other people are feeling the same, but you are all just fervently, aggressively trying to force yourself to have a good time. And actually, it’s not always possible to have good times all the time. Angelica is the name of my oldest friend, so we’ve been to a lot of rubbish parties together. We’ve also been to a lot of good parties together, but I thought it would be fun to put her name in the song and have her running around as the main character.”\n\n<b>“I Don’t Wanna Go Out”</b>\n“It’s kind of similar to ‘Angelica’—it’s that disenchantment of getting fucked up at parties, and you’re gradually edging into your late twenties, early thirties, and you’re still working your shitty waitressing job. I was trying to convince myself that I was working these shitty jobs so that I could do music on the side. But actually, you’re kind of kidding yourself and you’re seeing all of your friends starting to get real jobs and they’re able to buy themselves nice shampoo. You’re trying to distract yourself from not achieving the things that you want to achieve in life by going to these parties. But you can’t keep kidding yourself, and I think it’s that realization that I’ve tried to inject into the lyrics of this song.”\n\n<b>“Wet Dream”</b>\n“The chorus is ‘Beam me up.’ There’s this Instagram account called beam_me_up_softboi. It’s posts of screenshots of people’s texts and DMs and dating-app goings-on with this term ‘softboi,’ which to put it quite simply is someone in the dating scene who’s presenting themselves as super, super in touch with their feelings and really into art and culture. And they use that as currency to try and pick up girls. It’s not just men that are softbois; women can totally be softbois, too. The character in the song is that, basically. It’s got a little bit of my own personal breakup injected into it. This particular person would message me since we’d broken up being like, ‘Oh, I had a dream about you. I dreamt that we were married,’ even though it was definitely over. So I guess that’s why I decided to set it within a dream: It was kind of making fun of this particular message that would keep coming through to me.”\n\n<b>“Convincing”</b>\n“I was really pleased when we came to recording this one, because for the bulk of the album, it is mainly me taking lead vocals, which is fine, but Hester has just the most beautiful voice. I hope she won’t mind me saying, but she kind of struggles to see that herself. So it felt like a big win when she was like, ‘OK, I’m going to do it. I’m going to sing. I’m going to do this song.’ It’s such a cool song and she sounds so great on it.”\n\n<b>“Loving You”</b>\n“I met this guy when I was 20, so I was pretty young. We were together for six or seven years or something, and he was a bit older, and I just fell so hard. I fell so, so hard in love with him. And then it got pretty toxic towards the end, and I guess I was a bit angry at how things had gone. So it’s just a pretty angry song, without dobbing him in too much. I feel better now, though. Don’t worry. It’s all good.”\n\n<b>“Ur Mum”</b>\n“It’s about giving up on a relationship that isn’t serving you anymore, either of you, and being able to put that down and walk away from it. I was living with this guy on the Isle of Wight, living the small-town life. I was trying to move to London or Bristol or Brighton and then I’d move back to be with this person. Eventually, we managed to put the relationship down and I moved in with some friends in London. Every Tuesday, it’d get to 7 pm and you’d hear that massive group scream. We learned that downstairs was home to the Psychedelic Society and eventually realized that it was scream therapy. I thought it’d be funny to put this frustration and the failure of this relationship into my own personal scream therapy session.”\n\n<b>“Oh No”</b>\n“The amount of time and energy that I lose by doomscrolling is not OK. It’s not big and it’s not clever. This song is acknowledging that and also acknowledging this other world that you live in when you’re lost in your phone. When we first wrote this, it was just to fill enough time to play a festival that we’d been booked for when we didn’t have a full half-hour set. It used to be even more repetitive, and the lyrics used to be all the same the whole way through. When it came to recording it, we’re like, ‘We should probably write a few more lyrics,’ because when you’re playing stuff live, I think you can definitely get away with not having actual lyrics.”\n\n<b>“Piece of shit”</b> \n“When I’m writing the lyrics for all the songs with Wet Leg, I am quite careful to lean towards using quite straightforward, unfussy language and I avoid, at all costs, using similes. But this song is the one song on the album that uses simile—‘like a piece of shit.’ Pretty poetic. I think writing this song kind of helped me move on from that [breakup]. It sounds like I’m pretty wound up. But actually, it’s OK now, I feel a lot better.”\n\n<b>“Supermarket”</b>\n“It was written just as we were coming out of lockdown and there was that time where the highlight of your week would be going to the supermarket to do the weekly shop, because that was literally all you could do. I remember queuing for Aldi and feeling like I was queuing for a nightclub.”\n\n<b>“Too Late Now”</b>\n“It’s about arriving in adulthood and things maybe not being how you thought they would be. Getting to a certain age, when it’s time to get a real job, and you’re a bit lost, trying to navigate through this world of dating apps and social media. So much is out of our control in this life, and ‘Too late now, lost track somehow,’ it’s just being like, ‘Everything’s turned to shit right now, but that’s OK because it’s unavoidable.’ It sounds very depressing, but you know sometimes how you can just take comfort in the fact that no matter what you do, you’re going to die anyway, so don’t worry about it too much, because you can’t control everything? I guess there’s a little bit of that in ‘Too Late Now.’”","short":"“I don’t want us to ever lose sight of having fun.

It upended her world right as our social lives were already contracting under the weight of the pandemic, giving her plenty of time to mourn and then heal. Most of the songs on <i>Broken Hearts Club</i>, despite its name, were written before that, when she was still swaddled in the bliss of deep, reciprocal love. What results is a conceptual evolution of romance and its subsequent unraveling, traced over the course of the album.\n\n“CYBAH” (as in “could you break a heart”—one of the few songs written after the fact) captures the ambivalence of catching feelings, as fear begins to give way to surrender. Warm fuzzy feelings abound. They're in the ecstasy of “Fast Car,” an ode to not-so-secret rendezvous and stolen kisses, and the sentimental delight of “Sweet” and “Control,” both emblems of infatuation transforming into safety and comfort. Around “Out Loud”—a gorgeous plea to be desired and adored without shame which becomes especially cogent through the voices of Syd and Kehlani, both of whom are gay—cracks begin to emerge, before the all-out shattering of “Goodbye My Love.”\n\nLove is a risk and deserves music that reflects as much, and likewise, within the space of <i>Broken Hearts Club</i>, Syd shows up more vulnerable than ever. The lilt of her voice shifts forward, front and center to sing the kind of lyrics that could only come from real-life inspiration. There's no hiding here. It may be her most personal album to date, but it resonates far beyond.","short":"The singer’s latest captures romance and its unraveling—listen in Spatial."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/04xudYiCT2xyEVfF5Ov14Y"}},{"id":"1610572570","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610572570?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d2/76/02/d27602ab-0638-bfeb-b973-4b5883afe2cc/075679756503.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"b6a56d","textColor2":"e7ac6b","textColor4":"ba8d59","textColor1":"e2cb85","bgColor":"071110","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sad Night Dynamite","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/volume-ii/1610572570","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-07","name":"Volume II","recordLabel":"Parametric/Atlantic","upc":"075679756503","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Irish Wristwatch Limited under exclusive license to Parlophone Records Limited and Elektra Records","playParams":{"id":"1610572570","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/67yqXDQTVNgwD0MUeQ2uma"}},{"id":"1611591940","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611591940?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/a9/34/17/a93417f8-567b-da81-f56c-27a907e7e044/093624876984.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a9c9c3","textColor2":"71dbe9","textColor4":"72bebf","textColor1":"b6eaee","bgColor":"744717","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Regrettes","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/further-joy/1611591940","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Further Joy","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624876984","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021, 2022 Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1611591940","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wDkeMikKlMvcj3ylZrDnu"}},{"id":"1604657567","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604657567?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/c6/e9/c2/c6e9c20f-cc6f-f5d9-9f25-ad69b208966a/5056167170006_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2000,"textColor3":"c1b4a4","textColor2":"dc8b50","textColor4":"b47344","textColor1":"eddcc7","bgColor":"131418","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lizzy McAlpine","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/five-seconds-flat/1604657567","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"five seconds flat","recordLabel":"Harbour Artists & Music","upc":"5056167170006","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Harbour Artists & Music under exclusive license to AWAL Recordings America, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1604657567","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vh3nkUP7HlDQIeSm7Ht6N"}},{"id":"1608206266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1608206266?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/95/fe/6f/95fe6fa5-a436-0c9e-3093-ba328205f872/810074421140.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6c9ca","textColor2":"c0c4c2","textColor4":"9ca1a1","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"0a191e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jack White","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fear-of-the-dawn/1608206266","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Fear Of The Dawn","recordLabel":"2022 Third Man Records, LLC","upc":"810074421140","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Third Man Records","playParams":{"id":"1608206266","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Every time I go in, I'm trying to do something I haven't done before,” Jack White tells Apple Music. “And it's not like something that <i>other</i> people have never done before. It’s whatever it is to get me to a different zone so I'm not repeating myself.” \n\nOn <i>Fear of the Dawn</i>—the first of two solo LPs White is releasing in 2022, and the first in over four years—that zone is the world of digital studio effects, new territory for an artist who’s long been an avatar and champion for all matters analog. Here, working in lockdown and playing most of the instruments himself as a result, White’s challenged himself to make a rock record that’s every bit as immediate and textured as what he’s made before. The guitars are scrambled and fried, blown out and buffed to an often blinding shine (see: the crispy title track; “The White Raven”). Keys squiggle and giggle (“Morning, Noon and Night”), drums stutter and skitter and hiccup (“That Was Then, This is Now,” “What’s the Trick?”). It’s a real studio record, saturated and collage-like—White flexing his muscles as a producer.  “I don't know how many, but there's dozens and dozens of tracks,” he says of the recording process. “I never used to do that. I made mistakes—I would play drums last, which you're not supposed to do. But then I started to feed off of that. I liked that it was wrong. It's nice that time goes on and you get better at certain things in the studio.”\n\nAnd having been so dogmatic from the start—famously dedicated to tape, vinyl, and primary colors—White sounds free to experiment on <i>Fear of the Dawn</i>, whether he’s dusting off a Cab Calloway sample and joining forces with Q-Tip for “Hi-De-Ho” or pasting together shards of radioactive guitar and mutating vocals on “Into the Twilight.” But that doesn’t mean he’s any less disciplined. “It's delicate—when you have eight tracks only, there's not much you can do,” he says. “If someone says you can have as many tracks as you want, now you got to be your own boss. You got to be hard on yourself. All the years of the razor blade editing gets you to a point where I don't want to waste my energy on that when I could put that energy to this now.”","short":"“Every time I go in, I'm trying to do something I haven't done before.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/46qeiLBu3KwqFQpJBT7t6B"}},{"id":"1616949998","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616949998?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f0/db/9a/f0db9ad3-db1c-faad-f869-060299e148be/dj.cnhvnyci.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"31302f","textColor2":"252424","textColor4":"4f4e4c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f7f3ed","hasP3":false},"artistName":"ALTÉGO","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/todays-hits-april-2022-dj-mix/1616949998","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"trackCount":33,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Today’s Hits: April 2022 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381890650","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1616949998","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If you’ve heard ALTÉGO’s “Toxic Pony”—their viral mash-up of Britney’s “Toxic” and Ginuwine’s “Pony”—then you know the London-based twins Michael and Lucas Fernandes-Pense have a penchant for putting pop hits together in an irresistibly danceable way.

If that wasn’t enough to stake the Brooklyn MC’s claim in contemporary New York City hip-hop lore, he spells it out in rhyme: “Pop was the king of New York, now I'm the n***a in charge.”\n\nFivio has been nothing if not clear about his reverence for Pop Smoke throughout their once-intertwined ascents, but if <i>B.I.B.L.E.</i>’s long and star-studded guest list tells us anything, it’s that Fivio is well on his way to being crowned the hottest in the city. <i>B.I.B.L.E.</i>, which is actually executive-produced by West—and mixed and mastered by MIKE DEAN—features Quavo, A$AP Rocky, Coi Leray, Queen Naija, Vory, Chlöe, Lil Yachty, Blueface, DJ Khaled, Ne-Yo, and Polo G, in addition to the aforementioned West and Keys. To Fivio’s credit, though, he’s invited them all to the trenches, setting a table of nonstop Brooklyn drill production as envisioned by frequent collaborators AyoAA and AXL Beats. These aren’t the kind of backdrops we’re used to hearing a large majority of these guests against, but we figure they see in Fivio what he sees in himself, and that’s NYC hip-hop’s latest and greatest conquering hero.","short":"The Brooklyn driller invites us into his world.

The ensuing slowdown of the music industry gave Swindell more time than expected to work on what would become <i>Stereotype</i>, allowing him to take stock of exactly what kind of message he wanted to send with his fourth studio album. “You just didn’t know what to expect, what was coming,” he tells Apple Music. “And I think me making the music, getting the right songs—it just changed the process of this album so much that, looking back, I’m very proud of it. But I don’t think we’d have the album we have without everything we went through, the bad and the good.”\n \nAccordingly, <i>Stereotype</i> showcases Swindell’s growth in the intervening four years. Songs like the title track and “Girl Goes Crazy” share fresh takes on the clichéd “girl in a country song” narrative. “Every Beer” is raw and emotional, drawing from Swindell’s own experiences with grief as well as the unexpected passing of Kobe Bryant. And “She Had Me at Heads Carolina” is a clever interpretation of the classic Jo Dee Messina song “Heads Carolina, Tails California,” drawing connections between the increasingly influential ’90s era of country music and today’s contemporary sound. Guests on <i>Stereotype</i> include Lainey Wilson, who joins Swindell for “Never Say Never,” and frequent collaborator HARDY, who guests on “Down to the Bar.” Below, Swindell walks Apple Music through several key tracks on <i>Stereotype</i>.\n \n<b>“Stereotype”</b>\n“It’s about a girl that you might think you know by looking [at her], but she might have a little wild side to her. The production is what makes it. When that chorus comes in and then everything just kicks full-in after the beginning of that chorus, that was HARDY’s idea. I remember him saying, ‘This right here, everything needs to drop out. I can already hear the crowd singing that part.’ And I’m just like, ‘Man, he’s, he’s good at what he does.’”\n \n<b>“Every Beer”</b>\n“It’s sad losing anybody way too soon, but Kobe Bryant, one of the best athletes in the world you’ve grown up watching, you just realize that could happen to anybody at any time. Doesn’t matter who you are, where you are. And I remember posting a picture of Kobe and his daughter that morning and just saying, ‘You better tell who you love you love them while you got a chance, because you never know.’ We got to talking about that in the writing room. We didn’t have the title, the idea, or anything. It was just a down mood. Me and Jordan [Schmidt] and HARDY, we were all in shock. What do you say? What do you do? And we just started talking about how fragile life is and all the things that we better do while we get a chance.”\n \n<b>“She Had Me at Heads Carolina”</b>\n“I love every artist in the ’90s, whether it’s Jo Dee [Messina], Shania [Twain], Reba [McEntire]. I’m such a big fan of all of them. And [it was cool] to be able to go back to a song that Jo Dee Messina made a huge hit out of, and to be able to do a different spin on it. Think about all the people that have ever gotten up and sang that song at karaoke.”\n \n<b>“Girl Goes Crazy”</b>\n“This song is talking about a girl that’s just had enough. And if you knew her story, there was a lot. The guy over there walked in with a new girl. That’s the reason she’s upset. It’s not her fault that the guy’s not a good guy. I just think the angle of that was so different than anything I’ve done. I just felt like this is going to be a girl anthem for people that are going through a tough time and want to forget about somebody that’s done them wrong. This is going to be their song. They can turn up and realize that, hey, it’s not their fault.”","short":"Hear the follow-up to 2018’s All of It."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4rl9XdFEi5hIagPjROoA55"}},{"id":"1617894269","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617894269?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/d0/d2/cf/d0d2cfea-a2b0-2f00-3d37-910c58fecb40/075597908961.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"cccccb","textColor2":"f6b95b","textColor4":"ce994a","textColor1":"f4f9fc","bgColor":"2d1806","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wiz Khalifa, Big K.R.I.T. & Girl Talk","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/full-court-press/1617894269","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Full Court Press","recordLabel":"Taylor Gang Ent./GT Recordings LLC/Asylum","upc":"075597908961","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Taylor Gang Ent. / GT Recordings LLC / Asylum Records","playParams":{"id":"1617894269","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MLxuO3jk1GYUfJIMYMZCS"}},{"id":"1598486370","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598486370?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b8/84/e4/b884e448-58f2-ca3c-34b3-c604bddb5ba8/098787143065.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"d9d9d9","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"cecece","textColor1":"fbfbfb","bgColor":"535353","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Father John Misty","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chlo%C3%AB-and-the-next-20th-century/1598486370","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Chloë and the Next 20th Century","recordLabel":"Sub Pop Records","upc":"098787143065","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Sub Pop Records","playParams":{"id":"1598486370","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Josh Tillman, aka Father John Misty, has released five albums in the last decade—and each one is an expansion of and challenge to his indie-folk instrumental palette.

A swooning sax solo in a somber jazz number (“Buddy’s Rendezvous”) is immediately followed by the trill of a psychedelic harpsichord (“Q4”); “Goodbye Mr. Blue” recalls the acoustic inclinations of his early work, and warm strings wash over the record, from its first single, the romantic “Funny Girl,” through “The Next 20th Century,” the album’s sardonic closer, which resurfaces the ever-simmering existential dread of <i>Pure Comedy</i>. “If this century’s here to stay,” he sings on the track, “I don’t know about you, but I’ll take the love songs/And the great distance that they came.”","short":"Josh Tillman pairs his articulate inner monologue with eclectic arrangements."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2tfg6zi5pwuYeQ0IHYnOBz"}},{"id":"1617714439","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617714439?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/92/2e/85/922e8526-87a8-18b9-49db-8d7bf8d13fdf/22UMGIM35382.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"35312a","textColor2":"191816","textColor4":"3e3932","textColor1":"0e0e0c","bgColor":"d2bda2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Coi Leray","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trendsetter/1617714439","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Trendsetter","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602435585185","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Uptown Records, a division of Republic Records and UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1617714439","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Hear the Jersey-hailing MC put herself first."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6B6TNpcbfLYdBweoByc1vi"}},{"id":"1616729881","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616729881?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/45/7d/b5/457db57b-9e38-cf6d-1b80-9e1dd03449ee/23477.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdbdbd","textColor2":"f70926","textColor4":"c80920","textColor1":"ebebeb","bgColor":"090909","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rob49","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-vulture-island/1616729881","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"Welcome To Vulture Island","recordLabel":"Rob49","upc":"808391138308","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Rob49","playParams":{"id":"1616729881","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0g96ZZ9ME5DaTwZb1VYxmo"}},{"id":"1612343292","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1612343292?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/45/51/1a/45511a59-00c6-a737-79ae-13b94a7c2476/886449948079.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"413a3f","textColor2":"160e15","textColor4":"453e44","textColor1":"11090f","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Caitlyn Smith","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/high/1612343292","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"High","recordLabel":"Monument Records","upc":"886449948079","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Monument Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1612343292","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Three albums into her career as a solo artist, country singer-songwriter Caitlyn Smith continues coming into her own with <i>High</i>, the follow-up to 2020's <i>Supernova</i> and the first album she has self-produced.

continue their exploration of two miraculous years in Mozart’s life. This album moves on to 1786, with Mozart now settled in Vienna (“the land of the piano,” as he called it) and composing his greatest piano concertos and chamber music, each fizzing with energy and reaching to extraordinary depths. The synergy of Andsnes and his musicians can be heard in every bar, as if each player were instinctively attuned to every contour in Mozart’s music. The result is an intensely thrilling performance of <i>Piano Concerto No. 23</i>, its second-movement Adagio one of Mozart’s most beautiful and heart-rending creations. Composed the same month as <i>No. 23</i>, <i>Piano Concerto No. 24</i> possesses a grandeur that heralds the age of Beethoven. Equally sublime—and sublimely played—are the chamber works that bind this album together, including the <i>Piano Quartet No. 2</i>, a work of dazzling energy with moments of breathtaking intimacy.","short":"The pianist’s second album exploring two miraculous years in Mozart’s life."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1600988012","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600988012?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/75/52/49/75524935-3509-55b6-62c4-d1eb3d3d5d7c/21UM1IM52343.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7aa91","textColor2":"edaf94","textColor4":"bf8f77","textColor1":"f8d1b3","bgColor":"060c06","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kae Tempest","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-line-is-a-curve/1600988012","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-08","name":"The Line Is A Curve","recordLabel":"American Recordings / Republic Records","upc":"00602438639694","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"American Recordings; ℗ 2022 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1600988012","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Coming off the back of 2019’s excellent <i>The Book of Traps and Lessons</i> and the critically acclaimed play <i>Paradise</i> at London’s National Theatre in 2021, MC and poet Kae Tempest’s fourth album is their most ambitious, personal, and open to date. Made with longtime collaborator and producer Dan Carey, the record moves in a series of bold musical and thematic suites that take in collaborators including Lianne La Havas, South London rapper Confucius MC, Fontaines D.C.’s Grian Chatten, and BROCKHAMPTON’s Kevin Abstract. \n \n<i>The Line Is a Curve</i> is about letting go of the anxieties and fears that hold you back and embracing life’s cyclical nature. “This record is meant to symbolize a journey through different pressures,” says Tempest, “whether it’s the pressures of a relationship, or trying to survive and build the name for yourself, or just trying to get through the day. It will mean something different to everybody, but that’s the beauty of language.”\n \nHere, they talk us through <i>The Line Is a Curve</i>, track by track.\n \n<b>“Priority Boredom”</b>\n“It’s an evocation of a feeling that I imagine we all are familiar with, which is the relentless pressure of existence and the forces competing for our attention. It’s meant to plunge you directly into the experience of the dull numbness and the claustrophobia of life in the present moment. What it’s saying is this race to death that we call progress or happiness or the pursuit of normal activity, happy families, or whatever the value system is that we’ve swallowed up and are trying to recreate is actually extremely taxing for the individual and also for the community. It’s quite sarcastic in its own way. It’s meant to be knowing rather than an actual description of our lives.”\n \n<b>“I Saw Light” (feat. Grian Chatten)</b>\n“I’ve wanted to work with Grian ever since I met him. My desire was to have Grian’s voice contributing a poem because I feel him in that way, as a poet. When you put somebody else’s words alongside yours, you create this friction between the verses that creates new meaning. It gives the words a new energy, a new dimension. Grian putting his words down transformed and affected the verse that I had already written. It’s beautiful.”\n \n<b>“Nothing to Prove”</b>\n“It’s a statement song. It’s powerful in its musicality. I love the beat. The first and the second verses are absolutely phonetically matched. There is communication going on between the transformations in the lyric as it begins in one way, and then as it transforms in the other way, so you have this kind of call-and-response between two verses. For me as a writer, a rhymer, and a lyricist, to be doing that on a record is an embodiment of having nothing to prove. It’s like, ‘Here, look what this song is doing.’ It’s like this chorus, musicality, lyricism, flow that are all saying the same thing. There’s nothing to prove—it’s all to play for.”\n \n<b>“No Prizes” (feat. Lianne La Havas)</b>\n“It’s close-up portraits of three characters and Lianne’s voice is the overarching theme or the undercurrent of what is common with all of them. The same thing that is occurring for them all, and all of us, in this world where we’ve set the album—where the dominant mythology says, ‘I’ve just got to keep climbing, and I don’t know why.’ I’ve known Lianne for a long time, and I love her voice passionately. There’s mutual respect and friendship there, and it just felt like the right time to try and bring some of that energy through into the record.”\n \n<b>“Salt Coast”</b>\n“It’s a love letter to Britain. Within my imagination, this island was embodied as this kid, this young girl. I suppose I was thinking about my childhood. I was thinking about the people I knew and loved as a kid, the people that made the most profound impact on me, and also the particular Britishness of that time. It’s acknowledging all of the complexities of loving home. It’s a complex place to love but, for me, it’s no less beautiful than any other. It’s home. I’ve gone deeply into why this soil feels the way it feels to me. I really want it to be the unofficial England World Cup anthem. Imagine that on the terraces.”\n \n<b>“Don’t You Ever”</b>\n“Kwake Bass plays the drums. We’ve been friends since childhood. He’s one of the greatest drummers of our generation, I think. The guitar part is by this guy Luke [Eastop]. We were all in a band together when we were about 19 years old, and the music on this, not the lyrics, was something that we used to play together when we were doing all of these hippie festivals. I just thought to myself on this record, ‘I want to get everybody together again. I want us to play together, and I want to do a kind of grown-up version of that song.’ Because it’s a fucking brilliant song.”\n \n<b>“These Are the Days”</b>\n“This is one that me and Dan wrote together in this weird studio lockdown situation. It’s this big, epic production, but we were writing it on a very minimized kit. We knew we wanted to do it live, so when the band came in to do ‘Don’t You Ever,’ we also did ‘These Are the Days’ with all of the horns and the same crew playing the bass and the drums. That had a huge impact on it. It’s us saying, ‘Yeah, these are the days, this is the time, let’s fucking play this song!’”\n \n<b>“Smoking” (feat. Confucius MC)</b>\n“When I started rapping—and I’m talking about 15, 16 years old—Confucius was instrumental in guiding me. His lyricism was profound for me. We were in a crew together, and he was an important person in my creative life. If it wasn’t for those people, I would not be here, so I wanted to bring my community into my creativity. It sounds the way it does because I recorded it backstage at a festival and sent it to Dan as a voice note, which I often do.”\n \n<b>“Water in the Rain” (feat. Assia)</b>\n“It’s kind of setting myself free from some stuff that I’ve been suffering from with poor mental health. I think sometimes singing about it, just describing it and going into the experience of it, can take some of the fear out of what you experience when you’re experiencing it in isolation. It’s a profound moment on the album for me.”\n \n<b>“Move”</b>\n“I think of the album as a series of suites. You start with ‘Smoking’ and all of the themes that come up in that and then you move into ‘Water in the Rain,’ which is this unleashing of deep emotion, which then opens up the space for us to get to ‘Move.’ ‘Move’ is a response to what’s come before. I’ve connected with the tenderness, so now I can really dig deep and find my strength. This is the time to get up off the floor and stand up for yourself. The idea of ‘Move’ is that you earn that strength by being that vulnerable. It’s a fight song. I might be losing right now, but I’m not going to give up.”\n \n<b>“More Pressure” (feat. Kevin Abstract)</b>\n“<i>The Line Is a Curve</i> builds its momentum. It’s like a wave: You build up all of this galvanizing spirit of fight, and that’s what enables you to reframe the narrative of the pressures that you’re under. Now you can say, ‘Right, I get it. I’m under all this pressure, but I’m going to use all this pressure, and I’m going to use this energy to make change and cultivate greater acceptance.’ It’s all part of this swell that begins at the start of the record. Rick Rubin suggested that I give Kevin a shout. It’s not quite as close to home as the other collaborations, which are very much based in South London, but it opens the record up a bit more and, hopefully, allows more people in.”\n \n<b>“Grace”</b>\n“It’s like a prayer. It’s this repeated refrain that comes back to me. When I’m in need, I go back to those words: ‘Let me be loved. Let me be loving.’ I would say those words to myself before going out onstage to do a performance of <i>The Book of Traps and Lessons</i>. It’s become something to keep me grounded. It feels really fitting that this song came out of the sessions making this album, but then it’s something that had its place in other works that I’ve done. Dan is playing the synth line to ‘Priority Boredom’ on the guitar, so it leads you back around in a circle. It’s such a gentle, tender way of finishing the album.”","short":"“This record is meant to symbolize a journey through different
