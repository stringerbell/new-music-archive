Future has been a poster boy for the kind of toxic romantic engagements that turn well-intentioned social media users into self-certified relationship experts since about the time of his split with one-time fiancée Ciara. But rather than defend his lifestyle choices in earnest or make a case for himself as misunderstood, he drops an album whose title posits him as either a vindictive lover or a victim of a betrayal. But Future is nobody’s victim.\n\nWith <i>I NEVER LIKED YOU</i>, he's more likely a master of marketing. The album has far less to do with the rhetoric that surrounds his dating life than it does the MC’s lifestyle, drawing open the blinds within a single bar of “HOLY GHOST”: “I was in my big truck, my wrist up, getting my dick sucked.” The MC sounds as happy as ever across <i>I NEVER LIKED YOU</i>, lamenting only—in the rare instance that he laments—a perceived lack of credit for his stylistic influence (“I'M DAT N***A,” “PUFFIN ON ZOOTIEZ”). There are two instances, however, wherein his influence is wholly undeniable: “I’M ON ONE” and “KEEP IT BURNIN,” where Drake and Kanye West each take a turn paying tribute to one of their most cherished collaborators, rattling off volatile non sequiturs in classic Future style.","short":"Future lets us in on the superstar MC lifestyle.

And singing was never cool, back in the day, so I would try and hide it to remain as normal as I could.” The East Londoner’s talent is no longer hidden.\n\nJames first found acclaim during his preteen years with throwback covers before losing momentum with a lost record deal. He regained his footing with 2019’s stellar <i>DETOUR</i>, and <i>JOYRIDE</i> two years later. “Sometimes, in the moment, we don’t always understand why we’re not exactly where we need to be,” he says. “But I used that as the fuel to keep me going. I didn’t know where my talent was going to take me, I just knew that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.” \n\nHere, James’ fluency in neo-soul and R&B is fused with the gospel leanings of a childhood raised in the church. With this, he reaches for compelling vulnerability: There are tracks that recognize the risk—and romance—of nightclub trysts (“LOVE IN THE CLUB”), experiences of deep intimacy (“GALAXY SWIM”), and the bitterness behind broken ties (“HENNESSY TEARS”). A potent blend of pillowy vocals and heady lyricism, James’ flows veer from anxious to carefree—perfectly partnering with his effervescent R&B and aching soul. “Now I want to make music for that young kid in me,” he says. “To help lift him up.”","short":"“I’ve always been in my own little world.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1615644274","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615644274?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/66/75/04/667504c5-b502-0d70-e12a-5db22c5541ae/075679779724.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"383739","textColor2":"37322e","textColor4":"5b5654","textColor1":"0c0b0d","bgColor":"eae5eb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kehlani","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-water-road/1615644274","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"blue water road","recordLabel":"TSNMI / Atlantic","upc":"075679779724","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"TSNMI/Atlantic, ℗ 2021 Atlantic Records Group LLC","playParams":{"id":"1615644274","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The first single Kehlani released from <i>blue water road</i>, a mournful yet joyful elegy for lost loved ones titled “altar,” immediately signaled a shift for the singer. The deaths of young friends and peers sent them searching for clarity, and the song intends to pass along to listeners the peace they found in that quest. It also marks a bit of a creative shift, both in the production—a cinematic ’80s-esque jam—and in the lyrics. “I think I have always leaned on talking about love...because it's the most constant emotion we all experience as people,” they explained to Apple Music's Nadeska. “But there are three or four songs on this album that are just about me or about spirituality that aren't related to just a relationship.”\n\nIndeed, the album does feel different from its predecessors; it isn’t weighty so much as measured. Romances are as passionate as ever, like on the flirtatious “any given sunday” and “up at night” (which feature Blxst and Justin Bieber, respectively). And they still go sour, as on songs like “wish i never” and “more than i should.” But “get me started,” a simmering collaboration with Syd, seeks to communicate through the issues rather than bask in the implosion, while “little story,” an acoustic-guitar-driven ballad, resembles something akin to accountability for failing to show up emotionally.\n\nPart of this is the result of the maturation that comes with aging, but another aspect is motherhood and Kehlani’s desire for their daughter to have the kind of music that can anchor a person through the waves of life. It is, in many ways, a return to form, a refined take on the introspection they have always led with. “I can make healing music as a healing person,” they told Nadeska. “I don't have to weigh myself down with the expectation that music isn't deep if it isn't raging or sad.”","short":"The singer’s latest reflects maturation and evolution.

Here the Seoul singer takes us through a selection of his favorite tracks on the album.\n\n<b>“That That” (prod.&feat. SUGA)</b>\n“We have a saying in the K-pop industry. If the song is meant to be a hit, it’s made in a jiff. It was a ‘jiff’ I haven’t experienced in a long time. I wrote my part and sent it to SUGA, and SUGA took it. Then I wrote my verse, and just like table tennis, we went back and forth with ease. Hitting it off, they call it, right? We really hit it off.”\n\n<b>“You Move Me” (feat. Sung Si Kyung)</b>\n“I can put this song in one word: PSY vibes. We had those vibes in ‘Paradise’ and ‘What Would Have Been?’, and I have a feeling that this new track will become something beyond those songs. Having Sung Si Kyung as the featured artist was definitely the game-changer. I talk about life through rap while Sung Si Kyung sings about it, and that package of emotion is like a great blockbuster movie.”\n\n<b>“Sleepless” (feat. HEIZE)</b>\n“It was one of those nights when you toss and turn. I asked myself who would really understand how that feels, and I could only think of HEIZE. We all have those days when you feel down without a particular reason. As the lyrics of this song were written during one of those days, I hope this will make those who are going through one more bearable. HEIZE had asked me how she should sing this song. It’s almost a sin to give direction to HEIZE with this kind of song. I simply told her to sing however she liked to. Recording sessions ended really quickly that day. It was another one of those sleepless nights.”\n\n<b>“Now” (feat. Hwa Sa)</b>\n“This song is based on ‘When the Rain Begins to Fall,’ sung by Jermaine Jackson and Pia Zadora in 1984. In 1987, a Korean band named Seoul Family did a remake of this song. I knew Hwa Sa, who was born in 1995, wouldn’t even know this song, but I could only think of her when I heard this song. If she hadn’t accepted, I wouldn’t have included this track on my album. It’s a song you should sing your soul out within your vocal range.”\n\n<b>“forEVER” (feat. TABLO)</b>\n“It took only four days to write, record, and edit this song. But it took three years to share it with the world. I thought it might take forever, like the title of it. There are parts that I got to relate to better after time. I want to thank TABLO for being so patient. I’m sorry and I love you, TABLO!”","short":"The K-pop phenom’s ninth album, in Spatial, features special guests galore."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0v4swbfO7N9WyJkUo465C4"}},{"id":"1617906911","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617906911?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2500,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/6f/24/bd/6f24bde0-c4c2-2492-62e7-0bfb25aa7f86/194690801396_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2500,"textColor3":"3b3213","textColor2":"430b09","textColor4":"683211","textColor1":"0b0b0b","bgColor":"fcce31","hasP3":false},"artistName":"PJ Morton","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/watch-the-sun/1617906911","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Watch The Sun","recordLabel":"Morton Records / EMPIRE","upc":"194690801396","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Morton Records / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1617906911","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An examination of love as vulnerable as it is uplifting.

Their second LP, <i>WET TENNIS</i>, is largely the product of their regular live streams during the COVID-19 pandemic, a release that continues their idiosyncratic energy. In one moment, they’re sampling Suzanne Vega’s “Tom’s Diner” (“Summer in New York”) and finding inspiration in “Chic and *NSYNC,” according to Halpern (“Wet Tennis”); in another, they’re working with Turkish DJ Mahmut Orhan (“Forgive Me”) and Malian duo Amadou & Mariam (“Mon Cheri”) on a collection of borderless music. \n \n“We covered a lot more genres on this album,” Hawley-Weld tells Apple Music. “And we had to strike the balance between being honest about what we were experiencing and being optimistic. If there’s an emotional or a negative song, it’s always followed by a really hopeful one.” The message is found in the album title as well. It’s a celebration of the sport—how the duo work as a team, as if hitting a ball back and forth—a challenge of the traditional image to be more inclusive, “wet and sexy and colorful,” she says. It’s also an acronym: When Everyone Tries To Evolve, Nothing Negative Is Safe. “That’s basically the thesis statement,” Halpern says. “Which is when everyone intentionally decides to grow and evolve around any obstacles and continue to stay positive, that the negativity is not safe. You can move through it, always.” Below, Sofi Tukker walk through <i>WET TENNIS</i>, track by track.\n \n<b>“Kakee”</b>\nSophie Hawley-Weld: “This song is an ode to my favorite fruit, which is the persimmon. I was obsessing over this fruit, and I hit up the Brazilian poet that we’ve worked with since the very beginning of the band. His name is Chacal. He lives in Rio, and I texted him, ‘Chacal, we really need to write a poem about the persimmon.’ He wrote this poem about persimmons that’s just totally absurd—true to form for him. And it’s just this sexy persimmon poem. It has a James Bond vibe to us. Who knows what genre that song is.”\n \n<b>“Original Sin”</b>\nSHW: “Whether or not people are religious, the idea of the original sin is actually embedded in a lot of people’s brains and psyches, whether they like it or not. I think that it can be a really harmful mentality. Part of what we try to do with [our fans] the Freak Fam—and with what we’re saying in the world—is that you are perfect as you are, with all of your mistakes and so-called sins and desires. We really just wanted to say, ‘Hey, be nice to yourself.’ To know that you’re human, and humans are full of wonderful mistakes.”\n \n<b>“Summer in New York”</b>\nTucker Halpern: “We actually wrote the song without the ‘Tom’s Diner’ sample in it. Then we realized connecting the ideas felt really good because that’s one of the only other songs we really could think of that details an entire day, just normal things you would do. It’s also about New York, so that really did feel so good. After we finished the song, we were just obsessed with the song instantly. We got so obsessed that we realized we wanted to move back to New York, and so we actually bought a place in New York.”\n \n“Forgive Me”\nSHW: “At the time, I was like, ‘I don’t want to write. I’m in pain.’ And now, it’s alchemized into this thing that now really connects me with people all around the world who listen to the song and then are like, ‘Hey, I'm also going through something that feels very similar. Thank you so much for writing this song.’ It’s been so cool to experience that. And Mahmut Orhan is one of our favorite artists in the world. He remixed our song ‘Drinkee’ and then our song ‘Swing.’ His remixes are some of our favorite pieces of music. And the Turkish violin is so stunning.”\n \n<b>“Wet Tennis”</b>\nSHW: “Basically, we were in our house and Tucker, I swear, took on a completely different persona. Something overtook his body—he became somebody else, and he started singing, ‘Yeah. That’s life.’ We were just dancing around the house, singing this song in this funny character. We brought it to a bunch of musicians in Miami who are just world-class. We had the best organ player play. We had some incredible trumpet players, and the most amazing Brazilian percussionist that really added a lot of musicality to the parts.”\n \n<b>“Interlude”</b>\nSHW: “This is a palate-cleanser, the thing that separates the first half of the album from the second half. And the lyrics are actually the acronym When Everyone Tries To Evolve, Nothing Negative Is Safe. It ends on ‘Maybe I don’t want to know what’s on the other side,’ and then, on the other side, is the song ‘Sun Came Up.’ It feels like you’re finishing a day and starting a new one. An exhale before dancing again.“\n \n<b>“Sun Came Up” (feat. John Summit)</b>\nTH: “When we were live-streaming in the pandemic, we were playing a lot of John Summit music, and he was gaining popularity. We would tag him when we played his songs, and we started to talk in DMs on Instagram. We sent him the idea for this track, this demo. Within a couple hours, I swear, he sent back a new version of it. We went back and forth for a couple days. It was pretty funny because he has a party animal person, and it’s real, but the thing people don’t necessarily see is that, yeah, he might be partying all night, but he’s also up at 8 in the morning, working on the song and sending it back to us.”\n \n<b>“Larry Bird” (feat. Tucker’s Dad)</b>\nTH: “I wore 33 my whole life playing basketball. I played in college. Larry Bird was an inspiration that I always looked up to. He wasn’t the most athletic, he wasn’t the strongest, he wasn’t the most naturally gifted, but he would just dive on the floor. He would give it his all. I looked up to that a lot. And I think I’ve definitely brought that into the Sofi Tukker world. I have 33 tattooed on my hand in green. We were thinking of getting some old announcer/commentator voices off of YouTube, but then we thought, ‘You know what would be cooler? If we actually just had my dad talk about Larry Bird. We’ll record it and put that into the song.’ It felt like an amazing full-circle moment for me. And my dad is very excited to be a part of it.”\n \n<b>“Hold” (feat. BOII)</b>\nTH: “We loved the organic feel of that old sample [‘María Busca a Jesús’ by Ricardo Archuleta], and we worked on this song with this group called BOII. We started this on a tour bus maybe four years ago or something. This was the oldest song on the album. It laid the foundation for the vibe of the production and the song. And this song took many different iterations of it to finally get it to the place that feels right. It’s a really cool song about being able to love yourself before you can love other people, basically, and holding yourself and being alone and being comfortable with that.“\n \n<b>“Mon Cheri” (feat. Amadou & Mariam)</b>\nSHW: “We got an email that said, ‘Who in the entire world would you like to collaborate with?’ And we said Amadou & Mariam. We ended up having our dream come true. And this song just feels so hopeful and optimistic and bright. And it’s about eternal love—it makes us so happy. There’s French, Bambara, [and] Portuguese on it.”\n \n<b>“Freak”</b>\nTH: “It’s punkish. It’s sort of a rock/drum ’n’ bass song. It’s confusing.”\n \n<b>“What a Wonderful World”</b>\nSHW: “Again, we are definitely playing with a lot of different genres on this album, and so I also have a dad track on this album.

On his debut album, <i>Mr. Crawford</i>, it’s who he is as a man and an artist.\n\n“They telling me to make some club music/Nah, bitch, I’m a pop-star drug user,” NoCap sings on “I’ll Be Here.” Not unlike admitted influence Lil Wayne, the MC is partial to near-endless non sequitur, but buried within these brain dumps are declarations of identity: “My scars are amazing, I lost homie after homie,” he raps on the Kodak Black collaboration “Save the Day.” “I’m a real n***a, ain’t gotta record every time I hand out book bags,” he wants us to know on the album’s title track. “I was really in the streets before my YouTube,” he confesses on “GoRealer.” There’s likewise plenty here about the life he’s led since becoming maybe the most buzzed-about Alabama MC to date, but he’s just as quick to remind listeners—as he does on “Forever Loading”—that he's coming for everything he’s owed: “Lord forgive me for my sins, but I’m living off revenge.”","short":"“Lord forgive me for my sins, but I’m living off revenge.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3wTBdbTjE7aGH1e7WEs7A3"}},{"id":"1611645237","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611645237?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c4/b7/d1/c4b7d122-a0c4-b1ab-75e9-d4b1ee38edab/886449661381.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b2722","textColor2":"231209","textColor4":"442d25","textColor1":"180b04","bgColor":"c99999","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Miranda Lambert","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palomino/1611645237","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Palomino","recordLabel":"Vanner Records/RCA Records Label Nashville","upc":"886449661381","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Vanner Records, LLC, under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment.

Across 15 tracks, Lambert treks all over the United States, spinning colorful yarns of a rambling life out on the road. “We go to 36 different locations in this record and meet all kinds of characters that we made up,” Lambert tells Apple Music. “Or it might have been characters we have all met in our travels, put into these songs. I've never written with that much purpose.” \n\nLambert sets the freewheeling tone with opener “Actin’ Up,” a swampy ode to bad behavior. Tracks like “Scenes” and “Tourist” are some of Lambert’s most image-rich material yet, while “Music City Queen”—a collaboration with pioneering New Wavers The B-52’s—is easily one of her most fun. Some songs, like standout “Geraldene,” previously appeared in demo form on Lambert’s critically acclaimed <i>The Marfa Tapes</i>, a 2021 collaborative LP with Jack Ingram and Jon Randall, and take on new life thanks to thoughtful production from Lambert, Randall, and frequent collaborator Luke Dick. Below, Lambert shares insight into a handful of tracks on <i>Palomino</i>.\n\n<b>“Geraldene”</b>\n“She's everyone. I feel like we've all known one or been one at one point or the other. I just had that title because I was watching <i>Heartworn Highways</i> like a million times, and in that movie, Townes’ dog is named Geraldine. And Geraldine's this German shepherd, and I was like, ‘That's a cool name.’”\n\n<b>“Country Money”</b>\n“Aaron Raitiere pulls me in on a write one day. He's like, ‘Hey, come write with me and Mikey Reaves.’ I had never written with him before, and I was like, ‘Okay, cool, that'd be different,’ and we wrote ‘Country Money.’ It fit right into the vibe of this road trip we were taking. So it all just happened easily, which makes me a little nervous because I'm like, ‘Okay, when's the other shoe going to drop?’”\n\n<b>“Carousel”</b>\n“That is a real feeling. We joined the circus in one way or another, and we're so lucky to be part of it. I mean, I'm like, ‘If I ever lived before, I think I was either best friends with Calamity Jane or riding an elephant somewhere.’ Truly, that's what I was doing, because this is as close as I could get to those two things, what I do for a living. I miss so many weddings and funerals and baby showers and important moments of people that are important to me, and of my own, just because I'm rolling. But I think ‘Carousel’ puts this romantic spin on it where it's like, ‘It's okay. There's this whole other life that can happen, too.’”","short":"Miranda Lambert’s eighth LP is a road trip across America."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/69z5d2iu6PdaRZWvx8YVUl"}},{"id":"1619355569","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1619355569?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/8c/6f/1d/8c6f1d89-e1c7-5baa-dbf7-5a2963692e24/4050538765977.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"474747","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"MONSTA X","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shape-of-love-ep/1619355569","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-26","name":"SHAPE of LOVE - EP","recordLabel":"BMG Rights Management (US) LLC","upc":"4050538765977","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Starship Entertainment Co., Ltd. under exclusive license to BMG Rights Management (US) LLC","playParams":{"id":"1619355569","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Sparks fly in these sizzling, fiercely danceable K-pop serenades.","short":"Sparks fly in these sizzling, fiercely danceable K-pop serenades."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1620609132","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1620609132?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/c2/23/e9/c223e997-3d09-f1f6-ea30-b6d3e20884dd/22UMGIM45159.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9cdce","textColor2":"d5d9df","textColor4":"afb4b8","textColor1":"f7f8fa","bgColor":"14231e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nicholas Britell","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/succession-season-3-hbo-original-series-soundtrack/1620609132","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Succession: Season 3 (HBO Original Series Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"HBO Succession III - Score Album","upc":"00602445904112","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Home Box Office, Inc, under exclusive license to Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1620609132","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7loqC4xNMufDUv5rCdEn2S"}},{"id":"1593888649","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593888649?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/27/a7/fa/27a7fa04-890b-3cbc-ca7b-fca8f9ae8b3a/4050538753523.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"c15b5f","textColor2":"f15b67","textColor4":"c64a56","textColor1":"ea6f73","bgColor":"1b0a12","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bloc Party","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alpha-games/1593888649","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Alpha Games","recordLabel":"Infectious Music","upc":"4050538753523","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Bloc Party under exclusive licence to BMG Rights Management (UK) Limited","playParams":{"id":"1593888649","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Kele Okereke isn’t usually someone who looks backwards. “As soon as we finish a record and deliver it, that’s usually the point I stop listening to it as it becomes someone else’s,” Bloc Party’s singer/guitarist tells Apple Music. However, during 2018 and 2019, the band revisited their past as they played their debut album, 2005’s <i>Silent Alarm</i>, in full at live dates around the world. During sound checks, new music began to emerge—tracks that would eventually appear on their sixth studio album, <i>Alpha Games</i>. “The energy we were putting into the <i>Silent Alarm</i> songs, which were in our blood and our muscle memory, felt connected to these new songs on some level,” he says.\n\nDespite that genesis, <i>Alpha Games</i> is still a forward-looking record—not least because it’s the first to be truly made by this iteration of Bloc Party, with Okereke and fellow founding member Russell Lissack (guitar) joined by Justin Harris (bass) and Louise Bartle (drums). While the latter duo have been in post since 2015, previous album <i>Hymns</i>, made in 2016, was largely written by Okereke and Lissack, in the studio and directly into a computer. “We could manipulate anything any way that we felt like, and that can be quite eye-opening,” Okereke says. “But we knew this record needed to <i>feel</i> different, which it soon did, thanks to the spontaneous alchemy that came from four different personalities and perspectives coming together. The magical part of writing songs with other people is that you don’t know where you’re going to end up.”\n\nWhere they’ve ended up is as captivating as it is diverse. <i>Alpha Games</i> takes in hulking riffs (“Traps”), undulating grooves (“Callum Is a Snake”), cinematic electronica (“Sex Magik”), and brooding post-rock (“The Girls Are Fighting”)—all tied together by unifying themes of conflict and anger, dishonesty and duplicity. “There’s something fascinating about menacing things going on beneath the surface,” says Okereke. Let him guide you through the record, track by track.\n\n<b>“Day Drinker”</b>\n“It was two separate ideas that I could see potential in but needed to be finessed. In the final production session before we recorded the album, it all slotted into place. Lyrically, it really encapsulates what I see the record as being about: this kind of struggle for dominance. And what better way to exhibit and explore that than in the relationship between siblings? It’s about two warring siblings, an older brother who’s jealous of his younger brother’s success. We were able to carry that idea through in the instrumental section towards the end. The way that Russell and I are following each other with our guitar lines was, to me, supposed to signify two brothers dueling.”\n\n<b>“Traps”</b>\n“Justin had an idea for a version of the bassline, which we heard something in and added more parts around it. As it took shape, we’d play it in sound checks, and whenever we did, all of our crew would stop and listen. We knew then that there was something arresting about it. It gave us an indication of where we should be going with the album.”\n\n<b>“You Should Know the Truth”</b>\n“I like it because the musical refrain is so sweet and childlike but the words are so dark. It feels like one of the darkest things that I’ve ever sung, insomuch as it’s about coming clean after years of living a lie and the harm that can produce. But I love that most people won’t really get that [meaning]—if they don’t listen to the words then it’ll just be a pretty song. I quite like that, because a lot of my favorite music, like the Pixies, has such rousing melodies and violent imagery, marrying the dark and the light.”\n\n<b>“Callum Is a Snake”</b>\n“Callum is a real person, for sure, but Callum is not his real name. I think the song is less about him than it is about putting someone on blast, knowing that you’ve been fucked over and not wanting someone to get away with it. It’s about a very calm and calculated bout of aggression towards someone, because you can see what they’re doing and they need to stop, otherwise there will be consequences.”\n\n<b>“Rough Justice”</b>\n“This was one of the songs in which I could see lots of different scenes, like vignettes, as if I was a narrator watching them come together. I didn’t have a clear vision about what it was about, but looking back now I can see. It brings to mind a passage from the Bret Easton Ellis novel <i>Glamorama</i>, in which we find out that all of these socialite party people are actually an underground terrorist cell. That always stuck with me—that sense of there being a public face and a private face.”\n\n<b>“The Girls Are Fighting”</b>\n“The conflict here is about two women coming to blows because someone has been selling them dreams and lying to them, in order to get something he wanted out of them. That’s a theme that recurs throughout the record. It was a fascinating thing for me to explore, because I’ve always found those moments when people drop their masks of politeness, and real passion or violence erupts, to be strangely attractive.”\n\n<b>“Of Things Yet to Come”</b>\n“I guess it’s the most tender of the songs on the record. We were conscious that we wanted <i>Alpha Games</i> to have no lags and for all the energy to be up, but I feel like this is the one song when the energy isn’t up. It’s important because although there isn’t such palpable aggression in it, there is a tremendous sense of regret at the way life has panned out—and looking back wistfully and recognizing that you could have been a better person to someone.” \n\n<b>“Sex Magik”</b>\n“This song is ultimately about a very short-lived relationship—actually ‘tryst’ is probably a better word—with someone, without being fully aware of what they’re entirely about. You then recognize that you’re being led down a path that you’re not really sure you should be going down. Both ‘Sex Magik’ and ‘Traps,’ to me, feel quite sexual, but from different perspectives. In ‘Traps,’ it’s quite predatory: The singer is looking at someone he wants to take advantage of. In ‘Sex Magik,’ though, it’s the opposite side of that experience—someone realizing that maybe they’re being taken advantage of.”\n\n<b>“By Any Means Necessary”</b>\n“To me, it’s about ruthless ambition and knowing that you’ll stop at nothing to achieve what it is you’re setting out for, even at the cost of your humanity. That song feels like an assassin, psyching themselves up before the hit.”\n\n<b>“In Situ”</b>\n“Although ‘In Situ’ was one of the earlier songs we wrote, we didn’t really develop it properly until the end of the process. I was left with a bit of freedom, lyrically, so wrote them on the fly. It’s about this sense of inertia—this sense that after the pandemic, a lot of people reconciled what was going on in their lives. It’s about feeling you’re in your habitat, your space, having this life that has a sense of routine. I was sleeping in the same bed, not on a tour bus, so I was feeling quite domesticated. I think there was part of me that was worried the moss would grow over me and I’d forget what I’d done for such a big part of my life.”\n\n<b>“If We Get Caught”</b>\n“It definitely has a whimsical edge to it, but there’s a sense of impending doom. Although it’s a beautiful sentiment, about this tender moment between two people, there is this sense that very soon the shit is going to hit the fan. ‘If We Get Caught’ is like a final goodbye—a moment of tenderness before heads start to roll.”\n\n<b>“The Peace Offering”</b>\n“There’s all this rage and angst and conflict within the songs prior, but in ‘The Peace Offering’ there’s a sense of cold detachment. What happens after the fires of rage burn out and you’re left numb and disconnected? This song is about that feeling of letting your hate go but not letting love come into its place. Sometimes you have to cauterize the wound and move on. It’s ultimately about not looking for forgiveness, realizing that you’re never going to agree and that maybe it’s better to just part.”","short":"“This record feels different, thanks to four different personalities.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/12I46H1wjhsfOdf8iEETlB"}},{"id":"1601858871","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1601858871?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/21/68/7e/21687e5b-e182-04df-83c0-974500ddd848/29265.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"eecbcd","textColor2":"dce9fa","textColor4":"d4baca","textColor1":"fdfffe","bgColor":"b50009","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Toro y Moi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mahal/1601858871","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"MAHAL","recordLabel":"Dead Oceans","upc":"656605160160","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Dead Oceans","playParams":{"id":"1601858871","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Before becoming a progenitor in the microgenre chillwave—defined by a 2000s indie rock culture obsessed with 1980s electro-synth sounds and nostalgic, dreamy bedroom pop—Toro y Moi (Chazwick Bradley “Chaz Bear” Bundick) was known for his experimental production, leading to a long run of widely lauded albums. <i>MAHAL</i> is his seventh, its title taken from the Tagalog word for “expensive.” It's also a good time in 13 songs, from the Parliament funk of “Postman” and the psychedelic percussion of “Clarity” to the garage-psych of “The Medium” featuring New Zealand band Unknown Mortal Orchestra and the smoky “Mississippi.” If chillwave was a flash-in-the-pan moment, Toro Y Moi has long since survived it.","short":"A good time in 13 songs from a chillwave pioneer turned indie stalwart."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/16AQyjz1z9rOsTm6iVrBUR"}},{"id":"1620462344","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1620462344?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/90/61/ad/9061ad2d-7e81-4eaa-4d3b-54eab6e2c0c6/c0612fde-4990-4e78-a226-5ad406c85480.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"bcb8ad","textColor2":"e28558","textColor4":"bb714d","textColor1":"e3ded0","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Aluna","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dj-mag-coverstar-mix-dj-mix/1620462344","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":53,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-28","name":"DJ Mag: Coverstar Mix (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381894252","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1620462344","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1617818303","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617818303?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/a2/d3/02/a2d30243-3f4c-01ac-ecd1-5b1d6f8ad902/5060944576400.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2c2c2f","textColor2":"121216","textColor4":"303237","textColor1":"0d0a0c","bgColor":"a8b5bb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Charlotte de Witte","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/universal-consciousness-ep/1617818303","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-27","name":"Universal Consciousness -

With any plans to tour the record scuttled, that winter she managed to decamp from her London home to Oslo—just before borders were closing again—for some uninterrupted studio time. Much like <i>Inner Song</i>’s rather short 35-day gestation, after a month of work with Norwegian avant-garde/noise producer Lasse Marhaug, Owens emerged with <i>LP.8</i>, her most experimental, liberating record yet.\n \nOn her previous full-lengths—this is actually her third, not her eighth—Owens alternated between deep, plodding techno tracks and moody synth compositions, over which her lithe vocals floated effortlessly. But on <i>LP.8</i>, the contrasts—between the earthly and the ethereal—are felt more deeply. The opener, “Release,” plays like a lost Chris & Cosey cut, its crunchy precision finding that sweet spot between industrial and early techno. On the New Age-y “Anadlu,” “S.O (2),”and “Olga,” hints of Enya’s influence shine through, but the songs’ gauzy atmospheres are often counterweighted by brooding undertones. “Nana Piano” is a melancholy solo piano sketch, unfettered except for some gentle birdsong in the background. But the closing “Sonic 8” is Owens at her most direct and visceral: She channels all sorts of frustrations while intoning, “This is a wake-up call/This is an emergency” over a beat so skeletal and abrasive that it sounds like a frayed wire swinging dangerously close to the bathtub.","short":"The Welsh producer decamps to Oslo for a study in contrasting moods."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2nDuOMxIgxcimqobgE5veh"}},{"id":"1620235077","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1620235077?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/de/77/86/de7786d0-d656-2ed3-d843-abbad86f8c33/194690820144_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"333a3c","textColor2":"3d2003","textColor4":"634c35","textColor1":"00090c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Eric Bellinger","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-light-the-remixes-ep/1620235077","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"New Light: The Remixes -

Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1590849650","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Let’s Eat Grandma’s Jenny Hollingworth and Rosa Walton were making their third album, <i>Two Ribbons</i>, someone from their record label told them, “You know you don’t have to put yourselves through this, don’t you?” The album is a visceral exploration of the love, loss, grief, and devastation they’ve experienced in recent years. And for the electronic-pop duo from Norwich, England, best friends since childhood, this was the only way through. “I was like, ‘We’re going through it anyway,’” Hollingworth tells Apple Music. “It was hard making the record, but that’s because it was a hard time in general. Even though it was extremely challenging, it gives you a place to put the amount of emotion you have. It was a way of trying to forge meaning out of stuff, especially when it all feels a bit meaningless.”\n \nHere, their intricately woven synth-pop brings out a lightness in the darkest of subjects. This is an album about the duo’s personal ordeals, as Hollingworth tries to make sense of the tragic passing of her boyfriend, the singer Billy Clayton, who died at just 22 from a rare form of bone cancer, with both reflecting on cracks in their friendship. “It was the first time that we’ve written that honestly about our lives, and that felt really important,” says Walton. “It’s just very down the line and quite brutally honest. That was important for both of us.” All of which has resulted in a profound and poignant artistic statement—and an album that sees Walton and Hollingworth’s songcraft reaching new peaks. Here, they talk us through <i>Two Ribbons</i>, track by track.\n \n<b>“Happy New Year”</b>\nRosa Walton: “I actually started writing this with the intention of it being for the Cyberpunk 2077 game but, in the end, the brief for that was so specific, and I wrote a different track instead. I had the main hook chords for this and then I just sung the words ‘best friend’ and I was like, ‘Oh, wait, I know what this should be about.’ I had loads of things that felt really pressing to write about mine and Jenny’s relationship and looking back on that in a nostalgic way and also looking forward to a new chapter. It made sense to use the metaphor of New Year because it’s often a time when you do that.”\n \n<b>“Levitation”</b>\nRW: “This was written about the surreal mental state of feeling detached from reality, in a way that you almost feel high, and there’s positives about it, but then also it can be really scary and alienating. I wanted to write about two sides of that. It’s one that we both sing, and Jenny brought lyrics to it later in the process.”\n \n<b>“Watching You Go”</b>\nJenny Hollingworth: “I wanted to make something that reflected the pent-up emotion of grief and the kind of tension that you feel when you’re in a lot of confusion and distress. The way that the song’s built, there aren’t really clear chords through most of it; it’s very bass-led and kind of churning and then, at the end, there’s this big guitar release. It represents, to me, just how difficult I found it at the time to express myself. There’s a lot of nature imagery on the record because a lot of the record was written spending a huge amount of time outside. This one looks at the images of beauty but also the horror of nature at the same time.”\n \n<b>“Hall of Mirrors”</b>\nRW: “This was very production-led in that the shiny, bright metallic sounds came before any of the lyrics or the story. They almost informed the lyrics, in a way. The idea of writing about the hall of mirrors came from the image of the shiny, delayed synth sounds that were like reflections in a mirror, and then from there I realized that I wanted to write a song about my sexuality, which I hadn’t written about before. That was something that I felt like, at that point, I was ready to talk about in a song and the many different emotions in relation to that. I knew that I wanted it to be an uplifting and positive song, but then, in the same way, there’s a lot of secrecy and guilt mixed in there as well. I knew that I wanted to keep it a dance-pop song at the core.”\n \n<b>“Insect Loop”</b>\nRW: “This one is very painful and a raw, emotional song. I see it in sections, and all of the sections represent different facets of how you feel about a person. There’s anger, there’s guilt, there’s tenderness in the middle section, and then a release at the end, and we used the production to build that. The end section I imagine as being set on a beach: The big, reverb-y, distorted guitars are like the crashing waves. Both of us are really influenced by our environment and influenced by the Norfolk coastline and the Norfolk countryside.”\n \n<b>“Half Light”</b>\nRW: “This was written as a segue between ‘Insect Loop’ and ‘Sunday’ because they’re both very heavy, emotionally intense songs, and we felt like we needed to put in a breather there.”\n \n<b>“Sunday”</b>\nRW: “I started writing this one at the beginning of lockdown. I was about to break up with my boyfriend at the time and it was written ahead of that, as a kind of way to prepare myself for the break-up. I really wanted to write something very warm-sounding, which is interesting with it being about a break-up. The warmness was like a longing for how I wanted to feel and how I once felt in the relationship. I think there’s something extra sad about that. A lot of the sounds are very delicate and fragile, and also just really pretty. Again, there’s something really sad about using those sounds in a way which is about something which is ending.”\n \n<b>“In the Cemetery”</b>\nRW: “This was a track that Jenny had started, and then I wrote a bit of instrumental around it and then put in some shitty recordings of birds off the internet, and then Jenny went to the cemetery and recorded actual birds. Again, we just felt like we needed to have something in there that just created a bit of space and a break from the high volumes of lyrics.”\n \n<b>“Strange Conversations”</b>\nJH: “It’s complicated to talk about this because I feel like a lot of the lyrics are mysterious, even to me. I think when Billy passed away, it made me think a lot about spirituality, not in the literal sense of religion, but just in terms of meaning and what happens when we die, and you are quite confronted with that aspect of life in a way that you’re not previously. It not only represents a conversation with either some sort of higher power or a god, but also the questions that you have for the person that you love who’s passed away, and the way that your relationship continues even when they’ve passed away. I guess the strangeness of it is the fact that it’s obviously one-sided and that you can’t actually get the answers that you’re looking for.”\n \n<b>“Two Ribbons”</b>\nJH: “It wasn’t immediately obvious to me as a closer, but it made sense as the record came together because it just felt like it had a mood that was difficult to bounce back from. It also ended up creating a kind of circular, because ‘Happy New Year’ is almost like a response to ‘Two Ribbons.’ Ending on ‘Two Ribbons’ and then starting again with ‘Happy New Year,’ it’s almost like you hear the songs differently the second time you listen on loop because of the context of this song.”","short":"“It’s just very down the line and quite brutally honest.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4pFPIHBK3YjY7mcFt0seqi"}},{"id":"1615449450","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615449450?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/d6/04/cb/d604cbd1-79f5-0f29-6cfd-0de495668aeb/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"2f2f2f","textColor4":"585858","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bryan Martin","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/self-inflicted-scars/1615449450","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Self Inflicted Scars","recordLabel":"Average Joes Entertainment","upc":"661869003832","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Average Joes Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1615449450","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58ViqrwmHv3WGBhgOnXTbZ"}},{"id":"594180316","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/594180316?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features125/v4/fa/f7/54/faf7540e-3346-b548-55d8-8617ce707554/dj.hbpmuqwc.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"8f8eaa","textColor2":"dd91b0","textColor4":"b2758d","textColor1":"b1b1d4","bgColor":"070302","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Arthur Rubinstein","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chopin-nocturnes/594180316","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"1967","name":"Chopin: Nocturnes","recordLabel":"Sony Classical","upc":"886443706675","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 1967 Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"594180316","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Chopin’s nocturnes could well have been written for the voice, their beautiful, lyrical melodies unfolding with a magic that few composers for piano can match. Arthur Rubinstein understood their childlike wonder, his playing refreshingly, charmingly simple. The bell-like tone of his right hand soars artlessly over subtle accompaniment, and everything is delicately pedalled, tempos just so. Bask in <i>Op. 15 No. 3</i> or <i>Op. 27 No. 1</i> to hear the mastery of Rubinstein’s control: fortes never growl, pianissimos are exquisite.

Now she’s developed a new language for relationships, and blows it up to enormous size with orchestral instrumentation: horns and Una Corda (“easy”), pedal steel (“born again runner”) and tenor saxophone (“collect caller”). The record is her exploring “just how to be in the world,” she says. “I just turned 27 and <i>At Weddings</i> was when I was 21. This is a different chapter of life, with new circumstances and things to investigate.” Below, Tomberlin walks through her album, track by track.\n\n<b>“easy”</b>\n“I wrote this song on acoustic guitar, and it was very simplistic. I wanted it to have a little bit more of a being-at-sea feeling, of rocking out in the ocean, rudderless. I remember telling Philip [Weinrobe], who co-produced with me, that I didn't want it to be a guitar song. We had already been using the Una Corda, this certain kind of piano, on the record. I loved how it sounded—eerie, but really beautiful as well. We combined those two elements and we kind of built it out from there. We turned all the lights off and had candles lit. It was very witchy. We were all in a circle, in this room, with the mics in front of us—really listening, not being too loud so the instruments didn't bleed into each other.”\n\n<b>“born again runner”</b>\n“The title is attributed to an Emmylou Harris song, 'Born to Run,' which my dad always says reminds him of me. It's a song for him. It's a song about loving my dad and wanting to have a relationship with him, even though we're very different people.”\n\n<b>“tap”</b>\n“I moved to New York in September 2020. I assimilated by going on really long walks through the city, across the Williamsburg Bridge and into Brooklyn, on the West Side Highway, by the water. I was missing being in the country and the woods. I was trying to find ways to connect myself. The first line I had for the song was ‘I'm not a tree/I'm in a forest of buildings.' It's about things that disconnect us. I was thinking of how narrative singers can struggle with wanting to put ourselves in a good light. No one is a perfect person. We also pulled a bunch of twigs and grass and flowers from the garden and were hitting the drums with them, so it has this extra brushy, freaky, witchy thing going on.”\n\n<b>“memory”</b>\n“I actually did a session with Danny Harle—he co-produced Caroline Polachek's record [<i>Pang</i>]. He wanted to meet when I lived in LA, so we rented a studio space and he was like, 'It's no pressure. Let's just hang out and see if something happens.' We spent maybe three hours working on music, and it was just us meeting really for the first time. I really liked the lyrics that I came up with, and that's how I wrote that song, which was wild to me. I was really stressed out about writing something with someone in the room. It's like writing a paper when the deadline is the next day and somehow you write something good.”\n\n<b>“unsaid”</b>\n“It was February [2020], before everything went to shit. I wrote it about LA and trying to figure out how to be planted there, because it's not really a city. In my opinion, it's just this sprawl. It was really hard for me to know how to feel grounded there. It's beautiful and fake. Making that song was like trying to comfort myself.”\n\n<b>“sunstruck”</b>\n“This one is definitely about examining a relationship with a person that was sputtering on again, off again. A lot of time had passed, we were still friends, and I got some recent news about some changes in their life, and a desire to work on themselves. It was a magic thing to hear, and that song fell out afterwards. I felt released from that relationship. And often, growth comes from being uncomfortable, some drought and some storms. It is a bit mournful of examination, but it ends in a hopeful way.“\n\n<b>“collect caller”</b>\n“Stuart [Bogie], who is in fact a legend of New York, plays saxophone on this song, and wow. He came in for a couple songs. I kept saying, 'I’ve collected all the deep-feeling musicians for this record,' because some people can play an instrument well, but some people, they're so mathematical about playing. We somehow collected the people that just deeply feel the music, and Stuart is one of those people. I love him.”\n\n<b>“stoned”</b>\n“‘Stoned’ I wrote when I was feeling a bit exasperated—anger but trying to have compassion. I think the anger that I was feeling was just and right, but I didn’t want to become hardened by it. I wasn't a big partier growing up; no one's asking the pastor's kid to go rage. But I was a young adult at this time, and living in Louisville, and someone invited me to a party. It was like, oh, this is in my John Hughes movie, everyone is jumping in the pool, taking their clothes off. I was walking away from it barefoot, drenched wet, holding my shoes, the sun was coming up, it was probably 5 am. When I started writing this song, I was thinking about that moment a lot, of experiencing this fun thing, but actually being in my head. Walking away from it alone and feeling very alone.”\n\n<b>“happy accident”</b>\n“[Cass McCombs] invited me to come jam one day. I played him some new stuff and he actually hit up Saddle Creek being like, 'Hey, does Tomberlin need someone to produce? I'm interested in working with her,' which blew my mind. He's a legend to me. I knew that I wanted to recruit Cass for this song, and he played on 'stoned' as well. On 'stoned,' I'm playing the lead rhythm guitar and he's doing all the solo-y stuff.”\n\n<b>“possessed”</b>\n“I think it's cool to have a really short song. I need to get better at that. It's really a private song, almost trying to motivate myself. Writer’s block vibes. I thought it would be a fun intro to the record for a while. It's really cinematic to draw it back a bit. Each song is its own world, and I love that about different records, and I wanted it to be this way. But there is a sonic thread that sews it together throughout.”\n\n<b>“idkwnthat”</b>\n“I was walking around in Brooklyn and going through my voice memos and clicked ‘new recording 430’ or whatever. I don't label them. I'm sitting by the window playing guitar; I sound really tired. I'm singing that song to myself. Even though I'm saying, 'I don't know who needs to hear this,' obviously I did. That was the first song that we recorded in the process of the record. Everyone says it's a weird time. I feel like it's always a fucking weird time to be alive as a person in the world, but especially right now, I guess. This record does go through a flurry of different feelings and emotions. It's good to feel all of them. So it felt like a perfect way to end the record.”","short":"“This is a different chapter of life with new circumstances to investigate.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5orWhhMYUzPXsKx4pDZWak"}},{"id":"1617825787","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617825787?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/14/9d/0c/149d0c95-2e10-9a47-3754-f9eae6cf1b27/5060944576226.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbb302","textColor2":"f1d800","textColor4":"c2af02","textColor1":"fcdd00","bgColor":"080c0d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Josh Caffe, Steffi & Virginia","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/do-you-want-to-take-me-home-single/1617825787","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Do You Want to Take Me Home - Single","recordLabel":"Phantasy Sound","upc":"5060944576226","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Phantasy Sound","playParams":{"id":"1617825787","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1610040670","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1610040670?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f9/41/a2/f941a25d-2012-1dd8-fcc5-3563b8319912/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"31311d","textColor2":"0b1e0d","textColor4":"34341d","textColor1":"071a0d","bgColor":"db8f5e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wipe the Needle","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-my-world-ya-heard-single/1610040670","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Breakbeat","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"It's My World Ya Heard - Single","recordLabel":"Local Talk","upc":"5054286429999","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Local Talk","playParams":{"id":"1610040670","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1615510860","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615510860?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/fb/c3/1b/fbc31b50-929f-ec50-d496-3f29c621d35c/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"b2b2b2","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a3a3a3","textColor1":"dbdbdb","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Alix Perez, Hijinx, Ebb & Epoch","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/codex-1-ep/1615510860","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-29","name":"Codex / 1 - EP","recordLabel":"1985 Music","upc":"5054286558613","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 1985 Music","playParams":{"id":"1615510860","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
