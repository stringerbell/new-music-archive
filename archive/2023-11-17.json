Parton","editorialNotes":{"standard":"When the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame extended an invitation to Dolly Parton in early 2022, the preternaturally unshy megastar demurred. While Parton knows she’s forever changed the country music genre with her historic career, she admitted that she didn’t feel it was appropriate for her to accept one of the biggest honors in rock music, as she’d never made rock music of her own. With a little convincing, Parton eventually accepted the honor—but she wanted to put out an actual rock ’n’ roll album to prove her bona fides and make her enshrinement feel more legit. With <i>Rockstar</i> she does just that, enlisting the help of some of the genre’s biggest artists for creative reimaginings of classics. Guests include Elton John, Ann Wilson, Stevie Nicks, Lizzo, Paul McCartney, and many more—proof that Parton’s Rolodex alone justified her Hall induction.\n\nJohn, a true rock star if there ever was one, tells Apple Music he had a remarkable time joining Parton on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” an updated version of the song John originally made famous on his 1974 album <i>Caribou</i> and which later grew more popular as a duet with the late George Michael. “She's always led by example,” John tells Apple Music of Parton. “I duet with her, and it's the first time I've really ever sang with her. It was just the most incredible experience. So I think she's quite a remarkable woman. She's in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, thank god.”\n\nParton tackles a number of eras and styles of rock music—and hosts a number of legendary guests—across <i>Rockstar</i>’s ambitious 30 tracks. Among the other luminaries are none other than Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr (“Let It Be”), Stevie Nicks (“What Has Rock and Roll Ever Done for You,” a previously unreleased cut from Nicks’ 1985 solo album <i>Rock a Little</i>), Heart’s Ann Wilson (“Magic Man”), and former Journey singer Steve Perry (“Open Arms”). Miley Cyrus and Chris Stapleton are also on hand to represent the current class of stars with Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” and a version of Bob Seger’s “Night Moves,” respectively.\n\nThough the Rock Hall induction is certainly a prominent new feather in Parton’s cap, she tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen that she hopes her legacy extends beyond her musical accomplishments to include the philanthropic efforts she’s spent so much of her life pursuing. “I do hope, more than anything, that I've been an inspiration, that I can be an inspiration for all the days that I'm living and even long after I'm gone, that I can leave something behind, maybe something I've said or something I've done that might make some difference, maybe sometimes big difference,” she says. “And just to say, ‘Well, if she did it, I can do it. She was just a poor girl from the mountains.’” ","short":"The legend turns an honor into a dare and puts her stamp on 30 rock classics.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f2/7f/88/f27f8829-d28d-a828-379f-72b013050c94/23BMR0004168.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfbfa2","textColor2":"fed29f","textColor4":"cfac86","textColor1":"fdeac2","bgColor":"141422","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rockstar/1685950271","playParams":{"id":"1685950271","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2thjKwqPvHo5SWzSzudVB2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1685950271/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"535066","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/535066?l=en-US"}]}}},"1697032078":{"id":"1697032078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1697032078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/b2/1d/20/b21d20d4-349b-ccad-c838-f7275a2372d7/8abf518b-f53c-455b-8ad9-175140d0aaa2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcaba6","textColor2":"d5c4c2","textColor4":"b2a2a1","textColor1":"e1cfc9","bgColor":"271c1d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deafheaven/425470694","name":"Sunbather (10th Anniversary Remix / Remaster)","artistName":"Deafheaven","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/63/74/eb/6374eb15-1496-4ac5-2b4d-c13d8a601927/791689665856.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"422a2b","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"422a2b","textColor1":"161616","bgColor":"f37b7b","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1697032078","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sunbather-10th-anniversary-remix-remaster/1697032078","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6b6xeKwRSRTobIXUpT3egL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1697032078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"425470694","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/425470694?l=en-US"}]}}},"1701013740":{"id":"1701013740","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1701013740?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-manny/41369341","name":"Hypnotized","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"DJ Manny","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/18/42/b5/1842b5d1-d117-f6c1-cafb-d8f07b1e5e31/98840.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"25321f","textColor2":"131616","textColor4":"263331","textColor1":"131500","bgColor":"70a89d","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1701013740","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hypnotized/1701013740","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3xgAui5mv22Q6WYttpkDAX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1701013740/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"41369341","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/41369341?l=en-US"}]}}},"1701040018":{"id":"1701040018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1701040018?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/36/cd/a6/36cda68c-9bc4-2f45-90a3-8dae79108002/0e44b7eb-e5ed-4338-bb09-b5b30c824875.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2b0af","textColor2":"d8afa2","textColor4":"b39085","textColor1":"d7d7d7","bgColor":"1f1612","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bertrand-chamayou/194652702","name":"Letter(s) to Erik Satie","artistName":"Bertrand Chamayou","editorialNotes":{"standard":"French pianist Bertrand Chamayou imaginatively couples Erik Satie, creator of quirky yet somehow timelessly beautiful piano pieces, with another individualist whom he argues was deeply inspired by the French composer—John Cage. The result is a surprisingly compelling and seductive listen.\n\nChamayou opens with <i>All Sides of the Small Stone</i>, a charming Satie-inspired piece Cage is thought to have mischievously slipped into the score of one of his modernist pupils. None of the other Cage works come quite so close to Satie’s style, yet they share a contemplative character and often a beguiling and non-mainstream modality.\n\nSpread through the program are all Satie’s <i>Gymnopédies</i> and <i>Gnossiennes</i>, plus some of his lesser-known and harmonically audacious works. Chamayou’s performances, though apparently straightforward, include subtle touches, and their rapt engagement draws the listener in.","short":"A beguiling, imaginative recital of piano music by Erik

Symphonic Poems - Le Carnaval des animaux - L'Assassinat du duc de Guise","artistName":"Les Siècles & François-Xavier Roth","editorialNotes":{"standard":"When deep musicality and cultural awareness are coupled to period-instrument performance, the results are usually magical. That’s certainly the case here. Three of Saint-Saëns’s most famous scores—<i>The Carnival of the Animals</i>, the “Bacchanale” from <i>Samson and Delila</i>, and <i>Danse macabre</i>— are brought together with a selection of orchestral tone poems, and the composer’s score for the 1908 film <i>L’Assassinat du Duc de Guise</i>, one of the first to be written for cinema. \n\nLes Siècles and conductor François Xavier-Roth have stripped back these scores, each sounding as if a layer of grimy varnish has been removed. <i>Danse macabre</i>, often the victim of orchestral overload, proves enticingly fresh, the litheness of the orchestral sound revealing the composer’s orchestrations in scintillating detail. \n\n<i>Carnival</i> possesses all the charming wit you might expect from an animal-themed work written for close friends. The mythologically themed tone poems that open the album are beautifully rendered, technically accomplished with a restrained richness. Kudos to the recording engineers.","short":"A rich collection of Saint-Saëns’s finest works, in riveting performances.","tagline":"New

partnership between the pair of rap veterans predates even the name “2 Chainz.” In 2007, when the Georgia native still rapped as Tity Boi, his duo Playaz Circle released their debut single “Duffle Bag Boy”—a great song made even better by a guest verse from Wayne in his prime. Since then, the rappers’ paths have remained entwined: the 2010s are littered with joint tracks from the two, including <i>ColleGrove</i>, the 2016 collaborative album that mashed together their hometowns. (That’s College Park, Georgia, for 2 Chainz and Hollygrove, Louisiana, for Wayne.)\n\nSeven years later, the forty-something rappers still sound inspired by one another, trading scene-stealing moments for 21 tracks. (It isn’t a contest, but let’s say it is: 2 Chainz excels on minimalist productions like Bangladesh’s “Presha,” whereas Wayne dominates “Shame” in spite of Chainz’ pitch-perfect Ol’ Dirty Bastard impression.) The project is also loaded with more Easter eggs than a Marvel movie; the pair’s verses are riddled with nods to Southern rap greats: Wayne shouts out Fabo on “Long Story Short,” a track that samples Project Pat and channels UGK’s “International Players Anthem (I Choose You).” And on “Big Diamonds,” they take it back to 2000 with a classic Mannie Fresh beat, over which Wayne proclaims: “Me and 2 Chainz, bitch, we’re the new Big Tymers.”","short":"On their second joint LP, Wayne and 2 Chainz trade scene-stealing moments.","tagline":"New Album"},"playParams":{"id":"1712747991","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-2-collegrove/1712747991","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2LdlfTE6xqf2Ez8LPAFZSy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712747991/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"435300447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/435300447?l=en-US"},{"id":"5869117","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5869117?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713163429":{"id":"1713163429","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713163429?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/russell-e-l-butler/1091421123","name":"Call Me G","artistName":"Russell E.L.

scarcely any notice to his legions of fans, Ozuna announced <i>Cosmo</i> just days before its arrival. Rest assured, nothing about the Puerto Rican superstar’s sixth solo album feels rushed or hasty; instead it’s an exemplar of his holistically melodic approach. In contrast with the Afrobeats escapades of the preceding <i>Afro</i> EP, this 15-song set focuses primarily on reggaetón while making space for other adjacent dance-floor-friendly sounds. His <i>Los Dioses</i> cohort Anuel AA returns for the tropically tinged “Pa Ti Estoy,” while the Sky Rompiendo-produced “El Plan” adds Plan B veteran Chencho Corleone to the progressive mix. Even without guests, his silken voice elevates the synth-laden thump of “Baccarat” as well as the comparatively airier “Clase Azul” and “Mar De Lágrimas.”","short":"The ever-melodic reggaetón superstar shows us how it’s done.","tagline":"New Album"},"playParams":{"id":"1714463544","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cosmo/1714463544","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3nEa7WJXcruywRIZXu6qRE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714463544/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"283578837","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/283578837?l=en-US"}]}}},"1714499192":{"id":"1714499192","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714499192?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mo-troper/1098462777","name":"Troper Sings Brion","artistName":"Mo Troper","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/03/d0/93/03d09358-9c3a-9152-1021-e46d6f70713d/42923.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f3506","textColor2":"2e2f03","textColor4":"4b4e04","textColor1":"0b0f06","bgColor":"bdca08","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1714499192","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/troper-sings-brion/1714499192","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2lrSEcA58YYEdawwkvWoii"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714499192/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1098462777","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1098462777?l=en-US"}]}}},"1714727603":{"id":"1714727603","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714727603?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/2c/4e/9a/2c4e9a2d-ccd5-7feb-e830-1234341a9c7b/2ae6b87a-54e0-42c6-a457-3006421a790f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c79e5f","textColor2":"e0b569","textColor4":"b69457","textColor1":"f5c172","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/7e/77/f0/7e77f0e8-b2ee-1a84-bfbd-d35fbc36bfdd/e6e93043-cb34-4ce3-a4aa-708016326085.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b6965b","textColor2":"d6a560","textColor4":"ae8850","textColor1":"e0b76e","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=979458609-1567468305-994351172","name":"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (Music From & Inspired By)","artistName":"Olivia Rodrigo, Rachel Zegler & Flatland Cavalry","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/17/5c/8e/175c8ec4-a8fd-6a14-5a1e-ea5917a1e687/23UM1IM46888.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bc8637","textColor2":"dd8333","textColor4":"b36829","textColor1":"e8a745","bgColor":"0c0000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-snakes/1714727603","playParams":{"id":"1714727603","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/07J7Q3Z7V00LvCxqzVqj9s"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714727603/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"979458609","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/979458609?l=en-US"},{"id":"1567468305","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1567468305?l=en-US"},{"id":"994351172","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/994351172?l=en-US"}]}}},"1714745125":{"id":"1714745125","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714745125?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/bb/fb/bc/bbfbbc5c-6630-3f39-a9de-1845858007fa/564cc16f-0bf2-4959-a836-bf198195499e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"d8d8d8","textColor4":"b0b0b0","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/majid-jordan/684530590","name":"Good People / Afterhours","artistName":"Majid Jordan","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Majid Jordan’s fourth album arrives 10 years after the Toronto duo instigated Drake’s smooth lover-boy makeover on “Hold On We’re Going Home.” Since that breakthrough moment, they’ve never wavered from their mission to fuse neon-tinted ’80s-style productions and after-hours R&B into pristine pop songs. The very title of <i>Good People</i> reinforces that consistency of vision—it’s the original alias that singer Majid Al Maskati and producer Jordan Ullman used when recording the debut EP, 2012’s <i>Afterhours</i>, that got them signed to Drizzy’s OVO imprint. The album comes front-loaded with the sort of songs that feel uncannily familiar on first listen: “Waiting For You” is a stunning sophisti-soul collaboration with fellow OVO associate Naomi Sharon that you’d swear was a vintage Sade deep cut, while “Eyes Closed” plays like a Michael Jackson ballad retrofitted for a post-chillwave age.\n\nBut the deeper you go into the record, the further afield it ventures, as the duo explores the outer limits of their sound without ever losing sight of its melodic core. “Hands Tied” rides a restless drum-machine beat that’s practically post-punky in its chilly austerity, with Al Maskati’s unadorned vocals evoking the grayscale romantic reveries of The xx, before the duo gradually turn up the heat to melt away the icy surface. And at seven minutes in length, “Violet” counts as the longest song in the Majid Jordan discography to date, a dreamily hypnotic R&B odyssey that eventually submerges itself in an oceanic abyss. But in the wake of these bold moves, <i>Good People</i> peaks with a pair of beautifully understated guitar-based devotionals—“The Message” and “Cyanide”—that peel back the production layers while upping the emotional ante, reaffirming Majid Jordan’s commitment to straight-from-the-heart songcraft, no matter what form it takes.","short":"The OVO R&B emissaries push their sound to the outer limits.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c2/df/7c/c2df7c50-3de2-829c-4445-2322bc11ee4e/34373.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"272726","textColor2":"0f0f0e","textColor4":"2e2d2c","textColor1":"070805","bgColor":"a7a7a7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-people-afterhours/1714745125","playParams":{"id":"1714745125","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4uvjayEmk2gpZmel3vSCj4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714745125/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"684530590","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/684530590?l=en-US"}]}}},"1714931027":{"id":"1714931027","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714931027?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/6b/f6/48/6bf6485a-5823-a18b-f9ba-c5c23f00c30b/bbb8fc49-5aed-4cb5-8d23-ab4307f8c468.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bac5c7","textColor2":"aec2cb","textColor4":"8b9ba2","textColor1":"e9f6f9","bgColor":"000001","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wyatt-flores/1563146833","name":"Life Lessons","artistName":"Wyatt Flores","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4200,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/da/99/e4/da99e4fa-f271-4e79-1b4b-2b38ca3e26a6/23UM1IM35076.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4200,"textColor3":"a6a2a0","textColor2":"d6a92f","textColor4":"b08d2d","textColor1":"cac4c0","bgColor":"151c22","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-lessons/1714931027","playParams":{"id":"1714931027","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5e2QKeZUgdvmnXFxzRUGNO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714931027/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1563146833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1563146833?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715042762":{"id":"1715042762","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715042762?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"releaseDate":"2023-11-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/james-blake/59504818","name":"Playing Robots Into Heaven (Endel Chillout Soundscape)","artistName":"James Blake","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/8e/5f/72/8e5f72c1-50d3-a44f-d95d-ad56dac38d76/23UM1IM35266.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"1b2323","textColor2":"181f1f","textColor4":"2f3c3c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"8bb1b2","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1715042762","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/playing-robots-into-heaven-endel-chillout-soundscape/1715042762","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1aNEVZZJsa4nFR9D3N6WXm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715042762/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"59504818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/59504818?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715066158":{"id":"1715066158","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715066158?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/56/4d/45/564d45b8-d13a-496d-63b9-0e9a64527e65/b6a48ce7-5781-4003-b144-c52b674daa45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e5c0ba","textColor2":"faa761","textColor4":"e98c50","textColor1":"f5e8e6","bgColor":"a41f0b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/qing-madi/1649561181","name":"Qing Madi","artistName":"Qing Madi","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Qing Madi was just 16 years old when she released her first single, “See Finish,” a wistful R&B track about searching for meaning in betrayal, which instantly became a breakthrough hit on TikTok. Her self-titled debut EP arrives following a year of steady viral success for the Nigerian singer-songwriter, building on the popularity of “See Finish” with subsequent releases “Why” and “Ole”—all of which feature here—and positioning herself as the only one to watch in 2023. <i>Qing Madi</i> draws a circle around her intentions with a bold flourish. The mellow, Afropop wash of “Madi’s Medley” opens the project with the line “so I’m finally finally finally at the point that nobody can lower,”and, indeed, the EP’s solid combination of world-class production and sophisticated songwriting proves to be unshakable. Expanding on her already proven formula of blithe midtempo beats and raw lyricism delivered in clear, sweet tones, Madi opens up on everything from yearning for someone who is already in a relationship to the disorientating feeling of unexpectedly falling in love. The standout cut? “Chargie,” an irresistibly smooth groove, augmented throughout with a slick horn riff, that burrows into your brain and stays there long after you last heard it.","short":"Qing Madi stakes a claim to the Afropop throne on her undeniable debut EP.","tagline":"New EP"},"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/2c/d2/7b/2cd27b39-4ba6-ef9b-d5f6-0ae5a3db89eb/196871574891.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"0d273b","textColor2":"08175c","textColor4":"0f3578","textColor1":"05060f","bgColor":"2eadeb","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/qing-madi/1715066158","playParams":{"id":"1715066158","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1ob2YtI9F9r54JXKXt7lhX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715066158/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1649561181","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1649561181?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715073824":{"id":"1715073824","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715073824?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/danny-daze/338155616","name":"::BLUE:: (Continuous Mix)","artistName":"Danny Daze","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/63/c6/f8/63c6f84f-d197-5b75-f99a-8bb7f3b3e0af/840200584050_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f3187","textColor2":"0c0e70","textColor4":"383a89","textColor1":"00026e","bgColor":"ebebeb","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1715073824","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-continuous-mix/1715073824","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5VaqHr3g5fc037G6iiUBNo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715073824/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"338155616","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/338155616?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715272856":{"id":"1715272856","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715272856?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2023-11-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mannywellz/899607814","name":"Mr Oúlala -

The idea of such a thing has haunted hip-hop fandom’s collective consciousness for nearly two decades: a full-length solo effort from Outkast’s Gemini counterpart, not counting his half of <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>. In the Outkast years, André was known as the far-out yin to Big Boi’s earthier yang, and while the latter pursued a solo career following the duo’s 2006 hiatus, Three Stacks forged a less orthodox path. He designed clothes, produced a cartoon series, and took on a handful of acting roles, popping up every so often to rap a guest verse for Frank Ocean or Beyoncé. Meanwhile, he walked around playing the flute—a habit that, when caught on camera, was something of a meme, but had privately become a passion.\n\nThe title of the first track on <i>New Blue Sun</i>, whose 87 minutes of cosmic flute experimentation are entirely wordless, is at once a caveat and a mission statement: “I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a 'Rap' Album But This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time.” In a poetic sense, it’s also a truth: The instruments he and his collaborators play here (contrabass flutes, Mayan flutes, bamboo flutes) are powered by wind, or, rather, breath. And it’s reflective of the kismet which guided the album into existence: He hadn’t intended to release his flute music until a chance Erewhon run-in with Carlos Niño, the Los Angeles percussionist and producer of spiritually oriented jazz. Basement jam sessions with Niño became the series of improvised compositions that make up the eight tracks of <i>New Blue Sun</i>, along with a community of like-minded players, including guitarist Nate Mercereau and keyboardist Surya Botofasina.\n\nFrom the players’ deepening chemistry, transcendent songs materialized—not unlike the bonds that once inspired the Dungeon Family from which Outkast emerged in early-’90s Atlanta. And though its meandering and meditative (though often hysterically titled) compositions exist in the tradition of Alice Coltrane, Laraaji, and Yusef Lateef more than anything conceivably hip-hop-adjacent, they’re animated by a similar spirit to that which made Outkast’s music stand apart: a dauntless dedication to one’s own vision, alongside a belief in the power of creative communion. In that sense, it’s the André 3000 album we’d been waiting for all along.","short":"Three Stacks’ long-awaited solo debut is...maybe not what you were expecting.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/a1/b7/46/a1b74612-fd80-1849-2d67-37656fc303a3/196589963802.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dfc59c","textColor2":"f6dec8","textColor4":"dcbfaa","textColor1":"f9e7b7","bgColor":"784131","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-blue-sun/1716101993","playParams":{"id":"1716101993","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/33Ek6daAL3oXyQIV1uoItD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716101993/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3869739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3869739?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716425086":{"id":"1716425086","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716425086?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"releaseDate":"2023-08-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/d5/f1/06/d5f10646-d95f-c9e3-76b7-485c19958c27/d7710c5c-52f2-481f-a1c4-a55c64fa9220.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"282728","textColor2":"141312","textColor4":"282829","textColor1":"141211","bgColor":"777c84","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rene%C3%A9-rapp/1626560688","name":"Snow Angel (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Reneé Rapp","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/eb/cf/cf/ebcfcf4d-7410-511c-5713-778fd3c513ff/23UM1IM44274.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"baab8f","textColor2":"7eb9cf","textColor4":"6498a8","textColor1":"e8d1b0","bgColor":"00130c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"One of the toughest things to do as an artist is a feat of transfiguration whereby a songwriter changes the individual into the universal. It’s a rare accomplishment, and even rarer for an artist as young as Reneé Rapp to do it. “I write a lot from specificity,” she tells Apple Music. “So many of these songs have to come from real things that are happening in my life. Friendships end, relationships end. Sometimes you just have to sit with your feelings.” The 23-year old actor and musician blazed through Charlotte, North Carolina’s thriving theater scene before taking on the roles of Regina George in the <i>Mean Girls</i> musical, both on Broadway and in the upcoming movie adaptation, and Leighton on the HBO Max series <i>The Sex Lives of College Girls</i>. Through all that success, Rapp also somehow found the time to develop into a preternaturally talented songwriter. \n\nOn her full-length debut <i>Snow Angel</i>, she fuses the raw catharsis of Olivia Rodrigo with the scenic storytelling of Maggie Rogers, bouncing back and forth between stadium-ready hooks (“Talk Too Much,” “The Wedding Song”) and intimate, slinky crooning (“I Wish,” “Willow”). Rapp enlisted her longtime collaborator, the Grammy-nominated producer Alexander 23, to work on <i>Snow Angel</i>, and you can sense his guiding hand throughout the record, helping Rapp channel and focus her emotions—heartbreak, anxiety, venom, and hope in equal measures—into personal stories that also feel like they’re for everyone. Below, she tells the stories behind those stories on <i>Snow Angel</i>.\n\n<b>“Talk Too Much”</b>\n“I have a lot of stress dreams, and one night I had a dream that I killed my girlfriend. I was so stressed out and I was so confused. The relationship was very new, and I got really overwhelmed. I ended up confessing and asked her how she felt. They were like, ‘What is wrong with you?!’ Then I just decided to write ‘Talk Too Much’ because I don't think I should have told them that, but also I did tell you this. It’s about the spiraling of being in a new relationship and wondering if it's good or bad.”\n\n<b>“I Hate Boston”</b>\n“This song comes from two different places. It started because I was in a session with some of my friends and I was talking about this show I played in Boston. The fans were just so awesome and it was a great gig by all accounts, but I was sick and I felt like shit. I also wore these faux leather pants and big boots and a fuzzy sweater, and the venue was so hot and I was suffocating. It was awful. The other side was that I wanted to use Boston as an alias because the word sings beautifully. The lyrics are about a city that an ex tainted for me, and I wanted to make sure that it felt really close to the hyper-specific situations that I went through in this relationship. Boston was sort of a cover-up.”\n\n<b>“Poison Poison”</b>\n“This is probably the most sarcastic, cynical song that I have on this record. I had a friendship with another girl that ended really horribly. I think as a woman and as women, it sucks when we get in a fight with another woman. We don't want to be a girl that takes down another girl. I wanted to write a song about it because I cared about this person so much and we were such good friends and I felt really betrayed. I wanted to deal with my feelings in a way that was comedic and sarcastic and kind of coped with it in a different way than how I actually felt about it, which was extremely hurt and betrayed and really confused and very sad.”\n\n<b>“Gemini Moon”</b>\n“This song is so fucking funny because actually I'm a Pisces moon. But I wrote 'Gemini Moon' because I had a really tough breakup a couple years ago which started as us taking a break—this in-between thing where you're feeling two states at once. I walked outside after this happened and I looked up and, of course, it's a full fucking moon. That shit always happens to me on a full moon. I always have full moons on my birthdays, and it sucked. Then I wondered if the moon is in Gemini right now. And through tears, I looked it up, and sure enough, it was Gemini moon. Then I was in the studio one day and fresh into a new relationship and I was experiencing being in love with someone again after having that fallout. I hadn't felt that intensely for someone in a long time, and I was really scared. I was criticizing every little thing I did. So I was like, wow, I wonder if it's a Gemini moon right now. I looked it up and it was a Gemini moon, and I was like, are you fucking kidding? It was almost exactly two years apart.”\n\n<b>“Snow Angel”</b>\n“I went through a really shitty experience in early 2022. I was extremely sad, and I was involved with the wrong people. I had recounted the situation so many times to friends over and over again. It was something that I think I had just stored in a place that I was never really going to process it the way that other people did. Then one day I was sitting with Alexander and he was like, ‘We really should write that snow song.’ And everybody else on my team was like, ‘We're so happy. Oh my god, this is the code for this album, we've cracked it.’ In my brain I'm like, ‘Well, this was one of the worst experiences in my life, so glad that it could turn into something like this.’”\n\n<b>“So What Now”</b>\n“I was seeing this person and we had a really quick in-and-out kind of thing. It was just so intense and I was so mad. So after the situation had subsided, I was like, ‘Are you going to ever speak to me again? Am I supposed to speak to you?’ ‘So What Now’ is just the culmination of this overarching thought of ‘you're treating me like shit’ but also ‘I'm not mad at you, but what are we supposed to do?’”\n\n<b>“The Wedding Song”</b>\n“I was living in New Jersey for work for a few months when I wrote this. I was in a relationship at one point with someone who I thought I was going to marry, and that was the first time that had ever happened to me. And I thought that it would be so just gut-wrenching to be like, ‘I wrote you a wedding song because I thought I was going to be with you forever and I never played it for you, and now you're never going to hear it because we don't speak anymore.’ It's meant to be this really soul-sucking kind of song that's so happy and beautiful in the chorus, then it's just so sad in the verses because it's like, ‘Well, this is what I would've said had you stuck around, but you decided to not and that's just now something that I have to deal with.’”\n\n<b>“Pretty Girls”</b>\n“I think ‘Pretty Girls’ is the universal gay-girl experience, in my opinion. Ever since I became more publicly out, so many straight girls are like, ‘I couldn't be with a girl, but wow, if I did...’ So it's just the gay-girl experience of all these straight girls being like, ‘I am either a closeted gay in a way that I don't understand or I'm just kind of using you as a little prop.’ And that sucks any way you slice it. But in a really sick and twisted way, it’s kind of flattering. I love to be hit on. I'm so sorry, but I do.”\n\n<b>“Tummy Hurts”</b>\n“This was the last song we wrote that ended up making the album. It started because I wrote down in my notes one day the sentence ‘My tummy hurts, he's in love with her.’ It wasn't really about any specific situation, which is usually where I write from. I love this almost childlike way of saying I have a stomach ache and then this really adult feeling of someone is in love with somebody else. I liked how it felt and I liked how it was worded. And it all came from there.”\n\n<b>“I Wish”</b>\n“I wrote this when I was living in New Jersey. I was writing with some of my friends and they had come up with a different kind of concept for the chorus and some of the lyrics. They said, ‘Oh, this is like writing a song to your childhood self.’ But for me, it's reading in a different way. It was more about how I remember my first taste of mortality when I realized my parents were going to die when I was 10. I remember not being able to sleep for such a long time because I was like, holy shit, my parents are not invincible. I was just so shocked by it and I was so confused. I was young and it was really jarring and I struggled with it for a long time. I think I still do. And so I just wanted to make 'I Wish' this sort of love letter to the idea that I wish I didn't know about the concept of death.”\n\n<b>“Willow”</b>\n“‘Willow’ is two things. Frank Ocean is my favorite songwriter of all time. I didn't feel like I had any songs on my project that took any lyrical inspiration from him and his projects, and I really wanted there to be. I also loved willow trees as a kid. As I got older, I also thought there was something so interesting about it being called a weeping willow. I felt like I kind of had a lot of similar qualities to this tree, which sounds crazy, but I just always felt that way. I ended up framing it as my little self sitting under a willow tree talking to my current self. It was me personifying the tree as my younger self, which sounds kind of crazy, but it's one of my favorite songs on the whole album.”\n\n<b>“23”</b>\n“I think it’s the first song that Alexander and I did together. I was having full birthday panic the day before I turned 23. I was like, ‘Wow, it's my birthday, but I feel like all my friends hate me and I feel extremely alone.’ I thought that these feelings would be gone by now, but here I am, a young adult about to be in my Jordan year, and I still feel like shit. It’s a birthday blues kind of song. Then the outro is this hopeful message that I don't feel that same way when I'm 24 next year. So the kind of annual terror that comes around your birthday, it's like wishing that away.”","short":"“Sometimes you just have to sit with your feelings.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"playParams":{"id":"1716425086","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/snow-angel-deluxe/1716425086","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7pPV0OFuytqNj7ar82Hizf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716425086/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1626560688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1626560688?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716453445":{"id":"1716453445","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716453445?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/8c/44/16/8c44166f-d9bd-0570-7b6f-98c7bfac0a46/fdb5c1f2-b8cb-4110-b317-aeb4e75ae12f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"252223","textColor2":"230908","textColor4":"382324","textColor1":"0c0707","bgColor":"898e94","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arc%C3%A1ngel/28215216","name":"Sentimiento, Elegancia y Más Maldad","artistName":"Arcángel","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“It feels good to be at the position that I am,” Arcángel tells Apple Music, “because a lot of artists from my era are not around.” It speaks volumes that two decades into his music career, the Latin music star not only endured but is arguably more popular now than ever before. A pioneering and influential figure in Latin trap and reggaetón, his catalog remains among the most revered in the genre, something for which he expresses both gratitude and deserved bravado. “People have that respect for me because I've been a man of my word in the business, a real man with morals and principles in this industry,” he says. “For me, that's better than money.”\n\nThough the title <i>Sentimiento, Elegancia y Más Maldad</i> nods back to his beloved 2013 full-length, Arcángel insists this is not a sequel per se. Instead, he sees it more as a thematic extension of the original, maintaining his individual artistic authenticity while demonstrating his range across styles. That means listeners get the raw, streetwise raps his day-ones desire as well as the crowd-pleasing cuts that made him a ubiquitous presence in music, all in one package. “It don't matter how commercial it is,” he says. “You're always going to feel that essence of the real Arcángel.” Read on for more about some selected highlights from the album—in his own words.\n\n<b>“Me Gusta Tu Flow”</b>\n“I was actually the first artist to bring this sound to the reggaetón scene. Back in 2007. I did ‘Chica Virtual’ with DJ Nelson, one of the founding fathers of our music. He could back up the things that I'm saying right now because he was the producer of the track. I just started hunting that old Arcángel again, listening to my old music. We sat down with other composers and they showed me a lot of ideas. It's like they helped me wake up something that was asleep. It sounds weird, but I actually needed help finding the old Arcángel.”\n\n<b>“Plutón”</b>\n“The first demo, when I recorded the song, was always R&B. But that little bachata spice was hidden under the R&B beat. So, I started listening to the whole beat alone with no a cappellas or nothing. I'm not a bachata artist, [but] I could include a whole bachata in an urban album just to prove to my fans my versatility and all that. That’s good enough for me.”\n\n<b>“Rosita”</b>\n“I recorded that song in an R&B beat; the reggaetón came after. The same thing happened with ‘Plutón.’ My reggaetón, I record them on a rap beat—always. Then the producer comes in. When I rap on a rap beat, I have another speed. I’m a talented singer, but I’m in the street at the same time.”\n\n<b>“Los Roques” (feat. Quevedo)</b>\n“I'm a big fan of his music, but never met him until yesterday. When we recorded this song, I heard his voice on this track; this sounds like it was written for Quevedo. As a fan and as a producer, I just shot my shot in a DM. He hit me back within five minutes. I just sent him the track and in two weeks he sent me back everything. He loved the track, and I love his part, man. He killed it. I'm just supporting him in this track.”\n\n<b>“Arca 10Mil” (feat. Feid)</b>\n“He always showed me a lot of respect, and it's always great to work with people that respect your art. It was very easy, because I showed him the whole album, what I had at that moment. I showed him everything and he just chose the track. He said, 'I like this one.' It was like that, very fast.”","short":"The reggaetón star revisits a classic: “I started hunting that old Arcángel again.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b9/08/ab/b908ab97-c8d6-bf7c-837b-ae8556afda83/197190360073.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a7a7a7","textColor2":"b2c0ca","textColor4":"8f99a1","textColor1":"d2d2d2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sentimiento-elegancia-y-m%C3%A1s-maldad/1716453445","playParams":{"id":"1716453445","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21TAcmAXy0OY0U7B9LlwlY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716453445/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"28215216","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/28215216?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716621877":{"id":"1716621877","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716621877?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2023-11-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1436064480-123049323","name":"Lonely At The Top -

Starring and directed by Bradley Cooper, <i>Maestro</i> tells the story of a man who juggles his ambitions with personal struggles that tear apart his relationships. And with the help of the Philadephia Orchestra’s conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Cooper goes all out to portray Bernstein’s musical genius, both on and off stage. “For us classical musicians,” says Nézet-Séguin, “to have someone so important in our world represented with such care, beauty, emotion, and authenticity on the big screen by Hollywood is a gift.”\n\nWoven throughout <i>Maestro</i> is an impressive cross-section of Bernstein’s life in music, from his own works to the great symphonies for which he became renowned for conducting. There are little spoken vignettes from the film itself, too, adding something of a personal flavor. \n\nThe performances themselves incorporate instances of Bernstein’s own conducting, including part of his heartbreaking account with the Vienna Philharmonic of Mahler’s “Adagietto,” and an extract from his own Symphony No. 2, “Age of Anxiety,” with the New York Phil. Most of the movements and extracts, however, from <i>Mass</i> to <i>Trouble in Tahiti</i> and the “Prologue” to <i>West Side Story</i>, are presented in new performances by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Nézet-Séguin.\n\n“I discovered Bernstein’s recordings when I was a conducting student, and became fascinated by him,” Nézet-Séguin tells Apple Music Classical. “And I immediately felt very much under his inspiration and influence.” Soon after becoming music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2012, the Canadian conductor made it his mission to perform Bernstein’s theatrical oratorio, <i>Mass</i>. “As ever in my life and career, I start with the biggest thing when I want to know a composer,” he laughs. “It was maybe one of the biggest shocks of my life. It taught me so much about Bernstein, and I think I could identify with the blending of genres in this piece. From that moment I became completely obsessed with Bernstein and decided to go through all his symphonies: ‘Jeremiah’, ‘Kaddish,’ and ‘The Age of Anxiety.’”\n\nIn addition to his role as conductor, Nézet-Séguin acted as advisor to Bradley Cooper, helping him in his pursuit of musical authenticity. The soundtrack features two instances of Cooper conducting as Bernstein: part of the finale from Mahler’s Symphony No. 2, “Resurrection,” and, in a rehearsal scene, “Make Our Garden Grow” from <i>Candide</i>. “The important thing was to help Bradley and guide him to really understand what made Bernstein special on the podium as opposed to other conductors,” says Nézet-Séguin. “We were solely oriented towards having every gesture in the style of Bernstein.\n\n“There were countless videos of Bernstein that Bradley could observe and learn from,” he adds, “and I would do other videos with voiceover commentary on them, explaining the beats, explaining why he turns left or right here… and we would break it down together. Our sessions would be very much about discussing the gestures for any particular moment.”\n\nWith so much to pack in to such little time, did Cooper succeed in coaxing the grand, vibrant “Bernstein sound” from the LSO? The answer is not that simple. “It was not important to get a Yannick interpretation or a Bradley one,” explains Nézet-Séguin, “but Yannick and Bradley together getting a certain sound.” Cooper wore an earpiece while conducting, allowing Nézet-Séguin to speak to him and guide him in real time. “It’s hard to explain how collaborative this has been but, as you can imagine, it’s been a fascinating and very emotional journey for all of us.”\n\nNézet-Séguin is in no doubt of the impact that participating in <i>Maestro</i> has had on him. “It’s very hard to understand how only one person was capable of being at ease on Broadway, at ease in film music, at ease in religious music, in Hebrew, in English, in Latin, as a symphonic composer. But actually, this is all reflected in his life and in the fact that he was a true lover of many things, but also a true bisexual gay man having interest for men all his life, and feeling maybe forever dissatisfied by what life was for him.”\n\nBut for Nézet-Séguin, the film is much more than an ambitious biopic of a great man. It serves to show how classical music can, in the right circumstances, reach untapped audiences. “I do hope that through this film and this soundtrack that people are going to get more curious, not only about Bernstein, but about the whole of classical music.”","short":"“Maestro has been a fascinating and very emotional journey for all of us.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"playParams":{"id":"1716774772","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/maestro-music-by-leonard-bernstein-original-soundtrack/1716774772","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Eu9QPnzZEXpo0BzjWOLC4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716774772/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"29893","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29893?l=en-US"},{"id":"207589754","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/207589754?l=en-US"},{"id":"300300595","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/300300595?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716979097":{"id":"1716979097","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716979097?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"releaseDate":"2023-10-06","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/ac/67/93/ac679388-1f4a-1a9f-8023-261aa32d016e/c0db4d4b-8515-4b08-8a46-a93f144a9eda.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2825","textColor2":"15140e","textColor4":"31302a","textColor1":"130907","bgColor":"a1a39b","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/3a/09/53/3a0953d5-f582-5085-4560-307f8b6ddd6a/dfe9a113-d4d6-417e-958e-f899bf0da9a0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"302937","textColor2":"0d0a0d","textColor4":"312b39","textColor1":"0b080a","bgColor":"c4b0e9","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/drake/271256","name":"For All The Dogs Scary Hours Edition","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Drake","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/97/1a/a3/971aa332-2c7d-947c-33ed-4635d41115a4/23UM1IM56239.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"34356b","textColor2":"151c5e","textColor4":"39397b","textColor1":"10174a","bgColor":"c7aeef","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"<i>“These ideologies are haunting.”</i> —Drake\n\nIn the dog days of summer 2023, Drake did a very Drake thing: Just before embarking on tour, he revealed that he’d written a poetry book called <i>Titles Ruin Everything</i>. To spread the news, he took out ads in several major newspapers. On them was a QR code which led to another announcement: “I made an album to go with the book. They say they miss the old Drake girl don’t tempt me. FOR ALL THE DOGS.”\n\nThe “old Drake” line, as real heads know, is a reference to “Headlines,” a song from the early days of Champagne Papi’s rise from Canadian curiosity to global superstar. The old Drake was an underdog, a former child actor and Lil Wayne protégé who blended hip-hop and R&B in a way that would indelibly change both. And the new Drake? He’s a 36-year-old father of one who’s responsible for a not-small percentage of Toronto’s annual tourist economy and who, with the release of “Slime You Out,” is one No. 1 single away from tying Michael Jackson on the all-time list. (By the time his Scary Hours version dropped six weeks later, he’d tied it.)\n\nIf there’s anything Old Drake and New Drake can agree on, it’s hour-and-a-half-long blockbuster albums that master the fine art of score-settling. Drizzy’s gone through plenty of phases in his 15 years in the running as one of hip-hop’s GOATs: albums full of wintry grime and drill, or breezy dance albums for the baddies to turn up to on girls’ night. <i>For All the Dogs</i>, his eighth studio album, has more in common with 2011’s <i>Take Care</i>, the star-making opus loaded with luxuriant beats and big-name features. But instead of drunk-dialing his exes, Drake’s…well, he’s still doing that every now and again. Mostly, though, he’s with his dogs.\n\nThe album’s loose framework is a late-night local radio program: BARK Radio, live from Chapel Hill, whose hosts include Teezo Touchdown, Drake’s crush/idol Sade, and the occasional chorus of hounds. This particular broadcast is a sumptuous banquet of classically Drake techniques, starting with the smirking fake-out that is intro track “Virginia Beach.” (If you know, you know.) There’s the requisite Houston worship on “Screw the World,” the new jack swing peacocking of “Amen,” and the swanky-sounding “Bahamas Promises,” which opens with a couplet only Drizzy could pull off: “Broken pinkie promises/You fucked up our Bahamas trip.” He’s scoffing at rap’s NPCs with J. Cole on “First Person Shooter” and taking relationship advice from Future on “What Would Pluto Do.” On “BBL Love,” he drops an all-timer for the “that’s so Drake” archives, musing, “They say love’s like a BBL, you won’t know if it’s real until you feel one,” as if anyone has ever said such a thing whose name isn’t Aubrey Drake Graham.\n\nBut it isn’t officially a Drake album till you get to the song with the city name and timestamp in the title. On “8am in Charlotte,” over a boom-bap beat from Conductor Williams, Drake presides over his dogs like a coach before the big game, initiates breakups at five-star restaurants, and unleashes a barrage of knee-slappers you can imagine him deploying 20 years from now at his eventual Vegas residency. In the video, the most successful rapper of his generation wears a hoodie emblazoned with “HATE SURVIVOR.” \n\nSix weeks later he returned via Instagram teaser, dressed like Humphrey Bogart, with a pinot noir in hand and an announcement: Rather than rest on his laurels, he’d recorded the third entry in his Scary Hours series in a spontaneous five-day blitz. “It’s like a storm before the calm—we’ll get to the vacation later,” he raps on “Stories About My Brother,” a song made to be played in high-dollar LA supper clubs. There’s a lot of action packed into the project’s six additional tracks: a Yeezy mention in “Red Button,” a refutation of Old Drake’s romantic ways on the scathing “The Shoe Fits,” a second J. Cole verse on “Evil Ways,” and a rousing chorus of “Fuck my ex” over a beat with all the pomp and circumstance of a graduation anthem on closer “You Broke My Heart.”","short":"Drake drops six new
