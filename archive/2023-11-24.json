Each of these seven carols, whether a Rutter original or one of his typically thoughtful reworkings, is presented in dream performances by musicians who have this music running through their veins—the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge under its music director Daniel Hyde, alongside the Britten Sinfonia. \n\nDespite making the recording in the breathtaking Chapel of King’s, Hyde decided against using its superlative Harrison & Harrison organ, and to present each piece in Rutter’s own orchestral arrangement. “Dan [Hyde] felt he wanted to do something different,” Rutter tells Apple Music Classical, “but that gave me that extra little tinge of excitement, because my preferred accompaniment medium is orchestra.”\n\nRutter was just 18 when his “Shepherd’s Pipe Carol” caught the ear of that doyen of former King’s College music directors, the late Sir David Willcocks. Willcocks suggested it be published in the second volume of the hugely popular choir books, <i>Carols for Choirs</i>, and invited Rutter to be part of the editing and arranging team. From there, through dozens more carols and arrangements, Rutter forged a reputation for his melodic gift, instinct for the perfect harmonic treatment, and luscious vocal scoring. \n\nThere is, of course, more to Rutter than Christmas, and his non-festive works—including a Requiem, Magnificat, and Gloria—easily outnumber his carols. Rutter doesn’t mind one bit. “There comes a point where you want to say, ‘Hey, folks. I'm active in the other 11 months of the year as well!’,” he says, “but I love being associated with a time of happiness and joy. Christmas music is something that I think has a place in many people’s hearts, and it is of course, the one time of the year where many people who never experienced the sound of a choir, or any sort of a classical musical event, will come to church.\n\n“Composing carols is very much a living art form, and a very versatile one,” continues Rutter. “It can mean anything from Paul McCartney’s song ‘Wonderful Christmastime’ to Judith Weir’s choral work ‘Illuminare, Jerusalem.’ If the two of them were to meet, I think they’d have a lot in common in their feelings about Christmas and what it means.”\n\nHere, John Rutter takes us through each of the festive pieces on <i>Rutter: Orchestral Carols</i>.\n\n<b>Silent Night</b>\n“‘Silent Night’ goes to the heart of what the Christmas story is about, right into that stable with the mother and the child. I've learned never to leave it out of a Christmas concert or service without a very good reason, because I think for many people it’s the nearest they get to prayer. \n\n“When you hear my arrangement, you might think of Richard Strauss—I've moved it forward in time a little bit from its early 19th-century origins, and interpreted it in the way that it affects me. I cherish ‘Silent Night’ as one of the treasures of Christmas music—as an arranger you are, in a way, a curator of that treasure.”\n\n<b>All the Stars Looked Down</b>\n“This was written in memory of Sir Stephen Cleobury who died in 2019. For many years he was the music director of King’s College Choir, and we still miss him. I thought this would be a lovely opportunity to celebrate Stephen in the way I remember him, which is somebody who was immensely kind and gentle, and not without a dry sense of humor. I think he would probably like to have been remembered in a slow, thoughtful carol rather than a fast, jolly one. The title says it all, that I hope all the stars look down on him wherever he is now. The poem ‘The Christ-Child Lay on Mary’s Lap’ is by G.K. Chesterton.”\n\n<b>Child in a Manger</b>\n“‘Morning Has Broken’ is a hymn that a lot of people remember from their primary school years, and it gained currency as a pop song. But it started life as a Celtic folk tune and it’s got a beguiling lilt to it that I’ve always liked. The rising arpeggio at the beginning seems to usher in hope—it has a feeling of openness, which I think is all part of Christmas. ‘Morning Has Broken’ is not a Christmas text, but I thought it was such a nice tune that it deserved to be sung at Christmas time. And here it is with a very simple, woodwind-flavored orchestration.”\n\n<b>Sans Day Carol</b>\n“The text to this carol is a version of ‘The Holly and the Ivy,’ and I’ve always thought the tune to be rather delightful. I first remember singing it at Christmas time in my school as a member of the chapel choir, when the carol service was the great high point of our year. When I was arranging it, it seemed to me to invite a woodwind accompaniment, a little bit like my ‘Shepherd’s Pipe Carol’ did. They’re, let’s say, related as distant cousins.”\n\n<b>O Holy Night</b>\n“‘O Holy Night,’ originally a duet by Adolphe Adam, was pretty much unknown in the UK until Pavarotti recorded it in 1976. My choral arrangement was already available in print, and immediately all kinds of choirs started to do it, which was quite a surprise to me.”\n\n<b>Blake’s Lullaby</b>\n“I wrote ‘Blake’s Lullaby’ in 2021 to William Blake’s poem ‘A Cradle Song.’ It’s one I’ve always loved. There’s a setting by Vaughan Williams in <i>The Oxford Book of Carols</i>, which for me somehow misses the mark. So, I hoped he wouldn’t mind if I had another go at it! The occasion for this piece was the 25th anniversary of Macmillan Cancer Support’s Christmas carol concert in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The original accompaniment was organ—this arrangement is a recent one.”\n\n<b>All Bells in Paradise</b>\n“Stephen Cleobury commissioned this carol for the BBC television program <i>Carols From King’s</i>. I had already written two carols for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols: ‘What Sweeter Music’ (1987) and ‘Dormi, Jesu’ (1999). To then have an invitation to write something for the television program, I thought, was quite a hat trick and I was very honored to have been asked. \n\n“I based the words on medieval texts, and so tapped into a rich vein of already available ideas and phrases. Musically, it has got a slightly bell-like contour to the melody, which is appropriate because my wife JoAnne is a bell ringer.”","short":"“I love being associated with Christmas—a time of happiness and joy.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/fd/9c/0e/fd9c0ea3-8c96-5cf3-e27d-2edcbf51f676/0822231706953_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2a3032","textColor2":"162f32","textColor4":"375057","textColor1":"070804","bgColor":"b8d3ec","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rutter-orchestral-carols-bonus-track-edition/1709183638","playParams":{"id":"1709183638","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709183638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"130262369","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/130262369?l=en-US"},{"id":"816147","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/816147?l=en-US"},{"id":"13706244","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/13706244?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709711560":{"id":"1709711560","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709711560?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2023-11-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cecily/1515624478","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Love Letters","artistName":"Cecily","artwork":{"width":2333,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/2d/01/43/2d01436c-188e-af36-7847-bcc0bab7f6a6/617513811148_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2333,"textColor3":"c3a684","textColor2":"e0ba8d","textColor4":"bb9b76","textColor1":"eac99e","bgColor":"251d1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-letters/1709711560","playParams":{"id":"1709711560","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0ZdaxClkBy3JM8eGj4MxOE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709711560/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1515624478","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1515624478?l=en-US"}]}}},"1710250038":{"id":"1710250038","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710250038?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2023-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-hope-conspiracy/15405390","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Confusion/Chaos/Misery - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"The Hope Conspiracy","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/dc/b2/f2/dcb2f2a5-2b14-8ec1-9194-869f011eed78/791689666068.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"323232","textColor4":"5b5b5b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/confusion-chaos-misery-ep/1710250038","playParams":{"id":"1710250038","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710250038/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15405390","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15405390?l=en-US"}]}}},"1710796796":{"id":"1710796796","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710796796?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"1993-11-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/snoop-dogg/21769","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/ea/4a/e7/ea4ae77c-4cb6-9337-1650-8395bcfeeea7/c71da71e-4bf6-44ff-a2a6-8a729413a593.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"594741","textColor2":"28262c","textColor4":"504c4c","textColor1":"341f1f","bgColor":"f1e8cd","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/54/13/a1/5413a103-ae48-f026-d044-98bc37b07da7/f0dcd339-5d90-4fad-9b55-78704174fe3a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e1b435","textColor2":"d8cfd8","textColor4":"c8b1b9","textColor1":"f7d333","bgColor":"88363b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Doggystyle (30th Anniversary Edition)","artistName":"Snoop Dogg","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Coming fast on the heels of Dr. Dre’s seminal solo debut, Snoop Doggy Dogg’s <i>Doggystyle</i> plays like the sonic equivalent of the night of partying that must inevitably follow <i>The Chronic</i>’s long lazy afternoon of Crenshaw cruising. <i>The Chronic</i> ended on a slightly dark note, with the low-rolling menace and unbelievably casual misogyny of “Bitches Ain’t Shit,” and Snoop Dogg’s 1993 debut is shot through with that track’s debauched undercurrent. Though tracks like the unforgettable “Gin and Juice” and “Doggy Dogg World” provide moments of gleeful levity to rival the sun-saturated joy of “Nuthin’ But A ‘G’ Thang,” <i>Doggystyle</i> often sounds weary and dopesick where <i>The Chronic</i> was celebratory. \n\nCase in point is the epic “Murder Was the Case,” which features uncharacteristically baroque production from Dr. Dre and a relentlessly ferocious rap from Snoop that finds the normally laidback MC—who was facing murder charges by the time the album dropped—mimicking Scarface’s cold-blooded delivery.  <i>Doggystyle</i>’s occasionally gloom-laden atmosphere makes it at least as compelling as <i>The Chronic</i>, and helps to distinguish it from the glut of malt-liquor-soaked West Coast party rap that began to appear on the charts in the wake of Death Row’s unexpected commercial ascendance.","short":"Hear Snoop’s debauched debut like never before in Spatial Audio.","tagline":"Album in Spatial

(Soundtrack from the Apple Original Film)","artistName":"Martin Phipps","editorialNotes":{"standard":"The celebrated film director Ridley Scott brings Napoleon Bonaparte’s life to the screen in the 2023 biopic that couples his political and literal battles with his obsession with Josephine—his lover, wife, and Empress.\n\nMartin Phipps’ score plays a large part in highlighting Napoleon’s complex character, riffing on his simple Corsican origins with a folk-song-style melody that permeates the whole soundtrack. It’s first heard on the Erard fortepiano that Napoleon gave as a wedding gift to his second wife Marie Louise (and which now lives in London’s Museum of Music History). Phipps then passes the melody to trumpet, Corsican singers, accordion, and early plucked string instruments.\n\nElsewhere, Phipps sticks to his theme of a rough-edged hero, with Ensemble Organum adding a blood-curdling earthiness to “Austerlitz Kyrie” and “Downfall.” And in the final “Bonaparte’s Lament,” the Corsican singers return the defeated Napoleon to his island roots. There is even a nod to Beethoven in “First Counsel,” reflecting the composer’s short-lived admiration for the French leader.","short":"A multifaceted score that complements the complexity of Ridley Scott’s hero.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0c/3a/50/0c3a5003-631b-1669-d52b-55ce0d9f13db/196871470087.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a0948c","textColor2":"cbb399","textColor4":"a38f7e","textColor1":"c8b9aa","bgColor":"020214","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/napoleon-soundtrack-from-the-apple-original-film/1715501941","playParams":{"id":"1715501941","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48jFzjViqlC8w6ubCILFX2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715501941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"289709398","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/289709398?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715768149":{"id":"1715768149","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715768149?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2023-11-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/adam-blackstone/29347881","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"A Legacy Christmas","artistName":"Adam Blackstone","artwork":{"width":1536,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/e3/dd/5e/e3dd5ea1-368d-f68f-874e-f00d6837a3c2/197342399371_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1536,"textColor3":"cdc9ca","textColor2":"c5c2c7","textColor4":"a19ea2","textColor1":"fdf7f9","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-legacy-christmas/1715768149","playParams":{"id":"1715768149","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1YxEqMNJy5J9kZiMzG5iLA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715768149/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"29347881","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29347881?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716078551":{"id":"1716078551","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716078551?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2023-11-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tim-mcgraw/3496236","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Poet’s Resumé -

Some eight months later, <i>LVEU: VIVE LA TUYA…NO LA MIA</i> arrives as a companion piece to that project, albeit one roughly as long and no less significant within his wider catalog. Much like its predecessor, the broad scope of this full-length effort reflects his repeatedly proven ability to operate in any number of popular genre formats or styles. From the inventive rap of “OBVIO” and “NOVATO” to the rugged reggaetón of “CARTERA & TACOS” and “RITUAL,” he plays to his established strengths. Elsewhere, he stretches out into the tropical “LA CAPI,” the new jack swinging “ESA NENA,” and the salsa-infused closer “LA RONDA.”","short":"The versatile “LALA” vocalist drops a full-length companion to his 2023 LP.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/fd/f9/40/fdf9402c-95ae-8152-17b0-984649c6172a/5054197903205.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9bca6","textColor2":"cdd2a8","textColor4":"acb08d","textColor1":"dee0c6","bgColor":"262b24","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1717187322","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lveu-vive-la-tuya-no-la-mia/1717187322","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZVJTCW5rxpHKNgsNL91J2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717187322/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}}},"1717690342":{"id":"1717690342","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717690342?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2023-11-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/don-trip/271776453","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Wolverine","artistName":"Don Trip","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b4/94/7b/b4947b7f-fbb7-5b9b-0545-6f656b767de8/1833.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343532","textColor2":"281917","textColor4":"4b3e3c","textColor1":"0c0e0b","bgColor":"d8d3cf","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1717690342","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wolverine/1717690342","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7t2Bwd8ubUif8hy9pFwEI1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717690342/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"271776453","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/271776453?l=en-US"}]}}},"1717837232":{"id":"1717837232","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717837232?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2023-11-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trippie-redd/1203172438","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Saint Michael V2","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Trippie Redd","editorialNotes":{"standard":"The red-dreaded rapper feels like the final torchbearer for the “SoundCloud rap” scene of the late 2010s. Back then, his lovelorn warbles epitomized the angst of the rap-rock resurgence—fitting for a guy who cited Nirvana and Kiss as influences alongside Drake and Wayne. Six years after his breakthrough (2017’s “Love Scars”), Trippie doesn’t seem beholden to any particular scene at all, which frees him up for all kinds of formal experimentation. On <i>Saint Michael</i>, which follows August 2023’s <i>A Love Letter to You 5</i>, that means hopping from slinky R&B bolstered with Jersey club drums (“Pray 4 Us”) to a glitchy flip of a Japanese pop song (“Van Cleef Island”) to trying his hand at Drake’s signature move of titling your smoothest song with a timestamp and pin drop (“7am in Ohio”).","short":"Six years after his breakthrough,
