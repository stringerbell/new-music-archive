LA noise-rock trio HEALTH’s 2023 LP <i>RAT WARS</i> builds on their noise-centric industrial exercises, accentuating their hardcore tendencies with dance grooves, haunted synths, and wall-of-sound guitar lines. Taking influences from Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and contemporaries like A Place to Bury Strangers, HEALTH builds deeply twisted odes to sweaty nights on the club floor and long mornings trying to fend off the sun.\n\nLike its predecessor, 2019’s <i>VOL. 4 :: SLAVES OF FEAR</i>, <i>RAT WARS</i> blends pain and catharsis, emptiness and ecstasy. On “UNLOVED,” the trio of Benjamin Miller, Jake Duzsik, and John Famiglietti cook up a track built around military-grade snare drums, gnarling synths, and hi-hats that slosh like boots in deep rain puddles. Duzsik takes the vocal lead, conjuring up a deeply dark tale as he croons in an almost-snarl, “And it was not my fault you were unloved when you were a child/I wasn't there.”\n","short":"Twisted odes to sweaty nights and to rough mornings fending off the sun.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rat-wars/1707457955","playParams":{"id":"1707457955","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6tkuHFo0hTGGkWEGjdKOjz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1707457955/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"317478211","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/317478211?l=en-US"}]}}},"1708619786":{"id":"1708619786","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1708619786?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cc/8c/4c/cc8c4c73-5c28-b698-42de-dbdd007dddc3/f17992f5-f377-4c51-bb21-575ca39c5f01.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"acacb1","textColor2":"afbacf","textColor4":"8f97a9","textColor1":"d5d5da","bgColor":"0c0c0f","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dimmu-borgir/15621683","name":"Inspiratio Profanus","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Dimmu Borgir","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ab/e8/e1/abe8e1af-ad0d-47bc-f041-01cc702a8697/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdbdbd","textColor2":"c9c9c9","textColor4":"a1a1a1","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inspiratio-profanus/1708619786","playParams":{"id":"1708619786","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6PMOZfuG2E4wDMZLGmpkkx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1708619786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15621683","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15621683?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709411693":{"id":"1709411693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709411693?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/ea/2f/b3/ea2fb350-a30b-6b9c-5af1-e5f2b0a5f44f/e1964380-2fba-42bc-b07f-1180da813d7f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d9d8d9","textColor2":"eaeae1","textColor4":"cdcdc6","textColor1":"faf8fa","bgColor":"575758","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/neil-young/147370","name":"Before and After","artistName":"Neil Young","artwork":{"width":1914,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/98/16/35/98163522-0813-c184-0414-d085f08d341d/093624849834.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1914,"textColor3":"2b2a29","textColor2":"191615","textColor4":"393735","textColor1":"070605","bgColor":"bbbab6","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Anyone familiar with <i>Hitchhiker</i> or <i>Homegrown</i> or the dustier corners of the <i>Archives</i> series knows Neil Young has never subscribed to the idea of a permanent and enduring studio version of his songs. Part of what’s interesting about the sparse rerecordings on 2023’s <i>Before and After</i> is the relative obscurity of the source material, which reaches as far back as Buffalo Springfield (“Burned”) and as near as 2021’s <i>Barn</i> (“Don’t Forget Love”). The frailty of “Birds” has never sounded more beautiful, and nobody should take issue with a “Mr. Soul” stripped so bitterly bare. But the grace of the album isn’t in any single performance so much as the way it blurs the beginnings and ends of songs into each other to create a seamless ribbon of sound. Call it a “montage” (Young’s word), call it a dream (ours)—this is the sound of a 78-year-old man briefly glimpsing a life’s work from somewhere just outside himself.","short":"Lonesome, beautiful reimaginings of some of Young’s lesser-known songs.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/before-and-after/1709411693","playParams":{"id":"1709411693","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709411693/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"147370","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/147370?l=en-US"}]}}},"1710376355":{"id":"1710376355","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710376355?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2023-05-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arlo-parks/1291875084","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/df/e6/52/dfe65241-51b4-eec4-e211-b5d533926f61/ee971a19-f22f-4f7f-8a34-06ef591d6a7f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b69f94","textColor2":"e08b73","textColor4":"b77260","textColor1":"dec2b4","bgColor":"161217","hasP3":false}},"name":"My Soft Machine (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Arlo Parks","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/99/2e/0c/992e0c4f-673c-7ce2-8f52-657fa3886aa9/5400863151867_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9beb3","textColor2":"d5d8d7","textColor4":"adb8bd","textColor1":"e4e0ca","bgColor":"0d3655","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Almost everyone that I love has been abused, and I am included,” declares Arlo Parks with arresting honesty in the first lines of her second album <i>My Soft Machine</i>. Then, almost in the same breath, she adds, “The person I love is patient with me/She’s feeding me cheese and I’m happy.” It’s an apt introduction to an album that both basks in the light—as Parks celebrates the affirming joy of falling deeply in love—and delves into darkness. “The core concept of the project is that this is reality and memory through my eyes, experienced within this body,” Parks tells Apple Music. “From the loss of innocence to the reliving of trauma to the endless nights bursting through Koreatown to first kisses in dimly lit dive bars, this is about my life.” \n\nIt’s all told, of course, with the poetic, diary-entry lyricism that made <i>Collapsed in Sunbeams</i> so special—and which catapulted Parks to voice-of-a-generation status. Here, Parks also allows her indie-pop sound to unfurl, with embraces of synths, scuzzy guitars (see “Devotion,” the album’s most electrifying and unexpected moment), jazz, gorgeous harmonies (on the sweet, Phoebe Bridgers-guested “Pegasus”), electronic music, and more. That came, she says, in part from the team she assembled for the album, who allowed her to be more “fluid” (<i>My Soft Machine</i> was worked on with names including BROCKHAMPTON producer Romil Hemnani, the prolific US songwriter/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, and Frank Ocean collaborator Baird). “The community that organically formed around the album is one of my favorite things about it,” says Parks. “I think there is a confidence to the work. There is a looseness and an energy. There was a sense of sculpting that went beyond the more instinctive and immediate process of making album one. I am very proud of this.” Read on for the singer-songwriter’s track-by-track guide to <i>My Soft Machine</i>. \n\n<b>“Bruiseless”</b>\n“This song is about childhood abandon and the growing pains. It was inspired by a conversation I had with [American poet] Ocean Vuong where he said he was constantly trying to capture the unadulterated joy of cycling up to a friend’s house and abandoning the bike on the grass, wheels spinning, whilst you race up to their door—the softness and purity of that moment.”\n\n<b>“Impurities”</b>\n“I wrote this song the first time I met my dear friend Romil from BROCKHAMPTON. My friends and I were party-hopping and every time we called an Uber it was a Cadillac Escalade, which we thought was hilarious at the time. This is a song that is simply about being happy and feeling truly accepted.”\n\n<b>“Devotion”</b>\n“Romil, Baird and I were driving to a coffee shop called Maru in the Arts District of LA in Baird’s Suzuki Vitara that I nicknamed the ‘Red Rocket.’ We were blasting ‘17 Days’ by Prince. The three of us decided two things during that 15-minute round trip: that we had to fully commit to drama and that we were a rock band for the day.”\n\n<b>“Blades”</b>\n“The reference to the aquarium scene in Baz Luhrmann’s <i>Romeo + Juliet</i> refers to the idea of looking at a person you once knew so intimately and something indescribable has changed—as if you’re looking at each other through ocean water or obscure glass.”\n\n<b>“Purple Phase”</b>\n“The guitars you hear on this song are Paul [Epworth, the British producer who also worked on <i>Collapsed in Sunbeams</i>] and I just improvising. It was the last day of a long working week, we were feeling free and connected and our heads were cleared by exhaustion—we didn’t even have the capacity to overthink. This song has one of my favorite lines I’ve ever written: ‘I just want to see you iridescent charming cats down from trees/Mugler aviators hiding eyes that laugh when concealed.’” \n\n<b>“Weightless”</b>\n“Making ‘Weightless’ was a defining moment in the album process. I felt completely unchained from <i>Collapsed in Sunbeams</i>. Anything was possible, Paul [Epworth] and I were just chaos-dancing around the room and giggling. This one is very special to me and gave me so much creative confidence.”\n\n<b>“Pegasus (feat. Phoebe Bridgers)”</b>\n“Of course ‘Pegasus’ features lovely Phoebe [Bridgers]. The inspirations for the sparseness melting into the light, dancy beat were ‘White Ferrari’ by Frank Ocean, ‘Talk Down’ by Dijon, and ‘Grieve Not the Spirit’ by AIR. This is the first song I’ve written being so candid about how tricky it can be to accept someone being unbelievably kind.”\n\n<b>“Dog Rose”</b>\n“The original demo for this song was recorded in a hotel room in Toronto. I had the idea for the riff in the chorus and I was lying wide awake at 3 am just letting it drive me insane. Then I got up and ran about 15 blocks, through parks and across bridges, to get my guitar from the bus and get the idea down. It was very dramatic.”\n\n<b>“Puppy”</b>\n“I had always wanted to capture that half-spoken, half-melodic cadence—kind of like Frank Ocean in ‘In My Room’—and I was so pleased when I achieved it. The fuzzed-out guitar-sounding instrument is actually this little synth that [producer] Buddy [Ross] has. We were trying to recreate the energy of [my bloody valentine’s] <i>Loveless</i>.”\n\n<b>“I’m Sorry”</b>\n“Garrett Ray from Vampire Weekend’s touring band is on drums and David Longstreth [the lead singer and guitarist] from Dirty Projectors is on guitar for this one. Sculpting the right sonic treatment for this song took what felt like years, but it’s definitely my favorite song on the record from a textural and feel point of view.”\n\n<b>“Room (Red Wings)”</b>\n“‘Red Wings’ is a reference to the book <i>Autobiography of Red</i> by Anne Carson. The main character has distinctive red wings; his home life is tumultuous and he finds comfort in photography and falls deeply in love with a man called Herakles. The fragility and heart-rending nature of this book mirrors the broken quality of the song.”\n\n<b>“Ghost”</b>\n“This is the oldest song on the record. I demoed it in the winter of 2020 in my childhood bedroom. At the core of the song is a sense of embracing help, embracing human touch, learning not to suffer in solitude, learning to let people in.”","short":"“There is a confidence, a looseness, and an energy.

McRae is no stranger to stardom, having made history at age 13 as the first Canadian finalist on <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i>. Fiercely ambitious and a relentless hard worker, McRae saw dance as just one part of her toolbox, not a defining artistic characteristic. The Calgary-born artist began releasing singles in 2017, eventually dropping her first EP, <i>all the things i never said</i>, in 2020. Two years later, she shared her debut LP, <i>i used to think i could fly</i>. It was a statement, a shout from the mountaintop: “I’m here to stay.” McRae has followed up that defining moment with an even more determined album, <i>THINK LATER</i>. \n\nThe push between id and ego emerges most playfully on “greedy,” the album’s lead single and one of the biggest tracks released in 2023. Over steel drums and booming bass, McRae sings, “Baby, please believe me/I'll put you through hell/Just to know me, yeah, yeah/So sure of yourself/Baby, don't get greedy/That shit won't end well.” The temptation is there, McRae knows better, but she might not be able to help herself. <i>THINK LATER</i> is full of similarly self-aware pop bangers, unfiltered highs and lows that come with growing up as a celebrity.\n","short":"A sophomore album full of self-aware pop bangers.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/think-later/1716102849","playParams":{"id":"1716102849","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5YxG0ULdAixTrnzfo60HX4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716102849/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1446365464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1446365464?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716358729":{"id":"1716358729","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716358729?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2023-12-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lady-blacktronika/306569909","name":"Trablonika Daly -

Her debut album, <i>SAWAYAMA</i>, which was released to widespread critical acclaim under the isolating restrictions of the global pandemic, was a deceptively bombastic pop record, the production serving as a disguise for the heavy, existential lyrical content. Had it not been for the paradigm-shifting events of 2020, which left Sawayama experiencing her breakthrough success through screens, the electrifying follow up, <i>Hold the Girl</i>, would probably have been a very different record. “The thought I was really confronted with during lockdown was that I just did not feel connected to myself or my body,” Sawayama tells Apple Music. “I was constantly running on adrenaline because so many exciting things were happening, the album was doing better than I ever imagined, but I was so mentally unwell and completely numb to any real emotion.”\n\n<i>Hold the Girl</i> is the result of two years’ worth of forced self-reflection and “brutal” therapy, or what Sawayama calls a “‘can you be alone with your thoughts for two years?’ experiment.” Musically rooted in country and western—inspired by what she calls the “beautiful” writing on Kacey Musgraves' <i>Golden Hour</i> and Dolly Parton’s appearance in the film <i>Dumplin’</i>—the album was intended to be recorded in Nashville to ground the songs in the culture she was referencing, but closed borders made travel impossible. Despite the unavoidable limitations, Sawayama has succeeded in capturing the spirit of the genre, tipping a Stetson to Shania Twain on the irreverent lead single “This Hell,” tapping into the atmosphere of a saloon at closing time with “Forgiveness,” and stitching mismatched elements of other genres like industrial metal and electronica into tracks like “Your Age” and “To Be Alive.” “I really connect with the storytelling aspect of country,” says Sawayama. “It’s very authentic, and grounded in reality, and that’s what I needed to tell the story of this record.” Here, she takes us through that story, track by track.\n\n<b>“Minor Feelings”</b>\n“The title of this song is kind of the secondary title of the record. It was inspired by a collection of essays called <i>Minor Feelings</i> by Cathy Park Hong. It’s the name she gives to this collective feeling that a lot of Asian Americans have about racial microaggressions, and I really connected with that, because for me it was a collection of all these minor feelings that has now led to a pretty major shutdown of emotions. In the music I wanted to play with the minor and the major chords, so in the chorus when I say ‘minor feelings’ it’s minor and then major when I say ‘majorly getting me down.’”\n\n<b>“Hold the Girl”</b>\n“I wrote this with Barney Lister and Jonny Lattimer in the first session I ever did with Barney. He was producing the song and I was throwing out all these ideas, like: ‘So, I want it to be country, and I want the beginning to sound like Bon Jovi, and I really also want to then do a garage drop.’ Luckily he agreed! It was a very, very hard song to balance: I think we must have gone back and forth about 20 times on the production, and then another 20 times on the mix. I was trying to make it really big and orchestral, but also a pop song. ‘Hold the Girl’ was the song that really unblocked me and made me excited to write again. It reminded me of how much fun you can have with production.”\n\n<b>“This Hell”</b>\n“On first listen, ‘This Hell’ could be a romantic love song, and I love that. It sort of has a double meaning—during lockdown there were certain people that I really held on to and it truly felt like ‘this hell is better with you’—but I’m specifically talking about my friends’ experiences of being shut out of religious communities for being queer. I wanted the music to channel the confidence Shania Twain has and tell the story like a country song, a bit tongue-in-cheek. I worked on it with Vic Jamieson, Lauren Aquilina, and Paul Epworth, who is one of my ultimate production idols. We were in Church Studios, which felt really apt, and I just remember ‘line dancing’ and lighting the whole studio up in red. It was one of the best moments.”\n\n<b>“Catch Me in the Air”</b>\n“One of the first in-person sessions I did for this album was with GRACEY in Oscar Scheller’s flat, and we couldn’t come up with anything. I just wasn’t feeling it. Halfway through, GRACEY was like, ‘Oh my god, Gwen Stefani is coming out with new music!’ As a writing exercise, we pretended we were going to be pitching to Gwen, and then the first melody flowed out. The song is about getting to a certain point in my relationship with my mum, and being able to see things from her perspective now I’m around the same age she was when she had me.”\n\n<b>“Forgiveness”</b>\n“I had to write this song over Zoom because I had just come into contact with someone who had COVID, so Jonny Lattimer and Rich Cooper were in one room and I was at home. The lyrics are about forgiving people in my past, and things I couldn’t control. It’s quite stripped back, as if I was in a grunge band, but doing pop. I asked Freddy Sheed to play the drums like he was exhausted and hungover, a little bit behind the beat. I wanted this feeling of dragging your feet down this path that you’re walking to get to forgiveness. I remember that I came out with the chorus melody pretty much straight away, but I hate using GarageBand and Logic so I was having to record it to my voice notes, then AirDrop it to myself, then send to Rich to put it in the song. It’s great when you have those moments where it just flows out, but actually getting the idea down on paper was so boring!”\n\n<b>“Holy (Til You Let Me Go)”</b>\n“This is where the record starts to get dark. The previous track talks about the idea that forgiveness is a winding road, and now we’re going off the beaten path for the next four or five songs. ‘Holy (Til You Let Me Go)’ is like the counterpart to ‘This Hell.’ I went to a Church of England school and I grew up hearing so much about religion and spirituality, but there was some dark stuff that went on there that was not handled very well, and I’m alluding to it in these songs. I think going to Christian girls’ schools can be very confusing. There’s this idea that girls are holy until a certain point in their life, and then they’re not. So I’m asking: ‘What does youth mean in that situation? What is good and bad?’ You can hear my friends Louis [a school friend] and Lauren Aquilina at the end, talking about what happened, and they’re just in shock about how the adults were behaving.”\n\n<b>“Your Age”</b>\n“‘Your Age’ started off with a banjo riff, but it’s massively inspired by Nine Inch Nails. The song is about the anger I had towards the adults that were around me when I was younger. Now that I’m an adult myself, I think I can legitimately be quite angry towards the adults of my youth, because I just never would have done things that way. I think when you get older, you look back at certain things you’ve experienced and the way the adults handled it, and you kind of can’t believe it. This was one of the last songs I wrote for the album; I wanted it to have this really dark moment. It’s a pretty direct message.”\n\n<b>“Imagining”</b>\n“So much of the confusion around so many mental health issues is that you don’t know if it’s real, and you assume that everyone else is feeling this way, so you minimize what you’re experiencing. It's like being in a club and feeling completely lost, which is the energy I wanted to have in the production. It’s very repetitive, the chorus is really shouty, and the lyrics don’t make the most sense. It’s sensory overload.”\n\n<b>“Frankenstein”</b>\n“I had two days in the studio with Paul Epworth, and we wrote ‘Frankenstein’ on the first day and ‘This Hell’ on the second. I was writing about realizing that it’s not okay to give one person in your life all this baggage to deal with—whether it's a lover or a best friend or someone else close to you—and asking them to put you back together when that’s not their job. I love Paul’s pop production, but for me it’s about the work he did with Bloc Party. It’s actually Matt Tong playing drums on this track, which is insane. I grew up going to gigs around my area in Camden, and it was one of the best, most hedonistic and chaotic times of my life, and I wanted to reference that frantic energy. I might incite a mosh when I perform it live.”\n\n<b>“Hurricanes”</b>\n“A little pop-rock moment: It’s about self-sabotage and running into situations that aren’t good for you. I originally wrote this with Clarence Clarity, and the production sounded a bit like The Cardigans, a bit ’60s surf, and it just wasn’t working. I needed it to sound more driving, like being propelled forward throughout the song, like a hurricane. When Stuart Price came on board later on, he was also working with The Killers, and he suggested listening to them as a reference for the drums. Once we rerecorded the drums, it all fell into place. ‘Hurricanes’ is probably my favorite track on the album right now. It ends on that nice major chord, and it’s like this resolve. The end of the chaos. It’s such a fun song to sing.”\n\n<b>“Send My Love to John”</b>\n“One of my really good friends has quite actively homophobic parents, and they’ve had a very difficult time because their parents have never been supportive of their queerness. Then one day my friend was on the phone with their mum and at the end of the call she said, ‘OK, I’ll speak to you soon, and send my love to John,’ meaning my friend’s long-term boyfriend. It was a breakthrough. And it’s insane because the mum is never going to say sorry, but this is something they can hold on to. A lot of people need to hear the word ‘sorry’ from their parents and they’re never going to get it, so I wanted to write from the perspective of a parent who regrets not supporting their child to the fullest extent.”\n\n<b>“Phantom”</b>\n“I can’t quite remember how this song came about, but I think I had written ‘phantom’ in my notes and I was like, ‘Let’s just try things and see how it sounds.’ We were having quite a free session, just coming up with ideas. It’s a proper rock ballad, almost a love song, about losing yourself and wanting that person back because you don’t like the person that you are now. I wanted it to have a real Aerosmith vibe.”\n\n<b>“To Be Alive”</b>\n“The production on ‘To Be Alive’ is inspired by ‘Ray of Light’ by Madonna. It’s got those propulsive breakbeats. I wanted to make an extremely euphoric last song, about the really pure realization that simple things can give us joy if we want them to. The last line of the song, and of the whole album, ‘Flowers are still pretty when they’re dying,’ is actually a lyric Lauren Aquilina suggested. It ends on a hopeful note, but it’s sad at the same time.”","short":"“A ‘can you be alone with your thoughts for two years’ experiment.”","tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio"},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/be/1d/cf/be1dcf47-c1c4-9412-d15a-7d82c862a412/196922735745_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"babcd9","textColor2":"c9d7e9","textColor4":"a8b6d6","textColor1":"dfdeed","bgColor":"263188","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hold-the-girl-bonus-edition/1717982472","playParams":{"id":"1717982472","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6XSoviEu85xxQIAtX9VPIb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717982472/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"638343826","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/638343826?l=en-US"}]}}},"1718074523":{"id":"1718074523","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1718074523?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2023-12-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/t-williams/513292866","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Heartbeat (Remixes) [feat.

two decades, The Killers have been one of America's standard-bearers for rock that takes big swings. Their fusion of synth-pop grandiosity, heartland-rock grit, and pop savvy—as well as a bit of showmanship that could only be harnessed by a band originally from Las Vegas—has resulted in landscape-changing anthems like the angst-filled millennial rallying cry \"Mr. Brightside\" and gently insistent earworms like their pensive 2022 track \"boy.\"\n\nOn <i>Rebel Diamonds</i>, the band pores over their catalog with care, providing a 20-song Killers primer that shows how far they've come since they were causing buzz on both sides of the Atlantic 20 years ago. \"It allowed us to shine a light on some songs that have taken on a whole other journey than they were meant to early on,\" vocalist Brandon Flowers told Apple Music's Zane Lowe—an early champion of the band—about the thought processes behind putting together the band's second greatest-hits collection.\n\n<i>Rebel Diamonds</i> takes a completist view of The Killers' career, including tracks from all seven of its albums and showing off the breadth of its New Heartland Wave ideals. Smashes like the storming \"All These Things That I've Done,\" the soaring \"When You Were Young,\" and the twitchy \"Somebody Told Me\" are all present. Tracks from later albums like 2012's thunder-road-traveling <i>Battle Born</i> and 2021's Americana-tinged <i>Pressure Machine</i> show how the band used those early successes to evolve their sound—a shape-shifting evidenced by the charging new track \"Spirit,\" which amps up the band's jagged post-punk tendencies over a four-on-the-floor beat. \n\nFor Flowers, <i>Rebel Diamonds</i> represents the story of The Killers in a way that's crucial to how the band has sustained itself since the early 2000s—and where it might go next. \"The one thread that runs through all of this is just the authentic pursuit of finding ourselves,\" said Flowers. \"And that's something that isn't going to disappear.\" ","short":"A 20-song primer on The Killers’ first 20 years.","tagline":"New Anthology"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rebel-diamonds/1719009846","playParams":{"id":"1719009846","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6B4kdT96eBQnigkNj8eqeN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1719009846/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6483093","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6483093?l=en-US"}]}}},"1719927057":{"id":"1719927057","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1719927057?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yovngchimi/1558257759","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/3f/c8/28/3fc828fe-6a1e-f33f-11d7-9c65094852e2/3d4a88cd-604f-440f-a78b-44478f84de5c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"699eac","textColor2":"56c2d9","textColor4":"489fb2","textColor1":"7fc1d1","bgColor":"121618","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/c2/78/e0/c278e012-91c8-16e6-dec9-a30fe89caf53/af13247f-69a6-4175-b3d7-e28dffed7e2e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"88a4a7","textColor2":"adc6c6","textColor4":"8a9f9f","textColor1":"aaccd0","bgColor":"000503","hasP3":false}},"name":"WLGS","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"YOVNGCHIMI","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b7/4c/e4/b74ce4fd-46d4-921a-03a2-3a2cdcebe387/8721056232550.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c7a7","textColor2":"c3c7aa","textColor4":"a0a48d","textColor1":"eff3cb","bgColor":"181816","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I've been working on the concept for a while,” YOVNGCHIMI tells Apple Music about his full-length debut album. “I feel like I got it right where it needs to be.” The Puerto Rican rapper’s singles campaign throughout 2023 cemented his status in the Latin trap and drill scene. But even as he was grinding in the studio and preparing his first album, he knew to feed the streets with a mixtape, the DJ Drama-hosted <i>Gangsta Grillz: Mvrda Gvng</i>. “It was an honor to work with Drama,” he says. “Drama is a legend!” \n\nThat iconic hip-hop co-sign and features by the likes of G Herbo, Rich The Kid, and Shawny Binladen foreshadowed the bilingual heft of <i>WLGS</i>. Boasting collabs with French Montana, Bryant Myers, Southside, and more, the album operates on a level beyond language barriers to deliver a ruthless rap attack with a few other genre teases mixed in. “I felt like working with them was going to give the album the touch that I wanted,” he says of these team-ups. “I mixed what was going on in Puerto Rico with the swag that motherfuckers bring in the US.” Read on to learn the details behind some of the album’s highlights—in his own words.\n\n<b>“Glizzy Walk 3”</b>\n“‘Glizzy Walk’ is a series of songs that I do since the beginning. It's a freestyle song of what's going on with me in my life and career. It has the touch of street and points out the progress we're doing from ‘Glizzy Walk’ 1 and 2. It brings the vibe that I want for an album. That's why I wanted to start with ‘Glizzy Walk 3,’ especially since this is a song that people already know is hype already with the name, because they know the series.”\n\n<b>“Megvtron”</b>\n“I have everything on the album, even more commercial songs for the ladies. I have songs that I'm touching base with guys in the American community. But the first three songs, ‘Glizzy Walk 3,’ ‘Full of Diamonds,’ and ‘Megvtron,’ are basically what I'm about on this music-type shit. I wanted to start the album with my strongest line, you feel me?”\n\n<b>“Grave Digger” (feat. Southside)</b>\n“Back when I wasn't doing music, I used to always listen to a lot of rappers. I used to know a lot about Southside and a lot of producers that are legends in the producing area, with these guys from ATL. They made it big. He's one of the best trap producers. It’s amazing for me and it's an honor to work with him.”\n\n<b>“Bandida Fina” (feat. Ozuna)</b>\n“Honestly, we did a song and he dropped it and I wanted to have him on my album too. I told him I wanted to do a reggaetón like what he does, like what he's the best on, and bring me in Ozuna's wave, basically—but in my album. I feel like it's one of the top songs of the album.”\n\n<b>“Tu$$I” (feat. Dei V)</b>\n“I like the vibe of that track because it's for the ladies. But it's still on a different type of R&B beat, a little more movement than R&B, because R&B is kind of slow. Dei V, he's one of my main partners; he’s like my family. He's one of the reasons that I'm doing this music shit, to be honest. Me and him got a lot of songs, a lot of hits coming up. That was one of the songs that I wanted to put out because I felt like it's a hit. It's been a month and the song is going crazy.”\n\n<b>“357” (feat. SleazyWorld Go)</b>\n“I like SleazyWorld Go. His movement kind of looks like mine out here. We've got similarities. I felt like he was going to kill it. SleazyWorld liked it and he dropped a verse. It's crazy. SleazyWorld went crazy on it.”\n\n<b>“Quarter Milly” (feat. French Montana)</b>\n“I know about French a lot, way back in the days. He's still doing his thing; he’s still going crazy. He's got a good relationship with my people, so I wanted to do something with him. We had been talking about doing something, but I hadn't found it yet. That's why he wasn't on <i>Gangsta Grillz</i>. But I had something for him when I did this song. I got the beat from Tay Keith. It’s a fire-ass collab, bro.”\n\n<b>“Foreign” (feat. Foreign Teck)</b>\n“We've been in the studio once before, but we didn't really work on a song that day. We got a great relationship. I know him through Hydro, actually. He sent me a pack and I chose one of the beats and that's the one that got on the album. Then we also worked on a different one he dropped as a single, ‘Gang Affiliated.’”","short":"The Puerto Rican rapper on his debut LP: “I got it right where it needs to be.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wlgs/1719927057","playParams":{"id":"1719927057","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5JWyYQTyvhEeUj0xvHrPxh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1719927057/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1558257759","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1558257759?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720307257":{"id":"1720307257","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720307257?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nicki-minaj/278464538","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/93/bb/59/93bb59c1-c3f3-2cf2-8b1e-eb5658f58118/25bf9264-a308-457a-b907-5404c84173d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"36292e","textColor2":"2c2125","textColor4":"503d44","textColor1":"0d080a","bgColor":"ddadc0","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/94/e2/33/94e233c9-55f5-2220-faa2-d1c606c21499/f6c4a091-903f-45a5-8b8f-d358c47f8e59.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"291b21","textColor2":"171013","textColor4":"3c2831","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"cd89a7","hasP3":false}},"name":"Pink Friday 2","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Nicki Minaj","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/16/06/fa/1606fadb-8ebb-c797-1406-715779d9bead/23UM1IM08927.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"493438","textColor2":"552131","textColor4":"754d58","textColor1":"1d0209","bgColor":"f9fef7","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Attention, Barbz: The album has landed.
