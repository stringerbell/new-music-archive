warmth and yuletide grace exude from the enchanting improvisations and reflections on seasonal favorites that form <i>Christmas Piano with Alexis Ffrench</i>. The album’s generous tracklist embraces 24 songs and carols that invite listeners to take a break from merrymaking and contemplate the essential Christmas message of peace and goodwill. Beyond delivering countless touches of fine pianism and subtle artistry, Alexis Ffrench distills that message into music touched by the intoxicating spirit of nostalgia for childhood Christmases, and by genuine feelings of comfort and joy.\n\n“When I think of great Christmas albums, I think of Nat King Cole,” Ffrench tells Apple Music Classical. “The tone of his <i>The Magic of Christmas</i> is absolutely right. You get a sense of a man who has a deep, soulful connection with the music that he’s singing. \n\n“He was my dad’s favorite artist, too. It gives me a fuzzy feeling when I think about it. Christmas is a time of innocence on record as much as everything else. No one has anything to prove. You just put your heart out there and hope people will connect with it through the music. That’s what I've tried to do with this Christmas album.”\n\nFfrench draws deep from his heartfelt style of “classical soul” to reimagine such seasonal evergreens as “Silent Night,” “In the Bleak Mid-winter,” and “The First Noel.” His choice of songs includes Christmas chart-toppers—“It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” and “Fairytale of New York” punchy among them—and an exquisite sequence of new compositions, introduced by the sublime “A Time for Giving.” \n\n“They all mean very different things to me,” he observes, “and there’s a kaleidoscope of colors, feelings, and moods in this album. I truly hope there’s something for everybody, that there are tracks that can touch people in a profound way, to remind them of the time they’re in now, to remember times past and think of other people.”","short":"“There’s a kaleidoscope of colors, feelings, and moods in this album.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-piano-with-alexis/1686902774","playParams":{"id":"1686902774","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2YymiUCe4WEr0GBJ0aSLFx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1686902774/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"342515428","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/342515428?l=en-US"}]}}},"1693478781":{"id":"1693478781","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1693478781?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/children-of-bodom/13550318","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/4b/7e/b1/4b7eb199-fe77-2a29-a0b2-4465f833e3ba/9769e6d5-76ad-4fd4-82b2-e43922a0cf6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"5db7cc","textColor2":"7fc7ce","textColor4":"67a5ad","textColor1":"72def5","bgColor":"081c27","hasP3":false}},"name":"A Chapter Called Children of Bodom (Final Show in Helsinki Ice Hall, 2019)","artistName":"Children of Bodom","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f0/4f/b9/f04fb97a-162a-0428-7fe7-14afc928422a/5401148003093_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca7957","textColor2":"f86e2b","textColor4":"ce5d28","textColor1":"f39266","bgColor":"27181b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-chapter-called-children-of-bodom-final-show/1693478781","playParams":{"id":"1693478781","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nfjI93DAK3YWEJZTjzOv1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1693478781/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"13550318","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/13550318?l=en-US"}]}}},"1698676298":{"id":"1698676298","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1698676298?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"releaseDate":"2023-11-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-liu/1493505546","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/9a/3d/97/9a3d9736-d66c-16ce-107d-f11c641b2ae8/639e5a4a-87a0-40dc-a04a-e24fc903c395.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ced3d8","textColor2":"eaecef","textColor4":"c6ccd2","textColor1":"f4f5f7","bgColor":"364960","hasP3":false}},"name":"WAVES: Music by Rameau, Ravel, Alkan","artistName":"Bruce Liu","editorialNotes":{"standard":"This first full-length studio album from Canadian pianist Bruce Liu, winner of the 2021 International Chopin Piano Competition, offers music by three distinctive French masters. It begins and ends with works by Rameau, written originally for harpsichord. Liu provides the required clarity through dexterous fingerwork, even as he reinvents some textures, bringing a shimmering quality to the rapidly repeating notes of Variation 3 of <i>Gavotte et six doubles</i>.\n\nLiu has further scope to delineate character and atmosphere in virtuosic works by Alkan—bringing out their harmonic strangeness and acerbic wit—and in the varied musical depictions of Ravel’s <i>Miroirs</i>, most impressively in “Une barque sur l’océan” which prompts Liu to deliver liquid streams of notes while evoking the surge and power of the sea.","short":"Three great French

Only Talk About Real Shit When We're F****d Up","artistName":"Bas","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"A Dreamville fixture, Bas boasts a hip-hop vision without regional limits. His first proper album since 2018’s <i>Milky Way</i>, the pointedly titled <i>We Only Talk About Real Shit When We're Fucked Up</i> reflects the international expansion of his creative gaze. Songs like “Black Jedi” and “Diamonds” maintain his twin senses of melody and lyricism, two elements crucial to his catalog. Two J. Cole team-ups here, “Paper Cuts” and the Afrobeats-leaning “Passport Bros,” only affirm that further.\n\nNot surprising given his Sudanese roots, Parisian birthplace, and Queens upbringing, his curatorial choice of collaborators here spans the globe. Several of these guests represent the African diaspora, including Zimbabwean-born Sha Sha, whose “Testify” appearance leaves a lasting impression. A New York native, Ghanaian American singer Amaarae raises more than just a few octaves on “Decent,” while British rapper AJ Tracey helps bridge two respective drill worlds on the feverish “179 Deli.” Elsewhere, French multi-instrumentalist FKJ adds an organic feel with his textured loops and grooves on “Risk” and “Wait on Me.”\n","short":"The Dreamville fixture goes global while staying local at heart.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/27/0a/5a/270a5a6d-7644-46ff-c93c-fdb5c5cd4aa5/23UM1IM63100.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a8a2a9","textColor2":"b9c9be","textColor4":"97a59b","textColor1":"cfc5cf","bgColor":"0f1511","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1720257027","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-only-talk-about-real-shit-when-were-f-d-up/1720257027"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720257027/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"252299862","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/252299862?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720440239":{"id":"1720440239","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live From Drew's Rental House - Single","artistName":"The Chainsmokers","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0a/a9/92/0aa99210-b107-67f0-a3f9-e6cda2f6800c/196871702126.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4a4b49","textColor2":"211d1c","textColor4":"4d4a49","textColor1":"1d1e1c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-drews-rental-house-single/1720440239","playParams":{"id":"1720440239","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"580391756","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/580391756?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720469093":{"id":"1720469093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720469093?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/icona-pop/398345158","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/2f/a5/50/2fa550c2-029d-2c74-b3a1-0ccdc1920f03/f7151bef-9247-496e-86b0-ac81010a682c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"303231","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3c3e3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6f2ed","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/92/75/f2/9275f249-b239-09d3-db9f-bdf4754f874c/ea358ef8-035c-4261-b139-07afcd4ce43b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"252f2a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"26302c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebf3f2","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/42/56/49/42564977-40a8-4c62-c7f3-a3fd28e279b9/d936f95c-48b4-41bc-a3c9-f9d3e26783d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"373938","textColor1":"020001","bgColor":"d4dcd9","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/c8/42/11/c8421172-bc15-8f5c-72f8-8e2001d7b892/283710f3-152d-4f63-942c-dabaedf5511f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"262425","textColor4":"4d4e4e","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"e8f4f0","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/9c/62/12/9c621249-0ec0-0d0c-7f49-6eaf08129458/dab0ac91-6323-4eb7-85cb-6875bfae06ad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"030f09","textColor4":"323d38","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"eff5f5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/dc/99/cb/dc99cbbb-b33b-e7b7-8b0b-49b7c6a6e38a/5eaea06f-8e90-4a10-9b0a-1ec056fc38e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2e2d","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3e4040","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"c9d0ce","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fitness: Run, Dec 2023 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Icona Pop","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—the mix brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This month’s iteration was assembled by the Swedish electro-pop duo Icona Pop, which released its first album in 10 years, <i>Club Romantech</i>, in September. The project is a bit of a departure from the sunny, maximalist hyperpop they became known for with their 2012 breakthrough “I Love It.” Instead, it’s a journey into darker, stranger, clubbier spaces. This running mix follows that creative direction, but is peppered with moments of playfulness and surprise: Billen Ted and Kah-Lo’s “People Ain’t Dancing” breaks up all that adrenaline-pumping with a moment of bouncy deep house flow, and “We Kept Dancing”—a gospel-inflected collaboration between Jonk & Spook, Samuele Sartini, and DJ Roland Clark—is the sort of inspirational piano house anthem that will keep you moving forward when you want to give up.

Story Short: Willie Nelson 90 (Live at the Hollywood Bowl)","artistName":"Willie Nelson","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Early on in this guest-packed collection recorded at LA’s Hollywood Bowl over two nights in April 2023, Willie Nelson’s son Micah takes the stage to sing “Die When I’m High (Halfway to Heaven),” a song he wrote when he was playing a lot of dominoes with his dad during the pandemic. The song imagines Willie looking back on his improbable life, from young musician raised in poverty by his grandparents in Abbott, Texas, to hard-working legend who’s still eager to get on the bus at 90: “They say people my age are expected to fade,” Micah sings, “Well, I’m afraid I’ve let them down.” The moment proves that <i>Long Story Short</i> is not just another tribute album: It’s a thoughtful testament to one of America’s greatest artists, and it proves Nelson can outsing just about anybody into his 10th decade. Fifty-three tracks distilled from four hours of performances each night by Nelson’s greatest living contemporaries and acolytes, it’s also a souvenir from an extremely well-attended birthday party.\n\nBilly Strings kicks off the celebration with “Whiskey River,” channeling Nelson and Family’s late-’70s performance with fiery picking and harmonica. Charley Crockett steps into 1971’s “Yesterday’s Wine” like a pair of old boots, crooning over gorgeous pedal steel and fiddle. Allison Russell and Norah Jones team up for “Seven Spanish Angels,” a gospel classic Nelson recorded with Ray Charles.\n\nBut it’s Nelson’s appearance midway through that kicks things to another gear. He reunites with Booker T. Jones for “Stardust,” the Hoagy Carmichael standard the two included on Nelson’s album of the same name. He teams up with Buddy Cannon, another longtime collaborator who has produced more than a dozen of his recent albums, for “Something You Get Through,” an overlooked gem from 2018’s <i>Last Man Standing</i>. Nelson and Sheryl Crow deliver a gorgeous take on “Far Away Places,” the 1948 standard written by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer. \n\nNelson admits before the performance that he doesn’t know the key; by the end he’s improvising lines with Crow, adding new dimensions to the well-known classic. After more friends and luminaries, including Neil Young, Keith Richards, and Bob Weir, everyone takes the stage for “Happy Birthday.” Even though the group is singing for him, Nelson doesn’t step away from the mic. He sings it along with everyone else.

Friday 2 (Gag City Deluxe)","artistName":"Nicki Minaj","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"After delays, teases, rumors, and more, Nicki Minaj’s epic and much-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s <i>Queen</i> arrives to close out 2023 in style. At 22 tracks and over 70 minutes, the epic project features Minaj tag-teaming with fellow global stars like J. Cole, Drake, Future, Lil Wayne, and Lil Uzi Vert—that is, when she’s not aiming for the throne on solo cuts. \n\nLike 2010’s <i>Pink Friday</i> (Minaj’s debut album), <i>Pink Friday 2</i> features Minaj showcasing the various ways she can carry a track. On some songs, she brings out her best bars, unloading clever one-liners and technically flashy verses. On the album’s second track, “Barbie Dangerous,” Minaj spits over a hypnotizing piano melody and drums that hit like a punch in the gut. Switching between a smooth, controlled flow and a vicious double-time delivery, Minaj is in full control of the song’s dynamics from beginning to end. She makes her claim as one of rap’s great innovators, spitting, “Name a rapper that can channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear/Ho, I’m mother of the year/Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make ’em disappear/But to me, it's just another year.”\n\nOn “Nicki Hendrix,” she teams up with Future and taps into his toxic vulnerability, writing a song of love and love lost that would fit nicely into her collaborator’s catalog. At her best, Nicki is uninhibited by style, substance, or delivery. She raps, “Baby, did you think there were a million mes?/I guess I underestimated you too.” Whether engaging in a street cypher with J. Cole, chirping at exes with Drake, or lamenting what once was with Future, Nicki Minaj shows off every weapon in her arsenal on <i>Pink Friday 2</i>.","short":"50 Cent, Monica, and Keyshia Cole make a
