first full-length studio album from Canadian pianist Bruce Liu, winner of the 2021 International Chopin Piano Competition, offers music by three distinctive French masters. It begins and ends with works by Rameau, written originally for harpsichord. Liu provides the required clarity through dexterous fingerwork, even as he reinvents some textures, bringing a shimmering quality to the rapidly repeating notes of Variation 3 of <i>Gavotte et six doubles</i>.\n\nLiu has further scope to delineate character and atmosphere in virtuosic works by Alkan—bringing out their harmonic strangeness and acerbic wit—and in the varied musical depictions of Ravel’s <i>Miroirs</i>, most impressively in “Une barque sur l’océan” which prompts Liu to deliver liquid streams of notes while evoking the surge and power of the sea.","short":"Three great French composers reveal the superb artistry of a rising pianist.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/waves-music-by-rameau-ravel-alkan/1698676298","playParams":{"id":"1698676298","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5j5eLlvzM8KBh6vljwgbpz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1698676298/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1493505546","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1493505546?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709545291":{"id":"1709545291","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709545291?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/f8/35/23/f835231e-7357-3e87-cea5-281916ec0e72/Job9e0be23f-17df-45fb-b214-29046c429692-157713906-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_303071518_1592157836-Time1698270138036.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"b8b9bb","textColor2":"dda771","textColor4":"b98e62","textColor1":"dbdee0","bgColor":"2a2a2a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a3/05/0f/a3050f25-bf23-1e2a-ee73-67873d45ae5f/c3cd5be5-3844-4a81-9f49-6acfe98f8776.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9f9e9a","textColor2":"c6bba4","textColor4":"9e9683","textColor1":"c7c5c1","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/cf/ba/ce/cfbace91-80b2-9dfe-e444-f03232c8332b/Job461b9f20-c9d2-4345-a6fb-16ebfcc977a1-157713907-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_303071517_1592157835-Time1698271027727.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"b8bbbf","textColor2":"d4d4d4","textColor4":"acacac","textColor1":"e2e6eb","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ambrose-akinmusire/279545359","name":"Owl Song","artistName":"Ambrose Akinmusire","editorialNotes":{"short":"Glide away on Akinmusire’s velvet-soft, featherlight compositions.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9c/6b/ed/9c6bedca-6088-799f-67d2-4147d0e63b18/075597901832.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"b9babc","textColor2":"c3c5cb","textColor4":"9fa0a5","textColor1":"e4e5e7","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1709545291","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/owl-song/1709545291","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6HYZUqe4sXwIu5VWlfaV2E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709545291/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"279545359","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/279545359?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713053365":{"id":"1713053365","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713053365?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2023-12-22","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/85/33/f7/8533f78e-6e1c-9311-c00a-588be9dba8b4/3370c322-071c-4ed4-8252-023bfe236cf5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c973b0","textColor2":"f2719f","textColor4":"ca6388","textColor1":"f185d2","bgColor":"2b2b2b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/adam-x/56388372","name":"My Acidic Being -

The Venetian composer’s famously tricky concerto surges to life in the hands of Julien Chauvin and Le Concert de la Loge, launched by spooky chords and an initial solo entry that launches straight out of the starting blocks. \n\nThey’re no less committed (or theatrical) when the scene cuts to a warming fireside in the central “Largo,” or takes to the ice for a finale filled with incomparable snowy joys. Despite using just one period instrument per part, the Paris-based band conjures up a dazzling display of string sounds. Above all, their “Winter” counters monochrome meteorological realities with vivid colors, high-wire virtuosity, and daring musical gestures.\n\nThe interpretation, Chauvin tells Apple Music Classical, evolved naturally over the course of many performances. “Because <i>The Four Seasons</i> has been recorded hundreds of times before, everyone wants to make it faster, or slower, or more extreme, or more violent, or more singing than the rest,” he notes. “We didn’t want to do that—we didn’t want to draw attention to something ‘special’ just for the sake of it. But at some point, we’d played it so many times that we thought, ‘Yes, I think we play it quite OK. We have good ideas. So let’s record it.’ And we did it with all our heart and with every musician playing their full part in the interpretation. \n\n“I hope the first movement of ‘Winter,’ which is always an impressive piece, gives an idea of what we were about with this recording.”","short":"Vivaldi’s icy season comes to glistening life in this dramatic performance.","tagline":"New EP and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ff/8d/8b/ff8d8b77-e827-76b0-6e1d-50527e7936ab/8721056093946.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"e2e2e2","textColor4":"b4b4b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1714465887","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vivaldi-quatre-saisons-lhiver-single/1714465887"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714465887/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1147282548","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1147282548?l=en-US"},{"id":"317400668","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/317400668?l=en-US"}]}}},"1716102588":{"id":"1716102588","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1716102588?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2023-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4d/d6/0c/4dd60cd9-3ef8-4a59-6859-11391f0966a4/e7e015f3-a34e-426e-a110-bd6067ca918c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"3f221a","textColor2":"371d15","textColor4":"5f3022","textColor1":"0f0c0b","bgColor":"ff7c56","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1a/6c/86/1a6c86d4-c496-abd3-cab7-8c929737dd79/5c6c2818-3ec5-46d4-881e-9d27789ee58c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"35221c","textColor2":"13100d","textColor4":"3f2a23","textColor1":"070604","bgColor":"ef957a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/70/63/b5/7063b538-f350-850b-2366-b98cf845e6ca/dc754cc1-c583-44c3-9d2e-2c7c730ed0b0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b1a0f","textColor2":"1c1a1a","textColor4":"48281e","textColor1":"0b0807","bgColor":"f95e30","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/1a/9e/131a9e8e-239c-cd50-e528-1ec41f1136ff/e430294d-aeb5-4b7e-bbaa-38b124f4eed7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"362019","textColor2":"1d1b1b","textColor4":"462f29","textColor1":"090808","bgColor":"ed8060","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/89/2a/a5892a8d-4f19-bb44-f485-d16c06348a9e/b5cbd334-69b6-45ac-bc00-cdb042d11d8e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"3e1f17","textColor2":"2c130b","textColor4":"562516","textColor1":"0f0c0c","bgColor":"fc6c42","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hiroko-yamamura/1161050416","name":"NYE 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Hiroko Yamamura","editorialNotes":{"standard":"The Chicago DJ drops punishing techno for after the ball drops.\n\nDance music has never been more diverse, more inclusive, or more representative of the people actually making (and moving to) the music than it is right now.

Dreamville fixture, Bas boasts a hip-hop vision without regional limits. His first proper album since 2018’s <i>Milky Way</i>, the pointedly titled <i>We Only Talk About Real Shit When We're Fucked Up</i> reflects the international expansion of his creative gaze. Songs like “Black Jedi” and “Diamonds” maintain his twin senses of melody and lyricism, two elements crucial to his catalog. Two J. Cole team-ups here, “Paper Cuts” and the Afrobeats-leaning “Passport Bros,” only affirm that further.\n\nNot surprising given his Sudanese roots, Parisian birthplace, and Queens upbringing, his curatorial choice of collaborators here spans the globe. Several of these guests represent the African diaspora, including Zimbabwean-born Sha Sha, whose “Testify” appearance leaves a lasting impression. A New York native, Ghanaian American singer Amaarae raises more than just a few octaves on “Decent,” while British rapper AJ Tracey helps bridge two respective drill worlds on the feverish “179 Deli.” Elsewhere, French multi-instrumentalist FKJ adds an organic feel with his textured loops and grooves on “Risk” and “Wait on Me.”\n","short":"The Dreamville fixture goes global while staying local at heart.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-only-talk-about-real-shit-when-were-f-d-up/1720257027","playParams":{"id":"1720257027","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720257027/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"252299862","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/252299862?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720440239":{"id":"1720440239","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756","name":"Live From Drew's Rental House - Single","artistName":"The Chainsmokers","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0a/a9/92/0aa99210-b107-67f0-a3f9-e6cda2f6800c/196871702126.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4a4b49","textColor2":"211d1c","textColor4":"4d4a49","textColor1":"1d1e1c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-drews-rental-house-single/1720440239","playParams":{"id":"1720440239","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"580391756","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/580391756?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720469093":{"id":"1720469093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720469093?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/67/9f/74/679f7442-77ad-11c9-edad-eb81fedc7920/7fc09d0c-e49a-4f7e-a96d-9b93dbd01257.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"303231","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3c3e3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6f2ed","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/92/75/f2/9275f249-b239-09d3-db9f-bdf4754f874c/ea358ef8-035c-4261-b139-07afcd4ce43b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"252f2a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"26302c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebf3f2","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/42/56/49/42564977-40a8-4c62-c7f3-a3fd28e279b9/d936f95c-48b4-41bc-a3c9-f9d3e26783d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"373938","textColor1":"020001","bgColor":"d4dcd9","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/c8/42/11/c8421172-bc15-8f5c-72f8-8e2001d7b892/283710f3-152d-4f63-942c-dabaedf5511f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"262425","textColor4":"4d4e4e","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"e8f4f0","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/9c/62/12/9c621249-0ec0-0d0c-7f49-6eaf08129458/dab0ac91-6323-4eb7-85cb-6875bfae06ad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"030f09","textColor4":"323d38","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"eff5f5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/dc/99/cb/dc99cbbb-b33b-e7b7-8b0b-49b7c6a6e38a/5eaea06f-8e90-4a10-9b0a-1ec056fc38e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2e2d","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3e4040","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"c9d0ce","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/icona-pop/398345158","name":"Fitness: Run, Dec 2023 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Icona Pop","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—the mix brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This month’s iteration was assembled by the Swedish electro-pop duo Icona Pop, which released its first album in 10 years, <i>Club Romantech</i>, in September. The project is a bit of a departure from the sunny, maximalist hyperpop they became known for with their 2012 breakthrough “I Love It.” Instead, it’s a journey into darker, stranger, clubbier spaces. This running mix follows that creative direction, but is peppered with moments of playfulness and surprise: Billen Ted and Kah-Lo’s “People Ain’t Dancing” breaks up all that adrenaline-pumping with a moment of bouncy deep house flow, and “We Kept Dancing”—a gospel-inflected collaboration between Jonk & Spook, Samuele Sartini, and DJ Roland Clark—is the sort of inspirational piano house anthem that will keep you moving forward when you want to give up.

The sounds of Miguel Cantos Gómez reached every corner of the world, and now he celebrates this achievement. “I wanted to release all the songs that my fans have been asking for as a way of ending the best year of my life. This is like a little present for all my people.”\n\nSaiko’s initial plan did not involve an EP; he had hoped to release his much-anticipated album <i>Sakura</i>. “I feel that people are waiting for the album, and I’m a bit nervous about it, because I wanted to release it now. I didn’t want to leave a void,” he explains. The result is a collection of seven tracks that renews the young star’s reggaetón-meets-Auto-Tune aesthetic while delivering a taste of his forthcoming full-length debut. “It’s called ‘Leaving the Planet’ (<i>Saliendo del Planeta</i>) because <i>Sakura</i>—a galaxy—is the next step. So everything makes sense. Before we arrive at that galaxy, we have to leave the planet.” Saiko discussed the EP with Apple Music, track by track.\n\n<b>“CORLEONE” (feat. Yandel)</b>\n“In Miami, I had the chance to spend time in the studio with Yandel. I played him the song, and he said right away: ‘I want to be part of this one.’ The track was already amazing—add a legend to it, it’s like a nuclear bomb. It was done really fast. Yandel is a great guy. He treated me like I was his nephew, and we got along really well.”\n\n<b>“Éxtasisssssss”</b>\n“I was a little less productive this year. Usually I’m at the studio every single day, but my tour included 90 dates, and that made it difficult to work on new material. When I decided to release an EP, I found a few songs, like this one, worth rescuing. I worked on it last summer, and I actually had forgotten who did the backing track. I lifted it from the box of unused bits, we retouched it and added bright new elements, and I ended up liking it quite a bit. I’m burned out on it now, since I’ve been listening to it for a year and a half, but it will sound fresh to the fans. I know they will love it.”\n\n<b>“Feliz Navidad”</b>\n“I went to Barcelona with my girlfriend. I was at the studio with my buddy Came—we did ‘Polaris’ together, and a few other things—and we started recording some music. I already had some of the chords, so we continued working on that vein. I even have a WhatsApp audio where I’m humming the melody, which is usually how I write my songs. It’s a good way to come up with a track really fast. Then we modified it, added lyrics and all the rest. I returned to Granada and reworked it with Uli, my producer and frequent collaborator. I wanted this EP to be a real aural experience, so we added tons of effects. Good production is essential; I want you to wear headphones and feel like the record is kissing your ears.”\n\n<b>“Tinieblas” (feat. Justin Quiles and Raul Clyde)</b>\n“I met Justin around April [2023]. We were backstage at a festival, and my manager mentioned he had uploaded a preview of a song that I really liked. He said right at that moment: ‘I’ll send it to you and you can put it out.’ Unbelievable. The backing track was from Dímelo Flow. He sent it to me, but we never found the stems, because it was two or three years old and the project got lost. We were finishing the EP and I still wanted to have this song that didn’t really exist. Suddenly my producer sends me a project titled ‘track with Justin Quiles’—he had redone everything. We worked on the production to make it more contemporary and brought on a friend of mine, Raul Clyde, a talented kid from Spain who’s starting out. I always try to lend a hand. I told Justin, and he answered the same, that he loves helping the new talent.”\n\n<b>“Tú me calmas”</b>\n“We did this one in Medellín, Colombia, at the ICON studio, which is like a little house in the mountains. There was a lot of people around; we lit a fire and did a barbecue, it was really nice. I have a lot of affection for this track, because I worked on it the first time I went to Medellín, when everything was different. I knew I wanted it to come out, but wasn’t sure when. Last year I uploaded a preview, and a lot of people started asking for it. I decided to move ahead, because in the end, this EP is dedicated to my fans—the people who follow me and want to listen to my songs.”\n\n<b>“Siempre vas a volver” (feat. Polimá Westcoast)</b>\n“I recorded this one a year ago in Medellín. I was saving it only because I was looking for the right time to release it. The other day I posted a screen capture on Twitter and everybody started asking for it. Both the lyrics and the beat are really good. This summer I invited Polimá, who was in Madrid, to go to the studio. I put it on, he loved it and recorded it right there. It’s been ready for over six months, and I was saving it for the album. My team advised me to include it on this EP, and when I finally did, everything made sense.”\n\n<b>“Xxx_Rosario_xxX”</b>\n“I believe this is my favorite song on the EP, but certainly hope that my grandma doesn’t listen to it. It’s this beat that was sent to me; I loved it from the get-go and told myself I had to do something. The following week I went to the new studio, where everything sounds incredible, and almost blew the speakers with it. This one happened effortlessly. I really wanted to have a song geared to the nightclub. This EP has tracks that could be really big in the club, and other tracks for the radio, and that’s exactly what I wanted: being everywhere at once. This one’s really wicked for the nightclub.”","short":"“I want you to feel like the record is kissing your ears.”","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/saliendo-del-planeta/1720567679","playParams":{"id":"1720567679","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0ct1nMrWBi5B93RKXAZJEf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720567679/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"105159875","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/105159875?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720778509":{"id":"1720778509","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720778509?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"releaseDate":"2023-12-22","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/81/37/08/81370822-beb8-0520-fa10-f2de989d5c05/ce806bc1-6ff1-424c-87f2-ea861f4e0fdc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0c1b6","textColor2":"cdcbb7","textColor4":"afae9a","textColor1":"e3e3da","bgColor":"373a26","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/57/ce/3e/57ce3e7b-5aef-0a18-eb2e-5b79d1c2817b/f2c0f55d-578f-4125-b278-f9477e2d9d3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c9a78a","textColor2":"ccc7b6","textColor4":"a9a698","textColor1":"f3c9a4","bgColor":"212121","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/richard-reed-parry/215660194","name":"The Iron Claw (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Richard Reed Parry","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/75/27/6b/75276b31-8778-d822-c558-c31f9b43ae0c/43521.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4933f","textColor2":"cda855","textColor4":"a48744","textColor1":"f4b74f","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-iron-claw-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1720778509","playParams":{"id":"1720778509","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2aZ7EseMYSg7NGT3hhDUVZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720778509/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"215660194","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/215660194?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720811579":{"id":"1720811579","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720811579?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2023-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/ef/f2/a5eff2c4-075f-e304-6f8f-fdf055b79f5d/797a8e01-5cf9-4b8c-b6ea-c096ccbed04a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"43241b","textColor2":"1d1110","textColor4":"4a271e","textColor1":"140e0d","bgColor":"ff7c56","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/da/0a/30da0a9c-b310-3f10-da05-b21cd557be4d/98d60dd2-0f11-4af4-9a82-635484f20ca3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"35211c","textColor2":"190f0c","textColor4":"432922","textColor1":"070504","bgColor":"ed9479","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/32/4c/98/324c9841-2e36-80fe-5bf4-06e5734085c2/245c914c-68d6-4495-bc9c-fd9e67964347.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"391c14","textColor2":"160d0b","textColor4":"411c12","textColor1":"0c0c0d","bgColor":"ee5b30","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/03/4d/7b/034d7b14-f6a7-03c8-9384-afa455927a48/95a6e186-eaf6-4378-9254-ddbfa7d1f897.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"482921","textColor2":"2f1d1a","textColor4":"553128","textColor1":"1f1311","bgColor":"ed8060","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/56/b0/7b/56b07bf6-3d41-161e-431c-28ddc0f9f99d/a714b578-574f-4cef-9e7d-629d9323f6ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"412118","textColor2":"2d1813","textColor4":"56291c","textColor1":"130f0e","bgColor":"fc6c42","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/storm/964226850","name":"NYE 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Storm","editorialNotes":{"standard":"The iconic DJ holds it down for the junglist massive.\n\nDance music has never been more diverse, more inclusive, or more representative of the people actually making (and moving to) the music than it is right now.

The song imagines Willie looking back on his improbable life, from young musician raised in poverty by his grandparents in Abbott, Texas, to hard-working legend who’s still eager to get on the bus at 90: “They say people my age are expected to fade,” Micah sings, “Well, I’m afraid I’ve let them down.” The moment proves that <i>Long Story Short</i> is not just another tribute album: It’s a thoughtful testament to one of America’s greatest artists, and it proves Nelson can outsing just about anybody into his 10th decade. Fifty-three tracks distilled from four hours of performances each night by Nelson’s greatest living contemporaries and acolytes, it’s also a souvenir from an extremely well-attended birthday party.\n\nBilly Strings kicks off the celebration with “Whiskey River,” channeling Nelson and Family’s late-’70s performance with fiery picking and harmonica. Charley Crockett steps into 1971’s “Yesterday’s Wine” like a pair of old boots, crooning over gorgeous pedal steel and fiddle. Allison Russell and Norah Jones team up for “Seven Spanish Angels,” a gospel classic Nelson recorded with Ray Charles.\n\nBut it’s Nelson’s appearance midway through that kicks things to another gear. He reunites with Booker T. Jones for “Stardust,” the Hoagy Carmichael standard the two included on Nelson’s album of the same name. He teams up with Buddy Cannon, another longtime collaborator who has produced more than a dozen of his recent albums, for “Something You Get Through,” an overlooked gem from 2018’s <i>Last Man Standing</i>. Nelson and Sheryl Crow deliver a gorgeous take on “Far Away Places,” the 1948 standard written by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer. \n\nNelson admits before the performance that he doesn’t know the key; by the end he’s improvising lines with Crow, adding new dimensions to the well-known classic. After more friends and luminaries, including Neil Young, Keith Richards, and Bob Weir, everyone takes the stage for “Happy Birthday.” Even though the group is singing for him, Nelson doesn’t step away from the mic. He sings it along with everyone else.

Whether or not you accept that statement as true, at least in his case, there’s a strong argument to be made for the Puerto Rican rapper/reggaetonero’s <i>El Príncipe</i>. Originally released in 2009, that full-length debut’s legacy has endured and expanded over the years, particularly as Latin hip-hop’s global footprint grew beyond regional popularity into international ubiquity. Though he recalls being somewhat shocked by the success of its single “Prrrum” (“When I saw it on the tracklist I was like, ‘Yo, what is going on? This was a joke that I did!’”), he nonetheless maintains an affinity and affection for the album and what it did for his career. \n\nThat said, it took a lot for Cosculluela to decide some 14 years later to release a sequel. Born out of a criminal case that left him restless and confined to what he describes as a farm in the Puerto Rican countryside, <i>El Príncipe 2</i> finds him not merely returning to the well of his beloved earlier work, but reflecting upon himself and his craft with a newfound creative energy. Recording largely by himself in this tranquil setting was a stark contrast with his years of having an entire posse of friends and associates in the studio. “The vibe was perfect,” he says. “Sometimes you got to say, I want to work, get everybody out the studio. I want to see how I'm singing now.” \n\nWith a guest list including Chencho Corleone, Ozuna, and Luar La L, the resulting 20 tracks here include some of the strongest and most honest work of his discography. What fans might find most surprising is the lack of tiraeras, something he acknowledges he was very much known for. “Everybody wants me to beef, and I'm tired of it, bro,” he says. “You don't know what this comes with. I'm not dissing nobody; I’m just giving you music.” Read on to learn the details behind some of the album’s highlights—in Cosculluela’s own words.\n\n<b>“TLD”</b>\n“I consider myself humble, but if you mess with me—everybody got a limit. These are the perfect verses for people when they start listening to the album and say, ‘Damn, the punchlines.’ I was listening to [Meek Mill’s ‘Dreams and Nightmares’] on repeat and I was like, ‘My Lord, I wish I could make something like that.’ I wasn't thinking about that when I made it, but I always listened to that and I always used to think, 'I wish I could make something like that.'”\n\n<b>“Ese Kbrn” (feat. Ozuna)</b>\n“When you got an ankle bracelet, everybody picks up the phone because they're like, ‘Yo, I know you in a situation, bro.’ Ozuna, he's a star and he always wanted to collaborate with me. Me too! And we did it!”\n\n<b>“Mi Pistola” (feat. Luar La L)</b>\n“I made 30-something tracks. Everybody wanted to jump on <i>El Príncipe 2</i> from the new generation. I said I'm going to put the Luar one out and I kept the other ones for whatever comes after this.”\n\n<b>“Les Ninnos”</b>\n“I did this song for my kids, when my dad passed away. I was really close to my dad, but when my dad was passing away, I had a son being born at the same time. That sounds really crazy, because you're thanking God for your son, but at the same time it was like, your dad's sick, boom—couple of days. I started it for that son of mine especially. This kid, he’s the same as my dad. He got the same eyes, he got the same looks, he got everything like my dad. That emptiness that I felt when my dad passed away, that kid, he filled it up. It was like my dad's in him.”\n","short":"A sequel 14 years in the making from a reggaetón giant."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/fb/cb/9c/fbcb9cdf-04ff-472c-e0ac-e7d7c04190a7/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b78064","textColor2":"dd8c63","textColor4":"b3754f","textColor1":"e39a7d","bgColor":"081700","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-pr%C3%ADncipe-2/1721435035","playParams":{"id":"1721435035","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5U3A4CCnKzp3vtWbIqAzNO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721435035/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"76538401","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/76538401?l=en-US"}]}}},"1721441202":{"id":"1721441202","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721441202?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/5e/39/f9/5e39f902-3487-cc5d-4f79-3850309cd165/f1acd886-5e5b-4c81-ba2e-cb8e806875f8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"40393c","textColor2":"0e0909","textColor4":"3e3a3a","textColor1":"10080b","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/a1/5c/b4/a15cb476-1f75-74c8-d0f6-c218aa1a343c/ee94e6cc-8579-419f-9ae0-6f15b81ed29c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c76591","textColor2":"f565a5","textColor4":"c45485","textColor1":"f779b3","bgColor":"041205","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nicki-minaj/278464538","name":"Pink Friday 2 (Gag City Deluxe)","artistName":"Nicki Minaj","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4800,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ce/84/6e/ce846efa-372b-eba4-959c-dd43bb760924/23UM1IM66574.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4800,"textColor3":"cc7a95","textColor2":"e763bb","textColor4":"bc5199","textColor1":"fb97b6","bgColor":"110612","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After delays, teases, rumors, and more, Nicki Minaj’s epic and much-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s <i>Queen</i> arrives to close out 2023 in style. At 22 tracks and over 70 minutes, the epic project features Minaj tag-teaming with fellow global stars like J. Cole, Drake, Future, Lil Wayne, and Lil Uzi Vert—that is, when she’s not aiming for the throne on solo cuts. \n\nLike 2010’s <i>Pink Friday</i> (Minaj’s debut album), <i>Pink Friday 2</i> features Minaj showcasing the various ways she can carry a track. On some songs, she brings out her best bars, unloading clever one-liners and technically flashy verses. On the album’s second track, “Barbie Dangerous,” Minaj spits over a hypnotizing piano melody and drums that hit like a punch in the gut. Switching between a smooth, controlled flow and a vicious double-time delivery, Minaj is in full control of the song’s dynamics from beginning to end. She makes her claim as one of rap’s great innovators, spitting, “Name a rapper that can channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear/Ho, I’m mother of the year/Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make ’em disappear/But to me, it's just another year.”\n\nOn “Nicki Hendrix,” she teams up with Future and taps into his toxic vulnerability, writing a song of love and love lost that would fit nicely into her collaborator’s catalog. At her best, Nicki is uninhibited by style, substance, or delivery. She raps, “Baby, did you think there were a million mes?/I guess I underestimated you too.” Whether engaging in a street cypher with J.

The slick shakers and basslines of amapiano carry opener “Ololufe,” featuring former mentor Wande Coal, but it’s the fierce back and forth with Zanku Records wildchild Zlatan (on “IDK”) that delivers the best pairing for Wizzy.
