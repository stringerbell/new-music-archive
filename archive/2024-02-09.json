Forever","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Jessica Mauboy","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Jessica Mauboy regards her fifth studio album, <i>Yours Forever</i>, as a full-circle moment. “I remember the moment that I started writing my first album [2008’s <i>Been Waiting</i>] and the excitement: ‘I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know how people are going to react,’” she tells Apple Music. “That’s how I felt about <i>Yours Forever</i>.”\n\nKey to that sense was Mauboy’s decision to branch out and collaborate with songwriters and producers with whom she’d never worked, with the likes of Meg Mac, WILSN, GRAACE, and Nick Littlemore (Empire of the Sun/PNAU) featuring alongside regular collaborators such as P.J. Harding and the production team DNA.\n\n“Nick is such an inspiration,” says the proud Kuku Yalanji and Wakaman woman. “He really got me out of my comfort zone, to not feel afraid, to not beat myself down because I’ve gotten it wrong, which I have a tendency to do, particularly in writing. I’m very critical of myself. But when I was in the room with him, that all fell away. He was like, ‘I don’t care how great a singer you are, I want to be able to hear what you’re saying. What are you trying to say? And who are you saying it to?’ That to me felt completely naked and raw. It was like going back to the basics of just starting again and not being too critical of myself.”\n\nThe collaborations pushed Mauboy to explore new sounds, even incorporating elements of indie pop (the Mac-penned “Whitney”) into her trademark pop-R&B-dance output. Here, Mauboy takes Apple Music through <i>Yours Forever</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Yours Forever”</b>\n“It was one of the last songs I wrote for the album. [I grew up] in an Indonesian Uniting Church that my father and his father and his mother helped build in Darwin. And culturally and religiously, that was something I was brought up to do­—there was always prayer involved. There was gratitude, love, and kindness. That’s something that I have brought into my adult years, and that comforts me and makes me feel safe. ‘Yours Forever’ feels like opening a door to this sphere of emotion and thought and reflection—it makes sense as an opening hymn or a prayer. That’s how I start my day. Why wouldn’t I put that at the beginning?”\n\n<b>“Underwater”</b>\n“I think this is one of my greatest performances I’ve ever done in a song. I [wanted] to be able to deliver what love feels like to me, like what’s my interpretation of how love feels. Whether it comes from my love for my parents, the love for my husband, what does that love feel like when it’s kind of a tug of war? When you feel pressured or you feel scared of love—I’m scared if I show you my love and I don’t get that back.” \n\n<b>“The Loneliest I Ever Was”</b>\n“In my life [in the] music business, it was the first time of really owning my words and my sense of purpose. My craft means a lot to me, and I don’t want to be gaslit. It happens everywhere, to be gaslit or to be made to feel like you can’t really be yourself, and over time you become small and vulnerable and your words aren’t really being heard. This song is about how I’ve been able to maneuver or really survive in the music industry and to stay afloat. It was something that I felt so relieved to say: ‘I’m not taking any shit and I’m fighting for my words.’”\n\n<b>“Flashback”</b>\n“It’s really going back to the first time I met my partner. He was totally not my type, but when I got to know him and started to see him I was like, ‘Does he have to be my type?’ ‘Flashback’ is totally like episodes of our love—our love that was sometimes broken, sometimes confused, then becoming like, ‘I’m going to be that person there for you, I want to take care of you no matter what.’”\n\n<b>“Quite Like You”</b>\n“[It’s] like meeting your first love or your first friend that you didn’t know you were going to have this experience [with]. ‘Quite Like You’ is a dedication to that first greeting, and I think it’s a wonderful thing because when you first meet someone, there’s a sense of, you hold your own, but little by little, the more that you’re invited or the more that you’re close to this person, the more those things start to layer. I think this is a great message, which is to not fear that. The more that I stick around, the more I’m putting down these walls, I know there’s something really special about that. It’s just being thankful for you, grateful for you.”\n\n<b>“Give You Love” (feat. Jason Derulo)</b>\n“When I first heard this song, and I first started working with WILSN, I really got it. When people are distraught, or they feel their lowest, and they can’t quite figure out how to begin again—where to put their first step, or to put their hand out. I’ve seen that quite a lot in my own family, and in my community, they’re too scared to ask for help. So when I first heard it I was like, ‘I know this feeling, because I see it with my own mob.’ No one asks for help when really they’re screaming and needing it. This song is a dedication to anyone who feels that, to not feel alone.”\n\n<b>“Whitney”</b>\n“‘Whitney’ was the development of my childhood, growing up with five sisters in this chaotic house, and being full of dreams—this chaotic house that’s full of dreams. This song really transported me back to being a little girl, writing in her diary, wanting to be just like Britney and Whitney. Dreaming that one day they would see me either singing my songs or their songs.”\n\n<b>“Tell ’Em”</b>\n“There were songs like ‘Tell ’Em’ when I was growing up—activate your worth, know who you are, and don’t be afraid to go out there and show your ability in this world that has so many opportunities, and you’re able to fit right into it—and I wanted to write my own. The whole thought process of the story [is] about the youth, particularly troubled youth, and kids that don’t have the same advantages as other kids. I want the kids I know that are growing up today to have their ‘go out there and tell ’em, tell ’em your worth and tell them you got this’ song. Work hard. Don’t just say it, but act on it.”\n\n<b>“Forget You”</b> \n“This is such a fun song. It’s in your face. It’s like, ‘I am going to own my shit. And you’re not going to leave with any of it.’ I really wanted to make it fun, and the feel is kind of ‘Aretha Franklin mama’ but [with] the influence of that pop production. It really takes me back to doing my pop stuff, and I love making pop music. It just has this whole different spark of energy that really makes me shine.”\n\n<b>“I’m Sorry”</b>\n“Working with David [Musumeci] and Anthony [Egizii], the DNA boys, is always fun, but this really took a turn because I didn’t know I was going to write something so not-pop with them. I just said to Ant, ‘I want to say I’m sorry.’ My heart feels apologetic and maybe has been for a long time. I think it was the frustration of feeling apologetic, which is such a shitty feeling because it may not have been your fault. But somehow you’re the one paying for it, and you’re the one who now needs to apologize for something you didn’t do. And it’s that frustration of like, I’m gonna be the bigger person. But also, if there was no tomorrow I wouldn’t want to wish any harm on anybody. Regardless of the disagreement or the unfairness, I wouldn’t want to feel like that towards anyone and have that be left unsaid.”\n\n<b>“Little Too Late” (feat. Miiesha)</b> \n“This song means so much to [Miiesha and I] individually, on our path, on our journey, to remain strong. Behind this idea of a love story—you told me I was too early and now you’re too late—I think it means really standing your ground and being lifted by something that you didn’t know could lift you so high and bring you back. I think the message within this song is just, ‘You’re back on your feet and you’re heading in the right direction.’”\n\n<b>“Goodbye”</b>\n“[When you] let go of something you’ve been building, the hardest thing to wrap your mind around is that you have to let that all go and start anew. I really know what that feels like, to almost have to start again, particularly with music, and wrap my head around [the fact that] the stuff I was doing isn’t going to be the same, the people that I’m working with are not going to be the same. This whole new space is challenging me and it’s freaking scary, and how do I say goodbye to all of that? Now my focus and my heart and soul and spirit has to begin anew. What does it look like? Where’s that going?”\n\n<b>“Never Giving Up”</b>\n“‘Never Giving Up’ takes part in my own personal resilience of ‘I’m gonna get through this. I know what the question is, I don’t know what the answer is, but I’m just going to lead by [putting] one foot in front of the other and really feel those feelings out.’ And when it feels too much, I will step back and review. But I certainly know who I am, and I’m trying. I think it’s a song that just says, ‘I’m doing the best I can.’” \n\n<b>“Yours Forever & Ever”</b>\n“I wanted a bookend [to the album]. I wanted something to feel like it kept going, as a prayer does. It helps you through your day. And then when you come home, you might do another prayer, meditation, to have it not be resolved. When I split [the song ‘Yours Forever’] that way it was like, well, I don’t want just half of the song at the beginning [of the album]. And I don’t want half of the song at the end. Let’s have it a full song. But then I do a variation, and we’ll do just a little bit at the end and kind of fade. It keeps going and it’s unresolved.”","short":"“I think this is one of my greatest performances.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/43/e0/0f/43e00fc4-5119-10c0-9624-b85b7dffbba8/5054197754463.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca9369","textColor2":"e98d57","textColor4":"c47347","textColor1":"f1b582","bgColor":"2e0a05","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yours-forever/1696907305","playParams":{"id":"1696907305","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2L08li5KwgPx7BZO354BlK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1696907305/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"206609549","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/206609549?l=en-US"}]}}},"1701798763":{"id":"1701798763","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1701798763?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/oh-caroline/1595882091","name":"Monochrome","artistName":"oh caroline","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/6e/95/21/6e95210d-758d-0bf1-0577-1e6f2ed078f9/4062548067941.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b0b3a7","textColor2":"d1d7ce","textColor4":"abb1aa","textColor1":"d8dbca","bgColor":"12171a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/monochrome/1701798763","playParams":{"id":"1701798763","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2K6dix8Cx3UBanEylzyiM1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1701798763/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1595882091","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1595882091?l=en-US"}]}}},"1706228115":{"id":"1706228115","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1706228115?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/declan-mckenna/1009282890","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"What Happened to the Beach?","artistName":"Declan McKenna","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Declan McKenna’s music has always been thought-provoking. Ever since the UK singer-songwriter broke through in 2015 with an indie-pop single about corruption in soccer (“Brazil”), his songs have meditated on big questions. He explored youth alienation, police brutality, and media misrepresentation of the transgender community on 2017 debut <i>What Do You Think About the Car?</i>, before 2020’s <i>Zeros</i> investigated environmental issues, the toxicity of modern life, and class divides. For his third record though, he began to lean into the idea that, sometimes, you can overthink things—that ideas he might previously have dismissed as not serious or focused enough should be pursued. “Maybe in the past, I’ve wanted to think about and plan out what I’m doing,” he tells Apple Music. “But part of what’s sculpted the sound has been following what feels good and what feels right—letting [the album] become itself, not chaining it down, and just going with the flow.”\n\nThat instinctive spirit is strikingly evident on a record that mooches around in psychedelic pop (“Nothing Works,” “Sympathy”) and funk (“Mulholland’s Dinner and Wine”) and recalls Beck at his most loose-limbed and lo-fi (“I Write the News”) and the questing sounds of <i>13</i>-era Blur (“Breath of Light”). That’s not to say McKenna has abandoned his thoughtful perspective on the world though. Here, he’s asking questions about the very modern phenomena of truth and its online manipulation, phone dependency, and the contrasts between your authentic self and the person you present to the world. It’s just that, this time, he’s been more abstract and spontaneous in his lyrics, opening up opportunities for listeners to forge their own interpretations. “That is quite a natural thing when you’re working on music,” he says. “You’ve created a backdrop for a track and you start riffing little ideas that align. It’s very natural to come out with things that feel in that world and shape them into what feels like a weird story that has a simple message at the heart of it. That’s what a lot of the music I listen to does. Sometimes I find out what the lyrics mean and I’m like, ‘What the heck?’ because you kind of build your own little world and that’s maybe what this album does. It’s not just all fun and games. There’s little moments where the vulnerability cuts through and I think that’s really nice as well. Feels human.” Step further into the world of <i>What Happened to the Beach?</i> with Declan McKenna’s track-by-track guide.\n\n<b>“WOBBLE”</b>\n“I wrote ‘WOBBLE’ with Neil Comber, who’s someone I’ve worked with a lot over the years. He played those drums that are really jagged and weird, and this guitar part, which is probably one of my favorite guitar parts I’ve ever written, just came out. It came out of a period where it was still a little bit restricted in terms of going out, seeing people, and stuff [after lockdown]. But we were able to get into the studio, me and Neil, so it has this bit of sweetness to it. It does feel like something being a bit unleashed. It feels like the biggest step into the world of the new album because it combines a lot of things which are at the heart of it: the balance of emotions, the melancholy, but also the really playful ideas. The main thing, which I feel was at the heart of the album, was having this human and organic-feeling stuff combined with digital recording process and digital sounds.”\n\n<b>“Elevator Hum”</b>\n“It’s a real statement piece for the album. I almost originally thought it might be the first song on the album because it’s kind of asking you to open up and just let go while you’re listening to the album. ‘I want you to believe/You’re just like me,’ to become one with me right now. There’s something really freeing about the song.”\n\n<b>“I Write the News”</b>\n“I wrote it in my sister’s old room at my parents’ house when I was there for a bit during one of the lockdowns. I’d decided that her old room would be my studio. I just had an acoustic guitar and my laptop really. I think I was spending a lot of time looking online or reading stuff on Twitter [now X] and seeing a lot of arguments that had no way of reaching any kind of goal because everyone’s got their own version of the truth and their own idea of what’s real. A lot of the time it feels like there’s no unifying truth anymore and multiple different people can just—outside of opinion—believe that the facts are different on different issues. It’s a really, really bizarre thing to watch. So I came up with the idea to write a song where I’m going, ‘I write the news and this is what’s going on.’ It’s like, ‘I write the news.’ ‘No, I write the news.’ It’s stayed quite similar to the original demo I made with my phone—I think the iPhone recording is still what’s on the record for that first section.”\n\n<b>“Sympathy”</b>\n“It’s funny how it follows on from ‘I Write the News.’ I mean, it’s completely intentional, but it has the opposite side of things, like, you don’t need to be clever, you don’t need to show everyone how smart you are, open up and listen to each other and to your mind. Find some value in that. It’s a bit peace-and-love and I can imagine some people might see it as a little idealistic. But that’s what this album’s all about: those simple ideas that can still be very powerful.”\n\n<b>“Mulholland’s Dinner and Wine”</b>\n“I didn’t really know about Mulholland Drive when I went to L.A. [to record with producer Luca Buccellati in 2022], but I did know about Mulholland Wines [a liquor store in Hove, on England’s south coast]. The idea came together when we were driving around L.A. and pointing out things to draw inspiration from. So we got the golf carts, we got Mulholland Drive, we got this sort of weird, cool-guy party talk and stuff like that, which we observed at different parties. And it became a song that isn’t really set in one place or the other, but draws inspiration from both. I guess it feels more L.A. than Hove, but I liked it being based around an off licence [liquor store]. L.A. is such an interesting big place and there’s so many people searching for something there. And that’s really what ‘Mulholland’s…’ is—searching for good in the wrong places.”\n\n<b>“Breath of Light”</b>\n“It was just a weird little jam that me and my friend Jake Passmore did together and, gradually over time, it kind of formed into a song. We had these goblin-ish chants going on and these weird sounds and it was a gradual combination of ideas over time that went into what it is. Now it just feels like a song from Hell, a big chant or someone being pulled down to Hell. The lyrics are almost saying, ‘Welcome to Hell.’”\n\n<b>“Nothing Works”</b>\n“It started in L.A. with Luca, the chorus and pre-chorus. When I was back working on some stuff in the UK, I had Jake in the studio and we started writing the verse for it. The conversation that was being had at the time [in L.A.] was about what the singles were going to be on the album [and whether he wanted to add something more reminiscent of his previous records to the album]. But I already thought there were singles, because the album was pretty much done in my eyes. I was happy with what was there. I guess there can sometimes be a bit of fear if you’re moving on from an older sound, people might not want to listen to it or people might need the same sort of ideas to latch onto. But it doesn’t make any sense because, as a lover of music myself, I just want people to express themselves in as free a way as possible because you want to hear something you haven’t heard before, at the end of the day. So that was quite a direct moment for the album because it was putting a full stop on the end of it and being like, ‘Right, we’re done now.’”\n\n<b>“The Phantom Buzz (Kick In)”</b>\n“The inspiration came from the feeling that your phone is buzzing but it’s not. It was almost turning it into a disease or something, like, ‘I’ve got the phantom buzz.’ I think I had a lot of time on my hands at home working on different ideas and this one came out—and for a sort of erratic tune as it is, it needed a weird lyrical idea.”\n\n<b>“Honest Test”</b>\n“It feels like a love song, I guess. And it was quite spontaneously written. Quite a lot of the lyrics just jumped out, a lot of this album really just jumped out of me and I didn’t really think about it too much because it felt really good.”\n\n<b>“Mezzanine”</b>\n“This took a really long time. It came from a dance track me and my friend Will Bishop made quite a while ago with this saxophone/trumpet/Mellotron riff. And gradually, through various things, it became ‘Mezzanine.’ It’s one of the ones that jumps from world to world because it was really the amalgamation of lots of different ideas and pulling them all together. It’s got the dreamy essence of the record. Maybe it’s friends with ‘Elevator Hum’ in that way.”\n\n<b>“It’s an Act”</b>\n“It just felt like the album needed something like this to ground it and bring it down to earth at the end. It leaves you with a really different note. A little bit like ‘Nothing Works,’ it’s a look behind everything else. Sometimes I think in performance, as in life, it can kind of all just feel like a bit of an act or you’re sort of putting your face on to do what you’re doing. It came out of a time where I was thinking about that a lot and feeling perhaps it was quite hard to really feel like I was being myself. I think a lot of artists get that, whether it’s, as I say, on stage or just being around in life really, it’s a constant feeling sometimes. So it’s a sadder one, but it’s nice to sort of bring it to that point. And it felt important to the record.”\n\n<b>“4 More Years”</b>\n“[The title wasn’t originally in reference to upcoming elections], I actually wrote it when England got knocked out of the [2022] World Cup. And that was it really. But it feels like more than that [now]. Sometimes you’ve just got to take the inspiration when it jumps out and maybe it then doesn’t feel like that on the record, but serves a different purpose.”","short":"“This album’s all about those

HOME","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"USHER","editorialNotes":{"standard":"There’s a reason why USHER’s legions of fans call him the King of R&B: He’s been making hits for 30 years, since his self-titled debut album arrived in 1994; achieved diamond certification for his fourth album, <i>Confessions</i>; hosted a long-running Vegas residency; and landed the 2024 Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. USHER’s accomplishments, creative and otherwise, should be enough to allow him to rest on his laurels, but instead, in the lead-up to that halftime show performance, he enters his next era with <i>COMING HOME</i>.\n\nUSHER’s ninth album is a return to his roots and a celebration of his legacy. It’s also his first project as an independent artist, and it reunites him with longtime collaborator L.A. Reid, who signed him at 14. (<i>COMING HOME</i> also features frequent collaborators Johnta Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Bryan-Michael Cox.) “I’ve been coming home in a lot of different ways,” USHER tells Apple Music. “The choice of music and reconnection to some of the people I’ve worked with from my past and always wanted to work with; writers I’ve actually made hit No. 1 records with. In a sense, I’m coming home because I’m in that comfortable space.” \n\nThe album, he says, “is a love letter to the experience that I have as a man. It’s filled with romance.” Across 20 tracks, USHER narrates vignettes of love, lust, love lost, and everything in between. On the opening title track—which also features Nigerian singer-songwriter Burna Boy—he longs to return home to his lover after being on tour. He teams up with Summer Walker and 21 Savage on “Good Good,” in which the trio deals with an amicable breakup. “‘Good Good’ is not necessarily the most positive, but it is not bad,” USHER explains. “It’s not toxic. It's still a romantic song in the sense that we ain’t got to be enemies. That’s still a romantic way to have a conversation.” But on the tender ballad “Risk It All,” H.E.R. details a romantic journey between two lovers putting it on the line in the name of love. USHER then gets vulnerable on “Room in a Room” as he reflects on the hardships of growing apart within a relationship. \n\nIt's all delivered with dreamy, intoxicating vocals set against bedroom pop, with beats ranging from bouncy (“Kissing Strangers,” “Keep on Dancin’”) to trap (“Cold Blooded”) to Afrobeats (“Ruin”) to new jack swing (“I Love U,” “Please U”). “Love is so central. It’s the source of it all, man,” USHER says. “Love is the thing that makes your heart beat, the thing that moves your spirit. Love is at the center of all things. The love of money, the love of life, and the love of partnership, love of even just a moment, love of connection.”","short":"“COMING HOME is a love letter to the experience that I have as a man.”"},"artwork":{"width":3200,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c6/6f/30/c66f30c0-b733-265c-d5cf-0c0ba6c8e252/dj.uotzsnbz.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3200,"textColor3":"80a0a5","textColor2":"e57630","textColor4":"bc6129","textColor1":"9bc5cb","bgColor":"170f0d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/coming-home/1708795597","playParams":{"id":"1708795597","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/70xOoXrLzPZTRHySJED3q3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1708795597/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15885","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15885?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709596906":{"id":"1709596906","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709596906?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brittany-howard/418598947","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/0d/45/34/0d45348c-fa70-79eb-3a41-d51be6531989/Job2028e181-c7b7-432e-8357-d0c9d44864fc-162700308-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314948245_1680932124-Time1707443070745.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1a1512"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"302425"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"16282f","textColor2":"1a1512","textColor4":"1d3031","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"302425","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/c4/4c/ba/c44cbadc-743b-03bd-cee2-bb0bb77c21f9/08985673-d206-488d-92a7-d6de9679707a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"35383b","textColor2":"2c231a","textColor4":"3e413f","textColor1":"211815","bgColor":"87b9d2","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/b1/ab/f9/b1abf925-09b6-4d6b-ebd8-9baeaf399de2/Jobfa171ee3-c778-423b-8cdb-ed3c01b22edf-162567276-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314610453_1678681585-Time1707262407296.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d0db92","textColor2":"feed4d","textColor4":"d0d558","textColor1":"fff595","bgColor":"167387","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/74/dc/03/74dc0301-f37f-70df-a322-9be40fdca851/2c2cdbee-e4b9-44f1-95aa-222a7ddde90f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d2ca82","textColor2":"f4e47d","textColor4":"d5c571","textColor1":"f0eb92","bgColor":"584941","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/7c/33/0c7c3344-d223-30ff-a472-532d1c0ae783/dbf09b26-7f42-4921-a7eb-14d5614ce293.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c19f74","textColor2":"d5c975","textColor4":"ada461","textColor1":"edc38d","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"What Now","artistName":"Brittany Howard","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“This album is actually an album of questioning. There's a lot of introspection, and within that, I'm answering questions that I've never had the space or capacity to ask,” Brittany Howard tells Apple Music about <i>What Now</i>, the Alabama Shakes singer-guitarist’s second solo album. “I was always so busy, I was always running around, I was on tour, I was preparing this, preparing that. This time I told myself when I would go in there and make songs in my little demo room, ‘No one's ever going to hear this,’ and it was very freeing.”\n\nOf course, people would end up hearing those songs, but that mindset helped Howard write from a brave new perspective. She dives into her personal history and guiding philosophy in a vulnerable way, like she did on 2019’s <i>Jaime</i>, but this time, the instrumental choices are bolder and more unexpected than ever before. “Power to Undo” is a folk-rock tune that showcases the album’s central theme. “You have the power to undo everything that I want/But I won't let you,” she sings. Once that’s revealed, the song descends into an acid-funk freakout, built around scratchy guitars and ramshackle drums. “‘Power to Undo’ is actually about freedoms,” she says. “A lot of people can experience this feeling of ‘I know I shouldn't do that. I know I need to keep moving in this direction.’ It's just about this thing chasing you down, and you're like, ‘No, you're not going to get me, I'm not going to change directions.’”\n\nElsewhere, on “Prove It to You,” Howard cues up gauzy synths and a dance-floor drum groove that’s made for an after-hours. It’s the furthest from the rootsy rock Howard rose to fame with, but the creative risks of <i>What Now</i> suggest an artist more interested in following a muse than replicating past successes. “I am always expanding and evolving and trying new things,” Howard says. “That's the most fun about being a creative person—trying things that challenge you and you don't know anything about.”\n","short":"Her second solo album is finally here, and in immersive Spatial Audio.","tagline":"New Album and

The Japanese pianist’s <i>Bach Transcriptions</i> EP is presented in two contrasting parts, beginning with three gentle tracks, all arrangements by Alexander Siloti. Fujita articulates Bach’s themes with breathtaking technical and dynamic control, their accompaniments rippling effortlessly beneath. \n\nFor the second part, Fujita plays three movements from the Partita No. 3 for solo violin, arranged with rather more poetic license by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Each is a window into Fujita’s lyrical side—most delightful is the impish “Gavotte” although the final “Gigue” combines a sense of drama with a similar unalloyed playfulness.","short":"Playful, enchanting Bach played with consummate control and grace."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/99/2b/3b/992b3bf9-d4d6-f485-bc1f-45c198f36d3e/196871413770.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bebebe","textColor2":"71fc4d","textColor4":"5bca3f","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bach-transcriptions-ep/1712466829","playParams":{"id":"1712466829","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712466829/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"830567222","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/830567222?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713632015":{"id":"1713632015","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713632015?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zara-larsson/570372593","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1a/27/07/1a2707b3-a700-740b-09a4-872d88c7612b/bccb476b-7400-439f-84fe-b5e9dce67314.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9a373","textColor2":"e3a969","textColor4":"c18f58","textColor1":"edc28b","bgColor":"3c2912","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ed/60/f8/ed60f88f-01d2-d0a5-2661-5f5d32ccc6d7/e8258a67-ff8a-4eb3-831c-7643ad774616.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8da7aa","textColor2":"cdae75","textColor4":"a88f61","textColor1":"acccd0","bgColor":"121213","hasP3":false}},"name":"VENUS","artistName":"Zara Larsson","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Zara Larsson learned a lot about herself in the three years leading up to her fourth album. The results manifest on <i>VENUS</i>, a treatise on love in all its forms that marries classic songwriting with off-the-wall experimentation. “It’s been a really, really fun project to do for my personal growth,” Larsson tells Apple Music. “I feel a lot more secure in myself and what I do. I’m not stressed, I’m way more present, I’m thankful for making music. It was actually an amazing experience to do this album.” Amazing experiences aren’t always guaranteed, however, as Larsson can attest. The unprecedented success of 2017’s <i>So Good</i>—the hit parade that introduced Larsson (already a household name in her home country) to the world—had a detrimental impact on the way she approached the 2021 follow up, <i>Poster Girl</i>. “People held me to some kind of standard,” she says. “I felt so pressured to live up to that. I was thinking a lot about what other people were expecting from me and of me. This time, I didn’t feel that pressure. I just focused consciously on the making of the songs, not so much how it’s going to be received, and that really changed how I felt making it.”\n\nHer creative process changed too. The “red thread” tying the project together was a blissful three-way union between producers Rick Nowels (Lana Del Rey, Adele, Lykke Li) and Danja (Britney Spears, Missy Elliott, Madonna), and Larsson herself, alongside a streamlined team of other collaborators including Casey Smith and MNEK. Working closely with Nowels in particular granted her the space she didn’t know she needed to understand and develop her own craft. “I didn’t see myself as a writer. I was just an artist that sometimes writes,” says Larsson. “But Rick really doesn’t want anyone in his studio. One person, two tops. And he expected me to have titles and ideas and come up with chords that I liked. So I had to write, because there was no one else in the room. I realized I do have good ideas and I have a really good ear, and I do trust myself in what I think sounds good.” She is exceedingly proud of the chapter of her life that <i>VENUS</i> punctuates with the enthusiasm of multiple exclamation marks. “I feel like it represents an era, and the core of female energy and empowerment I want to step into,” she says. “I talk a lot about love and I think that is what makes the world go round.” Here, she takes us through more of the album’s themes and inspirations, track by track.\n\n<b>“Can’t Tame Her”</b>\n“I think MNEK is one of my absolute favorite people to work with, we have amazing chemistry in the studio. I’ve learned to stay close to the people that you feel good with. It’s fun and it’s a good way to start off the whole thing. It was released about a year ago now, and it was definitely a different type of vibe, sonically, from what I have done previously. It’s very much like she’s doing whatever she wants, she’s carefree, she’s that girl—which is a good representation of how I felt about making this album. And I have loved to perform it live. I think that’s something that was really important for me to just be like, ‘How will this be in a live show? How will all the songs feel on tour?’ This one gives me so much energy.”\n\n<b>“More Than This Was”</b>\n“I can definitely relate to this song, maybe not right now, but there was a time in my life where I felt maybe that was the one that got away from me…but then I realized it wasn’t. I’m fine! The nice thing about music is that sometimes you just want to feel related to, which is why you put on a sad song when you’re sad. I think you can make an amazing song just being empathetic for a situation in general. You don’t have to be going through it in the moment, because it would just be the cheesiest, corniest album ever if I wrote about how [happy] I feel right now.”\n\n<b>“On My Love” (with David Guetta)</b>\n“My A&R played me the chorus and the opening for this song when we were driving around L.A.. It could just have been really affecting me because it was dance-y and soulful, and the demo singer was absolutely incredible, but I thought it was so amazing. So it was a song that already existed and then I just finished it. I know when they wrote it, they were speaking to the universe and to God—just this very big love. For me, in my life, that is my sister. She’s the biggest love in my life, my oldest friend. We’re so close and we have been our whole lives. I’ve written a lot of songs about her, actually. Love doesn’t have to be romantic. It could also be friends or family, or love for myself and my career, and all these other things that are just as important.”\n\n<b>“Ammunition”</b>\n“This started off as a ballad, funnily enough. We were just in the studio listening through stuff Rick had in his computer and that chorus, originally from Starrah, stuck out. ‘I want to give us a shot/Please give me, give me, give me ammunition’ is such an amazing lyric. Then Danja was like, ‘Let me try some things on this…’ and you can really hear him in there—the drums and the vibe, even that little squeaky ‘give me, give me, give me’ sound. The production is the main character of the track and it has that nostalgic but fresh feel to it. I cannot wait to give you choreo, give you a breakdown, that whole thing. It’s one of my favorites.”\n\n<b>“None of These Guys”</b>\n“This is a song we did with [Swedish production and songwriting duo] MTHR, who also worked on ‘Can’t Tame Her’ and ‘You Love Who You Love.’ It’s so nice when we have a couple of days and we know we’ve done some great songs, so we can just have a little fun and not think about how we’re going to make a radio hit. We were just like, ‘Let’s go to a dirty, sexy club for this one and just talk about how much I love my man.’ I wanted an angle that wasn’t just ‘you’re my baby, you’re my favoUrite’ and I think it’s nice when you get to see a little bit of personality. I’m not a very serious person, so it’s definitely been nice to have songs where I get to be a little sassy and fun, because it’s such a big part of who I am.”\n\n<b>“You Love Who You Love”</b>\n“I’ve been in so many situations where I’ve talked to a friend and I’m just like, ‘Get up. What are you doing? You deserve so much better.’ I also had a relationship with an ex that just went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. One day, we were seeing each other again and he was on my sofa when my sister came home. She just started crying. She was like, ‘I hate him.’ So it’s quite relatable. It’s very desperate, it’s very emotional, and it’s camouflaged by this nostalgic beat and the guitar and how it breaks out into this very pop chorus.”\n\n<b>“End of Time”</b>\n“Casey Smith and Rick Nowels made this album with me and I am really thankful that they were still in the studio writing songs for me even when I wasn’t present. This is one of the songs that came out of that, and I think it’s such a beautiful track. It’s big, existential. In creating the visual world and the video for this song, I wanted to focus on love for myself—loving what I do and believing in myself. That is a love that will be with me for the rest of my life.”\n\n<b>“Nothing”</b>\n“I feel really happy about this track because this is throwing it all the way back to the very start of my career, when I signed to TEN at 15 years old. It was written by Mack [Marcus Sepehrmanesh] who was one of the writers on ‘Uncover’ [Larsson’s debut single, released in 2013], Erik Hassle, who I absolutely adore, and produced by Grizzly, who’s also a TEN Records ‘OG’ for me. We worked on my EPs, before my first album. And it’s just a really good song. It talks about that very relatable feeling, when you just know like, ‘Are we coming to an end? I feel like it’s slipping away from me a little bit. We could sort it out if we would just talk with each other, but you have very low communication skills.’ It’s an eerie feeling.”\n\n<b>“Escape”</b>\n“I think this is just a vibe. It’s very dreamy. I think my personal heaven would just be a very comfy bed. I live my life horizontally when I’m not working. That’s just how I exist—being cosy, a cute little cuddle with my boyfriend. It’s the perfect escape for me. And you don’t actually have to go anywhere.”\n\n<b>“Soundtrack”</b>\n“I have a lot of songs that are like different perfumes for different periods in my life, when I smell it and I’m like, ‘OK, wow, this really brings me back.’ Music is the same. You can encapsulate a whole story and a relationship in just one song that represents all that and it becomes a soundtrack to the life you lived or the memory you made. I get tagged in so many videos and the comments are like, ‘This was the song I ran out to at my graduation’ or ‘this is the song that I got married to.’ When I look back in a year or two, ‘Close to You’ by Absolutely will be the soundtrack to spring 2024 for me—she’s RAYE’s little sister, and she’s so incredibly talented. It’s just so insane when you think about being a part of people’s lives in that way. It’s one of the most beautiful things about being an artist.”\n\n<b>“Venus”</b>\n“She’s a dreamy, dreamy, dreamy girl. It was written by [Welsh singer-songwriter] Violet Skies and Rick when I wasn’t in L.A.. They sent it to me and I felt like the melodies were so beautiful. It’s almost a love song to love itself—the feeling of love, or meeting someone and realizing love could be different, it could change your perspective on what you thought it would feel like to be loved. I just thought it was gorgeous.”\n\n<b>“The Healing”</b>\n“A very soft but very important goodbye. It’s very bold in the sense that it’s not something I would usually do when it comes to the production, or my singing. Sometimes the voice can be camouflaged by the production on a pop song, but with this one you have no choice but to be really close and intimate. Even the way I sing is very pulled back. In real life, I think a big part of starting to love yourself can sometimes come from being loved by someone who really appreciates you. You don’t have to be completely healed, but know what you want and what you need and don’t just throw yourself at the first thing that shows up and looks good. But this is just meant to be for yourself, to go on your healing journey so you can come back as the fullest version of yourself that you can be, and love, even stronger—maybe stepping into a little Venus energy. It’s a nice little reflective sign-off to the album.”","short":"“It represents the core of female energy and empowerment I want to step

When she last checked in on a Drops release (battling through lockdown isolation and a bout of self-doubt to create <i>Drop 6</i> in 2020) Simz was still a year away from <i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</i>, the game-changing album that garnered the long-overdue recognition meritorious of such a singular talent. Undeniably at the top of her game right now, Simz channels that potent self-confidence through the fervent, primal Jakwob production—the powerfully still eye in a storm of commanding drums and reverberating echoes.\n\nOpening track “Mood Swings” foreshadows the pendulum sweep that occurs between “SOS” and “I Ain’t Feelin It,” separating the EP into two neatly opposing halves. The first is front-loaded with heart-pounding, club-ready beats and an untouchable, unrelenting Simz: “Torch” borrows the signature Jersey-bounce squeak, “Fever” marks a return to São Paulo (the setting for 2021’s collaboration between Jakwob and Simz, “Rollin Stone”) for a bilingual, baile-funk-infused flirtation. The back end sees Simz floating her meditations on the less palatable side of success over intricate, yet reserved instrumentation, closing out with “Far Away,” a lovelorn lament that drenches the racing percussion in melancholic piano chords. Whether or not <i>Drop 7</i> is a one-off experiment or an intriguing hint at a new direction, it’s electrifying to experience new facets of Simz’s consummate artistry. She proves herself as compelling as ever.","short":"The superstar rapper’s latest project lands in the middle of the dance

After a guest appearance on Kanye West’s 2021 album <i>Donda</i> introduced him to a wider audience, he broke through to rap superstardom with his 2022 LP <i>B.I.B.L.E.</i>. His 2024 mixtape is both a taste of his ever-evolving sound and a continuation of <i>Pain and Love</i>, an EP from 2019. On the sequel, Fivio celebrates his wins atop drill beats delivered from his hometown of New York. With features from Sheff G, Lil Tjay, Swae Lee, and more, the project is Fivio’s proof that his rise to the top was more than a fluke.\n\nOn the opening cut, “Who Knew,” Fivio raps, “Who knew if I mixed these words with the music, it’d make me a millionaire?” The highs are numerous, but Fivio still remembers the struggles it took to get here. On the Tjay-assisted “Trauma,” Fivio spits, “And I don’t even know who fault it is/But I climbed too far to go and fall to this.” The wins feel good, but Fivio Foreign is acutely aware of what a slippery slope fame can be. On <i>Pain & Love 2</i>, the MC is proud of his accomplishments but knows how much work it takes to maintain success.","short":"The sequel to the NYC rapper’s 2019 EP proves his success is no fluke."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/1b/6f/99/1b6f99eb-d6cf-8a37-7738-fba005fb74b7/196871790215.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8babf","textColor2":"a2c0d7","textColor4":"829aac","textColor1":"fae8ee","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pain-love-2/1728139953","playParams":{"id":"1728139953","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6N4ySRXQsXl6g9mCr7QPFx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728139953/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"967265914","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/967265914?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728316765":{"id":"1728316765","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728316765?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bob-marley-the-wailers/3174628","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"One Love (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Bob Marley & The Wailers","editorialNotes":{"short":"World-changing reggae from the incomparable Tuff Gong."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/cf/64/e5/cf64e5bf-0bb7-288e-b33a-58e1ea80a44a/24UMGIM03301.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b66908","textColor2":"f14812","textColor4":"c13a0e","textColor1":"e4830a","bgColor":"010300","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/one-love-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1728316765","playParams":{"id":"1728316765","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2VbmXDBkPj34TiyMNYaboj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728316765/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3174628","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3174628?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728319305":{"id":"1728319305","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728319305?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/terrace-martin/27522754","name":"Her Thoughts -

Kahan was looking to take a break from the more polished, pop-leaning writing sessions he’d been doing and found himself gravitating towards the music of his childhood. Bon Iver and James Blake were the soundtrack of his long, snowy winters in Vermont, and the term “stick season” refers to the time between autumnal splendor and the season’s first snowfall. For some, this period, with its changing leaves and trick-or-treating in New England, is idyllic. According to Kahan, it’s “super depressing”—but it was also super inspiring.\n\n“It wasn't until I wrote the song ‘Stick Season’ after a session that I realized I was making an album,” Kahan shared with Apple Music’s Hanuman Welch. “I looked back at the rest of the tunes, and they all fit this theme about home and about isolation. Once I had three or four songs that I thought could make up an album, telling the rest of the story became very natural, and a really focused experience. I was really happy to have that narrative through line figured out early on. Those things were present before I finished, which was really nice and helpful to guide the whole process.”\n\nWinters in New England are famously brutal. The sun vanishes, the temperatures plummet, and the world slows to a crawl. Kahan is deeply familiar with this cycle of transition and rebirth, but it wasn’t until much later that he realized how deeply he was impacted by the changing of the seasons. “Every year growing up, my entire family would really, really dread winter coming,” Kahan explains. “I had the worst times in my childhood, in my life, in the wintertime. It was always something that was foreboding, and stick season, in that time between the stunning autumn in Vermont and New Hampshire, became this cold, gray, empty place.” Those experiences are the narrative thread of <i>Stick Season</i>, which unfolds as equal parts eulogy and exhumation—a layer-by-layer cataloging of childhood memories, heartbreak, and resentments toward the claustrophobia of small-town living.\n\n“When I was living at home in Vermont after high school, I was super, super lonely, obviously, but also just kind of socially not developed,” he says. “And then I thought, ‘Man, I'm alone, and that's why I'm feeling all these terrible things.’ I moved to New York City and I felt just as alone there as I had in Vermont. I realized that what was going on was a lot of internal things that I needed to work out, a lot of problems that I had to work on in therapy, and also discover through writing some of the songs about this stuff. Finally, when I started singing about being alone and being out in Vermont, I felt like I could come to terms with some of those things.”","short":"Kahan adds even more new tracks to a third version of his 2022 album.","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"artwork":{"width":3127,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/45/d1/c9/45d1c98b-8753-4e02-ba23-80e0d9bd43cc/24UMGIM07395.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3127,"textColor3":"e3decf","textColor2":"eee8d6","textColor4":"d7ceba","textColor1":"fefcf0","bgColor":"78654a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stick-season-forever/1728501020","playParams":{"id":"1728501020","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0dPy2L0aXHBnPcu9BF5meN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728501020/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"328583953","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/328583953?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728939089":{"id":"1728939089","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728939089?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-02-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/de/b0/ef/deb0efda-c193-ca73-21d8-de4fc0c1bca4/6f5af33d-1263-4432-ba10-b70cfe6c643a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb8b66","textColor2":"f49160","textColor4":"c5754d","textColor1":"e7ac7f","bgColor":"0d0603","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/21/16/cf/2116cf44-d022-5686-15a5-5f8ef8eadacf/f0d58029-d67f-4871-a2ce-c1140baf13b1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c5c5","textColor2":"f5a278","textColor4":"c78564","textColor1":"f0f2f2","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fuerza-regida/1275690475","name":"Dolido Pero No Arrepentido - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fuerza Regida","editorialNotes":{"standard":"California’s own Fuerza Regida held nothing back with 2023’s sprawling <i>Pa Las Baby’s Y Belikeada</i>. Driven by the hits “HARLEY QUINN,” “SABOR FRESA,” and “TQM,” that feature-heavy, 30-track full-length exists in stark contrast with its immediate successor <i>Dolido Pero No Arrepentido</i>. A comparatively back-to-basics affair, this six-song EP strips away the guests to focus on the core strengths of one of the best acts in música mexicana today. \n\nThe spirited opener “Enculado” exudes a distinct bad-boy appeal by way of lead singer Jesus Ortiz Paz (aka JOP) and his knowing vocal delivery. Next, he softens his approach ever so slightly for “Brillarosa,” a confident if inherently romantic cut. A sharper tone of righteousness carries the embittered yet defiant “TÚ NAME,” while closer “PXTXS” finds regret and remorse somewhere near the bottom of a bottle.
