Jerry Goldsmith’s score for <i>The Omen</i> can sound as black metal as Bathory.” \n\nThe metal and orchestral versions of <i>Ihsahn</i>, his eighth solo outing, operate as two parts of a concept album with overlapping storylines. “I wrote them side by side as one piece,” he explains. “The orchestral version is really just a condensed instrumental version of the metal album. To put it bluntly, I tried to write a simulated soundtrack within the context of the full metal arrangement. So, to me, the orchestral version is just a different version of the same music, but it follows a slightly different story with a similar story arc. It’s all very interconnected.”\n\nAs for the storylines themselves? They’re based on the classic hero’s journey found in traditional mythology, but beyond that, Ihsahn would rather not say. “I'm always trying to not give away my story, because it's not that interesting for people to have me superimpose my thoughts on them,” he explains. “People can read the lyrics and kind of piece it together for themselves. I think that is a better value for everybody.” Below, he discusses each track. \n\n<b>“Cervus Venator”</b>\n“This is a purely orchestral piece, like an introduction, and the title roughly translates to ‘Deer Hunter.’ And, of course, you see the antlers in the artwork and the videos, so this is kind of a hint to the secondary story that follows the narrative of the orchestral album. In that respect it's the real beginning of our protagonist's trajectory, a dreamlike state before the first track kicks in.”\n\n<b>“The Promethean Spark”</b>\n“We are at the start of the story, and the Promethean thing of course hints to Greek mythology. There’s a lot of Greek references with Dionysus and Apollo throughout the album. The story of Prometheus is something akin to the story of Lucifer or the outsider element that gives you a new perspective. It opens your eyes to something more. This is the starting point for the protagonist of this story.” \n\n<b>“Pilgrimage to Oblivion”</b>\n“I'd say this is the most intense and hard song on the album. It’s full of hubris and determination. As the title implies, this is where our protagonist is very decisively starting his journey. It’s a very conscious decision to get out there and challenge yourself, so we’ve got a kind of a violent, challenging approach to this song.”\n\n<b>“Twice Born”</b>\n“Musically, ‘Twice Born’ is also on the harder side. With all the runs and everything, it’s kind of a revolt. There’s a sense of chaos involved in the lyrics. There’s a hint in the title again, this idea of being born again in the sense of discovering yourself anew when exposed to more things in your perceived existence. Like all traditional stories, there’s the potential reward of the journey, but also the danger and pitfalls of such a journey.” \n\n<b>“A Taste of the Ambrosia”</b>\n“This is the first reflective piece, and for the most part a much slower approach given the perspective. As the title implies, this is when you’ve had a taste of something more. It’s the realization that you can’t go back to where you started. It’s a loss of innocence, in a way, but also an experience of value. It’s like with nice cognac or wine, or coffee, for that matter—it’s hard to go back when one has had the good stuff.” \n\n<b>“Anima Extraneae”</b>\n“This is an interlude that also hints at the secondary story. It bleeds in with the orchestral side of things. As you see, the intro and outro and this interlude are all Latin titles, hence separating them from the main storyline. But, of course, the two stories bleed into each other. ‘Anima Extraneae’ translates to something like ‘a strange soul.’ The interlude follows the reflection of the last song. You’ve walked away from something and become estranged from what you were and the life you had prior to this. Musically, there’s a romantic sense of peace about it.” \n\n<b>“Blood Trails to Love”</b>\n“Again, there's a small hint in the title. You are exposed to danger; you're exposed to the unpredictable, and suddenly along the way in a typical story like this—and hopefully in our separate lives in general—we experience love. For someone in our protagonist’s position, are they capable of being loved? Have they come too far? Are they too estranged to be loved or even to be connected? There are some dilemmas there.” \n\n<b>“Hubris and Blue Devils”</b>\n“This song is of a more rebellious nature. ‘Blue Devils’ is referenced almost like a hangover, with all the hints of Dionysus and intoxication. There’s this feeling of hubris, like, ‘Fuck it. I’ll go all in, whatever the stakes.’ It reflects also to ‘Twice Born’ in the lyrics, so it’s something like giving up or giving in. There’s this sense of reigniting the same kind of willpower and determination as in ‘Pilgrimage to Oblivion’ in terms of accepting that this is the journey and the path you took.” \n\n<b>“The Distance Between Us”</b>\n“We’re getting into more of a reflective perspective again here. It's like the entire album, both in musical form and the lyrics, has this duality between balance and chaos; the safe, conformed, predictable existence versus the less predictable and more adventurous. ‘The Distance Between Us’ is the more reflective part of creating that distance in this kind of journey. Of course, this is not necessarily a physical journey. You are perhaps distancing yourself from things and people that you would not like to distance yourself from. Every journey has reward and sacrifice.” \n\n<b>“At the Heart of All Things Broken”</b>\n“This is the end of the journey. In my head, this is looking back on having returned and reflecting on the rewards and sacrifices made along the way. The lyrics are in present tense, in contrast to the rest of the record. I am very pleased with the title because it also has this kind of ambiguity to it. There’s ambition and tragedy and hope and loss and love in all of our lives. In the end, you will have to reflect on if you find your existence meaningful. None of us are spared tragedy, I think, but there are really no steps you could have skipped on your journey.” \n\n<b>“Sonata Profana”</b>\n“The title is a direct hint to the actual story that goes into the orchestral piece. Musically, it doesn’t imply a specifically happy ending.”","short":"The Norwegian black metal trailblazer’s latest has an orchestral version.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/6f/2d/2e/6f2d2e66-a38d-ae16-15a3-1ff10261227e/5401148003154_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2b2b2c","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"dbdbdb","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ihsahn/1697520720","playParams":{"id":"1697520720","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/78eWgdCbll6LBKZR696IBE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1697520720/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"152674496","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/152674496?l=en-US"}]}}},"1698595184":{"id":"1698595184","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1698595184?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-02-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/11/8c/e3/118ce3f8-e68e-aae0-b050-7f0059eebf2e/9670da2c-7edf-463b-8653-9f5a7626c819.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d7d7d3","textColor2":"f5f3ee","textColor4":"d4d2ce","textColor1":"f9f9f4","bgColor":"50504e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ihsahn/152674496","name":"IHSAHN (Orchestral Version)","artistName":"Ihsahn","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Black metal trailblazer Ihsahn likes his self-titled solo album so much that he recorded it twice. <i>IHSAHN</i> is available in both metal and orchestral versions, two styles that the Norwegian composer and multi-instrumentalist has been combining since the early ’90s with black metal pioneers Emperor. “To me, black metal is an abstract feeling, an atmosphere,” he tells Apple Music. “It doesn’t rely on any specific sound.

fifth album is a collection of love songs. For singer Joe Talbot, it couldn’t be anything else. “At the time of writing this album, I was quite lost,” he tells Apple Music. “Not musically, it was a beautiful time for music. But emotionally, my nervous system needed organizing, and I needed to sort my shit out. So I did. That came from me realizing that I needed love in my life, and that I had sometimes lost my narrative in the art, which is that love is all I’ve ever sung about.”\n\nFrom a band wearied by other people’s attempts to pin narrow labels like “punk” or “political” to their expansive, thoughtful music, that’s as concise a summary as you’ll get. It’s also an accurate one. The Bristol five-piece’s music has always viewed the world with an empathetic eye, processing the human effects and impulses around subjects as varied as grief, immigration, kindness, toxic masculinity, and anxiety. And on their fourth album, 2021’s <i>CRAWLER</i>, the aggression and sinew of earlier songs gave way to more space and restraint as Talbot turned inward to reckon with his experiences with addiction. \n\nFor <i>TANGK</i>, that experimentation continued while the band’s initial ideas were developed with Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich in London during late 2022, before the record was completed with <i>CRAWLER</i> co-producer Kenny Beats joining the team to record in the south of France. They’ve emerged with an album where an Afrobeat rhythm played out on an obscure drum machine (“Grace”) or a gentle piano melody recorded on an iPhone (“A Gospel”) hit with as much impact as a gale-force guitar riff (“Gift Horse”). Exploring the thrills and the scars of love in multiple forms, Talbot leans ever more into singing over firebrand fury. “I’ve got a kid now, and part of my learning is to have empathy when I parent,” he says. “And with that comes delicacy. To use empathy is a delicate and graceful act. And that’s coming out in my art, because I’m also being delicate and graceful with myself, forgiving myself, and giving myself time to learn. I don’t want to lie.” Discover more with Talbot’s track-by-track guide to <i>TANGK</i>.\n\n<b>“IDEA 01”</b>\n“It was the first thing [guitarist and co-producer Mark] Bowen worked on, and Bowen, being the egotistical maniac that he is, called it ‘IDEA 01’ because he forgot that it was actually idea seven. But, bless him, he does like attention. But, yes, it was the first song that was written in Nigel’s studio. Bowen sat at the piano and started playing, and it was beautiful. ‘IDEA 01’ is different vignettes around old friends that I haven’t seen since Devon [where Talbot grew up], and the relationships I had with them and their families, and how crazy certain people’s families are. Bowen’s beautiful piano part reminded me of this song we wrote on the last album, ‘Kelechi.’ Kelechi was a good friend of mine who sadly passed away, and I hadn’t seen him since I waved him off to move to Manchester with his family. I just had this feeling I was never going to see him again. Maybe I’m writing that in my head now, but he was a beautiful, beautiful man. I loved him. I think maybe if we were still friends, part of me could have helped him, but that’s, again, fantasy I think.”\n\n<b>“Gift Horse”</b>\n“I was trying to get this disco thing going, so I gave Jon [Beavis, drummer] a bunch of disco beats to work on. And Dev [bassist Adam Devonshire] is bang into The Rapture and !!! and LCD Soundsystem, and he turned out that bassline real quick. I wrote a song around it, and it felt great. It was what my intentions of the album were: to make people dance and not think, because love is a very complex thing that doesn’t need to be thought. It can just be acted, and worked on, and danced with. I just wanted to make people move, and get that physicality of the live experience in people’s bones. I had this concept of a gift horse as a theme of a song, and it sang to me. I like that grotesque phrase, ‘Never look a gift horse in the mouth.’ It’s about my daughter, and I’m very grateful for her, and our relationship, and I wanted to write a beast of a tune around her.”\n\n<b>“POP POP POP”</b>\n“I read [‘freudenfreude’] online somewhere. It was like, words that don’t exist that should exist. Schadenfreude is such a dark thing, to enjoy other people’s misery, so the idea of someone enjoying someone else’s joy is great. Being a parent, you suddenly are entwined with someone else’s joys and lows. I love seeing her dance, and have a good time, and grow as a person, and learn, so I wanted to write a song about it.”\n\n<b>“Roy”</b>\n“It’s an allegorical story that sums up a lot of my behavior towards my partners over a 15-year period where I was in a cycle of absolute worship and then fear, jealousy and assholery. I wanted to dedicate it to my girlfriend, who I call Roy. She’s not called Roy. I wanted it to be about the idea of a man who is in love and then his fears take over, and he starts acting like a prick to push that person away. Then he wakes up in the morning with a horrible hangover, realizing what he’s done, and he apologizes. He is then forgiven in the chorus, and rejoicing ensues.”\n\n<b>“A Gospel”</b>\n“It’s a reflection on breakups, which I think are a learning curve. I think all my exes deserve a medal, and they’ve taught me a lot. It’s really a tender moment of a dream I used to have, then [it] dances between different tiny memories, tiny vignettes of what happened before, and me just giving a nod to those moments and saying goodbye, which is beautiful. No heartbreak, really. I’ve been through the heartbreak now. It’s just me smiling and being like, ‘Yeah, you were right. Thank you very much.’”\n\n<b>“Dancer” (with LCD Soundsystem)</b>\n“The best form of dance is to express yourself freely within a group who are also expressing themselves freely, the true embodiment of communion. The last time I had this sense of euphoria from that was an Oh Sees gig at the [Sala] Apolo in Barcelona. I closed my eyes and let the mosh push me from one side of the room to the other and back. I didn’t open my eyes once, I just smiled and was carried by this organism of beautiful rage. Dancing’s a really big part of my personality. I love it. My mum always danced. Even in her most ill days [Talbot’s mother passed away during the recording of 2017 debut <i>Brutalism</i>], she would always get up and dance, and enjoy herself. I dance with my daughter every day that I have her. I think it’s magic and important.”\n\n<b>“Grace”</b>\n“It all came out of nowhere. I had this beat in mind for a while—I was thinking of an aggro Afrobeat kind of track. But it didn’t come out like that. It came out like what happens when Nigel Godrich gets his hands on your Afrobeat stuff. I asked Nigel to make the beat, and he chose the LinnDrum [’80s drum machine]. The LinnDrum changes the sound of a beat, the tone of a drum, the cadence of a beat, it changed the beat completely. It’s a very, very delicate thing, a beat. It sounded like a different song to me. It sounded amazing. And that’s where the bassline came from. And then that’s where the vocals came from. It felt a bit uneasy for a long time because it came out of nowhere. Me and Bowen were like, ‘Is this right? Is this complete?’ I think it just has to feel like you, like it is part of you and what you mean at the moment, that’s all. An album’s an episode of where you’re at in the world in that point in time.”\n\n<b>“Hall & Oates”</b>\n“I wanted to write a glam-rock pounder about falling in love with your boys. My ex and I used to joke about this thing where you make love to someone for the first time, and then the next day, you’re walking on air, and it feels like Hall & Oates is playing. The birds are singing, you’re bouncing around and everything’s great. I wanted to use that analogy for when you make friends with someone for the first time, and they make you feel good, lighter, stronger, excited to see them again. And that’s what happened in lockdown: I made friends with [Bristol-based singer-songwriter] Willie J Healey and my mate Ben, and we went on bike rides whenever we could, getting out and feeling good post-lockdown. It gave me a sense of purpose again. It felt like I was falling in love.”\n\n<b>“Jungle”</b>\n“I was trying to write a jungle tune for ages. The guitar line was a jungle bassline that I had but it just never fit what we were writing. And then Bowen started playing the chords on the guitar and it transformed it into something completely different. It completely revitalized what I’d been dragging through the mud for five years. Bowen made it IDLES, made it real, made it believable, made it beautiful. And then it reminded me of getting nicked, so I wrote a song about different times that I’ve been in trouble.”\n\n<b>“Gratitude”</b>\n“This was a real struggle. Bowen was really obsessed about doing interesting counts with the beats. I just wanted to make people dance and create infectious beats. We were coming from very different angles, but we loved this song that Bowen had made. I was like, ‘I get it, Bowen. This is insane. I love it, but I can’t get it.’ We hung on to it for ages, and then Nigel really helped us out, he created spaces and bits here and there by turning things down and moving everything slightly. Then Kenny helped me out, and got rid of the stupid counts, I think, and helped me write it on a 4/4 beat. And then they changed it back. I just come in in weird places. Everyone chipped in, because everyone believed in the song.”\n\n<b>“Monolith”</b>\n“I was fascinated by films where four or five notes are repeated throughout and create this monolithic motif. There’s a sense of continuity but the mood changes depending on certain things like tone and instruments. I wanted to do that over a song, and we got our friend Colin [Webster] from [London noise rock unit] Sex Swing to do the sax, we did it on different instruments that Nigel had. Nigel went away and basically put it all through the hollow-body bass. It reminded me of a documentary from a series called <i>The Blues</i> that Martin Scorsese curated. <i>The Soul of a Man</i> [directed by Wim Wenders] is about a song [Blind Willie Johnson’s ‘Dark Was the Night’] getting sent into space. If any aliens get this capsule, they’ll hear this song being played from a blues artist. It created a really beautiful and deep picture in my mind. It felt like this monolith drifting in the ether. I started singing a blues riff behind it, a Skip James kind of thing. I think it’s a beautiful way to finish the album—us drifting in the ether.”","short":"Singer Joe Talbot on album five: “I just wanted to make people move.”","tagline":"New Album and

Paloma Faith started working on new music shortly after splitting from her partner of nine years, the father of her two children, she didn’t expect it to come to much. “I just said, ‘I don’t really want to write an album, I just want to go to the studio and use it as therapy,’” the singer-songwriter, born Paloma Faith Blomfield, tells Apple Music. “I sort of anticipated it would be the worst music I’d ever written, because usually when you are in the midst of anything, it’s really difficult to be creative. But people were like, ‘This is really good. Keep going.’” And as she did, her sixth studio album <i>The Glorification of Sadness</i> began to emerge, its tracklisting a beat-by-beat exploration of the myriad emotions she was weathering at the time. “It was a document of the stages of grief,” says Faith. “It was written over a year from the impact of the first initial shock, so it was naturally going through all of those feelings.”\n\nWith raw balladry, keening rock anthems, UKG-powered escapism, and plenty of empowered pop—alongside intimate, diary-entry-like spoken interludes and mantra-like moments that almost feel like Faith is singing herself back to strength—<i>The Glorification of Sadness</i> captures the power of walking away and reclaiming who you are. But also, of course, devastation, anger (on the excellently immature “Eat Shit and Die”), guilt, shame, and, eventually, hope for the future. Making it was cathartic, but it also led to uneasy feelings about commodifying your pain in music and selling it for other people’s pleasure. “It’s quite a sinister relationship between creativity and the consumer,” says Faith, who chose this album’s title based on that exact premise. Yet, you can’t help but feel that this is an album the singer-songwriter <i>had</i> to make, rather than one she really wanted to, to process what she went through in the only way she knows how. And for all its pain, this is also an empowered (and empowering) listen that, at its core, embraces self-acceptance. “It’s accepting that we’re all flawed,” says Faith, who also executive produced the album. “We all make mistakes and we all hurt people. That’s what it’s meant to embody.” Read on as Faith guides us through <i>The Glorification of Sadness</i>, one song at a time.\n\n<b>“Sweatpants”</b>\n“I have felt this is quite a feminist album. It was important to me to get the line ‘when I’m old and no longer young’ in. I’m writing from a perspective of 15 years in the music business. It’s quite rare nowadays for female artists to have a lifetime career and [to] age in front of a public. I think there’s a lot of pressure on women. That line is very considered—but obviously everyone can relate to the sweatpants. We’re just Netflix and chilling with our partners and we don’t look as great as we used to.”\n\n<b>“Pressure”</b>\n“[British singer-songwriter] Liam Bailey introduced me to a load of tracks that Chase & Status had sent him. It was just the chorus at first, but it really spoke to me because it was what I was feeling before the breakup, which was this pressure of being a woman in this post-feminist era. I believe feminism started but kind of abandoned us halfway through its progress. I think quite a lot of women—having children or not—feel burned out by this expectation that we need to be dual people: maternal and kind <i>and</i> high-powered. It was about this pressure that I felt to be all things. I’ve known Kojey Radical [who features on the track] since we were kids. He asked me what the song was about and I said I’d like to get a male perspective because he feels the pressure as well. He wants to be a good father to a son.”\n\n<b>“God in a Dress”</b>\n“Kelsy Karter was one of the people who worked on this song—she’s a brilliant artist. She sent me an original version of this song which was written with her and [US-based producer] Martin Wave, who ended up producing pretty much the whole record. She’s got a real rock energy, sort of like a Joan Jett, Janis Joplin, or Chrissie Hynde—a legendary-rock-woman vibe that I admire. Not all the lyrics were completely applicable to me, so I changed them with her permission. Then, it became this collaboration—this proper female, girl-power collaboration, and a lot of celebrating with one another. It’s the same kind of theme as ‘Pressure,’ but it’s about being empowered rather than put down. It’s about saying, ‘Actually, I am kind of omnipotent.’”\n\n<b>“How You Leave a Man”</b>\n“It’s up and down all the time, but this is the first moment when you’re like, ‘OK, I’m going to do it. I’m going to really challenge myself to get out of this. I’ve been whinging for too long.’ I hate people complaining about stuff and doing nothing about it, and I felt like I’d become that person. It’s daring yourself to do something. That’s what the song’s about. At the time, you feel empowered by the fact that you’ve had the balls to do it. Obviously later in the album, we start worrying whether it is the right thing to do, but I was like, ‘Right, this is it. Empowerment. I don’t need anyone.’ And this song really embodies that.”\n\n<b>“There’s Nothing More Human Than Failure”</b>\n“It was meant to be me reassuring myself and also expressing the guilt and shame. It’s a contrast to the song before where it’s like, ‘I did this and I’m full of empowerment,’ and then it’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve ruined a lot of people’s lives, not just mine and my ex, but there’s kids involved.’ This is a mantra just to remind myself that I’m flawed and that there’s nothing more human than that.”\n\n<b>“Bad Woman”</b>\n“This song is about feeling judged by myself, judged by society, judged by my family that I’d done the absolute worst. People always assume that I’ve been cheated on and that that’s why I left. Because everyone’s got this formula that they subscribe to, that no woman would ever leave a man unless he hit her or cheated on her—those are our permitted exit routes. And if we’re not happy, we should still stay because that’s what the patriarchy tells us. I just thought, ‘Everyone thinks I’m a bad woman because of it.’ It’s about rebelling against the expectation on women to be good. It’s about saying, ‘I actually don’t care. I’m going to be bad. And if it means that I’m happier, then I’m happy for you to all think that I’m bad.’”\n\n<b>“Cry on the Dance Floor”</b>\n“The only one that I didn’t write during this breakup—I wrote it a long time ago. With every album that I did, I was like, ‘I want to put this record out.’ And everyone was always like, ‘No, it’s not right. It doesn’t fit.’ Even for this album. But in the narrative, this is the moment you go out and you are reckless and you drink too much or act irresponsibly. You’ve lost all sense of self-worth [so] that you just don’t even care. I just went full house and garage on it because that’s my background. That’s when I was young and what I was into in the ’90s—I wrote it with MJ Cole who’s a key person in that era.”\n\n<b>“Say My Name”</b>\n“This is the idea that I have lost myself so much and feel so hazy with depression and guilt and sadness. I was also so tired because my kids are really young and they wake up in the night and then I can’t sleep. You have to remember your own identity and also face yourself looking at your own reflection. With an end of a big relationship that defines your identity, and with becoming a parent that then [also] changes your identity, you often feel, as a woman, very lost in all of it. So it is cathartic to be like, ‘This is helping me remember my own identity.’”\n\n<b>“Let It Ride”</b>\n“That’s Maverick Sabre’s backing vocals, and I love him so much. This is another collaboration with Kelsy Karter, the rock queen. This one embodies London nightlife—the dirt and sleaze of it. It reminds me of pre-gentrification Soho, which is kind of where I grew up and where I developed my musical identity. It was like rock and jazz in Soho. It’s another reckless moment.”\n\n<b>“The Big Bang Ending”</b>\n“I think we’ve been cultivated culturally about breakups to be like—I don’t know what word to use—but, ‘Oh, he’s just a bastard.’ Or, ‘What a bitch.’ No, actually it’s even worse in a way when you fundamentally can’t continue—they call it irreconcilable differences—as opposed to something dramatic happening where you could just loathe the person.”\n\n<b>“Eat Shit and Die”</b>\n“That’s the petulant child. It goes from a level of maturity, of ‘We have done couples therapy, we’ve done all of this profound soul-searching,’ [to] ‘You’ve just said something really irritating to me, so I’m going to become a toddler.’ Then you go home like, ‘I feel shit. I know I let myself down. I’d said all these intelligent things and I really got to a place of progress and now I’m acting like a dickhead.’ That’s what this song’s about. Sonically, it’s like a Disney version—it’s supposed to be cynical.”\n\n<b>“Divorce”</b>\n“I don’t know if I’ll get to play this one live because I find it really sad. It feels like the most private version of me on a record I’ve ever put out. I think my vocals are almost closer to my speaking voice. It doesn’t have the theater of my normal persona, Paloma Faith. It’s more like Paloma Blomfield, which is my actual surname. It feels very vulnerable. Also, when I wrote it, it was harrowing and hard and the delivery is very soft. Then I decided that I’d make it even worse and add my children’s voices onto the beginning, which I can barely listen to when I hear it because it’s just them in the garden.”  \n\n<b>“Hate When You’re Happy”</b>\n“When you are still miserable, you imagine that your ex is having a great life and loves being without you. Also, sometimes, we feel like we contribute to our exes becoming the person that we wanted them to be for someone else. Now, you’ve got this new house and you’re doing really well and I just want to burn it all down because it wouldn’t have happened without me.”\n\n<b>“Enjoy Yourself”</b>\n“It’s like the beginning signs of an attempt at trying to see light at the end of the tunnel. When you initially experience grief, it’s constant. Then, there become moments where the gap gets wider and wider and wider. You have moments where you can see this idea of potential or optimism or hope. It is basically saying you’ve got no other option unless you wallow in self-pity forever.”\n\n<b>“I am Enough”</b>\n“I’m somebody who always wants to learn, I don’t want to repeat patterns, and it’s a reflection on that. But also, I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, or maybe my choices have been fueled by insecurity. I’ve always been a high achiever and I think that it’s all fueled by not feeling ‘enough.’ So it is just trying to learn that you might be. I did a lot of therapy around this breakup and one of the things that the therapist said to me is, ‘Why is good enough not good enough?’ My theory has always been exceptional is the only option. So I think it’s about that, and telling yourself about having a relationship with you, rather than attaching yourself to other people or thinking other people might define you.”\n\n<b>“Mirror to Mirror”</b>\n“I wrote notes all the time—some of them were going to turn into lyrics and some of them just didn’t feel like they would, but I still wanted to say them. I think this was one of the notes I wrote when I was writing ‘Say My Name,’ that you find the light or you find some hope in yourself in a way that maybe you’ve never done before. I hadn’t. I still haven’t really. I was working on it.” \n\n<b>“Already Broken”</b>\n“It’s about starting to date other people and feeling like I’ve never dated anybody as a single mum with two kids before. I’ve had a whole lifetime. I wasn’t quite sure how it would work because all the words that we can say to each other, I’ve said them and heard them before and it didn’t work out. I still don’t know the conclusion because I’m not in a relationship, but it was about a time when I was exploring the prospect of having another relationship. I kept saying when I wrote it, it’s sort of like a love song that you play at a second or third wedding when couples have got together after having tried before.”","short":"“It’s accepting we’re all flawed.

Since his 2016 debut EP, <i>blisters</i>, the Baltimore-born singer-songwriter has mastered his mode of gospel music for sinners—midnight music that shimmers like an oil slick, made to soundtrack the megachurch/nightclub hybrid that exists in his wildest fantasies.\n\nHis third album, <i>GRIP</i>, begins in the club: a Black queer love story shown through a cool, controlled, voyeuristic lens. Picture a strobe-lit close-up of a hand placed on a waist, a bead of sweat trembling on a shoulder, as serpent coos over the four-on-the-floor thump of intro “Damn Gloves”: “Hold you closer, closer than those damn gloves/Kiss you longer, longer than an opera.” (He’s joined by frequent collaborator and fellow hedonist Ty Dolla $ign, along with the Cape Town soul singer Yanga YaYa.)\n\nNight

Jennifer Lopez went back into the studio to make what would become <i>This Is Me...Now</i>—the follow-up to her 2002 album that was inspired, in part, by her then-new romance with Ben Affleck—she went back to the original source material: a collection of love letters that he had held on to after they broke up and given to her after they reconciled nearly two decades later. \n\n“He's a writer, so he writes long, beautiful, poetic letters,” Lopez tells Apple Music's Zane Lowe. “I brought them in there, and that really set the tone for everybody [working on the album] to understand what the mission was. We're going to [capture] this feeling of this journey, and what I've learned about love, which I've been searching for my whole life. What is it? What does it mean? Does it exist? We all get sold this bill of goods, like these magical things don't exist in life, and they do. Magic is out there.”\n\nThat’s not to say <i>This Is Me...Now</i> is all loving affirmations and “happy, sunshiny hearts and flowers,” as she puts it—like “Can’t Get Enough,” the album’s flirtatious first single—and fond looks back at the past. “Broken Like Me,” which was inspired by the dissolution of their relationship back in 2004, was particularly difficult for Affleck to hear while she was recording it. In the years they spent apart, Lopez and Affleck found love again, started families, weathered painful breakups, and worked on themselves before they found each other again in different seasons of their lives.\n\n“The whole story has to do with how you get there, and the difficult, really challenging things we have to go through as people to understand ourselves, and to get to a place where we can do the thing that human beings are meant to do in this life, which is love,” she says. “That's the big mission; that's the goal.

Few artists in his chosen genre have captured and cultivated heartache, heartbreak, and happiness quite like the Bronx-born singer. His first album since 2020’s <i>ALTER EGO</i>, the 23-song <i>LLAMADA PERDIDA</i> reinforces that lofty status—even more impressive considering his beloved first album dropped nearly a decade and a half ago.\n\nThose who’ve followed Royce all this time know he can get right to the heart of the matter in short order. Opener “La Corriente” does just that, documenting his descent into a romantic madness. Befitting its blunt title, “Sufro” shows the uglier flip side of that elated state, the pain of lost love as visceral as any physical ailment. Uninhibited sentiments on “Lao’ a Lao’” find their downer counterpoints via “Te Espero” (a duet with Maria Becerra) and “Otra Vez,” these ups and downs so familiar to his fans. \n\nEven still, he experiments freely within the genre format, leading to some of the album’s most compelling moments. He fuses música mexicana elements with his own tropical style on “Cosas de la Peda,” with no less than Gabito Ballesteros by his side. Elsewhere, he calls subtly back to his prior reggaetón escapades on the pensive “¿Cómo Salimos de Este Lío?” and brings an exuberant electronic pop energy to “Morfina.” Occasionally, he’ll deviate from the path altogether, as with the pure ballad “Frío en el Infierno,” yet even those scenic routes inevitably bring him back to the beauty and agony of bachata.","short":"Bachata royalty returns,

(Having pledged to retire the famous ad-lib years ago, he addressed his return to the habit on a talk show in 2020, stating cheekily, “Well, it’s a bigger hit if I sing my name at the front.”) Nearly a decade passed between the Floridian’s fourth album, 2015’s <i>Everything Is 4</i>, and its follow-up, which might explain the sprawling 27-song tracklist that explodes with audacious and occasionally deeply strange choices, like lead single “Spicy Margarita,” a collaboration with Michael Bublé that imagines what Dean Martin might sound like were he to perform at Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival. \n\n<i>Nu King</i> splits the difference between turn-up and heartache, with its fair share of cinematic twists: ’80s-inspired infidelity anthem “Favorite Song” is a wild ride that ends with the audible clank of prison bars. But mostly, the Haitian American singer’s on island time, floating over slow-winding Afro-Caribbean rhythms on tracks like “Ayo Girl” and “Jalebi Baby.” The guest list overflows with heavy hitters: Derulo recruits Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign for the Ol’ Dirty Bastard-referencing “Swalla,” taps YoungBoy Never Broke Again for the gently turnt “Mad Love,” and reprises his Imogen Heap-sampling classic “Whatcha Say” on the Dido flip “When Love Sucks.” \n","short":"His first album in nine years is 27 tracks and packed full of A-list guests.","tagline":"New

The follow-up to the ever-mysterious rapper’s 2023 album, <i>AftërLyfe</i>, is loosely organized around the late-21st-century dystopia in which Yeat apparently already lives: “I’m in 2093, where your life at?” he yelps on the thunderous “Psycho CEO.”\n\nThe Portland rapper’s best known for rapping over rage beats—dark melodies, booming bass, trap drums—but here he occasionally veers into subterranean techno (“Riot & Set it off”) or scuzzy house rhythms, like the strangely addictive title track. Lil Wayne and Future make brief cameos, but Yeat’s most fascinating on his own, left to ponder life’s great mysteries and make cryptic proclamations that future generations of rap scholars might make sense of in the 2090s. “I made every god cry…I know what happens when you die,” he warbles ominously over the decaying thump of “Team ceo.” Somehow, you kinda believe him.","short":"The mysterious
