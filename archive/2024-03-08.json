self-titled 1984 debut album. (They officially formed in 1981 after serving as the road band for Don King.) Since then, they have amassed an eclectic discography of pop country and, later, more traditionally inspired country music, earning a cult following along the way. <i>Desperado Troubadours</i> comes on the heels of both that anniversary and two retrospective projects: a memoir, <i>The Boys and Me: My Life in the Country Music Supergroup Sawyer Brown</i>, by lead singer Mark Miller, and the documentary film <i>Get Me to the Stage on Time</i>. Highlights on <i>Desperado Troubadour</i> include “Nashville Cat,” a spirited and reference-packed tribute to country culture in Music City, and the title track, which offers a romantic look at the life of a traveling musician.","short":"Forty years on from their debut, the band looks forward while looking back.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f8/2e/4f/f82e4f68-1d6d-14ad-fcb2-c33e5fb2d406/194646038968.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccdb7","textColor2":"f2a442","textColor4":"c28638","textColor1":"fefde1","bgColor":"050d10","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/desperado-troubadours/1704064368","playParams":{"id":"1704064368","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7CuqdxnrTONq74VevA1OfC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1704064368/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"889293","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/889293?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709354269":{"id":"1709354269","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709354269?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-03-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/judas-priest/154707","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/c7/57/6e/c7576ef7-3e7e-3384-f958-43d33ed2c99d/0c65ae9d-9c9d-436a-a5c1-331d7cc1a566.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9fa0a2","textColor2":"c9c0ac","textColor4":"a49d8d","textColor1":"c2c4c7","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/fa/20/6c/fa206c54-c2f1-136a-df33-fc89e0505c96/12ceaea4-e66a-4d38-8737-28f77834ce3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb926d","textColor2":"e78056","textColor4":"c16b4b","textColor1":"dfb180","bgColor":"2b1620","hasP3":false}},"name":"Invincible Shield (Deluxe Edition)","artistName":"Judas Priest","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Nineteen albums into their genre-defining career, heavy metal gods Judas Priest are still on top. <i>Invincible Shield</i> continues in the anthemic, fan-friendly tradition of 2018’s <i>Firepower</i> with songs inspired by internet-induced rage (“Panic Attack”), political charlatans (“Devil in Disguise”), and the Salem witch trials (“Trial by Fire”), among many other topics. “As the metal messenger of Priest, I'm always looking for opportunities to touch on subjects and ideas that I haven't done before,” vocalist Rob Halford tells Apple Music. “You’re searching for something fresh, something new. It’s the same with all of us in Priest. I think this is so important in music—to be interesting, engaging, and entertaining. I think Priest have been doing that for 50 years. Otherwise, we'd have been dissipated many decades ago.” Below, he comments on each song on <i>Invincible Shield</i>, plus the three bonus tracks included in the deluxe edition. \n\n<b>“Panic Attack”</b>\n“When you talk about topics and subjects and ideas and so forth, it's all been done. Let's face it. Whenever I do a title for a song, I search it, because I hate doing things that have been done before. But ‘Panic Attack,’ I just love that phrase. I used to have panic attacks before I got sober, and they’re very debilitating. In this case, it’s someone reacting to something they’ve seen on the internet.” \n\n<b>“The Serpent and the King”</b>\n“The devil is the serpent, and the king is God. Is the devil a deity? I don’t know. But I think the serpent came to me first, and then naturally my mind went to the king. And then I always try to use at least one word in a Priest album that I've never used before, like ‘sulfur.’ We know what sulfur is, we know what it smells like. So, we’ve got the devil and God in conflict. Good and evil, positive and negative, black and white. It’s a constant battle.” \n\n<b>“Invincible Shield”</b>\n“This is resilience, determination, protection. As I was sitting there with a blank piece of paper and pencil, what came into my head was the invincibility of who we are as people in all aspects of life and living, and the shield that we defend ourselves with. It’s about standing up for yourself within our world of heavy metal.” \n\n<b>“Devil in Disguise”</b>\n“I'm a news hound. Like most old people, you start to engage in politics more as you age. When you're a younger person, for the most part, you don't give a fuck about politics. But as you get older, you start thinking, 'Why do I want to do an Elvis—pull out my gun and shoot the TV?' So, this song came from just thinking about the political spectrum, but also thinking about the snake oil salesmen of this world. In the old westerns, the snake oil guy would come into town saying, ‘This potion will cure baldness. This one will make the horse eat.’ We’re not far removed from that, are we?” \n\n<b>“Gates of Hell”</b>\n“There are some deep, dark moments on this record, and this one goes to purgatory. You get there if you ride with me. It's that unity aspect of this beautiful metal community that we've got. Sign on the line, let the Priest sell your soul. I was thinking of the PMRC, and I was thinking about devil music, and the people that used to come and stand outside the venues with placards: 'Judas Priest is the devil,' and all that fun stuff. This is kind of throwing it back in their faces.” \n\n<b>“Crown of Horns”</b>\n“It's about finding love. I think if you can find love, it makes you complete. And it's a very deep song for me, spiritually. It's about finding Christ, really, but I wrap it up in that beautiful sphere of love. Love is all that matters. Love beats hate worldwide no matter where you're from. It's what keeps us all together.” \n\n<b>“As God Is My Witness”</b>\n“I think what's happening with me here is there's a lot of mortality going in my mind. Life can be a battle. I mean, it can be a battle trying to get the particular brand of bread that you want—‘they’re out of the bread!’ Originally, we were going to call this song ‘Hell to Pay,’ but ‘As God Is My Witness’ felt better. It’s something people actually say, like, ‘You’ve got another thing coming,’ or ‘Breaking the law.’ These phrases are out in the world, and they’re fun to utilize.” \n\n<b>“Trial by Fire”</b>\n“I saw something on Netflix about the Salem witch trials. The horrific way all those women were treated was out of pure superstition. The power of religion is profound in the way it affects humanity, and some of that is trauma. That was kind of the spark for this, but it’s also a bit of a reference to the way the public, when they get a story or an incident—and this is human nature—become the judge, the jury, and the executioner. We are so fast to create our opinions.” \n\n<b>“Escape From Reality”</b>\n“The bulk of that song comes from [guitarist] Glenn [Tipton]. He has these riff vaults. The thing about a riff is that it doesn’t matter if he wrote it in 1970 or 2023. Within <i>Invincible Shield</i>, it’s an affirmation of the heaviness of Judas Priest in this slow-tempo context. I think it’s the only one on the album with that kind of groove. Some of the messages on this album are quite personal, and ‘Escape From Reality’ is one of those. It’s about wishing you could go back in time to fix certain things, whatever they might be. It could be as simple as an argument in a relationship, or something big and traumatic.” \n\n<b>“Sons of Thunder”</b>\n“When you sit astride a Harley or whatever it is, it epitomizes freedom. The bike represents so many things with Judas Priest, and we're the only heavy metal band that's utilized the bike consistently. Those things that are attached to the bike—it's loud, it smells, it pisses people off—that's metal. I just wanted to have a bit of fun with that. And it's a little bit of a nod to <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, because that free spirit, that part of Americana, is with us.” \n\n<b>“Giants in the Sky”</b>\n“The touchstones for this were Ronnie [James Dio] and Lemmy, two of my dear friends. Originally it was going to be called ‘The Mighty Have Fallen,’ but I thought that just sounds too bleak. Let's give it some lift. Let's give it some transcendence. I was also thinking about rock ’n’ roll radio. When I was growing up in England, we had one station. The first time I came to America, I couldn’t believe how many stations there were. And right now, as you and I are speaking, somebody in the world is playing Ronnie or Lemmy over the radio. They’re the giants in the sky.”\n\n<b>“Fight of Your Life”</b>\n“This is a bonus track. I really wanted it in the main track listing, but I didn’t get my way. I’m not a fan of brutal sports, but I do understand the athleticism and the skill of MMA and boxing, and even the fun stuff like wrestling. And you are fighting for your life. It’s a struggle and you’re pushing through. But I love this song. To me, it’s like, ‘Can we please put this song up for the NFL or NBA?’” \n\n<b>“Vicious Circle”</b>\n“Sometimes relationships can be in a vicious circle. ‘With the wicked schemes, cut deep the way that you can try/It makes me wonder how you sleep.’ So, again, we're in the political arena, aren't we? ‘I stand against you as you rage. My fate has struck your gilded cage.’ It's about the way personal relationships can sometimes get into a vicious circle, but it's also addressing the political spectrum.” \n\n<b>“The Lodger”</b>\n“Bob Halligan Jr. wrote this. He wrote ‘Some Heads Are Gonna Roll’ and ‘(Take These) Chains.’ He came to a show a few years ago, just to see the band. It was so great to see him, and I love what he’d done with those two tracks, so I said, ‘If you’ve got anything, send it to me.’ Maybe a month later, he sends me this.

And really, those who have (Taylor Swift, Lorde, Lana Del Rey, The 1975) eagerly credit at least <i>some</i> of their success to his artistic genius. <i>Bleachers</i>, the self-titled fourth album from Antonoff’s Springsteen- and John Hughes-worshipping New Jersey rock band, arrives 10 years after their spirited debut and feels like the start of a new era. It isn’t so much that their sound has changed—they’re still making life-affirming Turnpike anthems laced with various strands of nostalgia (the sha-la-la ’60s, the fist-pumping ’80s)—so much as their lens has shifted. While much of the band’s prior work dealt with grief (Antonoff’s sister died from cancer when he was 18), here, they plant their feet firmly in the present: He’s newly married, turning 40, and, per the project’s tone-setting opener, “right on time.” \n\n“I tend to work with people who have a gut feeling about something and just want to find it,” Antonoff tells Zane Lowe. “That's all making an album is. The music I'm writing and the stories I'm telling, the magic is <i>right now</i>.” <i>Bleachers</i> is brimming with those stars and stories: Lana Del Rey, Clairo, Florence Welch, Matty Healy, St. Vincent, and his new wife Margaret Qualley all make low-key appearances on songs that embrace things we too often lament (getting older, feeling smaller, the suburbs). On “Isimo,” he captures the weight of lifelong commitment. “I see marriage and partnership in a very intense way,” he tells Lowe. “It's easy to share the fun stuff with someone, but will you share the really ugly parts of yourself? It's not an attractive part of myself; I can spin an attractive concept that sounds poetic about someone dealing with grief, but the day-to-day of that is not fun and attractive. I wanted to celebrate that in that song.”\n\nBut the best, most unexpected cameo is from professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen, one of Antonoff’s childhood idols, who speaks philosophically about passion, perseverance, and awe. Antonoff told Lowe that Mullen’s monologue, sampled from Tony Hawk’s 2022 documentary <i>Until the Wheels Fall Off</i>, “codified” the album’s whole concept: finding peace in the everyday. Antonoff, afloat in marital bliss and on top of the world, is doing just that. “You dance around the apartment,” he sings on “Ordinary Heaven,” “and I just get, I just get, I just get, I just get to be there.” ","short":"Jack Antonoff on his band’s joyous fourth album: “The magic is right now.”","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/6d/74/ff/6d74ff6e-8f28-5a62-6270-69f49e1f8855/196922686047_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"b4b4b4","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"d9d9d9","bgColor":"212121","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bleachers/1712730224","playParams":{"id":"1712730224","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0nZy2z8sZsM5TIHzUpcq5E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712730224/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"824434533","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/824434533?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713584722":{"id":"1713584722","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713584722?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/naum-gabo/323108729","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"F.

Ensemble","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Perceptions of time and place are challenged in this imaginative program of shapeshifting works from 12 Ensemble. At its heart is Richard Strauss’ <i>Metamorphosen</i>, completed in 1945 towards the end of his illustrious life, partly as a memorial to the war-ravaged Munich. It’s a work that sees Strauss retreat back into Romanticism, but, as the players show here in their transparent performance, there are untold details to savor and enjoy anew.\n\nThe album begins with Edmund Finnis’ fragmented homage to William Byrd, a piece that in its modern framing of a Tudor soundworld calls to mind Vaughan Williams’ <i>Thomas Tallis Fantasia</i>. Next, Claude Vivier’s <i>Zipangu</i> explores melody and texture, weaving in and out of a tonal world, its theme splintering and morphing throughout its 16 minutes. \n\nOliver Leith’s pastiche aria “Non Voglio, Mai Vedere Il Sole Tramontare” was composed as a plot device for his 2022 opera on the last days of Kurt Cobain. While it’s overtly contemporary, it’s instilled with the faint echoes of 19th-century grand opera as if caught in the middle of its own metamorphosis.","short":"Four incredible works that look to the future while being inspired by the past.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/79/73/56/797356d5-a323-1e0c-9091-c27da3aaffd2/5059449158105.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"292725","textColor2":"101113","textColor4":"2a2a28","textColor1":"0f0d10","bgColor":"93907b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/metamorphosis/1724189931","playParams":{"id":"1724189931","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0vi3ESZ7k5ovnL1OL2utBc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724189931/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1298805031","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1298805031?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725041334":{"id":"1725041334","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725041334?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/norah-jones/1001750","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/64/d9/06/64d906ab-f97b-55db-903b-fc5d288b2e48/Job4d7f38a5-f51c-4a95-b5e4-d7988c9bb36b-161640031-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_312462919_1662907285-Time1705609791309.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f48f8a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"242827"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"87b6ba","textColor2":"f48f8a","textColor4":"c3777a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"242827","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/00/b2/c5/00b2c52f-ca4c-f200-83e9-0e3e34bf1039/f51edb5d-cc65-4956-8d6e-73c0bae26060.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"19201f","textColor2":"1d110a","textColor4":"2d2823","textColor1":"050606","bgColor":"6c8585","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/64/e3/41/64e341ad-88a8-a238-a0b2-8ee43eb83197/Jobab08c3d0-cfdb-4a87-9a27-6ef3d6a3cf0d-161640032-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_312462918_1662907284-Time1705610957627.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","66c1cd"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"242827"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"91b1b2","textColor2":"66c1cd","textColor4":"539ba7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"242827","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/95/30/fd/9530fde4-d6fb-25de-bce8-b1204b55732f/0c774d8b-912d-427a-9ec5-9b802995961e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0bfbe","textColor2":"f3748b","textColor4":"cd6b7e","textColor1":"cfdedb","bgColor":"36474b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Visions","artistName":"Norah Jones","editorialNotes":{"standard":"There’s something playful about <i>Visions</i>, Norah Jones’ ninth album, even in the sadder moments—the way that novel guitar and keyboard timbres swirl around over simple beats and basslines, with Jones musing on life in her distinctive laidback delivery. While her 2020 album, <i>Pick Me Up Off the Floor</i>, co-produced by Jeff Tweedy, involved a larger cast of characters, <i>Visions</i> revolves around just a few, notably co-producer and multi-instrumentalist Leon Michels of El Michels Affair. The first half is just Jones and Michels, playing everything, bathed in a sparse retro-soul sound associated with Daptone and Truth & Soul Records, which is Michels’ pedigree. The second half, apart from the duo tracks “On My Way” and “That’s Life,” expands a bit to feature the pair with trumpeter Dave Guy, bassist Jesse Murphy, and drummers Homer Steinweiss or Brian Blade, all of whom played a role on <i>Pick Me Up</i> as well.","short":"With Leon Michels co-producing, Jones relaxes into something soulful.","tagline":"New

The pop star’s seventh studio album <i>eternal sunshine</i>—a lightly conceptual riff on the head-spinning 2004 film starring Jim Carrey, of whom Grande has said she’s a lifelong fan—feels like a mind game itself, blurring the lines between real-life references and theatrical bits. It arrives in the middle of a whirlwind tabloid-packed stretch—Grande married, divorced, and scored a starring role in Hollywood’s big-screen adaptation of <i>Wicked</i>—and she knows fans have questions. What’s true? What’s real? Ari gives a lot of things on this album, but answers aren’t one of them, a cunning reminder of how little transparency celebrities actually owe us. \n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Grande leans into the project’s thematic murkiness. “true story,” she says, is “an untrue story based on all untrue events,” and when asked about her own experience with the Saturn return, an astrology milestone referenced in the album’s only interlude, she shrugs. “It was chill. Nothing changed. Pretty uneventful.” She says she finds freedom in art because “you can really pull from anywhere,” and she describes the film as another “lovely costume” to wear. Her answers have flickers of defiance that feel like power. Whoever said albums had to be tidy, or true? “It doesn’t have to be an everlasting love story,” she tells Lowe. “Love is complicated. Showcasing both sides of it is what I tried to [do].” \n\nIf there’s one thing these tracks make clear, it’s that she’s still Ari on the mic—she’s still hitting those high highs (“eternal sunshine”); still finding release on the dance floor (“yes, and?”); still sifting gold out of ’90s R&B (“the boy is mine”), a sequel to the leaked 2023 track “fantasize.” Her favorite? “imperfect for you,” a tribute to the friends who make up her inner circle. “We’re so lucky to have loved ones who are accepting and real with us no matter what,” she says. “We live in a time where everything is boiled down, but that song demands room for nuance, humanness, and complexity.”\n","short":"A conceptual hat tip to the 2004 film about consuming, complicated love.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/34/fe/a1/34fea184-6d20-3f50-b4ce-5e1501c1c5ab/24UMGIM00198.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb986f","textColor2":"cf9d6c","textColor4":"ad835a","textColor1":"e1b886","bgColor":"241b14","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eternal-sunshine/1725877944","playParams":{"id":"1725877944","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/71PfP4E9roOXAudea1aPGw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725877944/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}}},"1726271214":{"id":"1726271214","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726271214?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-03-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ac-sapphire/1491783021","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"December 32nd","artistName":"Ac Sapphire","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b8/15/b4/b815b473-ccdd-03eb-14fc-438295822a67/21509.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343328","textColor2":"101414","textColor4":"363429","textColor1":"0d1413","bgColor":"d0b27c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/december-32nd/1726271214","playParams":{"id":"1726271214","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/36ZjTobU7Wlk8Tzsct2wRe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726271214/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1491783021","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1491783021?l=en-US"}]}}},"1726671219":{"id":"1726671219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726671219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-03-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luke-grimes/1611616103","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/56/4d/15/564d159a-4550-dc4e-3e0a-0378a84b3d7d/47d551e9-e32f-427f-b6a5-2cc1f5192e0f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0bcc0","textColor2":"e0d4cc","textColor4":"b7ada7","textColor1":"ede7eb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/73/d2/e7/73d2e777-60dc-4674-8d46-edebec201609/a26c06e5-2ae9-44fd-a6dc-465f0afb7360.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1bcbe","textColor2":"d0c1ba","textColor4":"a99d98","textColor1":"ede7e9","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Luke Grimes","artistName":"Luke Grimes","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Luke Grimes is a classic multi-hyphenate, earning fans for his role as Kacye Dutton on the massive show <i>Yellowstone</i> as well as for his music, which blends gritty country with rootsy Americana.

And each sonata both breaks the mold and, in its third movement, witnesses its composer at his most vulnerable. “The ‘Funeral March’ is one of the most dramatic pieces that Chopin has ever written,” says Rana, “and the Beethoven third movement is really a journey inside Beethoven the man.” \n\nTheir final movements, meanwhile, are nothing short of revolutionary. Beethoven blazes a path with an incredible extended fugue. Chopin’s fourth movement is unusual, too: “it’s something absolutely unbelievable,” says Rana, “this parallel movement in both hands, just <i>pianissimo</i> for the whole time, like wings. And then we have the shock of the final chord in <i>fortissimo</i>.”\n\nComposed in 1818, Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 29, nicknamed “Hammerklavier,” is Beethoven’s longest and technically most difficult sonata. Its opening movement crashes in with colossal chords that are almost orchestral in scope. Through its 10-minute journey, the movement barely lets up. “It’s very challenging,” says Rana, “and what I like is that this sense of challenge is shared with the audience—it’s such a demanding piece even to listen to. Just to understand what’s happening in the fourth movement is a real sense of a challenge.”\n\nRana is that rarest of pianists—a player with an almost limitless technical ability but with a soul that penetrates deep below the surface. These sorts of musicians don’t come along often, and it’s telling that she was persuaded to record the “Hammerklavier” on account of its profound third movement, rather than its extreme demands. The 18-minute “Adagio sostenuto,” says Rana, contains “one of the most beautiful melodies ever—it’s so pure and so delicate.” Which is unusual for Beethoven as he’s not generally considered to be a melodist. \n\n“Beethoven’s melodies are always the development of a certain interval or scale or repetition,” she explains. “If I think of melodies, I think of Chopin, not Beethoven.” But here, something magical happens. “This melody gets developed and developed throughout the movement,” says Rana, “and the more it comes back, the more powerful it becomes—and the more introverted, too. I don’t think there are many other compositions like that in Beethoven’s output.”\n\nShe brings a similar ethereal, even spiritual quality to the slow movement of Chopin’s Sonata when other pianists have often laden it with a certain portentousness. “I’ve always been inspired by this anecdote of Chopin’s life,” she says. “He was in Majorca and his health was not great. He was performing some of his music, and at some point raised his head up and saw a procession of priests walking in front of the piano. He knew that it was obviously a hallucination, but he stood up and ran away from the piano. For me, I think this detail is very important—there is a sense of hallucination here, and also of detachment from reality that is very important.”\n\nAnd indeed, Chopin’s Sonata, completed in 1839, surely has strong autobiographical overtones—a portrait of a man coming to terms with his mortality, just as Beethoven starts to come to terms with his deafness in the “Hammerklavier.” “Chopin is storytelling from the first note to the last. There is only one chance to listen to the work. You can’t go backwards, and in this sense, I think that this is like life.

This month’s edition comes from Vancouver producer Nostalgix (real name: Negar Hamidzadeh), who crafts a mix for your next ride. “I’ve had some of my best workouts while listening to my favorite songs,” she tells Apple Music. “Music always pushes me to try harder and show up better.” Hamidzadeh is mindful of pacing and tempo, weaving high-energy tracks for warm-ups and sprints with more reflective moments for catching your breath. Her own track “Real Girls” featuring Dev appears toward the end of the journey after a particularly fast-and-furious stretch. “It’s the perfect song to slow everything down for a second—to allow the listener to tune in to their emotions,” she says. Later on, she serves up TWINSICK’s remix to David Guetta and Sia’s “Titanium,” a track that she says has always inspired her. “It’s the perfect song for releasing heavy emotions and looking inwards at your strength,” she says.","short":"Vancouver's Nostalgix crafts a mix of bangers to accompany your next ride.","tagline":"New DJ
