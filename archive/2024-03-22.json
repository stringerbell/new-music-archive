her debut album. The Byron Bay pop artist sets aside time to chronicle her happy marriage to pro surfer Owen Wright—singing “Don’t need anything/Just this” on “Butterflies”—but also establishes a recurring theme of learning to value her independence. Against the thumping dream-pop of “Queen,” Alexander describes herself dancing alone like she’s headlining Madison Square Garden. “Best You Ever Had” is a clubby kiss-off to a lackluster ex, while “Zodiac” is another hard-earned tribute to standing on her own. There’s plenty of contrast here too, in both mood and approach. Featuring British singer LAUREL, “All Night” finds solidarity amongst affectionate 1980s pop motifs, right down to a sax solo. More surprising is “Date Night,” a duet with Aussie country singer Morgan Evans, but that also unspools like a heartfelt confessional. Even when the arrangements are at their most dynamic, Alexander makes sure that her subject matter remains close to home as she shares her process of self-discovery. As she sings over acoustic guitar and reverbed tambourine on the closing “Matter of Miles”: “Sometimes we need to disappear to find ourselves.”","short":"A journey of mid-twenties self-discovery set to dreamy, dynamic pop."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/3d/47/4d/3d474dd2-cd51-d763-58fa-3fd5f370dd38/5054197809064.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"ddd1d7","textColor2":"dbcfd9","textColor4":"c5b4b9","textColor1":"faf4fe","bgColor":"6d473c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/young-in-love/1710077735","playParams":{"id":"1710077735","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZhSTWUADVT7q7bcaqoyXf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710077735/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1004574930","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1004574930?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711812709":{"id":"1711812709","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711812709?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/julia-holter/289099102","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Something in the Room She Moves","artistName":"Julia Holter","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9a/43/0d/9a430d31-28e6-51c2-9b99-44d03aa1888b/887828050666.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0935d","textColor2":"dca165","textColor4":"b78757","textColor1":"e8b06d","bgColor":"201e1f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/something-in-the-room-she-moves/1711812709","playParams":{"id":"1711812709","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SVglM3r51P5teNFrQ9WOE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711812709/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"289099102","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/289099102?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713719179":{"id":"1713719179","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713719179?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/logic1000/1461794167","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a7/53/12/a75312de-f4fb-a757-3516-22a86cea5321/70d4a5e8-38a5-41eb-8688-548b23783065.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"35342f","textColor2":"291b14","textColor4":"433c34","textColor1":"18110d","bgColor":"abc0b4","hasP3":false}},"name":"Mother","artistName":"Logic1000","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The title is no accident: Samantha Poulter, aka Logic1000, wrote and recorded her debut album at home with producer Tom McAlister after they became parents.

A cult favorite with a diehard following, Jinks makes no-frills country music with rough-hewn edges—as influenced by genre giants like Waylon Jennings as he is by heavy metal. For his 12th album, Jinks takes an unreleased live favorite, the arena-rocker “Change the Game,” and builds around it, pushing himself both lyrically and vocally to level up his artistry. Highlights include the emotional substance-abuse confrontation of “Sober Thing,” which opens the record and boasts one of Jinks’ finest vocals to date, and “Take This Bottle,” a vulnerable collaboration with Pearl Aday. Naturally, Jinks made <i>Change the Game</i> according to his independent spirit, releasing the record on his own Late August Records label. Jinks’ bassist Joshua Thompson co-produced the LP with Ryan Hewitt, known for his work with a diverse array of artists including Molly Tuttle and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.","short":"No-frills country with rough-hewn edges."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/9f/a6/70/9fa6705a-4828-62c9-2cde-24e6f1e8200e/197189953934.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccbc8","textColor2":"dddad1","textColor4":"b4b1aa","textColor1":"fbfaf5","bgColor":"0e0f11","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/change-the-game/1715033188","playParams":{"id":"1715033188","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1OPgbhagGvc0wFx5ztKdwy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715033188/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"363412711","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/363412711?l=en-US"}]}}},"1717680174":{"id":"1717680174","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717680174?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyla/1552925732","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/fe/2b/ed/fe2bedf9-bfd8-ccce-4a96-2d159efa44e5/Jobf4226e74-3af1-4ae8-869f-0d25952b9cb1-163372617-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_316485276_1691391725-Time1708456555503.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"9293c4","textColor2":"e08e73","textColor4":"b8745e","textColor1":"b0b5f3","bgColor":"1b0c0a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/8d/ec/af/8decaf9a-b2fd-ec5e-e5b1-9a3dfec50556/c7d5db83-fcab-4d10-8273-55209d1a794e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bec1c7","textColor2":"e6d0cc","textColor4":"bba8a5","textColor1":"e9eff7","bgColor":"120a0a","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/7a/43/b3/7a43b3cb-6169-8ceb-f631-8316790c3fb9/Job6487e5eb-f067-47bd-b0ec-fcb53c318b63-163372616-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_316485279_1691391602-Time1708455369892.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c0907d","textColor2":"e6a487","textColor4":"c2876e","textColor1":"e4ae99","bgColor":"31150a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/d4/62/08/d46208b8-3cc8-5c1b-5f8d-73a9805d5573/fee44a4d-e03e-4539-a726-e70197d7d23a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c79989","textColor2":"e19f80","textColor4":"c3886e","textColor1":"e6b4a1","bgColor":"4b3027","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/a0/e3/3b/a0e33b4a-f879-3eb0-7914-853ee0392ab6/dbdc4d78-c14f-4361-95ff-8251561cad7f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a79488","textColor2":"c4b7ac","textColor4":"9d938a","textColor1":"d1b8aa","bgColor":"020201","hasP3":false}},"name":"TYLA","artistName":"Tyla","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I've always wanted to be a pop star, but beyond that, I wanted to be an African pop star,” Tyla tells Apple Music. “The roots of my sound are in amapiano music, in South African and African music.” Though the megaviral 2023 single “Water” may have put the South African singer-songwriter on the proverbial map—first as a social media sensation, then as the highest-charting African female soloist ever on Billboard’s Hot 100, earning her the inaugural Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance—she’s been carefully plotting her path to the top for years. “Since I started experimenting with amapiano, I just feel like it's really helped me get to this point where I created something that is fresh and new, but still familiar and comes from home,” she says. “It's a sound of Africa, and it's something that I couldn't be more proud about.” \n\nShe weaves through a blend of pop, R&B, amapiano, and Afrobeats (“pop-piano sounds cute,” she admits) across <i>TYLA</i>, a coming-of-age chronicle through love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. “I’m speaking about the things that I've gone through while creating the album—basically three years in the making,” she explains. “I was becoming a woman. So it was a lot of growing that happened, and me realizing my worth, and realizing how I want to be treated—and how basically, I'm that girl, and people need to know I'm that girl.”\n\nWhile the project was brought to life with the help of global producers including Sammy Soso, Mocha, Believve, Rayo, and Sir Nolan, Tyla made sure they all had a taste of her homeland. “[It was important] to bring some to South Africa,” she explains, “so when we get in the studio, they have context. Some people that try amapiano sound so watered down, it's cringey. So even though I am mixing it with pop and R&B, I didn't want it to sound watered down. Music is our everything in Africa. The way we speak, the way we dance, literally, our dance moves—they come so naturally. It's just in us. It’s our essence.” Below, Tyla talks us through her debut album.\n\n<b>“Intro” (Tyla & Kelvin Momo)</b>\n“I wanted to start off my album with something that was truly South African, something that showed people the root of where I started, before ‘Water,’ before all of these mixtures. I secretly recorded a voice note when I was in a session with Kelvin Momo. I loved hearing the people in the session, speaking, hearing the language, the accents. It was so raw and real. Kelvin Momo is my favorite amapiano producer—his music and his sound is my heart.”\n\n<b>“Safer”</b>\n“The message of the song is something that I feel like a lot of people could relate to. And the energy of the song I feel like is a strong intro to open an album.”\n\n<b>“Water”</b>\n“‘Water’ surpassed all expectations. I could've never expected all of these accolades—a Grammy, the Billboard Hot 100, people all over the world dancing and pouring water down their back. From the time I finished recording the song, it was all that I was listening to. It was also like a step away from what I was used to, because I [had been] <i>very</i> PG. And with this one, I was more grown up and I was experimenting more. And even though I don't enjoy vulgar music, I feel like we were able to make the song speak about what it speaks about, but in a way that's friendly.”\n\n<b>“Truth or Dare”</b>\n“This was the song where I was playing more house-y with it. It’s me calling out people, being like, ‘Hey, <i>now</i> you care.’ I'm not that type of person, but these are feelings that I felt around the time where I'm like, ‘Where did this person come from? Out of nowhere, you want to now talk to me?’ and I literally hate it. I'm sure a lot of people have felt that.”\n\n<b>“No.1” (feat. Tems)</b>\n“Tems and I had been wanting to make a song for long now. We ended up making it work, and Tems' voice alone is so amazing, so unique. The song is for everyone, but when I had it in mind, it was really for the girls—me and Tems, girl power, African girls—and we were just really pushing that message of ‘I'm leaving. I don't need anybody. If this is not serving me anymore, I’m gone, and I'm going to be okay.’ Always put yourself before anything.”\n\n<b>“Breathe Me”</b>\n“It's a song that's so emotional and so real. It's just about love, of how strong love is, and how you don't even need anything else. I don't need anything else. You don't need anything else—just me, and you; just breathe me and we'll be fine.”\n\n<b>“Butterflies”</b>\n“With ‘Butterflies,’ I was in a session with [producer and songwriter Ari PenSmith] and he was playing me some stuff that he's worked on, and I was like, 'Cool, cool, cool.' And then he played this, and I fell in love with it. It sat so perfectly with my voice. I connected with the song instantly, and it was too specific to what I was going through to not do anything with it.”\n\n<b>“On and On”</b>\n“This was [an initial] version of my sound, before ‘Water’ and everything. I made this with Corey Marlon Lindsay-Keay in South Africa. We were supposed to go out, and we didn't end up going out, so I was dressed up in a whole outfit in the studio session, and he was producing. I love the song so much because it's so nostalgic but new. I love that it feels like old-school R&B. I love that it has hints of Aaliyah's influence, but it's new, and fresh, and African—all things that are Tyla. The messaging is not so serious—it’s literally about not wanting a party to end.”\n\n<b>“Jump” (Tyla, Gunna & Skillibeng)</b>\n“‘Jump’ is a very different vibe. I really just wanted to tell people who I am, and I had to show my confidence through the song. And the opening line, with Skilli being like, 'Original girl, you want a replica? No.' There's no replica. That intro was already perfect, and it segues to that line of me saying, 'They've never had a pretty girl from Joburg/They see me now and that's what they prefer.' That line is just—it’s too iconic for me, and I'm just so excited to hear all the girls sing it, all the Joburg girls sing it, all the girls from home. And having Gunna on it, I really feel like it took me into that world further, making it even more raw and cool.”\n\n<b>“ART”</b>\n“When I'm with someone that treats me so good, treats me well, treats me like art, treats me like a princess, I will be there for them. I will be their art piece. We also played with that wording where it can be ‘art piece,’ but also your peace and your comfort. As a woman, that's how I want to be treated, and that's how I would treat you if you treat me that way. It’s about being treasured.”\n\n<b>“On My Body” (Tyla & Becky G)</b>\n“This was such a fun one because it’s in my world, but also I played a bit with the Latin vibes. The feature came so organically—I was in studio, and she was in a session next door. She loved it, and she recorded a verse, and I absolutely died. I died. I just love her touch, and how it just broadened the audience, because now it's just bringing everybody into this experience. It's a melting pot with all these genres, and I love that I was able to expand it even further.”\n\n<b>“Priorities”</b>\n“This song was probably the most difficult to share, because it's really letting people into my heart and mind, and how I feel I've been with myself. I feel like people would resonate with it, and it speaks about what a lot of people feel and may not express. [The idea of having spread yourself too thin] is something that's so raw and real, that not even just women, men, everybody feels.”\n\n<b>“To Last”</b>\n“I love this song with all my heart. I was in the Vaal with LuuDadeejay, and I literally finished this song in five minutes. It was based off an experience that my friend was going through at the time. About a year prior, I wrote the lines ‘You never gave us a chance, it's like you never wanted to last.’ And that note just came to mind, and the song just flowed out of me. I ended up going through something that made me feel that way. It was like I told the future, which is not good—but I fell in love with the song again. It’s so South African: It’s amapiano, it's house-y, it's our sound.”\n\n<b>“Water (Remix)” (Tyla & Travis Scott)</b>\n“Travis reached out—he loved ‘Water,’ and around the time, I was like, 'I don't want a remix, I'm cool.' But Travis Scott was so unexpected that I wanted to do it so bad, and he absolutely killed it. He added some South African shout-outs in his verse, and I just knew that people from home were going to love it—he acknowledged us, and he mentioned [the South African telephone country code] +27 and all those things. And I also love that he brought a different energy to the song. Everyone knows ‘Water’ to be that summer banger, and now Travis made it still the summer banger, but also more gritty. Putting him on an African-sounding song was just the perfect collab.”","short":"South Africa’s viral sensation drops her debut: “It’s about realizing my

A few other previously released songs appear here, too, like the tearjerker “All Dogs Go to Heaven” and the delicious “Double Down.” Other highlights include the title track, which borrows a guitar lick from David Bowie’s “Rebel Rebel” (the late star gets a writing credit), and the driving closer “Down.”","short":"Loose and in his element nearly two decades into his career."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/6e/b5/ac/6eb5ac0b-1fe0-eb4e-9975-55cd95ae5b2a/196871574495.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"323131","textColor2":"1f1e1e","textColor4":"413e3f","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"c7c1c1","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/young-love-saturday-nights/1721054919","playParams":{"id":"1721054919","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5fTud1jSzcTEwm7I0j4BTu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721054919/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4779205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4779205?l=en-US"}]}}},"1721222332":{"id":"1721222332","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721222332?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/waxahatchee/485087438","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/46/7e/c8/467ec818-6788-c07d-213b-0483cb56968f/Job41c9a1e6-b4e6-4181-90f6-06d0b93e4058-162949476-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315528383_1684650217-Time1707840924630.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"29342c","textColor2":"091800","textColor4":"303f2c","textColor1":"000b00","bgColor":"cedae0","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/3e/01/c3/3e01c3e7-1e79-4de9-750d-4f94ca44aea7/ded5aea7-6025-408c-a62a-96353a4c620e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a491","textColor2":"d6ae85","textColor4":"ad9679","textColor1":"ddc0a4","bgColor":"063449","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/20/e0/4c/20e04c9d-48ae-139d-c361-85dc02671cc9/Jobae04c209-1baf-40f0-bd1e-d440471f842b-161156099-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_311465251_1655168968-Time1704818302083.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"362f30","textColor2":"3d0c07","textColor4":"5e3935","textColor1":"0c0002","bgColor":"e2eceb","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1d/ea/8a/1dea8a86-a546-cc41-fa3d-7c8bc620031c/6bf63f56-c1be-46a4-ab24-74709959082e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aab6bd","textColor2":"cdd7dd","textColor4":"a9b2b4","textColor1":"cfdde8","bgColor":"161d11","hasP3":false}},"name":"Tigers Blood","artistName":"Waxahatchee","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When artists experience the kind of career-defining breakthrough that Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield enjoyed with 2020’s <i>Saint Cloud</i>, they’re typically faced with a difficult choice: lean further into the sound that landed you there, or risk disappointing your newfound audience by setting off into new territory. On <i>Tigers Blood</i>, the Kansas City-based singer-songwriter chooses the former, with a set of country-indebted indie rock that reaches the same, often dizzying heights as its predecessor. But that doesn’t mean its songs came from the same emotional source. “When I made <i>Saint Cloud</i>, I'd just gotten sober and I was just this raw nerve—I was burgeoning with anxiety,” she tells Apple Music. “And on this record, it sounds so boring, but I really feel like I was searching for normal. I think I've really settled into my thirties.” \n\nWorking again with longtime producer Brad Cook (Bon Iver, Snail Mail, Hurray for the Riff Raff), Crutchfield enlisted the help of rising guitar hero MJ Lenderman, with whom she duets on the quietly romantic lead single (and future classic) “Right Back to It.” Originally written for Wynonna Judd—a recent collaborator—“365” finds Crutchfield falling into a song of forgiveness, her voice suspended in air, arching over the soft, heart-like thump of an acoustic guitar. Just as simple but no less moving: the Southern rock of “Ice Cold,” in which Crutchfield seeks equilibrium and Lenderman transcendence, via solo. \n\nIn the absence of inner tumult, Crutchfield says she had to learn that the songs will still come. “I really do feel like I've reached this point where I have a comfort knowing that they will show up,” she says. “When it's time, they'll show up and they'll show up fast. And if they're not showing up, then it's just not time yet.”","short":"Katie Crutchfield doubles down on the charms of 2020’s Saint

Your Consideration","artistName":"Empress Of","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On previous album covers for Lorely Rodriguez’s alt-pop project Empress Of, the musician assumed a straightforward pose, casually stunting if not smiling. For the cover of her fourth album, which shares a cheeky title with the awards season campaign slogan, the Honduran American singer-producer throws her hair back as she straddles a shooting star, Los Angeles sprawled out behind her. She’s described it as something of a Hollywood album in all its sordid glam; the aching title track reflects on the end of a relationship with a showbiz scenester (“You wrote the script; your words, not mine”). That sheen of glitzy fantasy shimmers gently over Rodriguez’s club-ready explorations on love’s fleeting nature, running the gamut between heartbreak and hedonism and switching seamlessly between Spanish and English. \n\nShe longs for “<i>un hombre femenine, un latine, que baile pa' mi y solo pa' mi</i>” on thumping house jam “Femenine,” wonders about the owner of an unfamiliar pair of earrings on infidelity banger “Lorelei,” and finds redemption in a wild night out on “Cura.” Rodriguez’s lyricism is at times abstract and poetic (“The rumors there, the mirror shows, the cards don’t lie, the boys all know—what type of girl am I?”) and at others sharply seductive (“<i>Yo soy fácil, fácil de comer, fácil de amar</i>”). The small handful of guests are like-minded in their boundary-pushing, occasionally messy avant-pop: Rina Sawayama on the love-drunk “Kiss Me” and fellow Angelenos MUNA on the searching “What’s Love.”","short":"Lorely Rodriguez’s fourth album swings between heartbreak and hedonism."},"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/2b/d2/a7/2bd2a73d-a589-6b14-b8fc-55d96c6e3aa1/8721056032037.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"c8840d","textColor2":"e78f09","textColor4":"bc7911","textColor1":"f79d03","bgColor":"0e1e35","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-your-consideration/1725372055","playParams":{"id":"1725372055","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2TTsYkEOtnLgcWq469WQ83"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725372055/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"568038037","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/568038037?l=en-US"}]}}},"1726648265":{"id":"1726648265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726648265?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fletcher/1131301545","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/76/13/90/76139043-cd17-0005-926d-01096fc7fafd/Job1250f28b-65e4-42bc-8b30-4e12c56a68bb-163578613-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_317005696_1694983499-Time1708738018620.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"81b4c4","textColor2":"9bdade","textColor4":"86b3b7","textColor1":"94dbee","bgColor":"34161c","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/52/85/b1/5285b1a3-edaf-0422-f93a-6fc80b22274d/b21d2f4f-b28f-42e5-838b-1b0dbd65a9d6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9ca176","textColor2":"b3c3c2","textColor4":"909c9b","textColor1":"c3ca94","bgColor":"020000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/91/2c/4f/912c4ffd-3e0e-4ff6-1738-07bdeb0e9d35/Jobd1ad8c1f-89b3-4e52-9646-f488cd4828b7-161995668-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_313309321_1668972359-Time1706232066963.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"232f35","textColor2":"2b1913","textColor4":"3c3e3c","textColor1":"0b070a","bgColor":"83d1e3","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f8/db/11/f8db111a-5b24-36d4-fe76-456eea6ee69c/2354e7d7-85dd-4d0f-b879-d5aaec846b64.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9ba17a","textColor2":"aac1d6","textColor4":"899aab","textColor1":"c2c998","bgColor":"020000","hasP3":false}},"name":"In Search Of The Antidote","artistName":"FLETCHER","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"FLETCHER’s second full-length album <i>In Search of the Antidote</i> is unfiltered and raw, a desperate and thrilling attempt to find joy, even during life’s lowest moments. “I've been able to figure out who I am through music over the years,” the New Jersey-born pop singer tells Apple Music. “It's been the vessel for me exploring myself. Even now, looking back even at what all my projects have been called—<i>Finding Fletcher</i>, <i>THE S(EX) TAPES [Shot By My Ex]</i>, <i>Girl of My Dreams</i>—here's been these through lines of me just deeply searching.” \n\nThat is evident even in the album title: FLETCHER asks what it means to find a cure if you don’t know what exactly is wrong in the first place. Just because you feel a poison, there may not be a cure. FLETCHER experienced this conundrum firsthand in 2023 when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. The puzzling nature of the illness caused her to question the things she felt, and this journey from self-doubt to working through the struggles in song form makes up the emotional arc of <i>In Search of the Antidote</i>. \n\n“I went on a search to go find the antidote to what was happening in my body, and the antidote has been many things for me over the course of my life,” she says. “It's been the women, it's been fans, it's been stages, it's been bottles of tequila, it's been writing petty-ass music. This last year, it was healing. The antidote was healing and finding answers.”\n\nDespite the lows of illness, false hope, half-cures, and relapses, <i>In Search of the Antidote</i> is ultimately an album of optimism and triumph. The penultimate track, “Joyride,” captures the feeling of falling in love, of that moment when it might turn into more than a fling. She sings, “You were in my dreams/Now I’m in your bed.” “I think, for me, this album is about love in all of its infinite manifestations,” FLETCHER says. “For me, love is like giving voice to all of the parts, all of the feelings—the full journey, the rage, the joy, the lust, the being horny, your ego.”","short":"The pop singer finds answers and healing on her raw sophomore album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/4c/38/31/4c383130-4b43-6593-5e14-da5451d40cf3/23UM1IM65399.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1e292c","textColor2":"1b0a06","textColor4":"2e3132","textColor1":"060000","bgColor":"7bcde0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-search-of-the-antidote/1726648265","playParams":{"id":"1726648265","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5QWMCRZ2PfAUOTslrs3wGg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726648265/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1131301545","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1131301545?l=en-US"}]}}},"1727145709":{"id":"1727145709","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727145709?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/glass-beams/1558093934","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/40/9c/22/409c229c-99f4-cff1-0243-23eea614824d/Job91cb7b49-7338-4388-ae3a-780c068e263e-162607970-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314711561_1679370542-Time1707325328630.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"ddcca6","textColor2":"ebe3b0","textColor4":"d6c594","textColor1":"f4ebc6","bgColor":"835027","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/9d/38/9d/9d389d26-f0f2-5b86-d2c7-38f9f72f8416/c49efab7-2dde-40ce-9113-47bff583b62c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c2712","textColor2":"1b1109","textColor4":"412b16","textColor1":"160b04","bgColor":"d89649","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/2f/f3/61/2ff361ce-7a60-249c-c864-3d2d622ba4d6/Job1c041948-8d39-4c73-bf5e-28cde8ed92cc-162535611-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314524027_1678133248-Time1707224307762.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"e2c989","textColor2":"f3dea2","textColor4":"d9be86","textColor1":"feeba5","bgColor":"734118","hasP3":false}},"name":"Mahal -

It’s a love letter to our younger and current selves. Perfection has a different meaning for everyone. Social media has changed how we interact with the world. Perception versus reality is rewarded and condemned. From what people wear, to who they date, it’s like a magnifying glass. We just want to remind everyone to empower themselves, and free their minds. We all die in the end; we have to live with and love ourselves fiercely, first and foremost. On our deathbeds the only opinion that will matter on how you’ve lived will be your own.”\n\n<b>“Detox”</b>\nLisa: “‘Detox’ is a fusion of pop rock, ska, poetry, and skate punk. It’s an exploration of the chaos and hypnosis of toxic relationships with others, and with yourself. Fighting emotional volatility and sinking euphoria with inspiration.” \n\n<b>“Here to Dance”</b>\nJess: “[This] is based off the quote ‘dance like nobody’s watching.’ Attention is currency—gossip and headlines used for clickbait means we’re normalizing a toxic culture where gossip becomes the vehicle to line pockets. And that fuels a more rampant gossip culture than ever. So we wanted to remind ourselves not to let others define who you are, or your right to freedom and self-expression.” \n\n<b>“Savage (feat. Kerser)”</b>\nJess: “‘Savage’ was inspired by an old relationship. The hurt and confusion with what happens when you wake up and realize too much has happened to get back to that place of respect and love. We’ve been huge fans of Kerser since his early records. He’s represented an aspect of Australian culture that’s different from what we have. We all have a shared passion for music, telling our stories, and how important our fans are in our careers.”\n\n<b>“Invisible”</b>\nLisa: “‘Invisible’ paints a picture of different situations people find themselves in. It’s a basic human need to feel heard and understood. You expect truth to prevail always, and when it doesn’t, it can be really crushing.”\n\n<b>“Ribcage”</b>\nLisa: “[This] is a love song about someone who has been hurt in the past, finding a safe space and true love for the first time in their life. We used more morbid references to describe falling in love.” \n\n<b>“Jungle”</b>\nJess: “‘Jungle’ is our favorite song that embodies <i>Gothic Summer</i>. This song embodies stories that make you laugh so we don’t cry. Because that’s how life feels. Like a gothic comedy.”","short":"The Veronicas ride life’s ups and downs on their sixth album."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/6f/84/34/6f843443-81b2-e935-9254-a667fbcc2dd9/196922831980_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"25201d","textColor2":"28241e","textColor4":"453d35","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b9a292","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gothic-summer/1728827636","playParams":{"id":"1728827636","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2INYN4ZTJJk3DvxdODiYu8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728827636/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"74214491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/74214491?l=en-US"}]}}},"1729697233":{"id":"1729697233","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729697233?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kenny-chesney/205322","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/01/5a/12/015a1252-2ea3-1cb0-652a-f83db5edd61b/Job970386ee-4fd5-4a58-9ae1-32d59200564d-164887269-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319956399_1717419021-Time1710881734088.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","6ba2d8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"202121"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"508ab4","textColor2":"6ba2d8","textColor4":"5682ad","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"202121","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/56/2d/23/562d239d-65a2-20ce-7f55-468316892bb8/7ff46e12-7dd8-4af2-9130-e0c6bf4c511b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8ea7bf","textColor2":"88aad5","textColor4":"6f8ab5","textColor1":"afcee1","bgColor":"090834","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/60/4c/1a/604c1a0e-9976-08ab-07a2-4a5e92cbdb2c/Job0eda657b-a36e-4a0e-81df-cebc6a876430-164887270-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319956400_1717419022-Time1710883595483.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f1b24c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"202121"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d3dde5","textColor2":"f1b24c","textColor4":"caa056","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"202121","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/96/db/ac/96dbacc2-3180-aa07-f6c4-e7745e24a45d/ed169747-014b-4fa8-b6f3-b1cfdcba16b4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"6892bc","textColor2":"7aa6d4","textColor4":"6486b4","textColor1":"80b4de","bgColor":"090935","hasP3":false}},"name":"Born","artistName":"Kenny Chesney","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“What does life and love and truth all mean?” Kenny Chesney poses this question on the title track of his 20th studio album, a record that finds the wildly beloved country singer-songwriter reflecting on his roots and digging into his spirituality. Rather than firm answers, Chesney offers up 15 tracks that, thematically, run the gamut from casual (the sweetly cheeky “Guilty Pleasure”) to philosophical (“This Too Shall Pass”) to otherworldly, as on the touching closing track, “Wherever You Are Tonight,” which ponders where we go when we die. As he tells Apple Music, this period of reflection also finds Chesney very much focused on the future, always dreaming about where his next musical journey might lead him. “I think that I’ve been very fortunate to see a lot of my dreams come true and to live in that,” he says. “To live in gratitude that that happened. But, of course, as much as I’ve traveled, there’s still a lot of places that I haven’t been. I hope I haven’t written my best song.” Below, Chesney shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Just to Say We Did”</b>\n“Songwriting is a lot like fishing. Some days you catch a lot, some days you catch a really big one, and some days you don’t catch anything. When we got done with ‘Just to Say We Did,’ it was very authentic about my life. I felt like it was, in a way, just a call to action to get off the couch of your life and just see what happens.”\n\n<b>“The Way I Love You Now”</b>\n“I wrote that song with Mike Reed, who I really, truly love and respect. He’s written a lot of wonderful songs. He wrote one of my favorite Tim McGraw songs ever, a song called ‘Everywhere.’ He wrote ‘I Can’t Make You Love Me’ by Bonnie Raitt. You can say you can forgive someone, but once you have true life perspective, like years later, is when you forgive someone. That’s when it really matters. That’s how it happened for me, anyway. Taking ego completely out of the way, taking the life experiences completely out of the way and seeing someone as a broken human being just like we all are, and forgiving them. It’s one of my favorite songs I’ve written in a while.”\n\n<b>“This Too Shall Pass”</b>\n“One thing I love about our audience is that they have been with us for a while, and they have seen all sides. I love being a songwriter, and that takes you down a lot of paths. Yeah, we got a lot of songs that are about having a good time and partying and being in an island life, but there’s so much more to that. There’s so much more to me than that. The layers of what was built is so much more than just that. I think that our audience understands that.”\n\n<b>“Wherever You Are Tonight”</b>\n“It was fifty-fifty if I was going to put it on the record or not, even though I loved it. But sometimes it makes people uncomfortable just to talk about someone passing or what’s out there, their beliefs. Whatever it is, it can be an uncomfortable conversation. But I felt like the beauty of this song, it didn’t dive into what people believed; it just dove into the idea that when someone passes, they really don’t die—they linger. They linger in us forever. They linger in the lives of the people that loved them. That’s what this whole song is about: Whatever it is you believe, or wherever you are tonight. Because I do believe there’s something, not to get too religious, but I believe that there’s something much bigger than all of us up there that we don’t understand.”","short":"“I hope I haven’t written my best song.” Getting philosophical on album 20."},"artwork":{"width":3150,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/fc/d1/ad/fcd1ad4f-fba2-f557-8e3f-bc45a146fada/093624847397.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3150,"textColor3":"d4c1a7","textColor2":"f4bc57","textColor4":"cea960","textColor1":"fbdab1","bgColor":"365e82","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/born/1729697233","playParams":{"id":"1729697233","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Hg5u4WLNI85GHVISRXMna"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729697233/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"205322","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/205322?l=en-US"}]}}},"1731059947":{"id":"1731059947","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1731059947?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shakira/889327","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/af/ea/64/afea641d-6b4e-723f-45a2-2d22a165ee6e/Jobf4598675-53dc-4fe8-b5fa-0d7f530b07d8-163410325-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_316572395_1692038455-Time1708503263097.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"b89980","textColor2":"d4ab93","textColor4":"aa8b7c","textColor1":"e6bc98","bgColor":"020d21","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/fb/cc/d4/fbccd45c-014a-8f9c-f5cc-b5b5d57cc6f3/72e8351f-b977-4458-a6e0-38df675baaff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c89f95","textColor2":"dcad95","textColor4":"b48f7e","textColor1":"f5c1b1","bgColor":"121523","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/a7/52/0e/a7520e6b-51b0-8d79-b09b-58a0fc55e5bd/Jobd1e2866d-82a8-4c6a-9d50-e7e400de855d-163410326-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_316572397_1692038451-Time1708504185715.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d0ae8b","textColor2":"e5c7a3","textColor4":"c8a98e","textColor1":"f0cda0","bgColor":"54323a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/78/50/23/7850237d-347d-b16c-5b7b-b90dccc31f60/920a53bf-2d9b-4938-b318-a50e2f35df27.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"efa573","textColor2":"fdb5af","textColor4":"f1908c","textColor1":"f9ce8f","bgColor":"c40000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran","artistName":"Shakira","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Pain makes you more humane,” Shakira tells Apple Music. “Being able to take that pain and transform it into something else, that is an opportunity and a luxury that us artists have.” Assuredly, the Latin-pop superstar’s romantic and professional woes in recent years have been significant, often converted into cruel tabloid fodder that, no doubt, amplified the issues and surrounding emotions. Yet with <i>Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran</i>, her first new album in nearly seven years, she transforms the numbingly dull lead of personal hardship into a glorious musical gold. \n\n“In a way, it’s kind of good not to have a husband,” Shakira says of the impact her breakup had on her creativity. “Now I feel like working. It’s a compulsive need of mine that I didn’t feel before.” Even before the album emerged, that compulsion came through clearly and eventfully with the release of singles like the award-winning “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” showing the world that she wasn’t afraid to speak her mind during trying times. “No one should tell any woman how she’s supposed to heal and lick her wounds.”\n\n<i>Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran</i> exemplifies that sentiment. As expected, given her prior hits, she retains a mastery of the dance floor with the benefit of autobiographical lyricism. Here, she provides such expertly executed versions as the Bizarrap-assisted “La Fuerte” and the emotionally potent “Tiempo Sin Verte.” One of many successors to Shakira’s bilingual pop lineage, Cardi B joins for the opener “Puntería,” a sweat-inducing track dripping with erotically charged metaphors. More than willing to branch out beyond what her legacy already holds, she also demonstrates just how integral she’s become to the modern reggaetón landscape, lending her cosign to Manuel Turizo on “Copa Vacía” and finding a kindred spirit in KAROL G on “TQG.”\n\nFar more surprising are her successful forays into other genres represented throughout the album, namely the música mexicana team-ups “(Entre Paréntesis)” with Grupo Frontera and “El Jefe” with Fuerza Regida, as well as the brisk bachata cut “Monotonía” with Ozuna. Still, Shakira hasn’t forgotten her long-standing rock listenership, bringing energy and grace to the cathartic “Cómo Dónde y Cuándo.” Similarly, her balladry remains exemplary, the revelatory messages of “Acróstico (Milan y Sasha)” and “Última” obviously driven by her experiences and in response to these challenges. \n\nUltimately, against all odds, she emerges from this album with a sense of hope and optimism. “Love is the most amazing experience a human can live, and no one should take away that opinion from you,” she says. “It doesn’t matter the shitty experiences you go through in life; there’s always a lot more to look forward to.”","short":"Shakira turns her heartache into gold: “Pain makes you more humane.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/55/0e/5e/550e5ecc-3fe4-50df-c5a3-a019b67008c3/196871854894.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb9377","textColor2":"d6a684","textColor4":"b38a73","textColor1":"e0b18a","bgColor":"291a2f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/las-mujeres-ya-no-lloran/1731059947","playParams":{"id":"1731059947","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3fonA82Hl7huJiQCwKkzGA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1731059947/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"889327","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/889327?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732319005":{"id":"1732319005","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732319005?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-03-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/day6/1037939997","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/3f/72/9d/3f729d13-0088-abe7-8e0b-4297fe5a26e0/6ccd1c81-80a2-4d4a-abb2-d4f026a14ac4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"272828","textColor2":"1b1e20","textColor4":"343636","textColor1":"0b0d0e","bgColor":"979691","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fourever","artistName":"DAY6","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/e8/6e/9ee86ed8-4dcf-ac99-e49a-95fb2151b4ac/8809928951515_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"372e23","textColor2":"111012","textColor4":"38312b","textColor1":"100c08","bgColor":"d6b68f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fourever/1732319005","playParams":{"id":"1732319005","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/29pgfsXVV0cLsvfylWRZJ9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732319005/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1037939997","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1037939997?l=en-US"}]}}},"1733055332":{"id":"1733055332","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733055332?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dustin-zahn/176057851","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Temporary Vandalism -

Although fans have been eagerly waiting, the holdup between projects has been personal due to his struggles with depression, substance abuse, love, and stints in and out of rehab—all of which became the foundation for his introspective fourth LP <i>HEAVY</i>. “It’s me being vulnerable in different ways, it’s me diving deeper,” he tells Apple Music. “I thought <i>Chasing Summer</i> was personal, but this record really showed me a lot about myself as a creator, as a man, and it’s all on there, and I think those moments are necessary. I had to have those moments. Looking back at what I’m providing, the project that you’re getting, I wouldn’t change a thing.”\n\nServing as a therapeutic letter to himself as he tackles his issues, <i>HEAVY</i> is a road map of SiR’s journey from addiction to sobriety across 16 tracks. The title track, “HEAVY,” is a cry for help as the Inglewood, California, native grapples with the pressures of fame and the expectations that come from it. “Oh, I been killing myself softly/Lost my mind completely/I really hope I can find my way back to you,” he croons. SiR wrestles with his shortcomings and the impact they have on his relationships (“Satisfaction,” “ONLY HUMAN”) and the ups and downs of trying to stay sober (“TRYIN’ MY HARDEST”). Despite that, the tone of <i>HEAVY</i> shifts towards the middle of the album, tackling the process of healing (“BRIGHTER”) and forgiveness (“I’M NOT PERFECT,” “Nothing Even Matters”)—whether it’s from others or himself. \n\n“It’s like you’re starting in this really dark place, and you’re going from heavy to light,” he says. “That’s how I kind of wanted it to feel because that was how it was for me. I was in the darkest place of my life, and I was transitioning out as I was getting healthy. And the music I was creating was kind of shaping itself that way. It was a natural thing to put it in that order. It’s like you started. In a dark tunnel, you’re heading towards the light.

We begin with the great pianist Myra Hess’ sublime arrangement of Bach’s <i>Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring</i>. “The piece is so famous that I have been familiar with it since I was a child,” Sumino tells Apple Music Classical, “and I feel attached to it.” \n\nNext is Sumino’s glittering <i>Reminiscence</i>, a piece built on a fragment of melody from Chopin’s Ballade No. 2. “It’s a piece that came naturally to me when I went to Poland,” he says. “It’s about my memories of that trip to Warsaw—it’s a very personal piece, as if based on my memories of facing Chopin’s music.”\n\nFinally, Sumino evokes memories of his own childhood with one of the 555 sonatas that flowed from the pen of Baroque composer Domenico Scarlatti throughout his life. It’s a piece that Sumino says he practiced a lot as a child, and he brings to it a beautiful, fresh simplicity.\n\nThat this Classical Session has an intimate, almost muted sound is thanks both to the closeness of the microphones, but also to Sumino’s choice of instrument: a Steinway upright piano. “I like uprights a lot,” he says. “They have a very personal, internal, slightly nostalgic appeal—a different warmth to the grand piano. Uprights draw you inward.”","short":"“Upright pianos have a very personal, internal, slightly nostalgic appeal.”","tagline":"Recommended Playlist"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/57/9a/24/579a2424-4231-7be2-9a14-1499ee074cfe/196871780612.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"332828","textColor2":"1f173c","textColor4":"473753","textColor1":"070406","bgColor":"e4b8af","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/classical-session-hayato-sumino/1735771876","playParams":{"id":"1735771876","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735771876/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1465878637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1465878637?l=en-US"}]}}},"1735828780":{"id":"1735828780","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735828780?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dylan-gossett/1526025679","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e7/ff/29/e7ff2943-6fd7-1607-a612-8f30e9db6ebc/c1eae99c-a4f9-4e6a-b013-d08e6171c8fc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4f4641","textColor2":"362c2a","textColor4":"5c5452","textColor1":"261a14","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false}},"name":"Songs in the Gravel - EP","artistName":"Dylan Gossett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Dylan Gossett keeps Texas country alive and well on <i>Songs in the Gravel</i>, the Austin-based singer-songwriter’s second EP.

And the EP closes with “Bitter Winds,” a naturalistic mourning of passing time.

She underscores that success with <i>The After Taste</i>, her debut EP—also written, produced, and performed entirely by Grace herself—which leads off with “Strangers,” the haunting infinity loop of pared-back dance beats that put her on the map. \n\nShe applies the same winning formula of mellow synth sounds and cushioned drum breaks to tracks like “It’s not fair,” “Someone Else,” and “Hey, Hi, How are you?”, all of which dance around in the emotional gray area between the end of a relationship and the start of life’s next chapter. Variation comes in the form of “My Baby Loves to Dance,” which echoes with a distant, persistent electronic melody and staccato yelps, and the urgent, pounding of drum-’n’-bass-inspired percussion on “Only in My Mind.” While Grace’s signature sound—soft, glitchy dance pop complementing a featherlight, lilting vocal—has earned her comparisons to peers like PinkPantheress and Charli XCX, <i>The After Taste</i> proves the rising star is in a lane of her own.","short":"Sample the soft, subtle flavor of the rising dance star's striking debut EP."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d8/03/38/d80338e9-9147-c889-edb6-adc69580ccfb/093624844365.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"2e2d2d","textColor2":"3b0400","textColor4":"5d302d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6e1e5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-after-taste/1735988841","playParams":{"id":"1735988841","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48LLbdWgJTes4u2R324tdC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735988841/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1476584041","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1476584041?l=en-US"}]}}},"1736539363":{"id":"1736539363","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736539363?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kenya-vaun/1374926684","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8d/25/1b/8d251b2b-61f4-7199-33a0-f622b6037bfb/91dd8aa5-dfcb-463b-a00c-6effa8645623.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d1d6d8","textColor2":"afd8f5","textColor4":"98bdd7","textColor1":"f5f6f7","bgColor":"3f545f","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Honeymoon Phase","artistName":"Kenya Vaun","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/f8/c7/9ff8c792-ecae-e5dd-adfa-2dac7f184986/075679660275.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"babbaa","textColor2":"d1beb2","textColor4":"b1a297","textColor1":"dcddc9","bgColor":"33342c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-honeymoon-phase/1736539363","playParams":{"id":"1736539363","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4WfYXkR5ufqGEyZteQHzkT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736539363/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1374926684","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1374926684?l=en-US"}]}}},"1736626261":{"id":"1736626261","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736626261?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/6lack/1016633280","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/42/88/cc/4288cc27-3708-3ab0-d3d4-832ba2eb80eb/af6d7f80-3601-4476-859c-1c1cee8c5d47.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0b59a","textColor2":"dac2a1","textColor4":"b6a389","textColor1":"e6d8b7","bgColor":"282828","hasP3":false}},"name":"No More Lonely Nights (Acoustic) -

She’d written much of that record in her bedroom, free of expectation, having never played a show. The week before it was finally released, the then-18-year-old singer-songwriter would get to perform for the first time, only to televised audiences in the millions, at the BRIT Awards in London and on <i>SNL</i> in New York. Some artists debut—Rodrigo <i>arrived</i>.\n\nBut looking past the hype and the hoo-ha and the pressures of a famously sold-out first tour (during a pandemic, no less), trying to write as anticipated a follow-up album as there’s been in a very long time, she had a realization: “All I have to do is make music that I would like to hear on the radio, that I would add to my playlist,” she says. “That's my sole job as an artist making music; everything else is out of my control. Once I started really believing that, things became a lot easier.” \n\nWritten alongside trusted producer Dan Nigro, <i>GUTS</i> is both natural progression and highly confident next step. Boasting bigger and sleeker arrangements, the high-stakes piano ballads here feel high-stakes-ier (“vampire”), and the pop-punk even punkier (“all-american bitch,” which somehow splits the difference between Hole and Cat Stevens’ “Here Comes My Baby”). If <i>SOUR</i> was, in part, the sound of Rodrigo picking up the pieces post-heartbreak, <i>GUTS</i> finds her fully healed and wholly liberated—laughing at herself (“love is embarrassing”), playing chicken with disaster (the Go-Go’s-y “bad idea right?”), not so much seeking vengeance as delighting in it (“get him back!”). This is Anthem Country, joyride music, a set of smart and immediately satisfying pop songs informed by time spent onstage, figuring out what translates when you’re face-to-face with a crowd. “Something that can resonate on a recording maybe doesn't always resonate in a room full of people,” she says. “I think I wrote this album with the tour in mind.”\n\nAnd yet there are still moments of real vulnerability, the sort of intimate and sharply rendered emotional terrain that made Rodrigo so relatable from the start. She’s straining to keep it together on “making the bed,” bereft of good answers on “logical,” in search of hope and herself on gargantuan closer “teenage dream.” Alone at a piano again, she tries to make sense of a betrayal on “the grudge,” gathering speed and altitude as she goes, each note heavier than the last, “drivers license”-style. But then she offers an admission that doesn’t come easy if you’re sweating a reaction: “It takes strength to forgive, but I don’t feel strong.” In hindsight, she says, this album is “about the confusion that comes with becoming a young adult and figuring out your place in this world and figuring out who you want to be. I think that that's probably an experience that everyone has had in their life before, just rising from that disillusionment.” Read on as Rodrigo takes us inside a few songs from <i>GUTS</i>. \n\n<b>“all-american bitch”</b>\n“It's one of my favorite songs I've ever written. I really love the lyrics of it and I think it expresses something that I've been trying to express since I was 15 years old—this repressed anger and feeling of confusion, or trying to be put into a box as a girl.”\n\n<b>“vampire”</b>\n“I wrote the song on the piano, super chill, in December of [2022]. And Dan and I finished writing it in January. I've just always been really obsessed with songs that are very dynamic. My favorite songs are high and low, and reel you in and spit you back out. And so we wanted to do a song where it just crescendoed the entire time and it reflects the pent-up anger that you have for a situation.”\n\n<b>“get him back!”</b>\n“Dan and I were at Electric Lady Studios in New York and we were writing all day. We wrote a song that I didn't like and I had a total breakdown. I was like, ‘God, I can't write songs. I'm so bad at this. I don't want to.’ Being really negative. Then we took a break and we came back and we wrote ‘get him back!’ Just goes to show you: Never give up.”\n\n<b>“teenage dream”</b>\n“Ironically, that's actually the first song we wrote for the record. The last line is a line that I really love and it ends the album on a question mark: ‘They all say that it gets better/It gets better the more you grow/They all say that it gets better/What if I don't?’ I like that it’s like an ending, but it's also a question mark and it's leaving it up in the air what this next chapter is going to be. It's still confused, but it feels like a final note to that confusion, a final question.”","short":"Read our interview and hear the expanded edition with five new songs."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/4c/6a/5a4c6aac-318a-b5a6-a481-15141d65fddc/24UMGIM30484.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6c1c8","textColor2":"daa683","textColor4":"b58a74","textColor1":"efebec","bgColor":"231b3a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/guts-spilled/1736994915","playParams":{"id":"1736994915","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736994915/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"979458609","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/979458609?l=en-US"}]}}},"1737149923":{"id":"1737149923","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737149923?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-03-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=128050210-670534462","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ae/78/c1/ae78c18f-ea4c-2096-de97-ade3a201ee1e/8d69ce51-eb89-424c-a2d7-c51195a5d6eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"959ca6","textColor2":"a6b7d0","textColor4":"8896aa","textColor1":"b6bfcc","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/62/f0/6b62f038-f4e7-1ef1-0cab-53abe8e56de6/fc36d631-d484-4510-a357-316a4409e9f7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a1a2a9","textColor2":"c9b8bb","textColor4":"a49699","textColor1":"c5c7ce","bgColor":"111114","hasP3":false}},"name":"WE DON'T TRUST YOU","artistName":"Future & Metro Boomin","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Those who’ve been following Metro Boomin’s career from the beginning have probably heard his signature drop a hundred or so times: “If Young Metro don’t trust you, I’m gon’ shoot you,” warbled by Future himself. There’s something mysteriously catchy about the tagline, which the producer has appended to handfuls of hits over the years. So it’s a fitting title for the first full-length project between Metro and Future, whose previous collaborations make for some of the most essential tracks in the Atlanta rapper’s canon, from early heaters “Karate Chop” and “Honest” to 2017’s mega-viral “Mask Off.” (The latter hit marked the last time the two collaborated; if that hiatus seems painfully lengthy, they’re currently making up for it, having teased a second joint album to follow later this year.)\n\nFuture and Metro might not trust you, but they clearly have faith in each other—11 years after “Maison Margiela,” the duo’s chemistry remains strong, enabling each other’s more experimental whims. That means in addition to classic Future Hendrix heartbreak ballads like “Runnin Outta Time” and classic Super Future hedonist anthems à la “Fried (She a Vibe),” you get curveballs like the Giorgio Moroder-esque “Type Shit,” the Cash Money-circa-1998 mood of “Like That,” or “Everyday Hustle,” whose warm soul sample coaxes a rare appearance from the super smooth Future Mayfield, as well as Rick Ross. Well into their respective veteran years, the two still sound like they’re having fun, especially on closing track “Where My Twin @,” which introduces an instant-classic Future bar into the lexicon: “In the courtroom/I’m on mushrooms.”\n","short":"The longtime collaborators offer up their first—but not last—joint
