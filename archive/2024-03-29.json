Album and Interview","standard":"J.S. Bach spent most of his life in the service of the Lutheran church, composing weekly, and at speed, vast amounts of organ music and cantatas. But between the years of 1717 and 1723, the German Baroque composer was employed at the court of Prince Leopold in Cöthen. Freed from liturgical pressures, he conceived the majority of his greatest secular works, including the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i>, Orchestral Suites, music for solo violin and cello, a number of violin concertos, and a good deal more. \n\nOstensibly, there are two concertos for solo violin and orchestra. One in A Minor, the other in E Minor. But there is little doubt, now, that Bach later rearranged the solo parts of a number of concertos for harpsichord (and changed the keys). Today, we can add two more violin concertos to the catalog: G Minor and D Minor. “I think that the D Minor is the one that was a revelation for me when I first listened to a recording as a student,” Leonidas Kavakos tells Apple Music Classical. “It was one of the most powerful musical experiences I’ve had. It’s like a grand concerto. He almost never wrote anything like it before or after.”\n\nJust a year or so after his album of Bach’s complete music for solo violin, the Greek violinist has recorded here the “complete set” of four solo violin concertos with a small, one-to-part handpicked group, The Apollon Ensemble. There’s a vibrancy to their recording, partly due to the size of the ensemble, but also thanks to the use of modern steel strings. Kavakos and Apollon hover between modernity and a period-instrument approach, crafting an intimate atmosphere where soloist and ensemble are at one. A blissful union of old and new.\n\nIf those modern steel strings bring vibrancy, they also add richness. And the use of modern bows helps Kavakos and his ensemble reach greater levels of expression. “The quality of the sound of the modern bow does not compare,” he says. “Everybody speaks about articulation with a Baroque bow, but nobody speaks about, for instance, the really restricted dynamics. With a Baroque bow, you can only play so strongly. There is no way to play more than a certain amount of volume.” \n\nBut this is no big-boned Bach. Kavakos’ approach to this music comes on the back of a realization in his youth that the German composer’s music had to be approached differently. “My generation emerged from an environment of huge personalities in the violin world,” says Kavakos. “And that dictated a way of playing Bach that was absolutely wrong for me. In the solo works, the way the polyphony was pronounced and served was wrong from a technical point of view, as well as the music’s expressivity.” It took him 10 years to find his own pathway. “I am much more at ease with this music because I now know there is a way to bring a modern and new approach to it,” he says.\n\n“I feel that the concertos have yet to be explored in a way that offers a different experience, not just acoustically, but also from a musical point of view,” Kavakos continues. “And that's why I created this ensemble. I thought, I want to have an ensemble that is not going to sound like an orchestra. I want something that’s going to be very personal, but also very present. And, because it’s just one person per voice, very flexible and independent.”\n\nIn contrast to the vast spaces of Bach’s former places of work, such as the Divi Blasii church in Mühlhausen, the court at Cöthen offered smaller rooms and less reverberant acoustics. Bach’s music was therefore undoubtedly scored for smaller ensembles. “There are many times in the concertos when the orchestra repeats motifs that are in the solo part,” he explains. “If you look at the third movement of the Violin Concerto in G Minor, the soloist and the first violin part is like a double concerto. And so, while there is a personal solo voice, how can we depersonalize the other voices that are equally important?”\n\nA smaller ensemble allows the harpsichord to be heard much more clearly, too. Harpsichordist Iason Marmaras adds improvisatory elements that, Kavakos says, inspired the whole ensemble. “Iason does all kinds of things that bring to the music this unbelievable richness and this freedom,” says Kavakos. “It was almost as if I didn’t need the orchestra!” he adds, with a laugh.\n\nIn the months leading up to this album, Kavakos has lived and breathed these concertos. At journey’s end, it’s the slow movements that, for him, rise far above. “If Bach only wrote these movements, they would be enough to define him as the greatest of all. Each and every one of these slow movements are just out of this world,” he says. “They're totally different, not only in key, of course, but also in character, in architecture, in concept, in everything. But each of them takes you somewhere. It's like you are in heaven, like you are somewhere outside this world.”","short":"“It's like you are in heaven, like you are somewhere outside this world.”"},"playParams":{"id":"1727136318","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bach-violin-concertos/1727136318"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727136318/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"31304425","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31304425?l=en-US"},{"id":"1727136329","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1727136329?l=en-US"}]}}},"1727166376":{"id":"1727166376","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727166376?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kapote/986751499","name":"Electric Slide - EP","artistName":"Kapote","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/97/d1/f4/97d1f4de-c1a4-dd26-f88d-1b34656e2557/0880655516145.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"b973f5","textColor4":"945cc4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1727166376","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/electric-slide-ep/1727166376"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727166376/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"986751499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/986751499?l=en-US"}]}}},"1727790984":{"id":"1727790984","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727790984?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/enrique-iglesias/90895","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/b6/8f/f5/b68ff5aa-f280-bb89-523f-297e72662800/Job62172c3e-1392-46fb-9e2c-c70f9803e3dd-163666989-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_317182640_1696290862-Time1708965557957.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","531716"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"c0c0b8"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2f2f2c","textColor2":"531716","textColor4":"6b3a39","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c0c0b8","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7c/42/0a/7c420a88-a2d1-8b00-b88c-6a589d683c0b/e139f477-8ad4-4891-adea-d21101d95fd2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8babb9","textColor2":"8ebfd5","textColor4":"759eb2","textColor1":"a9cfdf","bgColor":"111a25","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/12/ca/51/12ca517f-cb9a-534b-71cf-e401fff2520f/Jobbdc65f21-e2f9-4136-89b5-f20b8cf48222-163666990-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_317182641_1696290863-Time1708967420302.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2d2e2a","textColor2":"191a16","textColor4":"3e3f39","textColor1":"040503","bgColor":"d2d1c8","hasP3":false}},"name":"FINAL (Vol.2)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Enrique Iglesias","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Whether singing in English, Spanish, or both, Enrique Iglesias will go down in history as one of pop’s finest practitioners.

From there, he teams up with Orishas mainstay Yotuel for “Fría,” pop veteran Belinda for the roots reggae jam “Llórame Un Río,” and dembow don El Alfa for the floor-filling “La Botella.” As on the first volume, he flexes the other side of his bilingual muscles for the emotional exhortations of “Be Together” and “Love and Pain,” as well as the Miranda Lambert-assisted ballad \"Space in My Heart.” And if this is truly goodbye, the moving “Espacio en Tu Corazón” makes for a finale to remember.","short":"The bilingual pop superstar bids farewell in the best possible way."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d5/b8/9f/d5b89f4d-c42d-cd1e-0744-a9c138a23942/196871615952.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"35352f","textColor2":"1e1f1a","textColor4":"42433d","textColor1":"0d0e09","bgColor":"d3d3c9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/final-vol-2/1727790984","playParams":{"id":"1727790984","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5LHd4piJoHcz4CXhjsFKxx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727790984/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"90895","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/90895?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728094321":{"id":"1728094321","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728094321?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kelly-moran/1448255815","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Moves in the Field","artistName":"Kelly Moran","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c9/99/0b/c9990b40-9bd3-3bd1-527a-9ad6b9ba37a4/5056614795622.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb9e88","textColor2":"d6ae89","textColor4":"ad8d71","textColor1":"e8c3a7","bgColor":"090a0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moves-in-the-field/1728094321","playParams":{"id":"1728094321","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1z0KCPqug2XNK68UyPT4zz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728094321/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1448255815","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1448255815?l=en-US"}]}}},"1729681395":{"id":"1729681395","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729681395?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gesaffelstein/283928791","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9d/9f/62/9d9f62be-cc33-8002-3aca-3be3bcab021f/4e11d029-d874-4c1f-9484-d26131ed4255.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bdcccf","textColor2":"c9d2d1","textColor4":"a8b2b4","textColor1":"e3f3f3","bgColor":"263143","hasP3":false}},"name":"GAMMA","artistName":"Gesaffelstein","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The French techno heavyweight plunges into New Wave."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/61/d3/10/61d3104a-6b3d-1015-6594-6289330027a3/196871778114.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"252625","textColor2":"1d1e1b","textColor4":"383836","textColor1":"060706","bgColor":"a3a2a0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gamma/1729681395","playParams":{"id":"1729681395","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5XinwAQBhLsp1NrFjfqzLO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729681395/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"283928791","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/283928791?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730127659":{"id":"1730127659","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730127659?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3b/50/8e/3b508eab-10bd-a993-ae58-a884e086bb12/32dce7b8-bde7-40c6-8a8f-094a69b13952.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"172129","textColor2":"050405","textColor4":"172128","textColor1":"040405","bgColor":"6295b8","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/josh-ross/1476860883","name":"Complicated","artistName":"Josh Ross","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Josh Ross is part of a growing contingent of emerging country artists who find inspiration outside of the genre.

On <i>Complicated</i>, Ross builds on the success of hit single “Trouble,” a soulful ballad about drowning heartbreak at a dive bar.

Like bandmate RM before him, j-hope uses <i>HOPE ON THE STREET VOL.1</i> as an opportunity to collaborate with other artists—both from Korea and the US. On lead single “NEURON,” an old-school, naughts-inspired hip-hop track named after the underground dance crew j-hope first joined in middle school, the artist splits the verses with South Korean rappers Gaeko and YOON MIRAE. All three rap about the vitality of their origins and the importance of staying grounded in simple passions. “Music and family, that's what it's all about/They keep me going like day in and day out,” sings Yoon in the final verse.\n\nThe album includes two songs revamped from previously released versions: a slightly softer dance mix of “What If,” which was a B-side on j-hope's 2022 solo debut <i>Jack in the Box</i>, and a solo version of “On the Street,” j-hope’s 2023 single collaboration with American rapper J. Cole. The former brings on South Korean rapper and singer JINBO the SuperFreak, while the latter gives the song’s central rap verse back to j-hope, who uses it to question our individual choices within the broader vagaries of time: “What the hell is time?/Is it medicine, evil, fate?/For us, knowing the way and walking are different/I'm just walking all night, all night (all right).” In this solo version, “On the Street” remains a fan song (“The distance between you and the whole world/Our street full of stories and textures”)—a message to ARMY, aka fans of BTS, as the group members continue their time away from the music industry.\n\nFrequent BTS behind-the-scenes collaborators Melanie Joy Fontana and Michel Schulz share songwriting credits with Big Hit producer Pdogg and j-hope on “i wonder,” a slim, funky love song (“Just enjoy it, this love/We can keep forever falling”) that features bandmate Jung Kook’s smooth vocals. On “lock/unlock,” j-hope collaborates with superproducer benny blanco and guitar legend Nile Rodgers for a groovy English-language track that allows the rapper to show off his lesser-heard pop music vocals. HYBE colleague Huh Yunjin, the Korean American singer of LE SSERAFIM, comes along for “i don’t know,” a low-key dance track about a relationship on a precipice: “Guess we're on the edge/Tryna figure out what's really on your mind.” While short, <i>HOPE ON THE STREET VOL.1</i> feels like the first chapter of a larger story, with the album’s “volume” designation promising more reflections on where j-hope came from, and how those origins still influence the K-pop superstar today.","short":"The BTS rapper’s six-track project pays tribute to his street-dance roots."},"playParams":{"id":"1730608078","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hope-on-the-street-vol-1-ep/1730608078"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730608078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1354883995","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1354883995?l=en-US"}]}}},"1731930726":{"id":"1731930726","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1731930726?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Pre-Rolled Joints, Vol. 3: 100% Jungle & Breaks","artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/5a/a7/ac/5aa7ac0e-dc8d-dee3-dd4c-fdf87ce70f5d/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c8c4a8","textColor2":"bfe9a5","textColor4":"aac991","textColor1":"e4e3c2","bgColor":"574a41","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pre-rolled-joints-vol-3-100-jungle-breaks/1731930726","playParams":{"id":"1731930726","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Lz3pGgC3CjaUS16SgLDbs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1731930726/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}}},"1732481280":{"id":"1732481280","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732481280?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-polo/1339659881","name":"If the Glove Fits EP","artistName":"DJ Polo","artwork":{"width":3626,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/0a/62/b6/0a62b62f-b479-e0b0-c615-23d0a95ea5fd/3663729297396_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3626,"textColor3":"252e34","textColor2":"120405","textColor4":"272e34","textColor1":"0f0405","bgColor":"7dd3f2","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1732481280","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/if-the-glove-fits-ep/1732481280","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0OFp3cSXSXP2hUd0PhGvhY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732481280/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1339659881","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1339659881?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732625524":{"id":"1732625524","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732625524?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/buddy/888074386","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/57/b0/f7/57b0f760-2ffc-6f18-d705-e6cc11d033ae/d2153f37-066a-4a0d-9247-6e01981de490.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bac3c6","textColor2":"d3e0e4","textColor4":"a9b4b8","textColor1":"e9f2f6","bgColor":"000409","hasP3":false}},"name":"Don't Forget To Breathe","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Buddy","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/23/f8/79/23f879ed-4b19-2e1a-4f26-386e400e8b04/197342474092_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3c0b6","textColor2":"bae6e7","textColor4":"9cbdbd","textColor1":"d7e9de","bgColor":"221d17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-forget-to-breathe/1732625524","playParams":{"id":"1732625524","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4bL9AVepWWKbg11Th0kGj0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732625524/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"888074386","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/888074386?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732728408":{"id":"1732728408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732728408?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/ee/aa/e7/eeaae7ca-7c9d-55b0-00a4-dac43348d785/bc0b0e38-60c5-475a-b221-4617b6f98753.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"99b3ca","textColor2":"5fd110","textColor4":"50ab10","textColor1":"badbf8","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fraggle-rock/267256000","name":"Fraggle Rock: Back To The Rock -

Originally debuting as the teen-only unit of SM supergroup NCT in 2016, NCT DREAM has since settled on a fixed, seven-member composition. With <i>DREAM( )SCAPE</i>, members Mark, Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle, and Jisung use six tracks to express the various moods and feelings of life as early twentysomething K-pop stars. Continuing the unofficial K-pop tradition of naming songs after beverages, hip-hop dance track “Smoothie” steers with swagger. The lead single uses whispers, shouts, repeating chants, and the occasional sipping sound over an 808 bassline to rap about blending criticisms into something they can “sip… down like [a] smoothie.”\n\nElsewhere on the mini album, hypnotic intro track “icantfeelanything” sets the mood, beckoning listeners—both in the context of the project and in life: “I might've been afraid to be brave, come on/A place I've never been to, an unfamiliar way, come on.” “BOX” is a song of escape “from the restraints of yesterday.” While the hip-hop track’s message of breaking out of the expectations that can bind us could apply to many situations, lyrics like “I’m a drummer boy/And I play with the rhythms” mark the song as an industry proclamation. \n\nIn upbeat banger “Carat Cake,” NCT DREAM explores the seductiveness of exorbitant wealth, singing: “Got you saying/ Wow, wow, wow, wow/That’s a Carat Cake.” “UNKNOWN” is the emotional heart of the album, slowing things down for a song of comfort and support for fans, known as 7DREAM: “Don't change, let go/Be brave, be strong/But take it easy, no rush/I know you got it.” Finally, “Breathing” is an anguished plea of a love song, asking someone to stay: “You’re my last chance/I don’t have any air without you/I know I'm no good without you, baby/Can you stay all night?”","short":"Six tracks chronicling life as early twentysomething K-pop stars."},"playParams":{"id":"1734330976","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dream-scape-ep/1734330976"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734330976/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1208839599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1208839599?l=en-US"}]}}},"1734500886":{"id":"1734500886","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734500886?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/05/a5/fa/05a5fae5-38c8-e025-1857-d99fd0b3aaf8/868be5c2-9f3c-4e47-9e73-157ae276b991.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"373a3d","textColor2":"1c1d1f","textColor4":"383d41","textColor1":"1a191a","bgColor":"a8bfcb","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/illit/1734551937","name":"SUPER REAL ME -

They’re like, ‘Oh my God, it’s the best time of my life, 2019,’” Dímelo Flow tells Apple Music. “It was just not the music; it was more the experience plus the music.” The hit-making producer is referring to his reggaetón fan favorite <i>The Academy</i>, a project that brought together then-rising stars Dalex, Feid, Justin Quiles, Sech, and Lenny Tavárez like some superhero squadron. The feelings expressed over that seven-song set only grew as its individual members saw their solo profiles soar. “That’s what made us put this project together: the love for the people.”\n\nThough for legal reasons they officially record as The Academy, fans of the supergroup and its members know them collectively as The Avengers, a comic book movie metaphor that Dímelo Flow happily employs while discussing their long-awaited follow-up <i>Segunda Misión</i>. (He sees himself as the Nick Fury of the group, FYI.) Despite the title’s implication, there was an abandoned attempt at a second project from the group prior to <i>Segunda Misión</i>. “We tried to put it together before, then we said no,” he explains, citing priorities with the members’ own respective projects that he often had a hand in making. “Actually, we had a lot of songs together, and we were in the studio a lot.”\n\nWith a stunning guest list of Latin music superheroes, including Eladio Carrión, NATTI NATASHA, and Myke Towers, this blockbuster sequel enhances the group’s core to produce an event-worthy series of songs sure to fill dance floors for months to come. And while not every member was available this time around, the ones who were ensured that their powers are used to full effect. Read on to learn the details behind the latest mission from The Academy—in Dímelo Flow’s own words.\n\n<b>“SÍ SÍ SÍ SÍ” (feat. Bryant Myers, Dei V & Eladio Carrión)</b>\n“It’s part of my role—what superhero I’m going to send for this mission, just like the movies. For me, it’s all about the vibes. I was like, ‘OK, who can fit this record?’ I started doing the whole structure in my head. I did it so many times, and I did it for so many records in my life that, for me, as a producer it becomes easy now.”\n\n<b>“LA RANGER” (feat. Myke Towers)</b>\n“One of the superheroes got injured. Do you remember that part when Hulk said he didn’t want to go to the mission? Well, it happened just like that on this one. Daddy Yankee was actually on that track, and then we decided to call another superhero. Yankee, you obviously know that he separated from the music. So, we brought Myke in. He loved the track.”\n\n<b>“FLOWHOT” (feat. Arcángel, De La Ghetto & Randy)</b>\n“I don’t know if you remember when the music was only the websites. You had La Pirateria, and the songs came out there. Well, FlowHoT was one of the pages that we grew up on. That’s why we called it like that—to pay respect on and pay honor to those guys. That’s why it makes sense that we brought in Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Randy.”\n\n<b>“LATTE” (feat. Maria Becerra)</b>\n“It was actually partly Sech’s idea. He’s like, ‘Bro, we don’t have no women on here.’ We respect women, and we always want to have women to be in our projects, because it feels good always. We decided to bring Maria Becerra in on this one; we always wanted to represent with a girl. That’s The Avengers.”\n\n<b>“EL ROYCE” (feat. NATTI NATASHA & iZaak)</b>\n“As a producer, I’m very creative when I make music. I want people to live what I’m doing. If you listen to all the end of the tracks, they all have something different. Every song has something different out of the end—a message, to actually give it a different vibe. Since the records are so long, you don’t get bored of the record—never. It’s always those mid-credits when you finish the movie, and you wait. It’s like you’re getting a new song, but you’re not.”\n\n<b>“QUÍTENME EL TELÉFONO” (feat. Jay Wheeler & Yandel)</b>\n“We actually made that track together, all of us in the studio. And then, we brought in Yandel and Jay Wheeler. And that’s how that song came out like that. It is something real, what the song says. You know when you always out, and you’re having a drink or you’re thinking about that ex, and then you call her? That’s what you say in the hook.”\n\n<b>“AMIGA” (feat. Ryan Castro)</b>\n“It’s a very Colombian vibe. That crowd loves us over there. I was like, ‘Yo, we got to do something for Colombia.’ Castro’s style of music—we needed something a little rough on there, more rap to it than what we had. This is perfect for him to get on this record.”\n\n<b>“SEÑORITA” (feat. Zion)</b>\n“To be honest, actually ‘SEÑORITA” was made for the second one, and it never released. We had Zion in there already. Then, two years passed by, and that song was still there.”\n\n<b>“BLINBLINEO” (feat. Omar Courtz)</b>\n“We believe in the new rising stars. How we came up. We were new—nobody knew about us when The Avengers came out. We were competing with the big top dogs at that time, and we were rising stars ourself, so we always try to give the opportunity, with iZaak, with Omar Courtz. It was very important.”","short":"Dímelo Flow reassembles the reggaetón

Highlights include Darius Rucker and Hailey Whitters taking on Diffie’s 1990 debut single, “Home,” as well as the unreleased original song “Life Had Plans for Me,” which features Diffie’s son, Parker Diffie. The emotional compilation is timed to the fourth anniversary of Diffie’s passing, with the late star’s estate helping shape the final project.","short":"HARDY rounds up famous friends to pay tribute to the late Joe Diffie."},"playParams":{"id":"1738307248","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hixtape-vol-3-difftape/1738307248","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4zdLttjbtQN3KWbeBEXL1O"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738307248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"329275","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/329275?l=en-US"},{"id":"1478347921","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1478347921?l=en-US"}]}}},"1738363766":{"id":"1738363766","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738363766?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"releaseDate":"2024-03-29","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/8e/32/ce8e326c-0a50-4388-ed5b-4732555a20e7/3d6ea25d-8bb4-4207-bc6c-ec10eb6eae6c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3b3b3","textColor2":"c2c2c2","textColor4":"a0a0a0","textColor1":"dadada","bgColor":"191919","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/00/4e/4e/004e4e08-91f5-4b09-c32f-78111220f582/ffa84b9e-2d13-4d4e-944c-d8049403cb43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ab9999","textColor2":"c4bab1","textColor4":"9c958d","textColor1":"d6c0c0","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/beyonc%C3%A9/1419227","name":"COWBOY CARTER","artistName":"Beyoncé","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bd/f6/83/bdf683a5-28de-08cb-cb91-2940c1e6270b/196871853729.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3aaa2","textColor2":"cfc8c2","textColor4":"a5a09b","textColor1":"e0d5ca","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Genres are a funny little concept, aren’t they?” Linda Martell cackles at the beginning of “SPAGHETTII.” Perhaps the name Linda Martell isn’t a household one, which only proves her point. She was the first Black woman to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, but her attempt to move from soul and R&B into the realm of country in the 1960s was met with racist resistance—everything from heckling to outright blackballing. Beyoncé knows the feeling, as she explained in an uncharacteristically vulnerable Instagram post revealing that her eighth studio album was inspired by a deep dive into the history of Black country music following an experience where she felt similarly unwelcome. <i>COWBOY CARTER</i> is a sprawling 80-minute tribute not only to those pioneering artists and their outlaw spirit, but to the very futility of reducing music to a single identifying word.\n\nAnother key quote from that post: “This ain’t a country album. This is a Beyoncé album.” It’s more than a catchy slogan; anyone looking for mere honky-tonk cosplay is missing a much richer and more complex point. Listening in full to Act II of the presumed trilogy Bey began with 2022’s <i>RENAISSANCE</i>, it’s clear that the perennial overachiever hasn’t merely “gone country,” she’s interrogating what the word even means—and who merits the designation. On “AMERIICAN REQUIEM,” in a voice deep and earthy as Texas red dirt, the Houston native sings, “Used to say I spoke too country/And then the rejection came, said I wasn’t country enough.” She nods again, as she’s done before on songs like “Formation,” to her family ties to Alabama moonshiners and Louisiana Creoles. “If that ain’t country,” she wonders, “tell me what is.”\n\nWith subtlety and swagger, she contextualizes country as an offshoot of the Black American musical canon, a storytelling mode springing from and evolving alongside gospel and blues. Over the wistful pedal steel and gospel organ of “16 CARRIAGES,” she tells you what it’s like to be a teenage workhorse who grows into an adult perfectionist obsessed with ideas of legacy, with a bit of family trauma buried among the riffs. On “YA YA,” Beyoncé expands the scope to rock ’n’ roll at its most red-blooded and fundamental, playing the parts of both Ike and Tina as she interpolates The Beach Boys and slips in a slick Playboi Carti reference, yowling: “My family lived and died in America/Good ol’ USA/Whole lotta red in that white and blue/History can’t be erased.” A Patsy Cline standard goes Jersey club mode on “SWEET ★ HONEY ★ BUCKIIN’,” with a verse from the similarly genre-flouting Shaboozey and a quick note regarding <i>RENAISSANCE</i>‘s Grammy fortunes: “AOTY I ain’t win/I ain’t stuntin’ ’bout them/Take that shit on the chin/Come back and fuck up the pen.” \n\nWho but Beyoncé could make a crash course in American music history feel like the party of the year? There’s the one-two punch of sorely needed summer slow-dance numbers: the Miley Cyrus duet “II MOST WANTED,” with its whispers of Fleetwood Mac, followed by “LEVII’S JEANS” with Post Malone, the “in those jeans” anthem filling the radio’s Ginuwine-shaped hole. <i>RENAISSANCE</i>’s euphorically nasty house bounce returns, albeit with more banjo, on “RIIVERDANCE,” where “II HANDS II HEAVEN” floats on clouds of ’90s electronica for an ode to alternately riding wild horses and 24-inch spinners on candy paint. (Houston, Texas, baby!) There are do-si-do ditties, murder ballads, daddy issues, whiskey kisses, hungover happy hours, cornbread and grits, Beatles covers, smoke breaks, and, on “DAUGHTER,” what may or may not be a wink in the direction of the artist who won AOTY instead.\n\nThere’s also a Dolly-approved Beyoncification of “Jolene,” to whom the protagonist is neither saying please nor begging on the matter of taking her man. (“Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene,” Bey purrs, ice in her veins.) Is this a genre-bucking hoedown? A chess move? A reckoning? A requiem? If anyone can pull it off, it’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>, as country as it gets.","short":"Who else could make a crash course in American music history feel like a
