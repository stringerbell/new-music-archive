Edge - EP","artistName":"Northlane","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Born from a writing retreat in Victoria’s Yarra Valley to address internal tension, Northlane’s <i>Mirror’s Edge</i> fruitfully ticks the boxes for everything the Sydney metal innovators do so well. That includes stuttered electronic elements and battle-ready riffs mingling with stark dynamic shifts and Marcus Bridge’s soaring vocals. Songwriter/guitarist Jon Deiley calls the EP “the greatest hits of Northlane sounds,” and that retrospective feel also accounts for some guest spots that represent foundational influences on the band’s journey. Following the atmospheric warm-up of the opening title track, “Afterimage” adds Karnivool and Birds of Tokyo vocalist Ian Kenny to the mix for a dramatic, prog-leaning scorcher. “Miasma” then calls in the cavernous crush of Parkway Drive’s Winston McCall, who inspired Northlane so much early on. Ex-bassist Brendon Padjasek (now of Structures) even shows up to scream against the uncertain throb and teeter of “Kraft,” while the unabashedly clubby closer “Dante” brings the EP full circle with its soft and dreamy outro. Rather than casually coast following the success of 2022’s <i>Obsidian</i>, these six songs find Northlane thoughtfully taking stock and then coming out roaring with renewed determination.","short":"Sydney’s metal innovators take stock—with help from a few special

Forget Me","artistName":"Maggie Rogers","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“There's something about this record that feels like I'm coming home,” Maggie Rogers tells Apple Music's Zane Lowe about her third full-length <i>Don't Forget Me</i>, which is the Maryland-born singer-songwriter's first project since completing her master's degree in religion and public life at Harvard Divinity School. Being away from the music business, she says, allowed her time to think about her life as an artist while also diversifying her mind. “I was trying to put so much in music,” she says. “Now my life is a lot more balanced and a lot more full—and I'm not saying by any means I have it figured out.”\n\n<i>Don't Forget Me</i> finds Rogers still on a path toward “figuring it out,” marrying the kineticism that made her breakthrough single “Alaska” such a sensation eight years prior with bigger sonic structures and wiser lyrics. Opener “It Was Coming All Along” thrums with plush synths and strings, as well as a sampled phone call that brings Rogers' lyrics about “trying to be brave these days” to life. “The Kill” possesses a grandness that recalls a sunny drive on an open road, which makes its story of a doomed relationship hit even harder.\n\nThat energy, together with a wiser perspective, enabled her to her explore stories from beyond her personal realm. Take “So Sick of Dreaming,” a sauntering, Nashville-tinged cut about the travails of twentysomething life punctuated by a frustrated monologue about being stood up for Knicks tickets. (“And by the way, the Knicks lost,” she dryly notes.) It's based on “a story that a friend had told to me the night before about another friend of hers that was going through this thing,” she says. “I never would've thought it was material; I had only written songs about things that were so personal to me.”\n\nBroadening her songwriting is another way Rogers lets loose on <i>Don't Forget Me</i>—and it's apparent across the album's 10 songs, which are confident even when they're grappling with regret and frustration. “I'm so focused and clear about the things that I want, and I've had different goals for every record or things that I really want to accomplish,” Rogers says. “The goal on this album cycle is, I'm trying to have fun. And if I don't think it's going to be fun, you probably won't find me there.”","short":"Ten songs exploring the lighter side of enlightenment: “I’m trying to have

Hubbard","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Tyler Hubbard—the Georgia half of the Florida Georgia Line equation—made his full-length debut as a solo artist with his 2023 self-titled LP. Now, Hubbard is opening for some of the same acts who once opened for FGL, and subsequently experiencing a second rise to fame a little over a decade after the duo broke out with “Cruise.” For this sophomore effort, Hubbard tells Apple Music he relished in reconnecting with fans, testing material during live shows and keeping tabs on which tunes seemed to resonate most. “A lot of this album was born on the road, was written on the road,” Hubbard says. “So I have the fans to thank. I feel like it was reverse-engineered a bit and inspired by the fans, and written for the fans and for the live show.”\n\n<i>Strong</i> opens with “Wish You Would,” an infectiously optimistic love song that sonically lands somewhere between Eric Church and Keith Urban. “American Mellencamp” pays tribute to its namesake and a simple style of living, with appropriately crunchy heartland rock production. On the title track, Hubbard celebrates lasting relationships, with John Mayer-style guitar flourishes and a cascading chorus melody. And highlight “'73 Beetle,” which Hubbard wrote solo, recounts a fond memory of a baby-blue Volkswagen he restored with his late father. Below, Hubbard breaks down a handful of key tracks. \n\n<b>“Take Me Back”</b>\n“I have an interesting relationship, I would say, with my hometown. So it was fun to write my hometown a letter, if you will, in that song. And also in our genre, there's so much pride in where you came from. Everybody's proud of their hometown, which I'm not saying I'm not proud of it—I'm very proud of where I came from—but maybe I wish that I still had that relationship with it, and it was equally as proud. Now I'm like, ‘Well, it served me well while I was there.’ But I had to leave to grow.”\n\n<b>“'73 Beetle”</b>\n“That song was written very similarly to how ‘Miss My Daddy’ was written—just in a time of being alone with my thoughts, wanting to write a song. Neither one of those songs did I ever intend on really putting on an album or releasing it. I just wrote for me, wrote them for probably therapeutic purposes, or to tell my kids about it or whatever the case is. And I feel like when I was putting this project together, I heard that song in the mix and I was like, it may be nice to have a follow-up, if you will, to ‘Miss My Daddy’ and let the fans in even more on a personal side of who I am, in kind of a cool way and a fun story and a very true story.”\n\n<b>“Strong”</b>\n“That word, when you really think about it, to me, it has a lot of depth. It has a lot of layers to it. If you listen to the song itself, it really touches on the strength in my marriage and within [my] relationships. And that's valuable to me, not only my marriage, but my friendships and any relationship that you build strength in, through time and work and all the things that it takes. So, yeah, that word's very dynamic for me, and it feels like something that's close to my heart. I'm always trying to get stronger, literally and figuratively as well, and relationally. So it just felt appropriate at the time.”","short":"The Georgia half of FGL road-tested his second solo album.

The award-winning artist, producer, and DJ—credited with spearheading a mainstream revival of jungle music—is the first to acknowledge that the sonic landscape of the album is an eclectic departure from her early sound. While elements of the production will be familiar to fans of Archives—including jungle pioneer Goldie and global superstar Beyoncé—<i>Silence Is Loud</i> rings with Britpop, Motown, and alternative rock influences, resulting in a wholly original listening experience that exposes the unconventional edge to her artistry. Coproduced with rising talent Ethan P. Flynn, whose credits include FKA twigs and slowthai, the record is beholden to the late-’90s/early-2000s era of organic, experimental pop dominated by William Orbit—albeit charged with the frenetic energy of drum patterns still firmly rooted in jungle. \n\nWhile tracks like “Cards on the Table,” “Crowded Roomz,” and “F.A.M.I.L.Y” see Archives explore recurring themes of loneliness, self-acceptance, parental estrangement, and love—both unconditional and unrequited—with her characteristic lyrical candour, <i>Silence Is Loud</i> leaves fewer places for the intensity of her words to hide behind. This reality is most clearly evidenced on the reprise of the title track, which strips away her typical percussive camouflage. “Jungle is so chaotic and intense that nobody really pays attention to the lyrics that much,” says Archives. “The drums take up a lot of space in the music—they’re like the heart, and when you take that away, it’s like the brain. Which is a bit much sometimes.”\n\nFor all the risk Archives has taken in releasing a body of work that resists the urge to chase trends in favour of presenting a true reflection of her own journey, <i>Silence Is Loud</i> succeeds in alchemizing its disparate parts into audio gold. “I played in a pub in London the other day and the people were singing along so loudly it made me think this isn’t just a viral-TikTok-moment album. It’s an album that people have to listen to, and then listen to again to take it in…[because] it’s something weird and new,” she says. “But I think I’ve got good taste in music, so that gives me a little bit of confidence in myself.” Read on to find out more about each track in Archives’ own words.\n\n<b>“Silence Is Loud”</b>\n“I wrote this song about my little brother, who is my little baby. He’s getting older and our relationship has changed so much. He’s changed so much, I’ve changed so much. I wanted to write about how I love him no matter what, and that is what unconditional love is to me. There’s no ifs or buts, it’s just pure love. I wrote it in bed and then I took it to Ethan. It’s the first song we made together. One of my favourite albums is <i>Aha Shake Heartbreak</i> by Kings of Leon, I’m so inspired by the lo-fi [sound] in their music. I really wanted a Kings of Leon-meets-Radiohead moment because <i>In Rainbows</i> is also one of my favourite albums.”\n\n<b>“Cards on the Table”</b>\n“I wanted to make a really hardcore Britpop jungle tune. It’s quite stripped-back breaks. I was hugely inspired by Blur, Pulp, Oasis, all that kind of vibe. I love Damon Albarn. If there’s anyone I would love to listen to the album, it would probably be him. Again, I wrote this in bed—I had a bit of a situationship with an Irish boy I met after a show in Dublin last year, so it’s a real story and my first time writing a song like this. I don’t really write love songs, but I was trying to have a bit of a Natasha Bedingfield moment. I’ve really tried to think of all the best songwriters to come out of the UK and focused on studying a lot of people. This was the first time I wrote a song and I felt like it was a ‘proper’ song.”\n\n<b>“Unfinished Business”</b>\n“This is the only song I’m worried about having to sing live because I’d just come back from a festival and I’d lost my voice, which is why it sounds so hoarse and rock ’n’ roll—I don’t know if I can re-sing it like that. I wrote it about realizing that everybody else has their own life before they’ve met you. Before you even say hello, they’ve already had so many experiences that have shaped them as a person. That’s actually quite positive. The production is quite four-four because I’ve been making loads of four-four music recently. And I also really wanted to make a Foo Fighters-inspired jungle tune because I loved the Foo Fighters when I was 14.”\n\n<b>“Crowded Roomz”</b>\n“We made this in the studio and it was a bit overwhelming. I was talking about loneliness—chronic loneliness. I feel like a lot of people my age experience loneliness. For me, with what I do—where it’s really high or low—it’s so heightened and you experience that a little bit more. And it was like, ‘Oh my god, this is actually a bit much, I can’t listen,’ because we listen to the same song on loop for four hours and it’s an intense one to listen to over and over again. The next day, we were like, ‘Oh, this is actually really good.’ I’ve been playing this one out and everyone screams the words, so I’m hoping that will be the vibe across the album. More of my sets have turned from hardcore jungle to a pop concert, which is cool.”\n\n<b>“Forbidden Feelingz”</b>\n“I feel like there’ll be a lot of people discovering me [through this new sound] and I really want them to hear where I’ve come from and how I got to this point. This is a nice moment for a switch-up, to be like, ‘I do this as well and if you want you can go back and discover all that stuff.’ I can never recreate this song, it’s one of my favourite songs I’ve ever made, so I didn’t want it to not be a part of an album that will hopefully shape the next few years of my life.”\n\n<b>“Blind Devotion”</b>\n“This is the longest project I’ve made in my life. I’m usually a 20-minute person, max. Towards the end I was like, ‘Oh my god, for an album to be an album it has to be 35 minutes, I need three [more] minutes to complete this thing, let’s make one more song.’ It’s one of the only new songs with the ‘old me’ sound, where it’s really clubby. We were going for that Massive Attack kind of vibe. We made this one at my studio and mine’s not got a lot of equipment. I try not to spend money on too much stuff. I’ve got 10 plug-ins, which is really weird as a producer, but I’d rather be the master of what I’ve got than have everything and not know how to use any of it. As a creative, you want a challenge and to feel like, ‘I’ve only got this, how do I make it sound interesting?’”\n\n<b>“Tell Me What It’s Like?”</b>\n“I said to Ethan that I wanted to make a song a bit like The Cranberries. The middle section, which is so happy, comes from another beat—the only song that didn’t make it on to the album. The rest of the song is quite dark and it was Ethan’s idea to put the two together. It’s about unrequited love, but not necessarily in a relationship sense, more related to my own life, but I guess people will take it however they want to take it. When I wrote it, I was inspired by Natalie Imbruglia’s kind of vibe. I sampled this voice note that Goldie sent me, because he sends me voice notes every week. He’s been a great listening ear and a real supporter. He’s someone I’m so inspired by and look up to—not just as a musician but as a person. He was quite gassed about it when I sent it to him.”\n\n<b>“Nightmares”</b>\n“I had my heart broken in Tokyo, which is hilarious and random. It’s like something out of a film. I came back from Asia and I was really sad, and the only way I can process my emotions is by making music. I wrote this song at home and then Ethan’s label let us use their spare studio, and he brought his guitar. I’d been listening to loads of Fleetwood Mac to get over my upset and I wanted to make something with that vibe. I thought ‘Nightmares don’t just happen when you’re sleeping’ was quite a funny play on words because what was happening felt like a real-life nightmare, which is so dramatic. This is the only song I kind of regret. I’ve never been really mean on a song in my life and the person I wrote about hasn’t heard it. I hope they don’t hate me because we’re kind of friends again now. But it’s a good song, so what can you do?”\n\n<b>“F.A.M.I.L.Y”</b>\n“I wrote this about my personal experience and my relationship with my family. This song is the end of that era, for me. I’m 25 this year, I feel like there’s only so many times you can be so caught up in things that cause you stress or upset you, so I really just wanted to say my piece and that’s it. There’s a little bit of acceptance within the song, understanding this is just the way things are and that’s OK, I guess. It was quite therapeutic. We recorded it in Ethan’s flat with me screaming and Ethan’s friend Felix [Stephens] playing the viola. My main inspiration was Estelle, ‘1980.’ There’s just a feeling I get when I listen to that song…I don’t know how to explain it. Even the video, where she’s sat on the stairs. It’s just a whole vibe I really wanted to capture with this song. It’s quite theatrical and I feel like the production reflects the drama.” \n\n<b>“Out of Options”</b>\n“I’d just been to the Motown Museum in Detroit for the first time and it was amazing. I love Motown. All the productions they made, just with what they had in those times, is actually crazy. It was such a booming Black industry that I’ve always been so inspired by. And I love The Ronettes, one of my favourite girl groups of all time. So I was really intensely listening to that kind of music and wanted to explore that sound. It was the only song I wrote on the spot and didn’t really have much that I wanted to say, but it was really fun recording how they would have recorded—standing in different spots in the room to create that big sound.”\n\n<b>“Silence Is Loud (Reprise)”</b>\n“Ethan suggested we do a reprise and I was kind of like, ‘Oh, I don’t know about that. Feels a little bit weird.’ But I trusted his gut. This was the only song we didn’t make in the UK. I was in L.A. on tour, and I hate making music in L.A., but we were at Sound Factory and we had all kinds of equipment and he was really having fun with the sound design. Throughout this album, I wanted to have loads of voice notes and anecdotes from people who mean something to me. So the voice talking at the start is my brother. In the middle, it’s loads of different voice notes from my friends, my friends’ parents who have become a really big part of my life, and my manager Tom, who’s my best friend. At the end is a sample of a video of all my friends from my birthday dinner. It’s quite emotional actually.”\n\n<b>“Killjoy !”</b>\n“I had a really nasty interaction with somebody who was quite close to me and this was me expressing that. It was the first time I was trying to think about how to make the words interesting and I love the way I wrote it. I made it at home and took it to Ethan, and what he brought to it was so cool—Massive Attack vibes with a bit of old-school IDM and jungle.”\n\n<b>“So Tell Me…”</b>\n“Another moment from a previous project. If I didn’t make [2023 EP] <i>Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall</i>, this song would have been on the album anyway—it felt like a good end.”","short":"The producer/singer expands her sound: “It’s something weird and new.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/6c/d3/c16cd3a3-3ccd-2b26-7438-40abbceb6498/23UM1IM66051.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c3c2","textColor2":"ed9c80","textColor4":"c3806a","textColor1":"efefef","bgColor":"1c1412","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/silence-is-loud/1728850551","playParams":{"id":"1728850551","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7aIsJRcf04ZeFiU1Fa70Cq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728850551/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1515978311","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1515978311?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728927016":{"id":"1728927016","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728927016?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-04-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/10/84/4c/10844cee-ab3c-a319-ce29-af35e2f632a5/13d629c3-6ca0-4904-93dd-9088745611a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b4ada0","textColor2":"c5c0b7","textColor4":"9e9a92","textColor1":"e0d8c8","bgColor":"050000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jade-bird/1167712148","name":"Burn The Hard Drive - EP","artistName":"Jade Bird","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"How to make sense of broken love with questing acoustic and electronic pop."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/5e/e1/3e/5ee13e4c-77f6-03be-fc55-b60c0279c1c9/197190980998.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ac977d","textColor2":"d29a64","textColor4":"a88055","textColor1":"d7b696","bgColor":"011b1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/burn-the-hard-drive-ep/1728927016","playParams":{"id":"1728927016","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728927016/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1167712148","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1167712148?l=en-US"}]}}},"1729230250":{"id":"1729230250","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729230250?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-04-12","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/0f/a0/82/0fa08218-af1f-4c76-9851-12bfa38e9ffd/Jobb417d0b1-973c-4751-8c54-aa3b1587c744-162693401-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314928024_1680798802-Time1707432606731.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","292d2d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"efecea"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"4e514d","textColor2":"292d2d","textColor4":"515353","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"efecea","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/46/c5/78/46c5786f-c114-adb8-dcca-0c2c42a6b957/7aee1e7c-93fa-4264-85af-4a013072f404.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"413937","textColor2":"2b2828","textColor4":"474549","textColor1":"241812","bgColor":"b6bdcc","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/17/1c/35/171c351a-ae4e-609b-fc38-ae28a8f24ce5/Job7fc8f831-1769-4170-af00-2cd5f8ec9afd-162693402-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314928023_1680798803-Time1707434214091.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"464948","textColor2":"1f2827","textColor4":"484e4d","textColor1":"1e2221","bgColor":"eae5e3","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/24/e6/77/24e677c6-4949-df78-56a6-79fafbc23764/06befe71-668a-4b62-81eb-ce7fcca0b962.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"353636","textColor2":"110b0b","textColor4":"3a3636","textColor1":"0b0c0c","bgColor":"e1e0e0","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/girl-in-red/1349818950","name":"I'M DOING IT AGAIN BABY!","artistName":"girl in red","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When alt-pop singer-songwriter girl in red completed her second album, <i>I’M DOING IT AGAIN BABY!</i>, and looked back over what she’d made, she saw a record of polar opposites. “The themes are being on top of the world and feeling in love and feeling amazing and living peak moments from life,” Marie Ulven, the Norwegian artist behind the project tells Apple Music, “and then other moments are reflecting on not being so good.”\n\nThe follow-up to 2021’s breakthrough <i>if i could make it go quiet</i> is a striking leap forward for Ulven, building on the propulsive anthems that wowed crowds when she bagged a support slot on Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour in 2023. It’s a euphoric record that swaggers from exuberant indie pop to soaring balladry, taking in gliding synth-y sing-alongs and frantic rock anthems along the way. “I wanted to make something that was a very delicate production with cool energy and great lyrics,” says Ulven. “I wanted to elevate what I’ve done before.” It was a process, she states, that involved trusting her instincts. “Something I was really thinking of while making the album was not thinking too much and going with your intuition,” she says. It has resulted in a dazzling second record. Read on as girl in red guides us through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“I’m Back”</b>\n“Even before I had a bunch of the other songs, I was like, ‘“I’m Back” could be the first track.’ It goes through different levels of being hopeful and then feeling like you’re better, but then tapping into that ‘I have been sad.’ The journey for this song is the journey for the whole album, in a way. Also, I’m referencing [<i>if i could make it go quiet</i>’s opener] ‘Serotonin’ in there—it’s the opposite of ‘Serotonin’ and the perfect opening for an album that’s about doing it again.”\n\n<b>“DOING IT AGAIN BABY”</b>\n“This is a similar song to ‘I’m Back,’ where it’s like, ‘I’m happy, I’m positive, I’m energetic, I’m feeling good about myself,’ but it’s on the other side of the scale. Instead of being, ‘Oh, I think I’m doing better,’ it’s like, ‘Fuck yeah, I’m the coolest person in the world!’ It’s capturing the extreme of being back, and that’s why I think it’s a fun song to have right after ‘I’m Back.’ It takes it to a whole new level and it really wakes you up a little bit. It’s got everything in there—banjo, fireworks, weird vocal stuff going on. It’s a fun song. It’s definitely one of the coolest songs I’ve ever made.”\n\n<b>“Too Much”</b>\n“I think ‘Too Much’ is fun to have right after ‘DOING IT AGAIN BABY’ because that song is about being a lot and then ‘Too Much’ is about being confronted with the world again, or people around you who think you’re a lot. On the emotional journey of the album, this is where there’s a little bit of a dip because there’s a bit of sadness in here as well as ‘No, I’m going to be exactly how much I need to be.’ I feel like it’s an empowering song [about] not letting anyone dampen you or tone you down—a really hooky pop song and with fun stuff in there but also a sad song. It was really important to have different energies and different feelings on the album.”\n\n<b>“Phantom Pain”</b>\n“Generally on this record, we’re operating with a lot of craziness. And similarly to ‘DOING IT AGAIN BABY,’ this is the crazy version of feeling good, the crazy version of being into someone and being smitten. This is about when I met my girlfriend three years ago, but before we called each other girlfriends, we were dating, just not officially. It turned out she wasn’t really free to date, so she cut me off the day after we had met and we were making out. The song is about the heartbreak I had that week, because I was so heartbroken and I didn’t even know her. It’s hilarious because it’s impossible to have heartbreak for someone that you don’t love yet—you don’t know them. So I thought it was fun to play with phantom pains—it’s like you have pains from somewhere in your body that doesn’t exist anymore but it’s heartache phantom pain.”\n\n<b>“You Need Me Now?” (with Sabrina Carpenter)</b>\n“It’s not linked to my girlfriend and I actually ending up together, but it’s a song about a person taking you for granted for a very long time and then dumping you, and then basically coming back when they realized, ‘Holy shit, wait, actually maybe this wasn’t that bad.’ A lot of people tend to think the grass is greener on the other side, but I saw this Facebook post from some old lady saying, ‘No, the grass is greener where you water it.’ I think there’s some truth in that. This song is also about standing up for myself and saying, ‘No, I won’t have your bullshit anymore and I’m not going to let you come back and walk in like nothing ever happened because you ruined me.’ It’s got an empowering vibe to it. [It’s] even more fun with Sabrina because, even though she’s singing from the me perspective, she’s also the friend that really agrees with you, like, ‘No, they’re bad for you. Don’t take them back.’”\n\n<b>“A Night to Remember”</b>\n“This is about the night I met my girlfriend. It’s basically a track that goes through the whole night. It starts with being smitten by just seeing her, being into her, then going through the different parties we went to. People were doing drugs, people were drinking, it was insane, it was like a night in the movies. The song builds up into this big indie electronic moment and it sounds like a lot of love is in the air. The music sounds like love. It’s attraction and sexual chemistry—all those things are going on—and then it goes into this really fun dance sing-along.”\n\n<b>“Pick Me”</b>\n“This is about jealousy and insecurity because my girlfriend is bisexual and there was a time—I have my reasons—where I was very jealous of this one guy. I was also very jealous of guys in general. I realized that I was really insecure in my relationship because I was constantly scared that she was going to leave me. I was confronted with a lot of my insecurities and I had to put them somewhere. I put them into this song. Even though my girlfriend has reassured me so many times, it still somehow just goes into my left ear and out of my right ear. It’s been impossible to even make me feel safe but I know it’s all in my head and it’s not on my girlfriend. I know it’s my problems. By the way, to anyone reading, we’re doing so much better now! I’ve learned to communicate, which is the most important thing because no one’s a mind reader, especially not when it comes to stuff like this.”\n\n<b>“Ugly Side”</b>\n“‘Ugly Side’ is reflecting after exposing myself when I feel [the way] I do in ‘Pick Me.’ It’s talking about those negative qualities, acknowledging that I’m not perfect and that I have ugly sides. It’s a funny play on ‘Oh, no, don’t take my picture on this side, my ugly side.’ This song is talking about ‘Why do I get so angry sometimes? Why do I lose my shit? Why am I so imperfect?’ It’s consciously debating why I have these shifting sides. It’s just a little self-reflection song.”\n\n<b>“New Love”</b>\n“This is about heartbreak and struggling to see someone that you’ve really loved moving on. It’s about wanting and longing for that person and knowing that they’re never going to want you again—and that a lot of heartbreak comes with that. I definitely was struggling with some heartbreak for a very long time, and then this song is, ‘I think it’s the end of that era, I hope. I think this might be the last song I write about this thing.’ It felt like closure to some old stuff.”\n\n<b>“★★★★★”</b>\n“I call this song ‘The Factory,’ people can reference it as ‘The Factory’ or just ‘Five Stars.’ It’s basically the overarching themes that I was going through making the album. I had so much doubt but then I was able to come out of it and be like, ‘No, this album is fucking amazing. This is the best shit I’ve ever done.’ This is just a fun little weird song about making songs at the factory. And are they hits? Are they five-star songs? Are they the top-notch songs that I really believe they are or am I being delusional? Because you have to be delusional. This song is about artistic doubt. That’s the best way I can put it. Also, I’m using the percussion from what I think will be the opener on album three, so I was like, ‘It’s a fun little nugget for people to hear this beat now.’ When album three comes out, they’ll be like, ‘Whoa, that’s the same beat!’”","short":"Again…but better: “I wanted to elevate what I did before,” says Marie

/ Komitas: Music in Time of War","artistName":"Kirill Gerstein, Thomas Adès, Ruzan Mantashyan & Katia Skanavi","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"All journeys begin with a single step. Kirill Gerstein’s album of works by Debussy and Komitas, <i>Music in Time of War</i>, evolved from the pianist’s ambition to learn Debussy’s <i>12 Études</i> “for personal amusement and self-improvement”, he tells Apple Music Classical. “These pieces are Debussy at his most elevated—they’re not drily analytical studies, but the studies of a painter.” While the pandemic gave Gerstein time to learn the <i>Études</i>, recording them sparked a hunt for suitable music to accompany them.\n\nIt was then that Gerstein turned to the Armenian composer Komitas. Debussy’s <i>Études</i> were composed in 1915 at the height of the First World War. But just a year later, in 1916, Komitas conceived his <i>Armenian Dances</i> in response to a very different but equally horrific chapter. Under the cover of war in Europe, over one million Armenians were being murdered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian Genocide, as it has since become known, “is still not universally acknowledged or recognized,” reflects Gerstein. And there is no doubt that the <i>Armenian Dances</i>, full of references to traditional Armenian folk songs, collected by Komitas himself, are a direct cry of anguish in response to the killings and to the horrors he witnessed before escaping to Europe.\n\nSo—here are two composers united by two wartime tragedies. And yet their connection goes so much deeper. In 1906, Komitas visited Paris, a city where, just 10 years later, he was to spend his final days in a psychiatric hospital. There, he founded a choir and mixed with the likes of fellow composers Saint-Saëns, d’Indy, and perhaps Debussy himself. In any case, Debussy caught wind of Komitas’ music, and there is one piece that binds these two figures inextricably together. “‘Antuni’ is an iconic song for Armenians,” reveals Gerstein, “but it is also the song about which Debussy is quoted to have said that, ‘Even had Komitas composed just this one song, he would already be considered a great composer.’” \n\nDebussy was to reflect the themes of destruction and desolation in “Antuni” in his own song, “Noël des enfants qui n’ont plus de maisons” (“A carol for homeless children”), first performed at a benefit concert for victims of the Armenian Genocide. “These two songs neighbour each other in history and in the output of these two men,” says Gerstein, “so ‘Antuni’ became part of the selection of Komitas songs that we recorded—and then, of course, we had to include the Debussy song.”\n\nDebussy contributed to the war effort, says Gerstein, by taking part in many more benefit concerts. “One of the pieces of his that he would often program is the <i>Chansons de Bilitis</i>,” he says, “though they were written a lot earlier.” So one of the challenges of this recording was finding a singer who was equally comfortable singing in French and in Armenian. “I’m very happy that I found Ruzan Mantashyan, who is I think a fantastic singer. In fact, when Ruzan and I agreed to collaborate, I didn’t know that her great, great-grand-uncle was the sponsor of Komitas—he had paid for his studies in Berlin and had bought him a concert grand piano.”\n\nGerstein connected the remainder of his Debussy choices either to the war itself, or to the <i>Études</i>. The 1915 two-piano work <i>En blanc et noir</i> was, says Gerstein, composed within three months of the <i>Études</i> and “essentially shares the same musical DNA,” while the <i>6 Épigraphes antiques</i> was the only piece that Debussy wrote in the year the war started. For both works, Gerstein performs alongside two superb fellow pianists—Katia Skanavi (<i>Épigraphes</i>) and the composer Thomas Adès (<i>En blanc et noir</i>). \n\n“<i>En blanc et noir</i> is maybe Debussy’s most overt anti-war statement with its references to Lutheran hymns and patriotic French quotations,” says Gerstein. “Thomas Adès and I have played it many times in concert, and I have always felt that he brings a compositional insight to playing this piece that makes the interpretation quite unique.\n\n“Playing four hands on one instrument is really the most intimate thing you can do,” Gerstein says of the <i>Épigraphes</i>, “and the sound has to match because otherwise it does not work. Katia is a pianist that I’ve very long admired, and so I’m happy that we can do something for the first time together on record. She studied in France and feels very close to French musical culture.”\n\nGerstein rounds his program off with late pieces by Debussy that, he relates, were included in publications to raise money for the war effort. “There’s the <i>Berceuse héroïque</i> that was written in support of the Belgian people after the invasion by the German army. There’s the <i>Étude retrouvée</i>, which is the one etude that Debussy discarded to keep his collection to just 12. And the <i>Élégie</i>, which is the first piece he wrote after his cancer surgery.” \n\nFinally, among the group of late piano pieces, is 1917’s <i>Les Soirs illuminés par l’ardeur du charbon</i> (<i>Evenings lit up by burning coals</i>), composed as a gift to the composer’s coal merchant as thanks for sourcing then scarce supplies of fuel. It was the last solo piano piece that Debussy would write.\n\nAs Gerstein began to work on the album, its theme took on more and more significance as conflicts arose in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and Nagorno-Karabakh where so many Armenians recently lost their lives. “Little did I know that war and genocide would become so present in our lives,” says Gerstein. “So what does it mean to make an album in 2024?

The Mexican singer’s new album finds her extricating herself from darkness and choosing inner peace as her closest ally. <i>CHILDSTAR</i> is a reference not only to the label that she grew up with, but also the healing that has taken place in the present. “Obviously, this record is meant as a gift to my fans, but it’s also an even bigger gift for me. Through it, I made peace with many things that transpired during my childhood,” she says. \n\nNow her artistic choices assume a new dimension, and we get to know the human being behind Danna. Intriguing risks like a bilingual tracklist, songs that tackle sexuality, and the surprising appearance of R&B stylings in her music are the foundations of this personal and artistic renaissance. “It’s like ‘Danna, chapter 1,’” she says. The singer talked with Apple Music about the many facets and shades of <i>CHILDSTAR</i>.\n\n<b>The album opens with “THE FALL,” and the lyrics talk about “having fallen down.” So, we’re starting from the very bottom.</b>\n\n“Hitting rock bottom was one of the experiences that made me reevaluate my entire life, both on a personal and artistic level. I found myself in a dead end—there was no exit available—and for the first time, I felt defeated. In the end, those experiences helped me realize that I needed to overcome adversity on my own, and that I could find catharsis through art. I left the darkness behind, and now I’m in a better place. I found the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\n<b>When you talk about being defeated, what exactly are you referring to?</b>\n\n“I’ve been working in this industry for over 20 years, since I was four years old. In therapy, I had to go through the difficult process of realizing that my childhood was not as idyllic or perfect as I imagined it to be. I was a very lonely kid. My emotions were constantly manipulated. I’m not portraying myself as a victim, but rather coming to terms with the way I grew up, how I developed my own way of presenting myself to the world, since I was always in the public eye. So, like you see on the album cover, there were many people, many hands pulling me in different directions. Those are people, but also toxic patterns that you tend to perpetuate: the music industry, pressure, and anxiety.”\n\n<b>The <i>CHILDSTAR</i> concept is transparent for anyone familiar with your life and career. Was that intentional?</b>\n\n“I’ve constructed this Danna—the person I am today—through the experiences, moments, and situations of my career. I see this one as my first real project. My self-discovery as an artist followed a reverse trajectory; I was always following what was happening in the outside world and what was asked of me, instead of following my instincts. Eventually, I realized that I could make my own decisions. I could take agency of my own art—“I want that color, this sound.” Finding freedom in those choices took time.”\n\n<b>And what does this freedom mean to you?</b>\n\n“There are no rules. Sometimes we impose too many expectations on ourselves during the creative process, and that’s when the endless questioning begins. People advised me not to sing in English, for instance, something that many artists in Mexico struggle with. Some songs are born in English; the lyrics flow better that way. In the end, you should pay no attention to what people think of you. Obviously, this record is meant as a gift to my fans, but it’s also an even bigger gift for me. Through it, I made peace with all those things that transpired during childhood.”\n\n<b>What’s the album’s narrative through line?</b>\n\n“It takes place during the span of a weekend. I would leave therapy realizing how fucked up my life was, and the first thing I did was drown myself in partying and excess. This is why alcohol, vice, and sex addiction are a thread here—the attempt to fix things [by] adding new problems, instead of delving deeper on a mental and emotional level. The album begins with that initial snippet of empowerment: You fall down, and your own darkness emerges. It’s an erotic album in many different ways, but there’s also love in the equation, because the lyrics touch on my relationship with my boyfriend. I also mention my first girl crush.

It’s a welcome bit of both narrative songwriting and vividly rendered compassion, as Green favors nuanced humanity over dismissive moralizing; “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” this is not. \n\nThe title track, which is the only outside cut on the EP, treads more familiar genre territory, celebrating a “backwoods way of living” and invoking, as country songs are wont to do, a trio of Johns: Cash, Wayne, and Deere. “Good Morning From Mexico” brings Kenny Chesney vibes to the proceedings, as Green celebrates the salt life with laidback, contented grit. Green also nods to country’s growing love affair with Bruce Springsteen—popularized, of course, by Eric Church—with a spirited cover of the Boss’ 1982 classic “Atlantic City.”","short":"Seven songs of

mechón de pelo","artistName":"TINI","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“The creative process helped me to understand what was going on with myself,” TINI tells Apple Music. “Working in the recording studio also contributed to the healing.” During most of 2023, the Buenos Aires star came to terms with one of the toughest battles a person can go through: an inner conflict. “I had become like a cup that’s filled with wounds, and my father’s problems—a serious medical condition that landed him in intensive care—was the shock that overflowed the cup. I finally understood what my depression and anxiety were all about, the fears and all the questions that could not be answered.”\n\nAs a result, <i>un mechón de pelo</i> is not only Martina Stoessel’s most personal album to date, but also a testament to her inner salvation, filled with internal monologues, metaphors, dedications, and the intervention of her loved ones. “Here’s to the storm that torments you/And yet it’s nothing but a lock of hair” (“<i>Por la tormenta que, aunque te atormenta, es un mechón de pelo</i>”), she sings on one of the tracks, an allegory about finding renewal after darkness. Here, TINI guides us through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“pa”</b>\n“This song is the drop that made the glass overflow. I had never felt so much pain and uncertainty in such a short time. It came as a huge shock, because my father almost died from one day to the other. Those situations transform you, and the emotions are extreme. I went to the studio and wrote about what I felt at that moment. I wanted to express how much I loved him, and what happened with this track was incredible.”\n\n<b>“posta”</b>\n“I’ve always believed that if I talked back or addressed any rumors, it would hurt my public image. As a result, I kept many feelings to myself. In this song I go back to the labels and words that were said about me—even though I believed them, I finally decided not to remain quiet about them anymore. Today’s TINI, the blonde, talks to the TINI who crossed over that door. The video conveys this message with clarity: the hour of reckoning between the TINI who dares to speak up and the TINI who gave her back to those same situations.”\n\n<b>“miedo”</b>\n“As I was going through all that emotional process last year, I was diagnosed with depression. I had to live with it, and felt scared. This third song is based on a note that I wrote down on my cell phone during one of many sleepless nights. The following day, I met the guys at the studio and mentioned the idea of incorporating the thoughts into a song. It’s me again, not recognizing myself in the mirror—not knowing where to go, not feeling brave enough to move forward. A reflection of pure fear.”\n\n<b>“ni de ti”</b>\n“Rage is part of the grieving process. This track embodies that, the moment where everything brings forth the rage. The voice is processed using an effect that amplifies that feeling. The beat is aggressive, too. It stems from the lies that were circulating; they reached my grandmother, and she was worried about me. I called her, and she tried to calm me down. ‘I know who you are; I know it’s all hearsay.’ I felt something intrusive in my mind, something telling me that I wasn’t at peace even as my grandma was asking me to calm down. We decided to include the same words that she told me during that call, because they show what going through that process felt like.”\n\n<b>“ángel”</b>\n“Sometimes, in order to understand and heal, you need a return to the past. This is where I tell my father’s story in the third person. I mention him again because of everything that he means to me, and also because of an incident that took place in 2008. There was always a stigma, the prejudice that my dad had made things easier for me because he was a television producer. In 2008, he basically had to exile himself from Argentina, and no one wanted to hire me. Then justice was made, and I was selected during the <i>Violetta</i> casting sessions, because it was a European production. As time went by, I realized how things played out. I had never talked about this, but thought it was important to verbalize it. It’s one of the most complex songs on the album—I touch on my childhood, adolescence, and adult years.”\n\n<b>“buenos aires”</b>\n“This was difficult to write, simply because I love this place so much. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires. My family, friends, and home are in that city, my favorite place in the world. Since the moment I had to leave because of my career, I waited for the day when I could return to my refuge, my home. That’s also where the people who offer containment live. Because of the media storm I mention in the album, I started to fear returning to my own city and facing the cameras. It hurt me for the longest time.”\n\n<b>“tinta 90”</b>\n“I’m having a conversation with myself throughout the album, and this is one of those songs. I delve deeper into the dark nights when I felt the sun would never come up again. I needed to write a song bearing witness to those dark-filled months. It’s a private conversation inside my head, and it encapsulates the hopelessness, the emotions that grabbed hold of me and appeared to want to stay there for good.”\n\n<b>“ellas”</b>\n“After thinking I will never see the dawn again, I’m rescued by my friends’ voices. I’ve known them since I was three years old; they are the people who always listened to me, and I listened to them. They helped me see the light, embrace love and the desire to keep moving forward. Since this is such a personal album, with references to my family, my father and grandmother, they needed to be here as well. This interlude gives me the opportunity to thank them for being there, and for making me feel that I deserved a second chance.”\n\n<b>“bien”</b>\n“This one’s about allowing yourself to feel bad. It’s OK not to be OK. It’s OK to go through all that. Make amends with the situation, the diagnosis, the process. Everything doesn’t need to be always fine. It’s also a letter to my family, the heavens above, God, my friends. I name them, and mention the little girl I was. I tell her: ‘We almost fell apart, but now we’ve made peace with each other again.’”\n\n<b>“me voy”</b>\n“This track is about admitting that I got all those feelings out of my system—the darkest hour is gone. I’m sure there will be more of that, but it will be different. It’s not a part of myself anymore. I carry on with my healing process, but now I’m sharing the past experiences. Stuff that I hadn’t talked about in 15 years, or things that worried me during the last couple of years. I feel ready for the next chapter.

20-05 - EP","artistName":"Feid & Yandel","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Anyone who heard “Yandel 150” or “XQ Te Pones Así” knows how dynamic and natural Feid and Yandel sound as a vocal duo. Following in the tradition of concise joint artist projects like Bad Bunny and J Balvin’s <i>OASIS</i> or Farina and Arcángel’s <i>FloWres</i>, the five-track <i>MANIFESTING 20-05</i> captures that studio chemistry perfectly and succinctly. Primarily though not exclusively a reggaetón affair, the intergenerational star pairing presents a modern, melodic genre approach on “Brickell” and “No Digas Na,” each with a pop appeal that feels subtly indebted to the veteran’s storied perreo past. Opener “Fecha” perhaps best reflects the merging of their respective strengths, its thumping beat and future-leaning synths soundtracking their purely hedonistic intentions. “De Negro” provides peak nightclub VIP energy with its embrace of house music, while the more after-hours-oriented “Pa Janguiar” surprisingly leans into a roots reggae groove to set a mood.","short":"The dynamic duo drops a reggaetón-centric joint effort."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/48/03/cf480322-e907-87b3-e933-217d2a73892e/24UMGIM42176.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbca","textColor2":"09d588","textColor4":"07aa6d","textColor1":"fffffd","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/manifesting-20-05-ep/1740674209","playParams":{"id":"1740674209","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740674209/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"194502100","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/194502100?l=en-US"},{"id":"72929426","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/72929426?l=en-US"}]}}},"1740864541":{"id":"1740864541","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740864541?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"releaseDate":"2024-04-12","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/78/4a/23/784a23f3-009b-60ff-06bf-644cac5733b4/5ac71c97-e1ab-4a26-b6fb-f28322a35acd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c5c7","textColor2":"ced2d5","textColor4":"a8abad","textColor1":"eef2f5","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5f/5d/a6/5f5da672-2907-4f04-91bd-31bef204dd34/a29d75a3-c0a4-4b63-bbf0-540ddfbd08be.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5bdc2","textColor2":"cdd0d2","textColor4":"a7abac","textColor1":"dfe7ee","bgColor":"101614","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=128050210-670534462","name":"WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU","artistName":"Future & Metro Boomin","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Part two of their collaborative album series has landed.
