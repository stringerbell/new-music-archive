That EP includes the title track, an unorthodox variation on the outlaw country genre that likens being a practicing Christian to an act of rebellion. Though not all of the sprawling 16-track record is quite in that spirit, <i>REBEL</i> does give Wilson room to play with genre, finding places—like on the soaring and inspirational “3:16” and the patriotic “God & Country”—where country and contemporary Christian music intersect. \n\nWilson gets a co-sign from Lainey Wilson on “Praying Woman,” a soulful ballad about being a woman of faith, while Jordan Davis joins on the simple-living celebration “Country Gold.” Longtime contemporary Christian favorite Chris Tomlin rounds out the guest list, lending vocals to the worship anthem “The

Album and Interview","standard":"For the follow-up to their 2018 Grammy-winning <i>Electric Messiah</i>, stoner-metal trio High on Fire enlisted Big Business’ Coady Willis to replace longtime drummer Des Kensel. “Coady is one of our favorite drummers, and it just seemed like it would make sense musically,” bassist Jeff Matz tells Apple Music. “Once we started jamming with him, it became apparent that it was going to work out really well. He has his own style, but he understands the High on Fire aesthetic.” \n\nDespite winning the Grammy for Best Metal Performance for their last album, High on Fire felt no pressure in writing <i>Cometh the Storm</i> with a new member. “I don’t really think like that,” vocalist/guitarist Matt Pike says. “It was nice to be appreciated by our peers and such, but we didn’t really get to take full advantage of it because the world shut down not long after we won. I think we got exposed to a lot of people who hadn’t heard us prior to that, but that’s probably it. On the other hand, wouldn’t it be weird to win another one?” Below, Pike and Matz discuss each track on <i>Cometh the Storm</i>.\n\n<b>“Lambsbread”</b>\nPike: “Well, I always have a song about weed. It’s basically a description of a bong hit working in a higher mental element, like what pot does to a meditative state, I guess. I don’t know how to word that correctly, but that’s just what pot does to you.”\nMatz: “The music for the chorus has been kicking around since probably 2010, and it reflects my obsession with Middle Eastern folk music, so we added some acoustic baglama to that part. The intro and outro just popped into my head when I was driving around, so I scat-sang it into my phone. It’s so Beavis and Butt-Head.” \n\n<b>“Burning Down”</b>\nPike: “That’s more of a serious one, and it’s a tiny bit political. I’m calling out people like the World Economic Forum and the billionaires who fly around in jets and tell us if we give them a billion more dollars, they’re going to fucking fix the world for us. Who the fuck are these people?” \nMatz: “Musically, that was one that Matt and Coady were working on when I arrived at practice one day. That riff’s got old-school High on Fire vibes. It definitely harkens back to the early albums, but it’s got some really interesting little timing changes.” \n\n<b>“Trismegistus”</b>\nPike: “The title means ‘thrice great,’ which comes from Hermes, who I always thought was an interesting character in mythology because he combined the wisdom of the material and the spiritual worlds. The music sounds kind of Egyptian, so in the lyrics, I’m talking about Osiris and Duat and Anubis. I’ve always been into esoteric mythology, but I’ve never really done one on Egypt.” \nMatz: “The verse riff came from when I was jamming with Coady down in LA. It reminded me of Lucifer’s Friend or something, like a weird classic-rock riff, but I tried to make it a little more like Voivod with some discordant intervals. The chorus uses a Middle Eastern scale, so I think that’s what set Matt off in that Egyptian lyrical direction.”\n\n<b>“Cometh the Storm”</b>\nPike: “This is basically about nuclear war and how foolish it is. It’s kind of an elaboration of ‘Burning Down,’ how we’re just starting wars and talking about nuclear war like it’s normal.” \nMatz: “The track started out of a little thing I started playing at practice, just tapping on the bass, and Matt just started coming up with a vocal right on the spot. I really like the vocal melody, and it’s probably my favorite vocal performance on the whole album.” \n\n<b>“Karanlık Yol”</b>\nMatz: “I’ve been studying Turkish folk music pretty intensely since just before the pandemic. I’ve been studying the Turkish folk lute, the baglama, and just learning how to play different folk tunes and different styles with different teachers in Türkiye and the Philippines. So, I basically wanted to try to write something in the style of a Turkish folk dance because I think those types of sounds blend really well with the particular kind of heavy music that we play.” \n\n<b>“Sol’s Golden Curse”</b>\nPike: “That’s the first song I wrote with Coady when I flew down to LA so we could feel each other out. I took something out of our riff vault, which is just hours and hours of music that me and Jeff have compiled over the years, and started working on it with Coady. Lyrically, it has more weird, esoteric shit about the Sethians and Abraxas.” \n\n<b>“The Beating”</b>\nPike: “That’s our D-beat song. I’ve always been into the martial arts world, especially MMA and boxing, but I don’t do too many songs about it. This one’s pretty much about ring fighting. It seemed to take the right shape. It’s a ripper and definitely one of the faster-paced ones on the album. And I’ve got to put a [Jeff] Hanneman solo on every album, so this is the song.” \n\n<b>“Tough Guy”</b>\nPike: “We’ve played with many hardcore bands in the past, so we were being smart-asses and wrote this hardcore breakdown about 10 years ago. It turned out really good, even though we were just joking around. But it’s got more of a metal mentality to it, just fighting and moshing, but it’s also about rebuilding our band from scratch. It’s truly violent sounding, so I went with that theme for the lyrics.” \n\n<b>“Lightning Beard”</b>\nPike: “The title was kind of an inside joke between me and Jeff. I took this picture of him when he was posing all crazy with his bass, and I had this camera app, so I put all these lightning bolts all up in his beard and on his fretboard. We called it ‘Lightning Beard,’ which just sounded cool. But the song is about my El Camino. During COVID, I got it going really fast and was doing doughnuts in front of all the street racers, and they were cheering me on, so I made lyrics out of that.” \nMatz: “That’s another ripper that we came up with at practice. It’s got a pretty crazy freak-out section during the solo where the bass just completely goes nuts. It’s pretty fun.” \n\n<b>“Hunting Shadows”</b>\nPike: “That one has some deep lyrics to me. I was just having a hard time with depression and my alcohol recovery and all sorts of stuff. I wrote that song not thinking about it, but really, I was trying to heal myself. I ate a bag of shrooms to try to figure out what the fuck was wrong with me. I thought I was singing those lyrics to someone else, but I was singing them to myself, so I had this crazy conundrum. But it’s about self-reflection.” \nMatz: “Musically, that one’s really interesting. It’s got more of a positive, hopeful energy to it that’s definitely a little bit different for us.” \n\n<b>“Darker Fleece”</b>\nPike: “Once we started writing the new record, I went over to Jeff’s to put some ideas together. I had this riff, but it was so long and complicated. Then we made it more complicated by adding subdivisions. It’s almost a lesson in timing, how you can cut up a whole note into quarter notes and 32nd notes. Lyrically, it’s just about life and war—it’s very much a war march.

He urged them to quickly meet him at Watt’s LA home studio, no gear or pre-written material necessary. It was all about playing—getting into a room together, splashing around, seeing what happens. It turns out, Vedder’s instincts are still good. \n\nWritten and recorded with Watt over the course of two sessions—the first at his home and the second, months later, at the legendary Shangri-La in Malibu—Pearl Jam’s 12th full-length is immediate and direct, a lean-and-mean counterpoint to the more sculpted and experimental feel of 2020’s <i>Gigaton</i>. Credit fresh wind: Born less than a year before the release of the band’s era-defining 1991 debut <i>Ten</i>, Watt came of age with Pearl Jam’s earliest work. He brings a fan’s enthusiasm to the proceedings—he even plays guitar across the record, a dream—but also an outsider’s perspective on what feels authentic to Pearl Jam, no matter the date.\n\nThat means they lean unabashedly into their strengths and influences: big, broad-shouldered rock (“Scared of Fear,” whose cavernous opening seconds recall those of <i>Ten</i>); Petty-indebted balladry (“Wreckage”); midtempo wizardry (“Won’t Tell”); reliable slabs of classic punk (“Running”; the 10-ton title track). They play the hits by offering new ones, and you can hear the satisfaction they seem to get in clicking here, in the spontaneity of it all. Vedder’s lyrics have never sounded so fluid and free; Matt Cameron’s drum work has never felt so concussive and true. Listen closely to the first chords of “Something Special” and you’ll hear exactly that: a little laughter amongst old friends.

By neat coincidence, Yunchan Lim was the same age when he recorded the composer’s fiendishly difficult, musically profound keyboard studies. The Korean pianist’s vision of Chopin’s two dozen pieces blends the fearless virtuosity of youth with a maturity associated with artists three times his age. \n\nLim, who shot to fame in 2022 as the youngest winner of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, produces a potent blend of showmanship and artistry, subtle voicing and pinpoint articulation, exquisite legato and arresting dynamic shifts, all harnessed to strikingly individual expression. \n\n“Chopin’s Etudes were a mountain I had to overcome someday,” he tells Apple Music Classical. “For the recording, I had the compulsion to be technically perfect. But I think every note is like a leaf swaying in the wind and should be as beautiful as nature itself. I feel Chopin has overcome the limits humans can achieve with these pieces to reach another level.”\n\nRather than highlighting any particular tracks, Yunchan Lim encourages listeners to immerse themselves in the complete Etudes. “This is not <i>instant</i> music, so I don't want to emphasize one piece. I think we should listen to all of their narratives in detail. When a mother gives birth, it will be the most precious and beautiful thing in the world to her. I feel the same way about making this recording. Of course, there are so many shortcomings, but this album is like my son. I'm proud to say that everything here is precious to me.” \n\nWas Lim inspired by listening to legendary Chopin recordings from the past? “More than any past performance or recording, I was most influenced by my will,” he replies. “My will to cross this mountain and face another mountain and face yet another mountain beyond.”","short":"“Chopin’s Etudes were a mountain I had to overcome

Daughter (Deluxe Version)","artistName":"Lola Brooke","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Children embracing an identity as a chip off a particular parent’s block is a long-held tradition in Black American communities, one that rising Brooklyn MC Lola Brooke upholds gleefully on her heavily anticipated debut album. “The idea behind <i>Dennis Daughter</i> is as simple as remembering my childhood,” the MC tells Apple Music. “I used to hang out with my dad. He would pick me up from school. I had a dog named Frankie and we would walk him around and people would say, ‘Hey, Dennis’ Daughter,’ or ‘Hey, D-Daughter.’ So I named [the album] <i>Dennis Daughter</i> so that I could always relive that moment, because I know I probably won't ever get to feel that anymore because my father's no longer here.”\n\nThe world lost the aforementioned Dennis in 2015, which means he’d know nothing of the impending stardom of young Lola (real name Shyniece Thomas), nor the way the MC would have New York City at large on tilt with her 2021 single “Don’t Play With It.” But Brooke places her father’s legacy front and center on <i>Dennis Daughter</i>, letting the world know that she wouldn’t be who she is without him. “Basically I'm still grieving from my father's passing and it's taking a little bit of time—but the music is helping,” Brooke says. “So I want people to, when they see me, they still see my dad.” Below, Brooke walks us through who—and what—<i>Dennis Daughter</i> is, track by track.\n\n<b>“Intro (2023 Flow)”</b>\n“Since 2017, I've been doing these freestyles for my fans. Flow is very important to me, and lyricism is important to me, and the delivery is important to me. So this was just a gift to my fans because it’s me giving them a different flow for a new year. I’m giving them more of my story as well, letting them know who I am.”\n\n<b>“I AM LOLA”</b>\n“‘I AM LOLA’ is ‘I am Lola the artist, I'm here for a reason.’ This did not happen as a mistake, I've worked hard to be here, and I’m taking the listener to certain places I come from and [explaining] who I am today. Poverty, struggling, discipline, family issues, miscommunication—I overcame a lot of those. It's basically like where I come from, Brooklyn, is really tough.”\n\n<b>“Don't Get Me Started” (feat. Coi Leray & Nija)</b>\n“I’m from New York, but once you get through the Holland Tunnel, you in New Jersey—it's just that quick. So I wanted to cross over to the state that was next to New York City and get involved with young female artists that was from there. And I knew it would look so good on camera with the three of us as a trio—[Lola, Coi Leray, and Nija], just so small and vibrant, a lot of energy. And it's Jersey club music—who don't love Jersey club music?”\n\n<b>“Best Side”</b>\n“My producer, Reefa Music, he know I love DMX, and I’m always nagging him about it. So he made the beat and I just went crazy. All I needed to know was that I had the DMX energy on the sample and I just went as hard as I could. But ‘Best Side’ is basically me explaining, like, I done grinded for this moment, so make sure when y'all put the light on me, it's my best side.”\n\n<b>“Pit Stop” (feat. French Montana)</b>\n“French is basically family. But it means a lot that the OGs is embracing me because it's like they see something that my fans see. As an artist coming up in New York City, you got big shoes to fill. Your responsibility is to make sure you can hold up the crown, and that's not easy because it's a lot of stars, a lot of legends and OGs. So you gotta stand out.” \n\n<b>“It's Me Again”</b>\n“So I always knew that me and Detroit beats was a vibe. ‘Don't Play With It’ it taps into a Detroit sound. I feel like 'Don't Play With It' is my first warning, telling people not to play with me, and 'It's Me Again,' it's the second warning. I linked up with Helluva to do 'It's Me Again' and I just was so motivated by working with a Detroit producer after being so much in love with Detroit beats. I'm like, I'm back and I'm going crazy again.”\n\n<b>“You” (feat. Bryson Tiller)</b>\n“I know I might come off aggressive, but I love affectionate people around me. I love to be around my family, I love to feel the energy of love. So I had to put it in the air because times is hard now and a lot of couples is struggling right now, so I just wanted to embrace the couples and tell them if the good outweigh the bad, then keep trying. And then the sample is Foxy Brown and Blackstreet. I'm always being compared to Foxy and Kim, so that was basically like a homage thing. But it had to be done right. So I got Bryson Tiller because he's so raw and authentic. Bryson don't miss.”\n\n<b>“Vacant Heart”</b>\n“Being vulnerable is one of the biggest reasons why I'm an artist today. It's not hard for me to go there because I started off being vulnerable before I was really rapping. I was in my journals, my diaries, writing about how I felt, expressing myself. I’m venting on 'Vacant Heart' because I’m showing people I'm still human. I might be going through the same thing you going through, I just wear my pain different.”\n\n<b>“Dear Dennis”</b>\n“I remember the project was almost completed, but it didn't feel complete. I felt like I was cheating myself out of some emotions. I had to put my father on this project because I'm still grieving; music is helping me grieve, and that's how I bond with him now. Sometimes I do feel embarrassed to tell my story, but I overcome that embarrassment and I still do it. So I had to talk to him in public because it might encourage other people to talk to their relatives that's gone and connect with them. Speaking out loud actually helps.”\n\n<b>“Shelter Baby (Be That Bitch)”</b>\n“I was a shelter baby and all I seen was negative vibes when I walked outside. My mom, she [worked] in the shelter, but she started leveling up and became security, recreations and residential aid, and a supervisor. And then she got <i>me</i> a job at the shelter. So now I'm working at the shelter, and I'm getting into music. I'm coming home late from the studio all the time and my mom's like, 'Shyniece, I see your passion…it’s not doing this 9-to-5 thing. I'm telling you to resign. It's okay, chase your dream.' And that's what I did. And if I wanted to go back to the shelter today, I could. But 'Shelter Baby' is like the celebration: 'We did it, Ma, we here.'”\n\n<b>“God Bless All the Rappers”</b>\n“This one is [a statement] for all artists in entertainment, because we do this for a living as well as it being our passion, and we've been judged for it so many times. [It’s like] our lives aren't as important as the music that we put out, so I had to speak on it because as an artist I feel it and I can't just ignore what's going on in my community.”\n\n<b>“Don't Play With It” (feat. Latto & Yung Miami)</b>\n“‘Don't Play With It’ set the stage for me. It changed my life: I have a different outlook on life, different look on business, different look on a lot of things now. I always say, 'Stay ready so you don't have to get ready'—I ain't got no choice now. I can't let my fans down, I can't let my team down. We worked so hard to get here today, so I got to give them a show. I got to be the one to tell them the story.” ","short":"Four new tracks round out the Brooklyn MC’s debut

Life","artistName":"Wyatt Flores","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP and Interview","standard":"Wyatt Flores makes the minute feel monumental. The young, quickly rising singer-songwriter knows how to take a small detail and wring feeling out of it, like the image of “the smell of bacon grease and better years” in the homesick title track. An Oklahoman by birth and Mexican American by heritage, Flores brings a welcome fresh perspective to country music, with a stripped-down sound reminiscent of Tyler Childers or Zach Bryan.\n\nThe heartbreak tune “Milwaukee” channels the stomp-and-clap sound of folk-rockers The Lumineers, with a hooky chorus tempered by downcast verses. Closer “Devil” finds Flores wrestling with self-worth and purpose. And on “Wish I Could Stay,” Flores takes note of the small but powerful moments that infuse life with meaning, a loose theme that runs through the entire project. “We're not supposed to have these moments like that for long spurts of time, because if we did, then we wouldn't appreciate them,” he says. “And that's where this project leads, is appreciating those moments that you do get. Because you're not going to get too many of them.” Below, Flores breaks down several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Running Out of Time”</b>\n“‘Running Out of Time’ is actually about three friends that I had lost in the year of 2022. And that was kind of like the eye-opener again. And I'd been to a lot of funerals before, and that's kind of what started these two projects is realizing that life can be taken away from you at any point in time, and what are you going to do with it? And it's all right if you choose the easy route, but I think there's a great deal in questioning yourself on what you want and what are you willing to do to get it. Having the motivation of death sitting in the passenger seat and not looking at it as a bad thing.”\n\n<b>“Half Life”</b>\n“It was written off of fear of what I might do if I spent all my time trying to [pursue music] and I didn't actually take the time that I needed to for the people that deserve it. And that's kind of what happened. On one side of the fence, I was living life in the fast lane, [playing] shows and flying from one place to the next or driving across the entire country, and then the next thing you know, look up and things have changed and you haven't taken the time to be there for anything. And that's what sucks. I've been home for a week now, and in the first 24 hours of being back home, I find out seven of my friends are having kids. And I'm just like, ‘What in the world?’ And I am hoping that I don't miss out on that.”\n\n<b>“Devil”</b>\n“I went from nothing to everything and then to not feel like I deserve any of it. That entire song is just thoughts that roll around in my mind late at night, and I believe everyone has that. That's why the verses, they're not really telling a story. But that's why it's all over the place. ‘What makes me so goddamn special?’ It's just that breaking point of, why am I picked to do this? Because there is a lot of pressure, and sometimes that song reminds me that it's all right to just be me, and that it's all right to not be okay sometimes. But to remember that you are deserving, which is why that bridge is powerful.”","short":"The Oklahoma singer-songwriter makes the minute feel

& Bnxn","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Even if you’re only a casual follower of Nigerian music, there’s every chance that you’ve come across the music of Ruger and Bnxn. Long regarded as fundamental parts of Afropop, both have steadily evolved into indisputable hitmakers and unavoidable presences on the scene. That’s thanks to their two distinctive yet addictive takes on the genre that subsumes influences from rap, dancehall, soul, and pop into an irresistible conception of the sound. Between them, the supremely talented and self-confident acts have released record-breaking singles, projects, and collaborations while earning the respect of their peers and the generation of stars ahead of them. \n\nIt was, perhaps, only natural that things would reach a boiling point between Ruger and Bnxn. In 2023, online comparisons between them threatened to derail a blossoming personal and professional relationship hinged on mutual respect and admiration. A bitter spat online seemingly put paid to any hopes of reconciliation between them. So, it came as something of a surprise when images and videos of them together emerged late in February 2024, tantalizingly hinting at working together. Putting beef behind them, the former opps are easing into a new era in their career marked by camaraderie and collaboration, as confirmed by their Kukbeatz-produced joint single, “Romeo Must Die (RMD),” released in March. \n\nTo celebrate finding common ground, the duo has taken things a step further with the release of a collaborative project. Aptly titled <i>RnB</i>, the seven-track heat check glistens with the synthesis of Bnxn’s sweet and soulful flow and Ruger’s luminously suggestive delivery as they cheerily consider the thrills of being young, financially liquid, and constantly on the go. Midtempo jams “Bae Bae” and “Not Done” channel these thematic references with pointed specificity and self-effusing gusto, while the Sarz-produced “Ilashe” brings things back home for an extended study on their celebrity and the attention it affords them. In the spirit of collaboration, they yield the floor to each other in turns: Bnxn calls for a good time on “POE” and Ruger makes a case for the club on “Party Monster.” At the moment, the two are at the pinnacle of their careers—and who needs more enemies when alliances can be built?","short":"The former opps celebrate their new common ground."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/45/ab/00/45ab0092-4f5b-af75-68a2-7892edbb775d/197342544658_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacbce","textColor2":"d5d4db","textColor4":"acabb4","textColor1":"fafcfb","bgColor":"08081a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rnb/1739878136","playParams":{"id":"1739878136","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1L9bJDoHYbV5NbUmIT36gu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1739878136/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1548965965","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1548965965?l=en-US"},{"id":"1347142581","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1347142581?l=en-US"}]}}},"1740124311":{"id":"1740124311","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740124311?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2024-04-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/russ/683622116","name":"That's My Girl & Tired -

The Eras Tour was breaking records and blowing past the billion-dollar mark; its attendant concert film became the highest-grossing of all time. She generated interest and commerce and headlines everywhere she stepped foot, from tour stops to the tunnels of NFL stadiums. In 2023, she was named both <i>TIME</i> magazine’s Person of the Year and—just as iconic, tbh—Apple Music’s Artist of the Year. \n\nBut do songs about that level of success speak to you? As the news broke that her highly private six-year relationship to Joe Alwyn had ended, Swifties started Swiftie-ing, quickly recirculating a clip on social media of Swift a few weeks earlier, onstage during an early Eras show, in tears as she sang “champagne problems”—a song she and Alwyn had written together. It was a reminder that, despite the superhero-like aura she now radiates, Swift, at her peak, still hurts like the rest of us. What sets her apart is her ability to sublimate that pain into pop. When she announced her 11th studio album in early 2024—while accepting another Grammy, as one does—we probably shouldn’t have been surprised. \n\n“I needed to make it,” she’d say of <i>THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</i> a few weeks later, to a crowd of—[rubs eyes]—96,000 in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on <i>TORTURED POETS</i>.” Working again with trusted collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, she returns to the soft, comfortable, bed-like sonics of <i>Midnights</i>. But the stakes feel noticeably higher here: This isn’t so much a breakup album as it is a deep-sea exploration of everything Swift has been feeling, a plunge through emotional debris. \n\nOn “But Daddy I Love Him”—over strings and guitar that faintly recall her country roots—she lashes out at the crush of scrutiny and expectation she’s been subject to from the start. Naturally, catharsis comes after the chorus: “I’ll tell you something right now,” she sings. “I’d rather burn my whole life down than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning.” On “Florida!!!” she and Florence + the Machine team up for a pulpy escape fantasy wherein they Thelma and Louise their way down to the Sunshine State in hopes of starting over with new lives and identities: “Love left me like this,” they sing. “And I don’t want to exist.”\n\nAt turns hilarious and heartbreaking, <i>TTPD</i> is a study in extremes, Swift leaning into heightened emotions with heightened, hyperbolic, ALL-CAPS language and imagery—how we think when we’re drunk on love or flattened by its sudden disappearance. Note the dark humor she weaves through the Post Malone-enriched opener “Fortnight” (“Your wife waters flowers/I wanna kill her”). Or the thrilling self-deprecation of “Down Bad,” a foray into science fiction wherein Swift likens the warmth of a relationship to being abducted by love-bombing extraterrestrials—only to be left “naked and alone, in a field in my same old town.” \n\nBut this remains her most candid and unsparing work to date: As a listener, you frequently get the feeling that you’ve stumbled across emails she’d written but never sent, or into conversations you were never meant to hear. There’s a density and a specificity and a ferocity to her lyrical work here that makes 2012’s “All Too Well” feel sorta light by comparison. If you’re the kind of Swiftie who likes to live in the details, well, this one might be your Super Bowl. “You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?” she asks on the devastating “So Long, London,” a high point. “I died on the altar waiting for the proof.” Alone at a piano on the haunting “loml,” she flips the script on someone who’d told her she was the love of their life, by telling them that they were the loss of hers: “I’ll still see it until I die.” \n\nThe story, as you likely know, doesn’t end there. We get a glimpse of new beginnings in “The Alchemy” (“This happens once every few lifetimes/These chemicals hit me like white wine”) and something like triumph in the montage-ready synths of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” when Swift, shattered on the floor, “as the crowd was chanting, ‘More!’,” still finds the strength to deliver: “’Cause I’m a real tough kid and I can handle my shit.” \n\nBut we also get a sense of acceptance, of newfound perspective. On “Clara Bow”—named after a 1920s movie star who was able to survive the jump from silent film to sound—Swift reflects on the journey of a small-town girl made good, sung from the vantage of an industry obsessed with the next big thing. She zooms out and out and out until, in the album’s closing seconds, she’s singing about herself in the third person, in past tense, acknowledging that nothing is forever. “You look like Taylor Swift in this light, we’re loving it,” she sings. “You’ve got edge she never did/The future’s bright, dazzling.”\n","short":"The completed works of Taylor Swift: Her new album—with 15 extra
