MacKenzie Porter channels her own hurt and heartache into her full-length Big Loud debut, a lengthy and far-reaching collection loosely centered on lost love. The Canadian-born singer-songwriter, whose accolades in her home country include six No. 1 hits at country radio and 22 CCMA nominations, offers a little bit of everything on <i>Nobody’s Born With a Broken Heart</i>: feisty kiss-offs (“Have Your Beer,” “Bet You Break My Heart”), vulnerable admissions (“Easy to Miss,” “Confession”), and reflections on her life as an artist (“Young at Heart,” “Nightingale”). Porter delivers each song with honeyed vocals reminiscent of veteran Hillary Scott and fellow newcomer Dasha, with each track, produced by Big Loud go-to Joey Moi, heavily emphasizing pop-adjacent melodies. Porter is a writer on nine of the 19 tracks, with notable co-writers including Hillary Lindsey, Emily Weisband, Devin Dawson, and Lainey Wilson.","short":"The Canadian singer-songwriter channels

Album and Interview","standard":"It was instant bromance when Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé met at a house party in early-2000s Paris: two young French graphic designers who loved good old American rock ’n’ roll. What they lacked in technical expertise, they made up for in taste—and not exactly the “good taste” of the French artists du jour. “When we started, French house music was really about precision, and we arrived and had no idea what we were doing,” de Rosnay tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. To the world of groovy French filter house, the duo known as Justice brought AC/DC energy, punishing distortion, and a giant neon cross that towered over Marshall speaker stacks at their famously wild live shows. \n\nThree studio albums, three live albums, and two Grammys later, the Justice boys have traded their skintight leather jackets for sharply tailored suits, but though the songs on their fourth album, <i>Hyperdrama</i>, are generally less punishing than early eardrum-destroyers like “Waters of Nazareth” or “Stress,” the duo have yet to lose their edge. Eight years after their last studio release, 2016’s unprecedentedly tender <i>Woman</i>, Augé and de Rosnay return to the tensions that animated their 2007 debut. “[Contrast] has been the motor of what we do since the beginning, because there is some kind of radicality and violence that we love in electronic music, and we are also blue-eyed soul and yacht rock fans.” \n\nOn <i>Hyperdrama</i>, saccharine disco and blistering electronics don’t just coexist—they duke it out, often within the same track, as on “One Night/All Night,” whose stomping beat tugs against plaintive vocals from Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker. “Generator” nods to the brutalism of their early hits, the sax-forward “Moonlight Rendez-vous” evokes the camp of George Michael’s “Careless Whisper,” and “Dear Alan” (named for French electronic legend Alan Braxe) is the kind of blissful filter house they once stood out from like two leather-clad sore thumbs.\n\nThe duo’s songwriting has aged like fine French wine, but as always, they lead with their gut. “Really often we find that decisions in production and engineering are on the side of style and sensation more than, ‘Does it sound perfect by the standards of hi-fi?’” Augé explains. “If the good thing is that thing that was ripped 10 times and is so downgraded that it has this sort of bitcrush and glow to it, then we should go for that.”","short":"On their fourth album, the French duo’s varied influences duke it out."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/c2/19/4b/c2194bc8-63e2-b31f-b872-9611aa5fcded/5056556135845_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c1c3bf","textColor2":"fa5c1d","textColor4":"c84917","textColor1":"f1f4ef","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1724935208","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hyperdrama/1724935208","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ooBxhsOVedpX4zPTCyL86"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724935208/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"145072812","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/145072812?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714153274466}}},"1725239048":{"id":"1725239048","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725239048?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-04-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/charley-crockett/987849844","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/f2/17/25/f2172527-7eaf-0521-32e8-024d0b758aec/9a64ff19-8245-4838-a651-1e938ce4e6e7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"271b0c","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"271c0d","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"b77f33","hasP3":false}},"name":"$10 Cowboy","artistName":"Charley Crockett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Charley Crockett is a rare talent.

That sound owes a lot to Crockett’s home state of Texas, which often serves as a character in his narrative-driven songs. On <i>$10 Cowboy</i>, Crockett found inspiration on the road, writing much of the album while touring in support of its predecessor, 2022’s concept record <i>The Man From Waco</i>. \n\nThat journeyman’s perspective brings us stories of hitting rock bottom (“Gettin’ Tired Again”), chasing Lady Luck (“Ain’t Done Losing Yet”), and hanging on to love while “empire…rule[s] the world” (“Diamond in the Rough”). A can’t-miss tune on the record is “America,” a plainspoken, heart-wrenching lament of a fearsome, unforgiving country.

I felt quite lost. I was confronted with myself and all sides of myself.” The resulting record, says Moore, is 11 snapshots of how they were feeling at the time of its creation. “It’s a fully fleshed-out picture of me, which can be good and bad. It’s all about acceptance, baby.” Accordingly, <i>Teething</i> paints a multidimensional picture, a meld of bittersweet reflection and euphoric hooks, an intersection of indie-pop dynamism, pulsing garage beats, drum ’n’ bass urgency, and club banger exhilaration. \n\nThe quartet has put out a series of captivating, propulsive releases since the original lineup formed at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester in 2019 but they wanted <i>Teething</i> to represent a clean slate, a daring step into the future. “It’s a completely fresh musical experience for the audience,” states Moore. “It’s everything you love from before but souped up a bit. We had time to go down all the rabbit holes and experiment.” <i>Teething</i> is a heady, kaleidoscopic listen. Moore, bassist and keyboardist James Middleton, and guitarist Jacob Maguire guide us through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“Marmite”</b>\nScout Moore: “I think this is such a strong statement. It’s the first angry song I’ve ever written. I think there’s something really playful about anger because anger is almost camp—it’s so silly that you feel furious and so it was just a lot of fun. James had written this beat and he’d been inspired by a hot stranger on the bus that he said smelled like Marmite—I think that’s his story. He sent over the beat and I was like, ‘Oh, this is really fun.’ It felt like a good opening statement. It was never in question that that was going to start the album.”\n\n<b>“Unpredictable”</b>\nSM: “This is made up of vocal samples that Nathan [Carroll, drummer] turned into LFOs synths and we built this beat. It’s quite a bleak song if you listen to the lyrics. I was missing [the time] when you’re a child and there’s no pressure and you’re just chilling and you’re just bopping to school and having a great time. I’d just moved into a new house and I was like, ‘Ah, this is all quite intense, it feels like there’s a lot of pressure on me right now,’ and it’s about that. But what’s great is if you listen to the song without really listening to the lyrics, you’re like, ‘Ah, what a bop!’ I really enjoy having that contrast of light and dark.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Talk To Me”</b>\nJacob Maguire: “Nathan got a demo down for this and it was quite different to how it ended up. It was a lot more spacey, almost orchestral.” \nJames Middleton: “Yeah, those luscious strings at the end dominated much more of the song.”\nSM: “It was too spacey, and so we went to my house and I was like, ‘What if we added cowboy guitars? It’s time to be cinematic.’ We had these jangly guitars, we’ve got a baritone in verse one and two, super fun. The song is about a breakdown of communication between people where it’s like, ‘Oh, there’s not even any point trying anymore because you’re not going to hear what I’m saying and I’m not going to hear what you’re saying, let’s just leave it there.’”\n\n<b>“Endlessly Waiting”</b>\nSM: “I wrote this when we were on tour with Metronomy and we had a day off. There’s this thing in my life where my best friend Laura goes to New York at Easter and every time she does, my life falls apart in very weird ways. The universe doesn’t like it when she goes to New York. She can go to other places, it’s only when she goes to New York that everything gets wild. This song is all about that. It’s basically like, ‘Please come home because you are really messing up my life right now by being in New York.’ It’s like there’s a cosmic curse. We actually went to New York a few weeks ago and played there, so hopefully the curse has lifted!”\n\n<b>“My Only Love”</b>\nSM: “This started off as a bog-standard love song. I was in a long-term relationship with my first love and it was meant to be a really sweet statement. Then at Easter, one of the times that Laura went away to New York, we had a huge fight and it was a horrible weekend and that’s when we were writing the bridge for this song. I was like, ‘Guys, I don’t know if I can write the bridge, I’m not feeling a lot of love right now.’ The tone shifted and it became a really present love song, saying, ‘I’m not going to make grand gestures and I can’t say that I love you forever but I love you so much right now and that’s all that’s important.’ That’s what this love song is about.”\n\n<b>“Ghost”</b>\nJacob Maguire: “I had a little guitar riff, which I came up with quite randomly when we were all remotely recording from different parts of the country, and the other guys seemed to like it. It was quite early on in the process, we all took it to the rehearsal room and came up with the sections there. We played it live really early on as well, quite ad hoc when we had extra time at a gig.”\nSM: “It’s all about a friendship breakup. We always talk about romantic relationships ending but I think it can be even harder to lose a friend and to have that relationship dissolve. It’s cherishing the moments before you know that you’re not really going to see each other anymore, looking back at the things that we could have nurtured.”\n\n<b>“Stranger”</b>\nSM: “What an emotional song. ‘Stranger’ is all about my experience as a nonbinary individual and me coming to terms with that. I think I felt a lot of frustration because I just really want to be normal. For a long time I felt like, ‘Oh, it was so close, I was so close to just being a normal kid.’ This song is all about that. I really disliked it for a long time because I think it’s one of the most vulnerable tunes on the record, I don’t think I’d put myself out there like that before. I realized quite recently it really wasn’t just about me, even though I wrote this song purely for my own demons. We played it in January and this woman came up to me and said, ‘Hey, I’m a teacher. I teach loads of kids who are nonbinary, and thank you so much for being a voice.’ There was a real shift for me, like, ‘This is actually quite important.’ I know I wrote it for me but if this can be helpful in any way to anyone else, then that’s really important. After that, I was like, ‘I love this song.’”\n\n<b>“Sweet Risk”</b>\nSM: “I wrote this as a dare with my ex because we were doing this thing—they’re a musician—and we were like, ‘You write a song and I’ll write a song and we’ll do a PowerPoint presentation at the end of the day.’ I wrote this, I had this little idea and it was called ‘Sweet Bisc’ because we were talking about biscuits. I put it on the SoundCloud and the boys were like, ‘We really like that!’ I just thought it was really silly because the intro is the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever heard. It was clearly not meant to be a serious actual song submission, but it was really fun. And so I was like, ‘What sounds like bisc? Risk?’ and then I wrote all the other lyrics about it. It’s one of the nice silly moments on the album. It’s all about what if you took that risk, what could happen?”\n\n<b>“Gutter Punch”</b>\nJames Middleton: “I’d been listening to loads of the [experimental hip-hop/electronic] band clipping. and I noticed in a lot of clipping. songs that they have a figure where they have a kick drum with a big blast of noise on it and that’s how I came up with the sound of the chorus. I’d also just been in a huge dubstep phase for the past four years so that’s kind of how the backbeat of it came along.”\nSM: “I became nocturnal when I moved into my new flat. I was writing the songs and it all became a bit strange. I was walking around a lot, and then I had a dream where I was in a Volvo car advert. Then I heard this beat and I was like, ‘I am in a Volvo car advert, I’m writing lyrics to that one, here we go.’ The lyrics are also quite bleak on this one, but quite fun.”\n\n<b>“You Should Know Me”</b>\nSM: “We’d been doing Basement Jaxx’s ‘Where’s Your Head At’ in our set the year before and I was like, ‘I want to have a song that has that energy.’ It was flowing out. James came over, did some wobs, and then we just wanted to do something epic and Jacob whipped out that wizard guitar line. The song’s all about bravado—another side of me, whether that’s attractive or not. It kills at the end of the live set. It’s full carnage, maximalism, let loose.”\n\n<b>“Slow Down”</b>\nSM: “I wrote this while ago. I’d just gotten ill with fibromyalgia, which is a chronic illness, and I was really depressed and I was really coming to terms with it. This album takes you on the whole character arc, and you go through all of these different palettes and worlds and then to have it come down to just the voice and piano at the end where it’s like, ‘OK, this record is all about self-awareness, I’m on my own now, I’m aware of it and I understand it and that feels good.’ It felt like the perfect ending.”","short":"Singer Scout Moore on the band’s

Laufey (pronounced <i>LAY-vay</i>) is a traditionalist at heart, and her influences (think Billie Holiday and Chet Baker) shine through in the melancholic torch songs that make up her second album. (She also regularly covers the standards, and includes a version of Erroll Garner and Johnny Burke’s “Misty” here.) \n\nBut it’s in the decidedly modern words she sings where she makes new breakthroughs. A tune like “While You Were Sleeping” could be a lost Songbook addition, but its lyrics—“I'm dancing down streets/Smiling to strangers/Idiotic things/I trace it all back/3:30 am”—draw a solid line between today and the past. Yet still, her voice’s richness and her phrasing are as spellbinding as those of many of her icons. Her songs can be inventive and playful, forlorn and wrenching, and she sings of love and lack thereof with a depth beyond her 24 years. But it’s in those unexpected, fanciful twists where Laufey really impresses. In “Letter to My 13 Year Old Self,” she sings about the awkwardness of teenage years with a sensitivity and frankness that’s very much a product of the present day.\n","short":"The Icelandic jazz

Glynne","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"After completing a lengthy tour in 2019—for second album <i>Always in Between</i>—and weathering the start of the pandemic, Jess Glynne felt trepidatious about trying to create again. “I was like, ‘Can I still write? Can I still sing? Who am I?’” the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. She began writing <i>JESS</i> in August 2020 and, to ease herself back in, she teamed up with her “safest human,” producer Knox Brown, with whom she worked extensively on her 2015 debut <i>I Cry When I Laugh</i>. She also invited her regular songwriting partner Janée “Jin Jin” Bennett to join their sessions. “At first, we were trying loads of different things and just figuring it out,” Glynne recalls. “But then we wrote a song called ‘Enough’ and I was like, ‘This is going on the album. This is a version of me that I like.’” \n\nThough Glynne’s gritty rasp was front and center on her previous albums, she was best known for a string of glossy dance-pop hits including “Hold My Hand,” “Don’t Be So Hard on Yourself,” and “Rather Be” with Clean Bandit. But, this time around, she found her sound was naturally evolving. As she shuttled between sessions with top producers, including Greg Kurstin (Adele, Foo Fighters), Malay (Lorde, Frank Ocean), and Jim-E Stack (Dominic Fike, Bon Iver), Glynne was writing everything from soulful bops to country-flecked rock, plus uptempo tracks with hints of disco and drum ’n’ bass. She soon realized she needed a new team to achieve her musical vision and, in January 2022, Glynne parted ways with Atlantic Records—her home since 2013—and signed a new deal with EMI. She also left her longtime managers and later joined JAY-Z’s Roc Nation stable. “When you have success with a certain type of song, the industry wants you to keep on repeating it, but everyone changes,” Glynne says. “I’m not the same version of myself that I was 10 years ago. What I want to sing and listen to has evolved.” The result is Glynne’s richest and most revealing album to date. Read on as she supplies a candid track-by-track guide. \n\n<b>“Intro”</b>\n“Knox sent me a beat late at night and Jin Jin, who I write with a lot, said, ‘Just sing whatever’s in your head.’ The lead vocal you hear now is exactly what came out; we didn’t change it from the first take. I love the message because it really sets the tone for the album: ‘I’m being me—unapologetically me—and you can take it or leave it. But I’d love for you to listen with a free mind.’” \n\n<b>“Silly Me”</b>\n“I wrote this song during a late-night session with Knox and [producer] P2J. We were talking about our lives and the jobs we’ve done and reflecting on our mistakes. And we were like, ‘Well, if I hadn’t done that then, I wouldn’t be here now.’ I think having this song quite early in the album is important because reflection has been a massive part of my journey. I’m saying, ‘I’ve accepted that part of me, now onto the next.’”\n\n<b>“Easy”</b>\n“This was the last song I added to the album. I didn’t think anything was missing, but then I did ‘Easy’ and it was like, ‘That’s the missing piece!’ I really love the message because not everyone has that person in their life that makes it easy, but I’m really fortunate to have found that someone. I’ve been on such a roller coaster so I really appreciate getting to the point where I have an incredible support network.”\n\n<b>“Say No”</b>\n“I made this with Malay, who produced one of my favorite albums, Frank Ocean’s <i>channel ORANGE</i>. I was actually quite nervous about getting in a room with him but we connected from the get-go, and I wrote ‘Say No’ with a real fire in my belly. It’s about the changes I’ve made in my career recently in order to get to where I’m at now. It’s a reminder of the power of saying ‘no’ because, for so much of my career, I felt like those ‘nos’ have been compromised.” \n\n<b>“Enough”</b>\n“Before I wrote ‘Enough,’ I was almost trying to regurgitate what I’d done before. I was making all these upbeat and dance records, but when I listened to them back, I’d think, ‘This doesn’t sound like me.’ Then I wrote ‘Enough,’ and it felt right. I was like, ‘You’ve just been really vulnerable and real in this song and that’s what’s working right now.’ It set the tone for this whole process—don’t try to be something you’re not; just be you.” \n\n<b>“Friend of Mine”</b>\n“I made this track with [DJ/producer] Sub Focus at the end of last summer. It was a different process for me because I’d never done a drum ’n’ bass record before. It’s a song about forgiveness, but also about acknowledgment and being able to hold your hands up and accept you’re not perfect. Sometimes in a friendship it’s not necessarily about asking for forgiveness, but just [about] asking to have an awkward conversation.” \n\n<b>“Lying”</b>\n“I was super excited to write with [producer] DaHeala, who’s worked with The Weeknd, and I brought Jin Jin into the session. We were starting loads of ideas but nothing was happening, and I remember saying, ‘I need some air.’ Jin Jin and I were actually wondering whether to call it a day. But when we went back in, this musician called Charlie [Coffeen] was playing the piano and we were like, ‘Let’s just sing over it.’ And, I kid you not, ‘Lying’ came out within half an hour. I ended up finishing it with another producer, Emile Haynie, and some singers I’ve worked closely with over the years. I love the sound and the sentiment. It’s a ‘look hard in the mirror’ moment.” \n\n<b>“Save Your Tears”</b>\n“It was really fun building this track from scratch with [producer] Jim-E Stack. We paid a lot of attention to structuring the chords and melodies in each section. When we got to the chorus, I wanted a kind of euphoric payoff with electric guitars. Then we FaceTimed Jin Jin who came through with extra lyrics and melodies—she actually changed the way I sing the hook. Because we spent so much time on this track, I couldn’t listen to it for a minute, but when I came back to it later, it was a real treat. It’s such a vibe.”\n\n<b>“What Do You Do?”</b>\n“I was in the studio with [producer] Chrome Sparks and got this notion of doing a house record. He was playing around with sounds, and we got into a really deep chat about past relationships. We were talking about how sometimes you can love someone so much, but it’s not enough. When that happens, when do you know to let it go? It’s about being in toxic relationships that are really damaging because you end up becoming co-dependent. It was quite liberating to write because I think we sometimes shy away from acknowledging experiences like that.” \n\n<b>“Say It Isn’t True”</b>\n“I wrote this song with [producer] Greg Kurstin and [singer-songwriter] Mozella. It’s got a country element and some Fleetwood Mac energy. I love the drums, but the funny thing is, when we finished the record, I remember saying to Greg, ‘Do you think the drums are a bit rocky? Should we make them calmer?’ And he said, ‘Jess, I think the beauty of this record is that it’s classic.’ I’m so glad he took a stance because now I love how they sound.”\n\n<b>“Chair”</b>\n“This song is one of my favorites because it’s incredibly vulnerable. I was going through quite a heavy breakup and I’d just had this really awful loss [of a close friend]. I didn’t really know how to manage my emotions, so when I went into a session and started singing, this song just kind of fell out. I called it ‘Chair’ because that’s what I see when I hear it: an empty chair of loss.”\n\n<b>“Do You Know About Love?”</b>\n“This was also liberating for me to write. I love Malay’s production and the ambiguity of its message. It’s about allowing yourself to fall in love, be it right or wrong, because you want to find out more. That’s one of my favorite things about love: when you meet someone and there’s a fear on either side, but you acknowledge it. Like, ‘I want to take that risk for you because what’s the worst that can happen?’” \n\n<b>“We Had Something”</b>\n“This track is very disco. It was on the album, off the album, on the album, off…I wrote it quite early on and couldn’t make sense of how it made me feel, but this is why it’s important to have people around you who can remind you why songs matter. I’m so glad I decided to keep it on the album because it’s got such a euphoric feeling and reminds me of where I started in this whole process.” \n\n<b>“Love Me”</b>\n“This is a confident, sexy record I made with Chrome Sparks. This journey I’ve been on the past few years [has been about] finding liberation as a woman: being able to stand confidently and be authentically myself. For a long time, I was made to feel bad if I showed that side of me. I was told, ‘That’s not what people want from you. Be relatable.’ So now, this song reminds me that being confident and sexy is just another part of being a woman and it’s important to embrace all sides of who you are.”\n\n<b>“Promise Me”</b>\n“I wanted to seal the album with a kiss, and this song felt perfect. I’m saying, ‘As long as you promise me love, then we’re all good.’ ‘Promise Me’ was a real turning point for me because [Roc Nation vice-chairman] Jay Brown heard it and wanted to know more. I went into that meeting feeling so insecure and unworthy but he reminded me that I’m good enough. I’ll never forget him saying, ‘There’s always a way forward.

A notorious shredder, she cut her teeth as a member of Sufjan Stevens’ touring band before releasing her debut album <i>Marry Me</i> in 2007. Since then, her reputation as a six-string samurai has been cemented in the wake of a run of critically acclaimed albums and collaborations (she co-wrote Taylor Swift’s No 1. single “Cruel Summer”).\n\nA shape-shifter of the highest order, St. Vincent, aka Annie Clark, has always put visual language on equal footing with her sonic output. Most recently, she released 2021’s <i>Daddy’s Home</i>, a conceptual period piece that pulled inspiration from ’70s soul and glam set in New York City. That project marked the end of an era visually—gone are the bleach-blonde wigs and oversized Times Square-ready trench coats—as well as creatively. With <i>All Born Screaming</i>, she bids adieu to frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff, who produced <i>Daddy’s Home</i>, and instead steps behind the boards for the first time to produce the project herself.\n\n“For me, this record was spending a lot of time alone in my studio, trying to find a new language for myself,” Clark tells Apple Music’s Hanuman Welch. “I co-produced all my other records, but this one was very much my fingerprints on every single thing. And a lot of the impetus of the record was like, ‘Okay: I'm in the studio and everything has to start with chaos.’”\n\nFor Clark, harnessing that chaos began by distilling the elemental components of what makes her sound like, well, her. Guitar players, in many respects, are some of the last musicians defined by the analog. Pedal boards, guitar strings, and pass-throughs are all manipulated to create a specific tone. It’s tactile, specialized, and at times, yes, chaotic. \n\n“What I mean by chaos,” Clark says, “is electricity actually moving through circuitry. Whether it's modular synths or drum machines, just playing with sound in a way that was harnessing chaos. I've got six seconds of this three-hour jam, but that six seconds is lightning in a bottle and so exciting, and truly something that could only have happened once and only happened in a very tactile way. And then I wrote entire songs around that.”\n\nThose songs cover the spectrum from sludgy, teeth-vibrating offerings like “Flea” all the way to the lush album cut (and ode to late electronic producer SOPHIE) “Sweetest Fruit.” Clark relished in balancing these light and dark sounds and sentiments—and she didn’t do so alone. “I got to explore and play and paint,” she says. “And I also luckily had just great friends who came in to play on the record and brought their amazing energy to it.” <i>All Born Screaming</i> features appearances from Dave Grohl, Warpaint’s Stella Mozgawa, and Welsh artist Cate Le Bon, among others. \n\nLe Bon pulled double duty on the album by performing on the title track as well as offering clarity for some of the murkier production moments. “I was finding myself a little bit in the weeds, as everyone who self-produces does,” Clark says. “And so I just called Cate and was like, ‘I need you to just come hold my hand for a second.’ She came in and was a very stabilizing force, I think, at a time in the making of the record when I needed someone to sort of hold my hand and pat my head and give me a beer, like, ‘It's going to be okay.’”\n\nWith <i>All Born Screaming</i>, Clark manages to capture the bloody nature of the human experience—including the uncertainty and every lightning-in-a-bottle moment—but still manages to make it hum along like a Saturday morning cartoon. “The album, to me, is a bit of a season in hell,” she says. “You are a little bit walking on your knees through some broken glass—but in a fun way, kids. We end with this sort of, ‘Yes, life is difficult, but it's so worth living and we've got to live it. Can't go over it, can't go under it, might as well go through it.’ It's black and white and the colors of a fire. That, to me, is sonically what the record is.”","short":"Annie Clark embraces the chaos: “The album is a bit of a season in

A lot of the stuff I write is very existential and trying to understand who I am and why I am. At this time, I was very disorientated and maybe a bit emotionally lost, even though life was moving forward in a really great way.”\n\nThe two albums were conceived and recorded in vastly different circumstances. His debut came together in isolation under the cloak of COVID lockdowns, while <i>boy</i> was written as he toured the world with 5 Seconds of Summer, the Sydney band the singer/guitarist co-founded as a 15-year-old in 2011. Still, the pair have much in common: turns out you can feel just as alone spending months traversing the globe as you can sitting in your house waiting for the world to open up.\n\nPart of the reason for that disorientation was the dawning realization that he was entering his late twenties, leading Hemmings to reflect deeply on his youth while considering a potential future as a father. “You want to be the most fully realized version of yourself before stepping into that sort of role, which is a work in progress,” he explains.\n\nTaking inspiration from artists such as Damon Albarn, Beach House, LCD Soundsystem, and Richard Ashcroft, <i>boy</i> exhibits a dreamlike quality, one that bathes in melancholy without ever sinking into depression—witness the way in which opener “I’m Still Your Boy” builds from a whispered acoustic beginning into a grandiose and uplifting climax; or the sad-happy mélange of synths and dance beats that propel “Close My Eyes.” Here, Hemmings takes Apple Music through <i>boy</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“I’m Still Your Boy”</b>\n“This song really encompasses the ache I wanted to get across and the growing pains it took to become a fully realized adult version of myself. It’s only until I started thinking of having children of my own that I began reflecting on the struggles I had myself as a teenager who grew up in the public eye. This song is about understanding my youth that was marred with trauma amidst beauty, whilst trying to become a good man. ‘I’m Still Your Boy’ walks on the high wire between boyhood and adulthood, looking both ways.”\n\n<b>“Shakes”</b>\n“‘Shakes’ was written on a dreary evening in between long periods of travel and touring, so it easily came from an incredibly melancholy place. A feeling of yearning to be back home, of feeling lonely and emotionally desperate and depleted. There is a longing for love and self-acceptance in the lyrics, and I hope it to be a song that anyone listening [to] can find themselves in and attach their own story.”\n\n<b>“Benny”</b>\n“This song is named after my brother, Ben, but in its entirety, it represents all of my loved ones and the guilt I feel being away from my family and living on the periphery of their world. It represents the mornings I wake up in a panic, anxious and worried that today will be the day I get bad news. News that would make my dreams of making music seem infantile and pointless. I’d do anything for the people I love.”\n\n<b>“Close My Eyes”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Close My Eyes’ as I headed into my late twenties and felt an unavoidable wave of fear and anxiety towards the inevitable death of my youth. I found myself unable to sleep because every time I tried, it was as if a film of my life was projected onto the back of my eyelids—the mistakes, successes, everything that could have been, and everything that was. I was sonically trying to tap into 2000s indie rock bands like LCD Soundsystem and The Rapture.”\n\n<b>“Garden Life”</b>\n“I had the idea for ‘Garden Life’ when I couldn’t sleep in a hotel room somewhere in the world, sometime around 3am. The next morning, I went for a walk and wrote the lyrics on a park bench, watching life pass me by. It’s really just an existential love song to my happiest and safest place. The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve realized that sometimes the most beautiful and visceral memories in life are not the most grand and obvious ones, they can be simple and powerful. It’s not always the fireworks on New Year’s Eve. Sometimes it’s a Friday night sitting on the couch listening to your favorite person laugh.”\n\n<b>“Close Enough to Feel You”</b>\n“This song was inspired by sounds from Cocteau Twins and my bloody valentine, who I listened to heavily during the making of <i>boy</i>. The beauty in ‘Close Enough to Feel You’ is all in the details, both sonically and lyrically. Sometimes when you suffer a big emotional loss, something so mundane and otherwise unnoticed can become earth-shattering. A glimpse of a photo out of the corner of your eye, a stain on the carpet, an old sweater, sends you into the fetal position. This song is about the willingness and desire to live in that pain in order to feel close to who or what you lost, rather than moving on.”\n\n<b>“Promises”</b>\n“‘Promises’ was the song written for the EP that finally made me feel like I was really onto something. It started with merely a drum beat, which I find ironic as I’m not a drummer. But I think maybe it’s that naïveté that led to this song being created.

have touched a vast global audience. <i>The New York Etudes</i> grew from the composer’s diagnosis with multiple sclerosis in 2007 and the therapeutic effects on his condition of the daily ritual of improvising at the piano. \n\nBeal, who moved to New York City in 2021, created and recorded the album’s 10 pieces at home in Manhattan. The results amount to a gentle hymn to life. Their cumulative power is intensified by the meditative stillness and concentration of “Riverside Revelations,” “I’m With You (for Rosemary),” and the haunting “The More Things Change,” and enhanced by the exquisite “Corridors of Calm,” a mantra-like progression of sonorous piano chords.","short":"Experience music as meditation with these beautiful piano

Sept 12 - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Bella Shmurda","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"In the wake of the passing of beloved rapper and singer MohBad in 2023, close friend and collaborator Bella Shmurda played a critical role in honoring the memory of the musician whose soulful interpretation of street-pop had captured popular imagination. Shmurda had first connected with MohBad years prior, as they both navigated Lagos’ labyrinthine underground street-pop music scene, developing a tight-knit bond that would provide a haven for both singers on several occasions throughout their careers. \n\n“My Brother,” released less than a month after the death of MohBad, succinctly captured the intensity of Shmurda’s hurt at the passing of his dear friend and the depth of the shared experiences that formed the bedrock of their friendship. Addressing these feelings more intently, <i>R2 Sept 18</i>, Shmurda’s first project since 2023’s <i>DND</i>, reverberates with the singer’s thoughts on death’s fickleness, the jarring confusion of a loved one being taken so suddenly, and trying to work through what fond memories are left while fighting off a never-ending sense of loss. \n\nThe EP was envisioned as a cogent dispatch before a more in-depth album release on the first anniversary of MohBad’s passing. Therefore, <i>R2 Sept 18</i> is an unflinching portrait of the grieving process and, even though MohBad is only referenced directly on “My Brother,” the sum of its five songs bear witness to his presence and what he meant to Shmurda. “I just dey lie if I say I’m fine,” he candidly offers on the larrylanes-produced opener, “Feelings.” Those same impulses provide thematic influence for “Loner” as Shmurda bids for peace for himself, his friends, and MohBad’s loved ones. Fast-rising singer and producer Bloody Civilian stops by for an ode for hustling on “1999,” while Jeriq and Zlatan combine to provide the project’s liveliest moment on “Oghene,” with the trio supplicating for divine blessings. By the time <i>R2 Sept 18</i> fades out to chants of MohBad’s name from a memorial held in Lagos last year, we’re reminded of the never-ending specter of grief and how it can still creep up on us even at the most unexpected moments.","short":"The street-pop star returns with a meditative take on love and loss."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c7/6b/16/c76b164e-a139-5f76-ad62-02c353a3d215/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c4c3c3","textColor2":"f94902","textColor4":"cd3f05","textColor1":"ededf0","bgColor":"1e1913","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1738075875","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/r2-sept-12-ep/1738075875"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738075875/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1455517405","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1455517405?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714152671196}}},"1738146233":{"id":"1738146233","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738146233?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-04-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marc-anthony/217029","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a9/f4/c4/a9f4c4b9-d12a-86db-1e8d-2912ba640f9c/057823ca-6c16-4d4c-b020-dacf1c469137.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7a296","textColor2":"da997d","textColor4":"b27e67","textColor1":"f4c5b7","bgColor":"121510","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/11/28/b3/1128b3bd-d0bd-56d1-0920-2a6fff77c0e6/7357a287-13fb-4323-8026-19c41fccd8d2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3b5b4","textColor2":"bbc5c7","textColor4":"98a2a2","textColor1":"dcdedc","bgColor":"101511","hasP3":false}},"name":"MUEVENSE","artistName":"Marc Anthony","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The title of Marc Anthony’s latest album more or less speaks for itself. The tropical rhythms of <i>MUEVENSE</i> compel listeners to dance, while the lyrical contents seek to inspire a more emotional sort of movement. Much like he did with the preceding <i>Pa’lla Voy</i>, the indomitable salsa star concisely and effectively emphasizes his strengths as a genre veteran with these 10 tracks. The opening title track and the previously released single “Punta Cana” set the tone for what comes next, all of which is sure to captivate his long-standing audience. Romantic themes naturally prevail here, whether he’s wrestling the sadness of “Amarte a la Antigua” or urging towards the more hopeful promise of “Pasemos a los Besos.” By contrast, “Ale Ale” shifts the focus from matters of the heart to matters of national pride, while the Pepe Aguilar team-up “Ojalá Te Duela” shakes things up by transitioning into a música mexicana mode.","short":"The indomitable salsa veteran returns with 10 new songs."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ab/88/47/ab8847b6-28f2-710c-8d20-3b55544f6633/196871093873.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"182527","textColor2":"121f21","textColor4":"20373b","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"5b99a4","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1738146233","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/muevense/1738146233","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4s31G22LIRgvzROQatefZ9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738146233/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"217029","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/217029?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714152398469}}},"1738384800":{"id":"1738384800","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738384800?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-04-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/acemo/949219289","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f9/ee/f7/f9eef7bd-025a-27ac-fca3-bfd887b6806d/193ffb1c-e4eb-49e1-b1c5-5e6e3fc4f4ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2e2e","textColor2":"0b0b0b","textColor4":"303030","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"c4c4c4","hasP3":false}},"name":"Save the World","artistName":"AceMo","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d0/4a/8a/d04a8a8b-ed35-0a33-4622-b6369afeb1a7/840200598941_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfb9ba","textColor2":"e2d59e","textColor4":"b7ac82","textColor1":"ece5e5","bgColor":"0d0a11","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/save-the-world/1738384800","playParams":{"id":"1738384800","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3coLUMzwSUP6MTzFOtDnsd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738384800/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"949219289","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/949219289?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714139264029}}},"1738543876":{"id":"1738543876","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738543876?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-04-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ringo-starr/52017","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Crooked Boy -

But his first album in four years represents the purest statement of purpose we’ve heard from the Toronto R&B auteur. If <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR 4</i>’s NSFW cover art doesn’t make his intentions clear, then the album’s very first lyric—“Take off your clothes”—instantly thrusts you into the boudoir where many of these songs play out, with foggy keyboard tones wafting in like incense and trap beats flickering like candlelight. \n\nBut PARTYNEXTDOOR is a certified lover boy keenly attuned to the destabilizing dynamics inherent to desire: After making the aforementioned request for disrobing on the opening “C o n t r o l,” he asks, “Who is in control?”—reframing his bedroom conquest as an act of surrender. Even his most salacious admissions project a certain ecstatic innocence: The Auto-Tuned devotional “L o s e M y M i n d” is possibly the most rapturous song ever written about enjoying a threesome on molly, while the dreamy “M a k e I t T o T h e M o r n i n g” renders mutual oral sex as a near-religious experience. But <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR 4</i> does more than merely celebrate his X-rated exploits: The awestruck “R e a l W o m a n” suggests he’s looking for a relationship that goes beyond sunrise, while the downcast closing duo of “F a m i l y” and “R e s e n t m e n t” tap a deeper emotional vein to reveal the hang-ups that come with the hookups.

As one of the most notorious artists in Mexican pop, her career has been anything but typical, but she’s currently enjoying a commercial and critical peak. The singer from Mazatlán has transitioned from a social media phenomenon into a serious artist, developing a sophisticated sound that’s revived the Latin pop genre.\n\nNow, the singer has crafted the definitive album of her career with the third chapter in her personal saga: <i>Pink Aura</i>. “I wanted the entire album and everything associated with it to feel deeply feminine, so that women can identify,” she explains. Below, Kenia OS explains the changes she went through to make the album happen.\n\n<b>Finding herself</b>\nThe moment I finished this project, it’s like all the pieces of the puzzle started to fit together. When you begin the process of creating music, it also marks the discovery of your own individual sound. It was only on this project that everything came together and my music finally began to sound like Kenia OS. I’m at a stage right now where I can get in the studio and every single song I record will feel like it’s mine. For instance, I was under the impression that I was an urban artist who did only reggaetón. But suddenly I had huge hits with pop material like “Llévatelo” and “Malas Decisiones.” There was a milestone where I decided that this new sound would become my true identity, not only because my fans love pop, but also because it’s the genre where I feel the most comfortable.\n\n<b>Mixing things up</b>\nI’m really into electronica. I’ve been recording a batch of songs that are in a pop vein, but with more electronic sounds. That kind of song never fails to put me in a good mood—music for the nightclub, for going out to party. I touch on that influence on the new record. I didn’t want the whole album to sound the same. That would be boring for both my fans and myself.\n\n<b>Overcoming personal challenges</b>\nWhenever I make an album, it has to be connected with my essence. It can get complicated if you begin the process just for the sake of making music. If there’s no motivation behind it, then I can’t be passionate. I needed time before I could get started, to see where I was standing in my personal life, what I really felt like. I realized that I was going through the process of leaving behind my younger self and becoming an adult woman. I wanted the entire album and everything associated with it to feel deeply feminine, so that women can identify with that vibe. I also wanted people to realize that in addition to looking for my own sound, I’m also involved in a more personal quest—a quest that my fans have been a part of. I grew up within the industry, and finally arrived at a place of healing where I found happiness.\n\n<b>Reinventing her vocal style</b>\nIt involved a lot of hard work. About a year ago, I met a vocal coach; we’re a great match, and I haven’t let go. I fell in love with her work and how she directs my voice. I’ve spent hours in the studio working on the same song. Before I would record the lead, some backup vocals, a few improvs, and the job was done in about three hours. Now it takes me at least six hours. We do so many new things underneath the melody that it takes a lot of effort until we achieve the desired effect. I can definitely tell you that I gave everything I had recording the vocals for this new album.\n","short":"“I’m searching for my own sound, but also for the essence of my true

Face (Club Deluxe)","artistName":"Stephen Sanchez","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Album","standard":"In a world rife with dating apps and situationships, Stephen Sanchez is repackaging old-school love for a new generation. The young singer-songwriter channels the vintage pop/rock sounds, love-stricken lyricism, and warbly croons of the golden greats (à la Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Nat “King” Cole, and The Platters) and filters it through today’s high-definition lens, producing a style that’s nostalgic without erring on pastiche. \n\nAfter going viral on social media in 2020, Sanchez released his 2021 major-label debut “Until I Found You,” which became an instant and lasting hit, going multiplatinum and amassing over two billion streams. A tender ballad swathed in dreamy, dusty guitar and warm harmonies, the song could almost be one of the many vinyl records he thumbed through in his grandfather’s barn as a child, 7-inch time capsules of the ’50s and ’60s.\n\n<i>Angel Face</i>, Sanchez’s first full-length, is an extended trip into that world: one of smoke-filled nightclubs and glamour, where candy-colored Cadillacs pack drive-in theaters and couples slow-dance cheek to cheek next to the jukebox. Taking place between 1958 and 1964, the concept album chronicles a love story between a famous crooner (The Troubadour Sanchez) and Evangeline, the girlfriend of a mob boss who owns the club where Sanchez performs. “Something About Her” opens the LP with infatuated musing over plinking keys: “What good is love if not to miss your hands or your eyes/Or the way that yours just look in mine?” he drawls. On the twinkling “Evangeline,” he pleads his case to the titular character with an urgent half-roar, half-falsetto. While the pair find a (premature) happy ending atop the piano crescendo of “Be More,” complications arise across the album’s second act, bringing balance to Sanchez’s loved-up serenades and carrying <i>Angel Face</i> to its dramatic finale.","short":"The singer-songwriter adds six new tracks to his nostalgic 2023 debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5c/30/34/5c303478-a98f-90b0-98fb-5541d1017a9a/24UMGIM37365.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbccc5","textColor2":"e95547","textColor4":"bb483f","textColor1":"fdfbef","bgColor":"03141e","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1741034588","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/angel-face-club-deluxe/1741034588"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741034588/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1276541872","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1276541872?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714157068763}}},"1741063217":{"id":"1741063217","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741063217?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-04-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/moneysign-suede/1583997543","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Chosen One","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"MoneySign Suede","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5d/18/4f/5d184fa7-7a56-65f3-d483-31b5f65ce756/075597898866.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"bead9a","textColor2":"e8c099","textColor4":"c09e7f","textColor1":"e6d2bb","bgColor":"1e1915","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-chosen-one/1741063217","playParams":{"id":"1741063217","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3XXZCHqk34BNnJpOgCWxE7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741063217/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1583997543","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1583997543?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714160639816}}},"1741279869":{"id":"1741279869","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741279869?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-04-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yuqi/1566541268","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/43/33/3c/43333ce3-8686-bda9-d295-7646321179c9/5ac70afb-7d36-4698-affa-2f399e415ffe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a7a6","textColor2":"da887c","textColor4":"b3736c","textColor1":"d9c8c4","bgColor":"1a232b","hasP3":false}},"name":"YUQ1","artistName":"YUQI","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a3/1f/6f/a31f6f3c-f192-3eba-90f0-74b2eadb095f/196922937156_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"241f28","textColor2":"240110","textColor4":"401e33","textColor1":"010303","bgColor":"af8fc0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yuq1/1741279869","playParams":{"id":"1741279869","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7LYc8ngbhwha4aGJ5kVauc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741279869/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1566541268","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1566541268?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714080434022}}},"1741374821":{"id":"1741374821","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741374821?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fredo-bang/1080703688","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/68/ff/e1/68ffe1a3-7539-f85e-7628-7b627781688f/Job128393f3-c064-4b91-b41b-f539a190ea35-166782569-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_324286556_1749097245-Time1713887015512.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e8c1b8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c1c0c0","textColor2":"e8c1b8","textColor4":"bc9d97","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/46/fe/a8/46fea8dc-ef61-231c-168f-ce13e8d25175/Job26c3eae1-eb96-4a53-84d3-5de37dbcc89e-166782570-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_324286555_1749097244-Time1713888154589.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c2c1bd","textColor2":"eaccab","textColor4":"bfa78c","textColor1":"eeece8","bgColor":"131414","hasP3":false}},"name":"Yes, I’m Sad (More Therapy) [Deluxe]","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fredo Bang","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Baton Rouge rapper Fredo Bang has rarely shied away from honesty in his music. On the boldly titled <i>Yes, I’m Sad</i>, he takes that to a new level. Mixing defensive aggression with honest vulnerability, songs like “Come Thru” and the title track deliver bars about the pain that lingers even after achieving success. Demonstrating a willingness to let his guard down that’s rare in hip-hop today, he raps about lost friends and loved ones, taking care of those left behind. Hardship only seems to compel him further forward, evident on the purpose-driven hustle and grind of “Tina Turner.” Topically, the project moves from heavy moments to relative lighter ones, the latter encapsulated in the explicit smooth talk of “Drop It Low” and “Love & Relations.” To further his points, he links with the seasoned likes of Kevin Gates and Rick Ross while reuniting with “Trust Issues” cohort NLE Choppa, the latter’s “Sideways” soundtracked by a Jersey club swing.","short":"The Baton Rouge rapper lets his guard down and lets listeners in."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/da/52/3c/da523c8a-e2d8-75b8-aef5-2a98499de9cf/24UMGIM41410.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4b7ae","textColor2":"edd1b3","textColor4":"c3ab92","textColor1":"efe0d6","bgColor":"1a150f","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1741374821","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yes-im-sad-more-therapy-deluxe/1741374821","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4cojwTIPEfSxiqcGrhcLrK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741374821/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1080703688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1080703688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714152226333}}},"1741470746":{"id":"1741470746","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741470746?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-04-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anitta/597214610","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/73/89/1d/73891d43-584f-67cb-d71c-ef1db0d67eb9/Job9c0c0dc2-2e62-4c04-9ebd-d59c8c54d137-166348146-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323334118_1741871414-Time1713243054714.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dfd841"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cad1d2","textColor2":"dfd841","textColor4":"b3b23a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/35/9c/f0/359cf072-2a07-1297-895f-3294d27b3927/462252ab-f603-4bac-9b02-1af712591d5b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b99e8f","textColor2":"dcaf98","textColor4":"b18f7d","textColor1":"e6c2ae","bgColor":"050e11","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/21/a0/7d/21a07d34-9add-758f-8b78-0378a8257f82/Job28b8b65d-20ac-45c2-aa53-2e78c40e2ae9-166348147-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323334121_1741871415-Time1713244375539.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c0cbce","textColor2":"dfd92c","textColor4":"b2b227","textColor1":"f1f9fc","bgColor":"001515","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/24/8a/13248a82-7b35-ba9d-a624-d9d83015ee90/f7d0d1c7-b783-4bfd-b221-46ad2a57dec8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c564","textColor2":"d4d260","textColor4":"abab51","textColor1":"f2f278","bgColor":"061114","hasP3":false}},"name":"Funk Generation","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Anitta","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Trilingual triple threat Anitta boasts a chameleonic quality as an artist, one who can vibe with Cardi B or Peso Pluma just as credibly as she waves the flag for definitively Brazilian sounds. Expanding on the tantalizing tease of 2023’s <i>Funk Generation: A Favela Love Story</i> EP, this broader and bigger expression of the homegrown baile funk style benefits from the wide reach of her global platform. From the opening rhythms of “Lose Ya Breath” to the subtle breeziness of closer “Mil Veces,” she proudly and explicitly represents for the genre. \n\nEnergetic cuts like “Funk Rave” and “Savage Funk” shake the room, while “Aceita” and “Sabana” delightfully push back against any conservative notion of what this music should sound like. To that end, she brings her knowing pop appeal to “Fria” and “Love in Common,” delivering hooks without losing the overall vibrancy of the dance-floor format. None of these tracks crack the three-minute mark, save for the urgent and profane “Double Team” with Brray and Bad Gyal.

After expanding his range further on 2023’s hip-hop-adjacent <i>TRAPPii</i>, the arrival of <i>Música Buena Para Días Malos</i> reinforces his bona fides as a standout singer. Romantic reggaetoneros abound in the scene, but his pliant yet masculine tone suits the maximalist thump of “En Tu Mente” and “Otro Más.” Even still, his pop prowess continues to grow, evident on the oft beatless “Admítelo” and the downtrodden “Mi Todo.” The album’s back half basks in this quieter though no less emotional mode, spilling his feels out in English and in Spanish on “Save Me” and “Turbulencia.” As for the handful of collaborations, he moves to the urgency of synthwave alongside Mora on “Textos Fríos” and dips into duet mode with Venezuela’s Noreh on the broadly balladic
