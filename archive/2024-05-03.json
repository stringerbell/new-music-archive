A Devastating Turn of Events","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Rachel Chinouriri","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I have to write about how I feel,” Rachel Chinouriri tells Apple Music. “If I don’t feel it or can’t relate to it, I can’t write about it.” Since breaking out in 2022 with viral track “So My Darling,” the South London singer-songwriter has done just that, penning bittersweet indie bops and devastating ballads that have been fueled, most often, by stories of heartache. You’ll find plenty of that on this debut album, but Chinouriri also goes deeper, with songs about self-contempt, loss, grief, and feeling like you don’t belong right when you’re supposed to be killing it (see “The Hills,” her cathartic exhale about a five-week songwriting trip to LA, which left her feeling lonely, under pressure, and creatively stumped). For Chinouriri, <i>What a Devastating Turn of Events</i> was shaped by “the journey of being in your early twenties. You finally leave home and then you are kind of becoming an adult, but you don’t really feel like an adult,” she says. “You’re still looking at the grown-ups to give you advice, but you are the grown-up. It is a weird journey of trying to discover yourself. Being able to feel and then turn it into song—it’s a privilege to have that as a gift.”\n\nBut <i>What a Devastating Turn of Events</i> also feels rooted in much more than just a bumpy life transition, and Chinouriri’s lyricism is laced with far more wisdom than most people can apply to those chaotic early-twenties years. Either way, the singer-songwriter wanted her debut to capture what it’s like to be shattered by a sudden event. And so, the record opens with sharp-witted, mostly upbeat indie-pop moments (plus some “wonky” bits, as Chinouriri puts it), before the crushing title track—written after the singer-songwriter’s cousin tragically took her own life—shifts this album, and its creator, on its axis. What follows are some of Chinouriri’s most raw, arresting songs yet. “When death happens, it does turn your entire world upside down,” she says. “It might not even be death, it might just be something that happens. And sometimes you don’t realize how much you have until something major happens. Then you realize, ‘Damn, I’ve wasted so much time bothering about stuff that doesn’t matter.’ Turning points can either make or break people.” This album ends on Chinouriri’s own turning point: “Pocket,” a sweet song about new, better love that Chinouriri promised she’d give to the person who finally allowed her to feel it, followed by her acoustic version of “So My Darling,” the song that started this wild ride in the first place. Here, Chinouriri takes us through her debut, track by track. \n\n<b>“Garden of Eden”</b>\n“I wrote this after my big LA trip feeling like, ‘This [the UK] is home for me.’ I’m just adamant I want a house in the countryside. Where I grew up in Croydon isn’t that, but it was quiet, and I would always hear birds and see fields and grass. We were in a room [in a studio in the UK countryside, where Chinouriri went after LA] and would always have the recording on, and the birds were that loud. I was like, ‘Let’s just maybe make it a soundscape where you’re just falling into this situation.’ It’s setting the scene.” \n\n<b>“The Hills”</b>\n“We’ve left the Garden of Eden now and I’m like, ‘Right, I don’t belong here.’ The music video shows [me], a Black woman, walking across some flags, and people have said, ‘Oh, she’s talking about how she doesn’t belong in the UK,’ but I’m actually talking about how much I <i>do</i> belong. It’s almost seeing those street parties where they’ve got all the flags and being like, ‘I’m as English as you guys, so I belong here and I’ll be staying here whether you like it or not.’ The song is definitely a headbanging, screaming moment—it has a bit of an American-boy-band-in-a-basement, kids-in-a-garage vibe. It felt like a relief to have something after a trip where we didn’t have much, especially after five weeks.”\n\n<b>“Never Need Me”</b>\n“After I wrote this, I didn’t even send it to the label. A few days later, I was at a festival and my manager came to me and said, ‘Why didn’t you send us this song? Oli [Bayston, one of the song’s co-writers] sent it to us.’ I said, ‘I don’t like it, I think it’s a terrible song.’ I think it was because of its meaning. And in the session, I was just so angry and annoyed and in such an agitated mood. I felt uninspired. But later, I said, ‘If I can do it however I want, I’ll finish the song.’ So I went to [songwriter] Glen Roberts and changed all the production—I was thinking Kings of Leon and heavy guitars.” \n\n<b>“My Everything”</b>\n“This song is about giving your all to everyone. My project before this album, <i>Four° in Winter</i>, was very experimental and wonky. I knew I was hitting some pop territories with this album, but I think there are still wonky elements to me. I really love Ladysmith Black Mambazo and how they use their voice almost as the instruments. I just liked being in the studio and coming up with weird sounds with my voice. I don’t even want to know how many vocal tracks are on that—but it was a lot! I don’t know if people will like it, but I wanted to show all the different parts of who I am.”\n\n<b>“All I Ever Asked”</b>\n“Again, I didn’t want it on the album. But now I realize this song is important and a way people discovered me [it was a single in 2022]. I think I’m actually quite a dark person because I’m a Scorpio. Whether you believe in star signs or not, I’ve always gravitated towards dark lyrics to a point where I don’t think sad lyrics really hit me anymore. But there’s also a degree of making light of situations. Because as much as [what inspired this song] is sad, it’s also like, ‘You’ll live. He was an asshole. There are plenty more people you can meet in this world.’ There’s light that can come to those situations.” \n\n<b>“It Is What It Is”</b>\n“When I was doing [the speak-singing here], I was like, ‘Maybe I’m going to sound a bit like a loser.’ I’m not really rapping, I’m talking, and then obviously I have this English accent. I don’t want to say I have a boring voice, but when I’m speaking, I think I sound quite monotone. But what I’m saying is, ‘You are a fucking arsehole.’ This one’s for my girls and boys who have definitely felt this multiple times. Mae Muller is on this track. She is that person who will be like, ‘Absolutely not.’ I’ll go out and look at someone slightly questionable and be like, ‘I fancy him.’ She’ll go to the bathroom and be like, ‘Rachel, love you so much. No, no, you’re not doing that.’ And I’ll be like, ‘OK.’”\n\n<b>“Dumb Bitch Juice”</b>\n“This was very much Amy Winehouse-inspired—I know it’s not Amy Winehouse at all, but she had this ability to sing in quite a free and melodic way, but you can hear every single thing she says. When I wrote this, I was like, ‘I’m here to insult today.’ Not just insulting someone else—insulting myself too. Because sometimes men are terrible, but there’s also a degree of ‘You have allowed someone to treat you like that.’ Of course I’ve been heartbroken by an absolute idiot because I’m drinking dumb bitch juice!”\n\n<b>“What a Devastating Turn of Events”</b>\n“All my siblings were born in Africa, I’m the only one who was born in the UK. There’s a set of relatives who know I exist, but I’ve not met most of them—I have no clue who they are, but my siblings grew up with them. And when she [Chinouriri’s cousin, the subject of this song] died, my siblings were devastated. I was sad about someone I didn’t know. I constantly thought about it and wondered how it had happened. I had gone through something similar; being able to write about it has been kind of helpful for me to understand my own situation and stuff that I’ve gone through. Sonically, I never thought we needed a big chorus. It’s a different verse and different chorus every single time. Then there’s just this kind of chanting thing—I think that’s maybe where my African influence is coming, the marching and the pace of the drum and everyone singing as a group. We all sat in the studio with a mic and just screamed, ‘What a devastating turn of events.’ I think there’s a degree of sorrow that comes along, kind of trudging through this very sad story. This is a very important one.”\n\n<b>“My Blood”</b>\n“I wanted a song where there’s not necessarily continuation, but which speaks about things which people might do as a cry for help. You should always watch when things like that happen to people. I went through a phase where I was pulling out my own hair—it was a stress thing. It started making me think about when I was younger and there was self-harm things. It was visualizing looking in a mirror and being like, ‘Why am I doing this to myself?’ But it’s also these invisible wounds. The strings here add so much to the song—the cinematic-ness of it is definitely influenced by Daughter. I wanted to get people to feel. It sounds very sad from top to bottom, but I hope people listen to it and think, ‘Wow.’”\n\n<b>“Robbed”</b>\n“There was a baby in our family who passed away, and I felt like I was robbed of them. I was a bit more poetic in this song, but it’s almost considering people I’d not met that had such a massive effect on me. You can be robbed of time sometimes, with people or family. When stuff like that happens, the people around you are always like, ‘It’ll be OK. I’m sorry that happened.’ And actually, sometimes it’s OK to just be like, ‘That was fucking shit. That was horrible and this is unfair.’ That was the kind of emotion I wanted to translate in these songs.”\n\n<b>“Cold Call”</b>\n“I was really inspired by Coldplay’s ‘Politik.’ It’s just mind-blowing. I’m quite obsessed with Coldplay and I asked my team to show them the song. I know that they liked it—it meant a lot. They are my inspiration for a lot of things. I think it feels like a universal song. It’s kind of like, ‘I’ve had enough of this now, I’m not doing that anymore.’”\n\n<b>“I Hate Myself”</b> \n“I like how this ends with me reflecting on the positive. I’ve felt some very negative things, which I’ve been lucky enough to stop in their tracks. I mean, ‘a victim of your mind’ is one of the lyrics here. I wrote this with [producer and songwriter] Jonah Summerfield and he was like, ‘Oh, this is pretty deep.’ But sometimes when you put your thoughts on paper, you can read it back and think, ‘That was ridiculous.’ I looked back at this and thought, ‘That was a really stupid thing for me to even put myself through.’ You have to learn to love yourself—and hope that as a society we can really unlearn the treatment of people for being different sizes. Being able to write music has been a combination of me unlearning and learning so much about myself. And I think I can see how my self-esteem really skyrocketed the song in many ways.”\n\n<b>“Pocket”</b>\n“When I wrote this, I’d gone through all my phases of being like, ‘Men are trash, men are toxic.’ Then I was kind of like, ‘Well that’s just BS. I was just choosing terrible men. And there are actually nice ones if you allow yourself to be loved. So I’m going to write a song about how I would like to be loved.’ I thought, ‘When I find someone, I’m going to give them this song.’ And when I started dating my boyfriend, I said, ‘There’s this song I have.’” \n\n<b>“So My Darling (Acoustic)”</b>\n“The song is like six years old, so it’s a nostalgic way to end the album.

It‘s a thread that weaves throughout her guitar-driven fourth album, which is built around infectious melodies, incisive lyrics, and moments of solace and triumph that comfortably intermingle. \n\nOn the project’s first single “Care,” Vu’s opening refrain is an almost audible sigh. She sings: “I'm waking up to the sun and I find it all too much/Oh, here we go, another day, another name I can't bring up.” On “22,” acoustic guitars build against Vu’s powerful voice as she yearns for simpler times. The nostalgia is nearly palpable, but it’s never saccharine. She croons: “At the bar and they're playing our song/It sounds like summer and white guitars.” The chorus is deceptively emblematic of the entire album, stuck between the joy of growing and the lingering impostor syndrome that comes with it. “I'm just getting old/I'm just 22,” she adds.","short":"The DIY-pop artist’s fourth album gets nostalgic for her (recent) adolescence."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/e1/ff/8e/e1ff8ee1-36dd-95a3-48fb-a9eb0219f158/43983.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ad957e","textColor2":"cea483","textColor4":"aa876c","textColor1":"d2b69a","bgColor":"1a100f","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1726216204","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/romanticism/1726216204","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6I7Al2K8HxKvyJcook1ZR8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726216204/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1071927900","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1071927900?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714749449705}}},"1726247423":{"id":"1726247423","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726247423?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/c2/fa/86/c2fa8619-b6b7-6794-ace5-14fe32cdf64b/Jobe10865e3-8802-4fae-b8c1-e120f13f7b18-162548446-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314561513_1678337833-Time1707235833639.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e9c1aa"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d9beb7","textColor2":"e9c1aa","textColor4":"d5a693","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/b1/46/a6/b146a6c5-7392-f97f-17b2-6010459516c7/Job7ce64e89-b51b-45a8-b138-886a8965ebf3-162548447-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314561514_1678337834-Time1707239905926.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fbe8df"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"e4cfc6","textColor2":"fbe8df","textColor4":"e6c6be","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/s-raekwon/1491811601","name":"Steven","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"S.

Yuja Wang does precisely that, however, in this April 2022 recital from Vienna. The results are riveting. \n\nWang’s sovereign technique imparts a magical clarity to the shifting strands of Ligeti’s Étude No. 6 (“Autumn in Warsaw”), and a scintillating, zig-zag energy to his Etude No. 13 (“The Devil’s Staircase”). A similar diablerie fuels Wang’s glinting take on Kapustin’s Jazz Prelude No. 10 and “Lavapiés” from Albéniz’s <i>Iberia</i>. \n\nYet, nowhere are her formidably sharp interpretive reflexes more obvious than in the quirky twists and razor-edge dynamic contrasts of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 18, which sounds startlingly modern in Wang’s interpretation. A meditative account of Brahms’ Intermezzo No. 3 in C-Sharp Minor shows Wang’s poetic side, and the “Mélodie\" from Gluck’s opera <i>Orphée et Eurydice</i> provides an ethereal conclusion to this

Blue","artistName":"Charlotte Day Wilson","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Charlotte Day Wilson’s second album opens with “My Way”—which is not a cover of the Sinatra standard, but it’s a no less emphatic statement of purpose for the Toronto singer. Beginning as a Tropicália-tinged folk reverie before blossoming into a soulful, piano-pounding slow jam, the song is a testament to Wilson’s refusal to be boxed in by the parameters of genre, while still epitomizing the untouchably cool attitude and straight-talkin’ candor we demand from our R&B queens. \n\nWhere past signatures like “Work” and “Doubt” were carefully plotted exercises in slow-building tension and rapturous release, with <i>Cyan Blue</i>, Wilson sounds more comfortable with allowing her songs to unspool in unpredictable ways. “Forever”—a collaboration with Swedish sensation Snoh Aalegra—rolls in with a heavenly chorus hook that you expect to tee up a big beat, but Wilson is happy to just let the song float away on a cloud bed of drifting piano chords. \n\nAnd while “Canopy” fills out its minimalist guitar-plucked/finger-snapped production with sassy kiss-off quips like some bygone Y2K-era <i>TRL</i> smash, it’s followed by a wistful, piano-led (actual) cover of “Over the Rainbow” embedded with field recordings of children playing in the background, as if Wilson was lost in her own blissful midsummer daydream. But with the closing “Walk With Me,” Wilson’s dual affinities for in-your-face lyrics and in-your-head atmospheres coalesce to glorious effect. “Just walk with me,” she pleads in a song that documents a difficult conversation between two lovers drifting apart, but saunters about like a late-afternoon stroll, threading the needle between ’70s psychedelic soul, ’90s R&B, and 21st-century bedroom-indie aesthetics—a perfect portrait of Wilson doing it her way.","short":"The shape-shifting Toronto singer continues to do R&B her way.

Many of the songs end abruptly, then give way to something almost polar opposite in vibe. Observe how the triumphant “Champion”—featuring rappers Tierra Whack and Kaliii and a parting message from writer Jimmy Jolliff—leads straight into the redemption-granting piano ballad “I Forgive You.” Such stark contrasts are all over <i>Reasonable Woman</i>, which sees Furler work closely with producers/co-writers Jesse Shatkin and Greg Kurstin amidst a wide cast of guests. \n\nFunk icon Chaka Khan updates her signature swagger on “Immortal Queen,” while Kylie Minogue drops in for the big, brash “Dance Alone.” Labrinth lends glossily cool singing to the subtly stuttered and distorted “Incredible,” ROSALÍA co-writes the devastating romantic postmortem “I Had a Heart,” and Paris Hilton sings what she knows so well against the nostalgic synth-pop of “Fame Won’t Love You.” But those memorable cameos never threaten to eclipse Furler’s unique approach, from brassy vocal climbs and left-field hooks to sparse, clapping beats.

Still, anyone unfamiliar with the stutter-step rhythm of Tuareg music should visit “Imajighen” and the lullaby-like hush of “Modern Slaves” immediately, and it pleases the heart to imagine a borderless future in which moody teenage guitarists might study stuff like “Sousoume Tamacheq” the way Moctar himself studied Eddie Van Halen. As with 2021’s breakthrough <i>Afrique Victime</i>, the intensity is astonishing, the sustain hypnotic, and the combination of the two an experience most listeners probably haven’t had before.

After bringing a whole new generation of listeners to jazz through his albums <i>The Epic</i> and <i>Heaven and Earth</i>, as well as his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, the Los Angeles native and saxophonist amassed an impressively eclectic set of guests to join his forthcoming bandleader project <i>Fearless Movement</i>. Among the guests were Los Angeles rapper D Smoke and funk legend George Clinton, who joined him for “Get Lit.” “That was definitely a beautiful moment,” Washington tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “The sessions were magical; it was like being in a studio with just geniuses.”\n\nOriginally written by Washington’s longtime drummer Ronald Bruner Jr. (also known as the brother of bass virtuoso Thundercat), “Get Lit” sat around for a bit before the divine inspiration struck to invite Clinton and D Smoke to build upon it. After Washington attended the former’s art exhibition and the latter’s Hollywood Bowl concert in Los Angeles, it couldn’t have been clearer to him who the band needed to make the song shine. Washington compares Clinton’s involvement to magic, marveling in the studio at just how the Parliament-Funkadelic icon operates. “It's like we're listening to it and he's living in it,” he says, conveying how natural it felt having him participate. “When he decides to add something to some music, it's like water.” As for D Smoke, Washington was so impressed by the two-time Grammy nominee’s sense of musicality. “He plays keys, he understands harmony, and all that other stuff. He just knew exactly what to do.”\n\nAs implied by “Get Lit,” the contributors on <i>Fearless Movement</i> come from varied backgrounds and scenes, from the modern R&B styles of singer BJ the Chicago Kid to the shape-shifting sounds of Washington’s <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> peer Terrace Martin. Still, the name that will stand out for many listeners is André 3000, who locked in with the band on the improvisational piece “Dream State.” The Outkast rapper turned critically acclaimed flautist arrived with a veritable arsenal of flutes, inspiring all the players present. “André has one of the most powerful creative spirits that I've ever experienced,” Washington says. “We just created that whole song in the moment together without knowing where we was going.”\n\nAllowing himself to give in to the uncertainty and promise of that particular moment succinctly encapsulates the wider ethos behind all of <i>Fearless Movement</i>. “A lot of times, I feel like you can get stuck holding on to what you have because you're unwilling to let it go,” he says. “This album is really speaking on that idea of just being comfortable in what you are and where you want to go.”","short":"The visionary saxophonist's guest list is eclectic: “The sessions were magical.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fearless-movement/1729582490","playParams":{"id":"1729582490","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Jy18n9qpKS4RyDYmaPpdL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729582490/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"154076564","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/154076564?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714749751927}}},"1729629164":{"id":"1729629164","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729629164?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/adeem-the-artist/1097824833","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dc/d2/36/dcd23664-1313-d148-eb6b-9831ff1efc7a/f0f576a3-7c17-414d-9031-84464bccfda1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"43495a","textColor2":"342628","textColor4":"564b4e","textColor1":"1c2337","bgColor":"dee0e6","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/9c/e5/ef9ce5c1-1a10-7e1d-6171-f5f6a88512e2/f8e0bd21-6b4e-4d63-9f86-7b5ab1c96097.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2931","textColor2":"0a121f","textColor4":"2a303c","textColor1":"0d0811","bgColor":"a9abb0","hasP3":false}},"name":"Anniversary","artistName":"Adeem the Artist","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/68/31/37/68313721-f06e-1a4e-9a6b-9e44d9eb0a9a/198391107320.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"353639","textColor2":"0d1f32","textColor4":"354455","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"d7dbe4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Adeem the Artist digs deeper into their roots on <i>Anniversary</i>, the follow-up to the singer-songwriter’s critically acclaimed 2022 record <i>White Trash Revelry</i>. A native of the lower Piedmont region in the American southeast, Adeem builds upon the country-inflected folk of past releases to include the blues music that makes up their heritage, finding musical and thematic connections along the way. “Socialite Blues” pairs the Piedmont blues sound with a modern narrative, with an especially charismatic vocal from Adeem. \n\n“Rotations” is a clever and heartfelt spin on parenthood, with a gentle arrangement that suits the song’s tender message. And “One Night Stand” makes the case that Adeem could just as easily be a pop country hitmaker, using a big, hooky chorus to center a queer narrative. Adeem recorded the LP with producer Butch Walker in Nashville, setting up for a few days at renowned local studio The Butcher Shoppe. Players on <i>Anniversary</i> include Ellen Angelico, Aaron Lee Tasjan, and Megan Coleman, and the record boasts Adeem’s most expansive sound yet, complete with a horn section.","short":"Expansive

Album and Interview","standard":"When it comes to manifesting, Dua Lipa is, well, radically optimistic about its power. And with good reason. “I know this is going to sound mad, but when I was writing my first album, I was having thoughts about my third album,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I thought by the third album, I would maybe be deserving of working with Tame Impala. <i>Currents</i> [Tame Impala’s career-defining 2015 album] was the record that completely shook me.” With <i>Radical Optimism</i>—the follow-up to 2020’s impeccable, superstar-confirming <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, and the next note after her 2023 <i>Barbie</i> smash “Dance the Night”—Lipa got her wish. \n\nThe 11 tracks here were made with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, as well as Tobias Jesso Jr. (the singer-songwriter Adele has labeled her “secret weapon”), OG PC Music artist Danny L Harle (PinkPantheress, Caroline Polachek), and Lipa’s long-term collaborator Caroline Ailin, co-writer of “New Rules.” It’s not the <i>most</i> obvious team for a chart-dominating name like Lipa to recruit, but maybe there was radical optimism in that, too. Plus, the proof came in the first song they wrote together: A moodier sister to <i>Future Nostalgia</i> standout “Hallucinate,” “Illusion” is an indisputable banger that feels tailor-made for Lipa’s 2024 Glastonbury headline set (something else she manifested for her third album). “It was like, ‘OK, how are we all going to connect together in the room? How is it all going to work?’” says Lipa. “[‘Illusion’] really kicked us off. When we wrote that song, it just gave us confidence as a group.” \n\nLike <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, <i>Radical Optimism</i> pulls from the past, so you can expect shimmering synths, groove-laden basslines, nods to psychedelia, and plenty of ’80s production (Lipa has also cited the adventurousness of both Britpop and Massive Attack among the album’s spiritual influences). But the singer-songwriter wanted to “experiment and do something different” as well, and in place of <i>Future Nostalgia</i>’s polished nu-disco, <i>Radical Optimism</i> often embraces an organic, golden-pop feeling with bright acoustic guitars, pianos, roomy drums, handclaps, and the occasional panpipe, plus some skyscraping vocals that should stop anyone describing Lipa’s vocal style as “nonchalant” again (see: “Falling Forever”). All of which is set against Lipa’s most personal writing to date, fueled by reflections on heartbreak, singledom, the arresting experience of meeting someone you might just give your heart to, and realizing the person you once loved has moved on. \n\n“With this album, I feel like I’ve managed to put so much more honesty out there and be really open in a way that I don’t think I’ve ever had the chance to,” she says. “It was a beautiful experience to not be afraid.” That was helped, again, by the team around her. “You come into the room, you’re hanging out with your friends, and you’re just having a tell-all,” she says. “There was absolutely no holds barred. They knew everything that was happening. There was no judgment. The fact that everyone felt free to just be themselves is what, I think, created such a beautiful energy in the room.” \n\nThe singer-songwriter <i>gets</i> heartbreak pop; after all, she’s made a whole career out of crafting sharp, post-breakup empowerment anthems (and you’ll hear her trademark up-front lyricism here, such as on “Training Season,” in which she declares, “Are you somebody who can go there?/’Cause I don’t wanna have to show ya”). But here, Lipa also favors acceptance and a heartening sense of hope. Perhaps the album’s most powerful moment comes at its end, when Lipa realizes her ex has moved on and experiences an unfamiliar feeling: just happiness that they’re happy. “It feels like a full 180,” she says of closing track “Happy for You,” a song she admits she couldn’t have written until this point in her career. “Maturing, seeing almost my ghost on the other side and being like, ‘Wow, you’ve grown so much from an experience to be able to see things from that perspective. You have to be in the act of forgiveness and growing and learning and being OK with the past in order to move on. For me, ‘Happy for You’ is a beautiful, happy song because it’s so reflective of my journey.” You might say the same about “Maria,” in which Lipa salutes a new partner’s ex for making them who they are today. “I’m better, too, from the ones that I’ve lost/Now he is everything I’d ever want,” she sings. “I wanna thank you for all that you’ve done.” \n\nWorking through these stories has been “a form of therapy” for Lipa, but she always kept two things in mind: what her songs mean to other people and how they might land at Glastonbury, which the singer-songwriter calls “the pinnacle.” “I think about emotions and feelings and thoughts. How does this make me feel? How will this make someone else feel when they hear it? What is the energy and the emotion and the thing that I’m trying to convey at this point in my life?” For Lipa, the answer seems to be in this album’s title. “What [this album] was really about was the theme, which was ‘radical optimism,’” she says. “It’s this idea of rolling with the punches, of not letting anything get you down for too long. I’ve always seen the positive side of things, of being able to grow and move forward and change your perspective regardless of what’s happening in your life—whether it’s heartbreak, whether it’s a friendship, whether it’s a relationship, whether it’s just growing and seeing things differently. I think it’s a big part of maturing.”\n\nWhen <i>Future Nostalgia</i> came out in 2020, just as the global pandemic set in, the album met the moment in a way Lipa could never have foreseen. It became a vehicle for escapism—another kind of radical optimism in a locked-down world. It seems that, for Lipa, <i>Radical Optimism</i> was about meeting <i>her</i> moment—the point she began working with the collaborators she’d always dreamed of, on songs made to perform on the most important stage she can think of. And now, she can draw a line under everything she needed this album to help heal. “Now, I’m done. This chapter is done,” she says. “I did so much growing. I feel like that is my exorcism.”","short":"“It was a beautiful experience.” Dua on the album she dreamed into existence."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/radical-optimism/1734980417","playParams":{"id":"1734980417","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Mo92916G2mmG7ajpmSVrc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734980417/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1031397873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1031397873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714749327232}}},"1735515952":{"id":"1735515952","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735515952?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nice-girl/1473257680","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Yummy","artistName":"Nice Girl","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8a/52/fc/8a52fce8-d772-cc65-52b8-674690b1899b/4251804178679_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"f4cbcb","textColor2":"ffe2e4","textColor4":"f4b4b6","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"cb0000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yummy/1735515952","playParams":{"id":"1735515952","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yMHFLTBu39TbnAR5vqRHP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735515952/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1473257680","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1473257680?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714712918002}}},"1736126611":{"id":"1736126611","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736126611?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-02","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hunny-buzz/1612099036","name":"Welcome to Our Garden -

Yet those who enjoyed her recent full-length forays into artfully angsty post-punk will likely find the vibe shift here more drastic than any jagged guitar rock riff. Conveniently albeit loosely categorized as jazz, these dozen tunes showcase yet another side of her maturing craft.\n\nDespite the inherent softness of acoustic compositions like “ancient girl,” WILLOW’s strengths burst through each and every time. Informed to some extent by the presence of guests like Jon Batiste and St. Vincent, two vanguard artists who consistently push against convention, <i>empathogen</i> gives her ample space to explore and expand. Her lyrics often feel simultaneously confessional and poetic, her voice thick with emotional resonance on “down” and “symptom of life.” Traces of 2022’s sonically tougher <i></i> linger via the frenetic pop-rock fusions of “between i and she” and “false self.” Still, it’s clear that she’s leveled up on all fronts, perhaps most poignantly on “b i g f e e l i n g s,” a finale as grand as any in her discography. “It's trying to bring you in, even though it is extremely complicated,” she says. “Obviously it's a lot to take in when you listen to it for the first time, but there are moments that you really get into that rhythm.”","short":" A dozen songs that showcase another side of her maturing craft."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/16/d7/62/16d76285-4d77-9f33-5260-4d3fc87f62ce/797885078780_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e2d4cc","textColor2":"eedbc5","textColor4":"dbc2ab","textColor1":"f6f2ef","bgColor":"905b42","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1737442320","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/empathogen/1737442320","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5jsfwcWxZIPtF5aaWx0mlL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737442320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"400531893","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/400531893?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714749502311}}},"1737488678":{"id":"1737488678","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737488678?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/33/f3/f6/33f3f69e-5b61-a039-0c6a-6929e5eeaa13/Job1d9a3932-8450-4199-bef6-2c6cdbe0aa24-165093096-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_320493184_1721070694-Time1711134996680.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e28e58"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"050505"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bb8c65","textColor2":"e28e58","textColor4":"b67248","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/65/fb/a9/65fba91d-21a1-0e53-1be7-c8f338785875/071bfd02-bf3f-4a7d-892b-a7633bbc698c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c5c2","textColor2":"e2c6b2","textColor4":"baa292","textColor1":"f3f1ed","bgColor":"191415","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/00/9b/0d/009b0db3-e7fb-1e19-7f1b-34bec9af8815/Job84908ea1-2906-414c-aca6-036ce281f252-165093097-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_320493181_1721071025-Time1711141407884.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"b1b19c","textColor2":"e1ae6a","textColor4":"b48c55","textColor1":"dcdcc2","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/forest-claudette/1630262755","name":"Jupiter -

Some two years after <i>@dannocean</i> and its deluxe expansion pack broadened the range of his Latin pop parameters comes the relatively concise but no less significant <i>REFLEXA</i>. Released just in time for his 32nd birthday, the album seizes the senses with its irresistibly clubby soundtrack and sentimental lyrics. Polyrhythmic floor-fillers like “Medio friends” and “Ley universal” revisit the breezy <i>Babylon Girl</i> feels of his earlier work, while “Involucrarnos” and “La noche” respectively drive deeper into tropical house and techno territory. \n\nSteamy standout “Si no no” outlines an astrologically divined encounter between Taurus and Leo, its progressive thump regularly matching the chorus’s simple yet emotional peaks. He continues to bend dembow to his will and whim, presenting fresh variants on “Lo mejor en tu vida” and the subtler “AMOR.” Bright bilingual excursions like “Tauro y Piscis” make crystal clear how effortlessly he can thrive in a global pop context as well.\n","short":"The Venezuelan pop phenom commands the dance floor once

Together, the singles tell the story of SEVENTEEN’s career so far.\n\nProducer-member WOOZI has credits on all of the anthology’s tracks, highlighting the scope of his behind-the-scenes contributions to the self-produced group. This includes composition and writing credits for new lead single “MAESTRO,” new performance unit track “Spell,” and new vocal unit track “Cheers to youth.” He wrote the lyrics for the new hip-hop team track “LALALI” with subunit members S. Coups, WONWOO, MINGYU, and VERNON. \n\nGreatest-hits albums are rare in K-pop, in part because it is uncommon for groups to make it long enough for a reflection on their careers so far. <i>17 IS RIGHT HERE</i> is an example of the potential of the format, with lead single “MAESTRO” tying the reflective themes of the anthology album together. The dance-pop track is an eclectic tribute to the music-making process (“Doesn't matter either classic or new thang/We take pride in our new combinations”) that uses sounds from seven of SEVENTEEN’s past songs, including debut “Adore U.” The song centers not only music, but SEVENTEEN fans (known as CARATs) into the narrative of the group’s success: “As we complete this piece together/I see us finally become one/Amidst complex notes and rhythms/I'll always be with you.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/seventeen-best-album-17-is-right-here/1741446411","playParams":{"id":"1741446411","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Jrp37x38qZqtyrIrfxN4H"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741446411/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"999644772","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/999644772?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714750557347}}},"1741466047":{"id":"1741466047","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741466047?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kany-garc%C3%ADa/251432197","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3e/5a/a4/3e5aa46c-6d14-743b-9e60-84483517612c/Job4c77f64d-43b6-4711-8f52-31a6652dae94-167277339-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325329138_1757130383-Time1714604296127.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fdb336"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"4b473e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"dfa45f","textColor2":"fdb336","textColor4":"dfa039","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"4b473e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/49/87/4f/49874fcb-97e0-e36f-b920-54f207d1ace2/4f1164aa-0c3e-45be-ace5-c6af3729805a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"392718","textColor2":"23120a","textColor4":"432e1c","textColor1":"160905","bgColor":"c5a165","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/87/33/e9/8733e9eb-2543-39a2-75f9-3d0936a6e5c4/Job688481ea-fb33-48ba-b2d1-877e17e64ecd-167277340-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325329139_1757130384-Time1714607110146.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"e0a96b","textColor2":"feb325","textColor4":"e0a12c","textColor1":"fdbd75","bgColor":"6b5946","hasP3":false}},"name":"GARCÍA","artistName":"Kany

His evolution from Latin trap pioneer to EDM anthem generator was momentous enough, yet his subsequent pivot toward Christian themes may very well be the most noteworthy of his creative choices. Coming fewer than two months after the faith-based <i>Transition</i> compilation effectively rebooted his Carbon Fiber Music imprint, <i>CVRBON VRMOR [C_DE: G_D.O.N.]</i> furthers his cause. \n\nThe seven songs here reacquaint him with styles he’s long been dominant in, as well as familiarize him with some in which he’s relatively new to performing. The opening “CARBON VRMOR” and the immediately following “G_D.O.N.” showcase his reggaetonero and trapero modes, yet the vibes shift noticeably from there. “SAHARA” with Spanish singer Elena Vargas integrates Middle Eastern instrumentation through its dancehall foundation, while “APOCALYPSE” plays toward a different albeit familiar kind of pop-rock punchiness. Rest assured, Farruko doesn’t dare depart without leaving a summer jam on deck, in this case the upbeat closer “RANGOS.”","short":"His artistic evolution continues on this seven-track release."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cvrbon-vrmor-c-de-g-d-o-n/1743497272","playParams":{"id":"1743497272","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3zaBxuBf9zSlxZ20ZRHXXE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743497272/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"364377482","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/364377482?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714748483546}}},"1743506811":{"id":"1743506811","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743506811?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-05-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/realbleeda/1622689692","name":"Out on Bail","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Realbleeda","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ad/0d/84/ad0d8429-96b9-2fcc-c827-86946fa70467/8721093106920.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"323232","textColor2":"202424","textColor4":"454848","textColor1":"090909","bgColor":"d8d8d8","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1743506811","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/out-on-bail/1743506811","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/606LzkIR8s12YZh066wHig"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743506811/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1622689692","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1622689692?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714178305791}}},"1743665385":{"id":"1743665385","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743665385?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-05-01","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fc/26/ce/fc26cebd-1eae-f2a2-f4ac-923640235676/34d9683c-31f0-4d92-9824-63631003f6e1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"60d0cf","textColor2":"f8ae74","textColor4":"cb9a67","textColor1":"72f2f5","bgColor":"174836","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eladio-carri%C3%B3n/1024801206","name":"Porque Puedo - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Eladio Carrión","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Eladio Carrión has reached a point in his career where even the smallest of his releases carries weight.

Following the intimately personal <i>Sol María</i> album and its risk-taking forays into poppier spaces, this five-track return to form for the proven trapero comes with far lower stakes. \n\nThe dismissively casual boldness of the title carries over on songs like “Susanoo” and the potent “Heavyweight.” The latest in an ongoing series, “Don KBRN Freestyle” lets the bars fly freely once again, reminding that he’ll always be one of Latin trap’s toughest emcees.

Which is why many listeners were shocked when a gentle and pitched-up croon came out of his mouth instead. “For me to sing, it was different,” he tells Apple Music. “I didn’t think anybody was going to accept it, but at the time, I didn’t care. I took that shit the most dramatic way. I was on the block with my guys behind me, just doing my own thing, popping out, and really just having my own way. I embraced that to the core all the way.” \n\nThe first time 4batz appeared on <i>From the Block</i> he performed his debut single “act i: stickerz ‘99,’” but it was when he returned to do the infectious and moody track “act ii: date @ 8” that he catapulted from underground artist to breakout star. The viral track earned him co-signs from SZA, Timbaland, and Drake, who appears on the remix. His ambitious debut mixtape <i>u made me a st4r</i> further mines his love of ’90s R&B and emotive storytelling, using pitched-up and slowed-down vocals to tell, over the course of eight “acts,” the personal story of a turbulent relationship gone wrong.\n\nOn “act i: stickerz ‘99,’” 4batz uses a metaphor to illustrate unrequited yearning. “I felt delusional over a certain female, and I remember I was like, ‘Yo, I feel like this girl doesn’t want to be with me, but I still fly to see her. I’ll still be with her right now.’ And that’s how ‘Stickerz’ came about, because I was stuck to someone that wasn’t stuck to me,” he says. The project is bookended by that and “act viii: i hate to be alone,” which ruminates on finality and heartbreak. And if it all sounds a little too real, that’s because, for 4batz, it was. “All this, it’s actual things,” he says. “It’s not just something I just walked in the living room, came in the booth, and just made. This is real life.”","short":"“This is real life.” Hear the Dallas rapper-singer’s debut in Spatial
