Album","standard":"Twenty-five years or so after they picked up their banjos and decided to turn off their amps (at least for a little while), The Avett Brothers make the album you kinda always figured they would. Having graduated from the lowercase charm of their early music but likewise from the more stadium-sized sentiments of albums like 2019’s <i>Closer Than Together</i>, they ruminate on the simple pleasures that (of course) turn out to be not so simple after all (“Cheap Coffee”). They also indulge in folksy wisdom while taking enough shots at themselves to make that wisdom feel real (“Country Kid”). And no matter how earnest they get, they always remember to exercise the good, old-fashioned American humility that got them here in the first place (“2020 Regret”).","short":"Comfort, warmth, and

Album","standard":"Cage the Elephant’s <i>Neon Pill</i> arrives five years after their 2019 Grammy-winning global breakthrough <i>Social Cues</i>. Brothers and bandleaders Matt and Brad Shultz lost their father in the interim, the group mourned the death of friends, and Matt spent time in the hospital with severe depression. This tragedy, fight, spirit, and resolve is messily and triumphantly wrapped into <i>Neon Pill</i>, an album that finds the band forging their own sound devoid of outside influence, channeling their rollicking live show into a meditation on life, death, and music’s healing power.\n\nTake the psych-folk-leaning title track, which tells the story of Matt’s battle with mental illness, looking for answers but only finding more questions. As the band so often does, they mask dark and searching lyrics with melodic candy, making these philosophical queries go down more easily. On the track, Matt sings: “It's a hit and run, oh no/Double-crossed by a neon pill/Like a loaded gun, my love/I lost control of the wheel/Double-crossed by a neon pill.” Just like the story of the band over the past five years, the track includes a phoenix-like resurgence: “Knocked down, not out, let's roll.”","short":"Five years after their breakout, the Shultz bros return, bruised but bolder."},"playParams":{"id":"1733061411","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/neon-pill/1733061411","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2dGlEut1TyhAyApZ0ADIsd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733061411/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"267957933","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/267957933?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715964033610}}},"1733291253":{"id":"1733291253","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733291253?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-17","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pallbearer/499450846","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/58/2d/c1/582dc10c-f676-b05b-8900-06434f8ddb76/c20cb851-4708-470c-bfc9-c78c8d4d295f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbbbbb","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor4":"a7a7a7","textColor1":"e9e9e9","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false}},"name":"Mind Burns Alive","artistName":"Pallbearer","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/7e/c4/52/7ec45283-6fa6-bf3c-0b05-42d8d048a191/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7652d","textColor2":"ed6f3e","textColor4":"bf5931","textColor1":"f77e39","bgColor":"060000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1733291253","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mind-burns-alive/1733291253","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5ppoXtj1diskTKxHyuChWI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733291253/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"499450846","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/499450846?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715956849778}}},"1733515424":{"id":"1733515424","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733515424?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-05-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mary-in-the-junkyard/1706946585","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"this old house -

The British Pakistani singer is learning now how time heals wounds. It was nearly a decade ago that he left One Direction and forged on alone, releasing three albums while bearing the public scrutiny of fame, high-profile relationships, breakups, and in recent years becoming a father. Decamping to a farm in rural Pennsylvania provided a sanctuary from the noise, where, through nurturing his daughter, as well as animals and a garden, he learned his own ways of self-care. \n\n<i>ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS</i> refers to the space where ZAYN recorded the album: an actual shoe cupboard in his home. From familiar surroundings, he steps into largely unexplored territory, submerging himself in the stripped-back, country-inspired sounds he’d touched upon at the tail end of his third album <i>Nobody Is Listening</i> in 2021. Assisted by renowned Nashville producer Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile), ZAYN’s voice and lyrical vulnerability here are as raw and resonant as the acoustic instrumentation, with a weary soulfulness fit for the questions—about life, love, growth, and parenthood—that emerge in the stillness of solitude.\n\n“I’ve been needing something else/I’ll know what it is when I see it,” he sings on album opener “Dreamin.” On the bittersweet \"What I Am,” he sets boundaries and asks for acceptance, while reverberating guitars, cinematic strings, and background croons create a vast soundscape for live-and-learn revelations on “Grateful.” Healing isn’t always linear, as the twinkling, wide-eyed love of “Stardust” whiplashes into “Gates of Hell,” which seethes with loathing. But it’s “The Time,” a song about the joy his daughter brings to his life, that shows ZAYN’s hard-won maturity.\n","short":"A new direction, thanks to a team-up with Nashville giant Dave

Album","standard":"After nearly two decades in the game, Rapsody’s left no room for doubt when it comes to her formidable pen. But it wasn’t until 2020, when she began piecing together her fourth studio album, <i>Please Don’t Cry</i>, that Marlanna Evans realized that she’d shared very little of herself beyond her mic skills. “People had to put up a mirror for me,” she admitted to Apple Music’s Ebro Darden, recalling a pivotal conversation with the producer No ID. “He was like, ‘Everybody knows you can rap, but I can’t tell you five things that I know about you.’” Thus began the North Carolina native’s journey inward: Before she could reintroduce herself to her fans, she’d have to know herself first.\n\nThe result of that journey, <i>Please Don’t Cry</i>, is Rapsody’s deepest and boldest work yet. “Who are you in your rawest state?” asks the gentle voice of the album’s narrator, Phylicia Rashad. Making the record, Rapsody found her mind wandering towards <i>The Matrix</i>, in particular the relationship between Neo and the Oracle. “He’s trying to find his way, trying to find himself…and she’s kind of his guiding voice,” she tells Darden. “I was like, ‘That’s kind of what this journey has been for me, but who would be my Oracle?’” Rashad was the first name that came to mind. Through interludes, the Tony Award winner nudges Rapsody further down the path of vulnerability: “Who are you when you’re joyful? What makes you sad? Why do you cry?”\n\nRapsody doesn’t hold back her answers on tracks like “Diary of a Mad Bitch,” a cathartic shit-talking session, or the bittersweet “Loose Rocks,” where she grapples with a loved one’s dementia diagnosis with backup vocals from Alex Isley (yes, that Isley). Intense emotions are countered with airy, meditative beats on the gorgeous “3:AM,” a late-night love song with a hook from Erykah Badu, and the balmy reggae jam “Never Enough.” By the closing track “Forget Me Not,” her fear of vulnerability feels like a distant memory as she raps: “I want to know everything/I want to feel, I want to be alive/It’s too good.”","short":"On her first solo studio album in five years, Rapsody asks big

Album","standard":"Billie Eilish has always delighted in subverting expectations, but <i>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</i> still, somehow, lands like a meteor. An especially wide-ranging and transportive project, even for her, it’s brimming with the guts and theatricality of an artist who has the world at her feet—and knows it. In a tight 45 minutes, Eilish does as she promises and hits listeners with a mix of scorching send-ups, trance excursions, and a stomping tribute to queer pleasure, alongside more soft-edged cuts like teary breakup ballads and jaunts into lounge-y jazz. But the project never feels zigzaggy thanks to, well, the Billie Eilish of it all: her glassy vocals, her knowing lyrics, her unique ability to make softness sound so huge. \n\n<i>HIT ME</i> is Eilish’s third album and, like the two previous ones, was recorded with her brother and longtime creative partner FINNEAS. In conceptualizing it, the award-winning songwriting duo were intent on creating the sort of album that makes listeners feel like they’ve been dropped into an alternate universe. As it happens, this universe has several of the same hallmarks as the one she famously drew up on her history-making debut, 2019’s <i>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</i>. In many ways, this project feels more like that album’s sequel than 2021’s jazzy <i>Happier Than Ever</i>, which Eilish has said was recorded during a confusing, depressive pandemic haze. In the three years since, she has tried to return to herself—to go outside, hang out with friends, and talk more openly about sex and identity, all things that make her feel authentic and, for lack of a better word, normal. \n\nIt seems to be working. On songs like “THE DINER” and “CHIHIRO,” Eilish seeps back into her creative happy place, dusting off those haunting, gothic, dark sensibilities that became her trademark and making them feel bigger and new. Elsewhere, she uses those core soundscapes as a launching pad to veer off into surprising new directions: “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE” morphs from a staccato jazz ballad into a joyride of trance and Auto-Tune, and “BITTERSUITE” begins as a low-key bossa nova song before cascading into a wall of giant cinematic synths. As a songwriter, Eilish is still in touch with her vulnerabilities, but at 22, with a garage full of Grammys and Oscars, they aren’t as heavy. These days it’s heartache, not her own insecurities, that keeps her up at night, and the songs are juicier for it. “LUNCH,” a racy, bass-heavy banger that can’t help but hog the spotlight, finds Eilish crushing so hard on a woman that she compares the hook-up to a meal. “I’ve said it all before, but I’ll say it again/I’m interested in more than just being your friend,” she sings. The lyrics are so much more than lewd flirtations. They’re also a way of stepping back into the spotlight—older, wiser, more fully herself. ","short":"Billie outdoes herself again.

Beyond opening doors for countless artists with his single’s massive success, the Puerto Rican singer reaffirmed what fans already knew from a two-decade-long discography. The aural travelogue <i>El Viaje</i> seems to speak directly to those who’ve been following his career’s trajectory, while welcoming the relative newcomers to his catalog. A master balladeer, he kicks off the album with the Laura Pausini duet “Roma.” That sets the proverbial stage for a whirlwind escapade across continents, touching on the tropical vibes of “La Romana” and the synth-driven thump of “México.” His collaborations here similarly shine, be they with Carlos Vives on the rock-centric “Santa Marta” or with Jay Wheeler on the homecoming “San

“Un Viaje” with KAROL G, respectively. That same energy seemed to reemerge with his 2024 singles “NOCHES DE MÁS” and “STORIES VERDES,” all leading up to the release of <i>EN ESTA NOS FUIMOS LEJOS</i>. These 14 tracks largely eschew flashy features, instead centering him over a series of thumping yet atmospheric beats. Working with producers like Botlok and Okelo, he manages to rekindle the heat that drew so many listeners to him in the first place. From big reggaetón moments like “CASA DE CAMPO” and “ROTONDA” to the future-facing R&B of “JACU’” and “COMO NICKY \"NIKKI 2,” he sets a mood for late nights and alluring destinations. When he does allow other vocalists into his world, they blend in rather well. Jowell nimbly navigates the synthesizer squirm of tempo-shifting perreo cut “WIKIWIKI,” while Kris Floyd flows with the ambient trap aesthetic of “LOS LOBOS.”","short":"The “Pantysito” hitmaker

Album","standard":"Álvaro Díaz’s artistic evolution has been nothing short of remarkable. The Puerto Rican rapper heard on 2020’s hip-hop-centered <i>Diaz Antes</i> sounded little like the 2.0 version on his innovative and inventive 2021 follow-up <i>Felicilandia</i>. His now-established penchant for pop-wise productions and futuristic forms carries on with <i>SAYONARA</i>, an album that finds him on the cutting edge of reggaetón, among other styles. At a time when the pervasive dembow thump in Latin music can feel a bit too formulaic, he brings a freshness to the format on cuts like “KAWA” and the Quevedo team-up “QUIZÁS SI QUIZÁS NO.” He has obvious reverence for his pioneering predecessors, evident on the homage-heavy Feid collab “GATITAS SANDUNGUERAS VOL.1,” but he’s not beholden to genre norms: The beat switches on “EN PR NO HACE FRÍO” and “SIN PODERES” feel surprisingly natural, a testament to his ability to navigate shifting sonic environs. Further departures such as “QUIÉN TE QUIERE COMO EL NENE” and the balladic “YOKO” only add to his growing mystique.","short":"The cutting-edge reggaetonero continues to innovate."},"playParams":{"id":"1742298801","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sayonara/1742298801","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7kfPf285KnlWUTbqaB1jnI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742298801/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"7044841","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/7044841?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715971020198}}},"1742758247":{"id":"1742758247","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742758247?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-05-17","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/big30/1493449801","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Still King","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"BIG30","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/27/53/45/27534518-5cc0-e092-7092-846ecf66051d/2482.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"cb803f","textColor2":"f6762f","textColor4":"c56026","textColor1":"ff9e4f","bgColor":"000901","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-king/1742758247","playParams":{"id":"1742758247","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ixnEoLRXXdTiZjJ1Brz9x"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742758247/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1493449801","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1493449801?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715958116032}}},"1742767710":{"id":"1742767710","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742767710?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lagos/338817335","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b9/3a/59/b93a5953-93c3-7d2a-ab1d-b6fddc766241/9b2e13a1-69e8-49a7-b801-9ab25353637e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"282828","textColor2":"131313","textColor4":"343434","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"b9b9b9","hasP3":false}},"name":"Alta Fidelidad","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"LAGOS","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/76/21/78/76217836-4742-7370-c964-6b786ed399fe/5021732343581.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"aaadbc","textColor2":"81a5db","textColor4":"6784af","textColor1":"d5d8eb","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alta-fidelidad/1742767710","playParams":{"id":"1742767710","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7bhy6RPPMvCNgn2XAYRWbJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742767710/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"338817335","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/338817335?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715969607089}}},"1742999078":{"id":"1742999078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742999078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/uncertain/1336990387","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Donna - EP","artistName":"Uncertain","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/87/c2/19/87c21927-7964-fb5f-0a60-e74949a7ccc9/8718723255936.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333f25","textColor2":"151a2a","textColor4":"394822","textColor1":"0d102e","bgColor":"cafe00","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/donna-ep/1742999078","playParams":{"id":"1742999078","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3yln3Lwh6ZanxpDwSPE8lS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742999078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1336990387","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1336990387?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715920070789}}},"1743250058":{"id":"1743250058","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743250058?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/enhypen/1541011620","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"DARK MOON SPECIAL ALBUM <MEMORABILIA> - EP","artistName":"ENHYPEN","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s common for a K-pop album to have a narrative concept tying its tracks together, but few are as explicit as ENHYPEN’s <i>DARK MOON SPECIAL ALBUM 'MEMORABILIA'</i>.

Each member of ENHYPEN inspired a character in the story, which has also played out across a web novel, music videos, and now its own dedicated soundtrack album.\n\nFor the album, the seven-member group split up for their first-ever unit tracks: “Teeth” and “Lucifer.” The former has Jungwon, Heeseung, Sunoo, and Ni-Ki singing about the monotony of life as a vampire, while the latter taps Jay, Jake, and Sunghoon for a more stripped-down performance of immortal anguish (“My only wish/I just want to be normal”). “Scream” ends the album on an upbeat note, channeling ENHYPEN’s musical energy into a cathartic song about the exhilaration of racing ahead despite obstacles.\n","short":"The group’s multimedia vampire comic gets its own dedicated soundtrack."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c8/47/95/c84795b7-bc43-eed6-ad4b-e067ed57b538/196922921810_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"433a35","textColor2":"2e130f","textColor4":"4d3833","textColor1":"211611","bgColor":"cac9c5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dark-moon-special-album-memorabilia-ep/1743250058","playParams":{"id":"1743250058","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743250058/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1541011620","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1541011620?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715964529119}}},"1743272954":{"id":"1743272954","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743272954?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"releaseDate":"2024-05-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/linea-personal/1621429938","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Vision","artistName":"Linea Personal","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8c/f9/8f/8cf98f42-5403-5a99-d384-3c4fb1849ab3/717340559807_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"dedede","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1743272954","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vision/1743272954","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3CVObq7AFkpwOkwdhJYJQo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743272954/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1621429938","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1621429938?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715934690416}}},"1743344184":{"id":"1743344184","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743344184?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2c/d0/07/2cd0070a-85ef-e6c3-f8e3-741385ca6efc/c0fa3394-2820-4ca8-8cf2-5e520ad78f9a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c1f15","textColor2":"090300","textColor4":"2e1f14","textColor1":"060302","bgColor":"c39062","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Garfield Movie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"width":3675,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/aa/22/f0/aa22f0d4-29b0-5515-9724-2fd20daf25b7/24UMGIM39277.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3675,"textColor3":"473a39","textColor2":"46190f","textColor4":"6b473f","textColor1":"190907","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Tunes new and old guide the grumpy feline through his next Monday."},"playParams":{"id":"1743344184","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-garfield-movie-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1743344184","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Qx3QHgSCGYIV1iA5VnBI7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743344184/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715970550697}}},"1743724932":{"id":"1743724932","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743724932?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-05-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/troye-sivan/396295677","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Honey (Remixes) -

had me at HELLO","artistName":"ZEROBASEONE","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"As a group formed out of a K-pop competition show, ZEROBASEONE signed an initial contract that is much shorter than the standard term. The nine young members were contracted for a two-and-a-half-year run, which means there’s little time to waste. With their third mini album <i>You had me at HELLO</i>, ZEROBASEONE wraps up their youth trilogy within only 10 months of their July 2023 debut. \n\n“Feel the POP” (released in both standard and sped-up versions) is an upbeat UK-garage bop that encourages listeners to let go of their worries and live in the moment, while pre-release single “SWEAT” pairs a “Brr-rup, ba, ba, ba-dum” hook with an upbeat descending-chord chorus to get people on the dance floor. DAY6’s Young K wrote the lyrics for the sweet ballad “HELLO” (the group’s first official fan song: “It's so special between you and me/I wish only for happiness”), while Big Hit producer EL CAPITXN has credits on both high-energy opener “Solar POWER” and feel-good pop track “Sunday RIDE.” \n\nThe seven-track EP is roughly 20 minutes, and ZEROBASEONE makes use of every minute on the eclectic addition to their young discography. Hypnotic, R&B-infused B-side “Dear ECLIPSE” allows ZB1 a chance to showcase their vocals, using the imagery of an eclipse to sing about a sudden, all-consuming attraction. But, for a dynamic group whose members’ lives changed dramatically with the winning of <i>Boys Planet</i>, the metaphor echoes across their EP and young careers.\n","short":"A short but sweet

Gambino","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"For years, Childish Gambino’s <i>Atavista</i> hid in plain sight. When he released an unfinished version of the record on March 15, 2020, it spent just 12 hours on his website before he pulled it down. Reappearing on streaming a week later as <i>3.15.20</i>, the project brought up almost as many questions as sparkling neo-soul anthems, which still sounded slicker than the average as raw cuts titled after timestamps.\n\nFlash forward to 2024 and Donald Glover has upgraded and updated <i>3.15.20</i> with added tracks. He worked closely with Los Angeles producer DJ Dahi and Swedish producer and esteemed film and TV composer Ludwig Göransson, a longtime collaborator, to set a sumptuous tone seated back between the ’70s funk reverence of 2016’s <i>“Awaken, My Love!”</i> and the smooth Caribbean-inflected soul of 2014’s <i>Kauai</i>. Features from Ariana Grande, 21 Savage, and Summer Walker soar on reinvigorated mixes, while “Little Foot Big Foot” features a spotlight-ready Young Nudy, finding Gambino’s eye still fixed towards the future of the regional scene he portrayed in vivid color on FX’s <i>Atlanta</i>.\n\n<i>Atavista</i> is an ode to impermanence, never more directly than over the glimmering guitar of “Time” with Grande. (“One thing’s for certain, baby/We’re running out of time,” they harmonize on the chorus.) But in Gambino’s capable hands, <i>Atavista</i> also slows down to enjoy the view, the sonic equivalent of a luxe leather-interior BMW cruising an open California highway. “I did what I wanted to,” he revels on closing track “Final Church.” <i>Atavista</i> took many shapes over the years to reach a final form. In each warm refrain, tight sequence, and carefully chosen collaborator, Gambino demonstrates why some things are worth waiting for.\n","short":"Four years later, an updated and upgraded version of the 3.15.20 project."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dd/bd/26/ddbd26b4-400c-c7cc-0c56-01b87270bce1/196872058413.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3d3d","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"474747","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/atavista/1745756757","playParams":{"id":"1745756757","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/692R05mxz7V6eOFoj5PMlQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745756757/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466842536","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466842536?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715966848596}}},"1746151068":{"id":"1746151068","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746151068?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2024-05-17","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rachel-chinouriri/1033202344","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d6/7b/e0/d67be030-f4f5-fb3f-cc72-a3bc388f8a6c/3dad81b4-846f-42fd-8e33-b21b1d5bce88.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"b68872","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b57356","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f1/80/c5/f180c554-585b-a1fe-272b-f07238de27b6/a882510f-f410-4a31-bc0f-ae8d8908b5d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"d36a6a","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"ba734d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/4f/c4/184fc45d-ee71-f476-0d0f-2eaee272294e/323274ba-d203-45d3-942d-9c0deb814283.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"adadad","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c5896c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/af/80/5b/af805ba3-7df0-c625-3316-dde28b259552/33d9eec0-dc1c-48ae-82b6-76adfffd989e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"cc6860","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c26b66","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ac/61/c3/ac61c3ba-c8c3-bd49-4de6-a0fdde7e66ce/ffd88acb-8d32-4dc8-977f-01f386138485.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"ba8f7c","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c4896d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/02/a7/8a02a7e8-126d-4e29-4c43-ccbda52cd1e9/7666d825-3dd9-492a-bbe4-1e46e5491984.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"ababab","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c18466","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/94/d2/a894d2e7-c27b-5ccf-d370-ec0f3463b745/35f79763-d11f-4a79-b2bf-1d4fb8f625f1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"aeaeae","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"cd9378","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false}},"name":"Apple Music Sessions: Rachel Chinouriri","artistName":"Rachel Chinouriri","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cf/91/29/cf91299e-05a2-f397-2ee2-6519970dd3b6/5021732368843.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d3d3d3","textColor2":"da7e4a","textColor4":"b56c42","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The singer-songwriter plays “Never Need Me,” plus a Noah Kahan cover.","standard":"Rachel Chinouriri always knew that the bubbling, buoyant indie pop of her 2023 single “Never Need Me” could paper over its sadder sentiment. And so, for her Apple Music Session, the London singer-songwriter felt it was time to offer a pared-back take, with help from Adele pianist Neil Cowley. “I haven’t really had a super-emotional piano version of ‘Never Need Me,’ so even when I heard the piano for the first time, I was like, ‘Ah, this is going to add a different essence to what the song means to people,’” she tells Apple Music. “The voice is an instrument to me. So being able to interweave two instruments in that way was great.” \n\nHere, Chinouriri also covers Noah Kahan’s “Northern Attitude,” a song she listens to most days. And yet, it wasn’t until she decided to perform it here that she grasped what it was all about. “Even though I sing the lyrics all the time, I realized I sing them incorrectly a lot. Then I was like, ‘Wow, this man is really smart, the way he wrote this,’” she says. “There are elements of that I could put more in my writing. It was just literally eyes closed and going off feeling. I added some of my own harmonies. I think it has an essence of sadness. It was cool to transform it in that way.” For Chinouriri, writing has always been cathartic—and playing live is another kind of musical “therapy,” “I think every time I perform songs live, I’m like, ‘All right, I’m healing,’” she says. “A room of people singing something together—the energy can almost make you tingle. Humans are incredible and the voice is incredible. I think a community of people singing something together is really therapeutic.” Get a taste of that right here."},"playParams":{"id":"1746151068","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-sessions-rachel-chinouriri/1746151068"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746151068/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1033202344","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1033202344?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715963610593}}},"1746212824":{"id":"1746212824","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746212824?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-05-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/drefquila/1424620452","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d0/6d/e8/d06de892-03db-c358-f57e-11254f7fd49c/28ef5772-5687-47c7-8b99-7472fc5c3e55.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"343433","textColor2":"080b08","textColor4":"313634","textColor1":"0c0908","bgColor":"d6e1e3","hasP3":false}},"name":"Los
