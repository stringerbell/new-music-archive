Electric Light","artistName":"Lenny Kravitz","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Throughout his nearly four-decade career, Lenny Kravitz has kept with the theme of positivity in his music. Six years after releasing 2018's <i>Raise Vibration</i>, which saw him advocating for peace and unity with more political bite, the multiple-award-winning rock icon shows his more lighthearted side on <i>Blue Electric Light</i>. The conditions had to be perfect, and with a clearer mind, Kravitz returned to his home on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas to record the album (reportedly one of four albums' worth of material) with his longtime songwriting partner, guitarist Craig Ross.\n\nThat feeling of escapism also flows through the album's genre-hopping style, which switches from swaggering P-funk (“It's Just Another Fine Day [In This Universe of Love]”) and robotic synth-pop (“Let It Ride”) to anthemic gospel (“Love Is My Religion”). Elsewhere, he continues to take influence from Prince on “TK421,” leaning hard into an upbeat funk jam featuring an extended outro begging for a party remix. But when the mood is more subdued, Kravitz adds plenty of sultry touches to soulful ballads (“Honey”) and slinky slow jams (“Stuck in the Middle”), another similarity he shares with the Purple One. \n\nHe may encourage you to bob and dance throughout <i>Blue Electric Light</i> with wild abandon, but Kravitz can still crank out groovy hard rock. In fact, he can still flex his virtuoso guitar chops with gusto. Take the stomping, hypnotic “Paralyzed,” where Kravitz revisits the ’70s classic-rock sound of 1993's commercial breakthrough <i>Are You Gonna Go My Way</i>. Taken together, all of these playful experiments add up to a remarkably consistent statement of purpose tied together to one unifying message: Love conquers all. But when he's not spreading positivity to others, Kravitz does some thoughtful self-reflection, like on “Human,” feeling grateful to be alive and live his truth: “My heart is yearning for transformation/What is this life for? I'm gonna win.” \n","short":"The veteran rocker stays positive on his genre-hopping 12th album."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/59/b8/3d/59b83d20-3907-89a3-d2b4-49ac7bc94e49/4050538939194.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"ae7f8a","textColor2":"05b1f3","textColor4":"0491ce","textColor1":"da9b9e","bgColor":"00103b","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1709632753","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-electric-light/1709632753","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/33i9bBiL7PuwD5hEG9GoUi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709632753/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"160410","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/160410?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716552605766,"RTCI":0}}},"1719361928":{"id":"1719361928","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1719361928?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wyatt-c-louis/1358423871","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Chandler","artistName":"Wyatt C.

In Boiling Water","artistName":"DIIV","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"DIIV has always been a musical shape-shifter—subtly mutating into new forms that are deeply felt by those who pay close attention to its sonic textures. The band’s debut album, 2012’s <i>Oshin</i>, was double-dipped in the chiming guitars of classic indie pop and post-punk’s intense persistence; <i>Is the Is Are</i>, from 2016, stretched lush dream-pop weavings across its wide canvas, while 2019’s <i>Deceiver</i> dove headlong into shoegaze’s bottomless bliss. For its first album in five years, the quartet led by Zachary Cole Smith takes its catalog into several thrilling new turns: At various points, <i>Frog in Boiling Water</i> conjures the sweeping drama of goth à la <i>Seventeen Seconds</i>-era The Cure, slowcore’s crushing and hypnotic beauty, and the metallic textures of vintage grunge.\n\nDIIV has never sounded so devastating, so ominous, and so utterly pristine as it does on <i>Frog in Boiling Water</i>—a triumph in fidelity that’s owed as much to veteran indie-rock producer Chris Coady (Beach House, Future Islands) as it is to the band’s locked-in interplay. Smith and Andrew Bailey’s guitars drip like melted candles over the vast expanse of “Soul-net,” while “Brown Paper Bag” stomps and splashes with every cymbal crash, courtesy of drummer Ben Newman. This might be the heaviest music DIIV has ever put to tape, and its doomy sound perfectly matches the album’s foreboding themes.\n\nBorrowing its title from a central metaphor in Daniel Quinn’s 1996 novel <i>The Story of B</i>, <i>Frog in Boiling Water</i> takes aim at what the band refers to as “the slow, sick, and overwhelmingly banal collapse of society under end-stage capitalism,” and a close read of Smith’s lyrics indeed reveals a sense of wide-scale distrust, as well as general societal malaise. But even at its most despairing, DIIV never forgets that retaining a sense of humanity is key to surviving what lies ahead: “The worst of times/Leave them behind,” Smith implores over the soaring riffs of “Reflected.” “But keep that lump in your throat.”","short":"On its first album in five years, the NYC band reaches in new

Album","standard":"On twenty one pilots’ seventh album <i>Clancy</i>, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have crafted a project that is both a culmination and a glimpse into the future. Narratively, <i>Clancy</i> wraps up a story they’ve been weaving since 2015’s <i>Blurryface</i>. Sonically, the Columbus, Ohio-bred group begins forging the next iteration of their style. “It feels like truly the beginning of an era, but an end to one as well—or will be,” Dun tells Apple Music. “I think it's been a great place to write songs from having this kind of story in mind, but I think that definitely by no means is it the end of our band.”\n\nTake the thriller “Next Semester,” which finds the group diving into elements of synth-pop, emo, dance-punk, and more. It’s equal parts catchy and subtle, with Joseph’s lyrics almost directly in conversation with early themes the group focused on, like alienation, confusion, and loneliness. He sings: “I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here/It's a taste test/Of what I hate less/Can you die of anxiousness?/I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here.”\n\n“Lavish” is a futuristic psych-pop track buoyed by glimmering keyboards and dusty drums. When Joseph sings, “Welcome to the style you haven’t seen in a while,” before delivering an intoxicating rap, he’s almost speaking to the creation of the album itself. It’s an ambiguity and a breaking of the fourth wall that the band has embraced. “Maybe there are conversations that will happen between friends who have followed the storyline and maybe have some kind of arguments over what the outcome was,” Dun says. “And I think that's cool.”","short":"The Ohio duo’s seventh album ends one story and opens up new possibilities."},"playParams":{"id":"1733370881","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/clancy/1733370881","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1KFWgQTw3EMTQebaaepVBI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733370881/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"349736311","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/349736311?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716525822876,"RTCI":0}}},"1734187714":{"id":"1734187714","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734187714?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wallows/1225257328","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4b/9b/9b/4b9b9be1-7007-1290-a3a3-173f4666d800/Jobace877b4-c08a-486e-b3f1-6668975b5df0-164433724-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_318899686_1709162535-Time1710196599613.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","33241c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2c241b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3a3433","textColor2":"33241c","textColor4":"574943","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2c241b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f8/43/7c/f8437ca9-faa3-8b2a-59b6-bdf2a87a3fc0/d7382fc4-f436-4fc0-802f-91d42e99a69f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"413f4b","textColor2":"1c1c20","textColor4":"444448","textColor1":"191625","bgColor":"e5e5e5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/eb/f0/8b/ebf08be0-2a3f-08ed-bd52-56a6c940c6b3/Job02a3e414-4007-4e5e-92fb-473452587c8d-164433725-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_318899685_1709162532-Time1710199230130.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","3a3133"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2c241b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"373528","textColor2":"3a3133","textColor4":"57534d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2c241b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Model","artistName":"Wallows","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/ae/37/a2/ae37a289-6b57-f0a0-d57b-decd92cad6b6/075679652515.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3127","textColor2":"3a2c10","textColor4":"574e2d","textColor1":"160808","bgColor":"ced5a1","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1734187714","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/model/1734187714","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64SX9Efb2JGW3rJFE1ZddJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734187714/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1225257328","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1225257328?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716525667437,"RTCI":0}}},"1735440254":{"id":"1735440254","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735440254?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=38124-614150-300575930","name":"Sushi.

Into the 2020s, her songs with Megan Thee Stallion and Kanye West led to her hip-hop-infused album debut, <i>ALPHA</i>, which featured hitmaking rappers 21 Savage and Offset alongside reggae icons Beenie Man and Sean Paul.\n\nBy comparison, <i>Never Gets Late Here</i> finds Shenseea in an even greater position of creative strength, more than willing to experiment while maintaining her identity. “I’ve always been an artist who just always tries new things because that’s how magic happens,” she says. Her longtime fans will get their dancehall fix via “Die for You” and “Tap Out,” while the like-minded “Keep a Place” and “Neva Neva” deliver her vibes in the classic one-drop style. Occasionally, her gaze goes global, most evident on the collaborative cuts “Red Flag” with Brazilian funk ambassador Anitta and “Work Me Out” with Afrobeats luminary Wizkid. Still, it’s her broader pop moments—like the Coi Leray team-up “Flava” and the emotive “Stars”—that travel beyond borders without sacrificing the impact of her powerful voice and messages. “My album is so versatile,” Shenseea says, unable to pick a favorite from the bunch. “It’s almost like you can like this one today—but tomorrow is a different day.”","short":"The Jamaican star strives for timelessness: “That’s how magic happens.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4d/42/ed/4d42edf6-6a14-5e74-9a02-a01fe9bff99c/23UM1IM07501.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e5cab4","textColor2":"fbe4ba","textColor4":"ebbb9b","textColor1":"f3f6da","bgColor":"aa181c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-gets-late-here/1743522357","playParams":{"id":"1743522357","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2wkK1n9m6c7OutXRgtvVsz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743522357/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1132311326","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1132311326?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716552853411,"RTCI":0}}},"1743867591":{"id":"1743867591","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743867591?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/65/35/1b/65351b93-0115-8b0a-ba32-5f42ceeb30a2/01a2917c-5ae9-464a-b5ba-388f5ccf59f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a6bfd7","textColor2":"a7c6e8","textColor4":"8caed1","textColor1":"c9dbf1","bgColor":"1c4d73","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pepe-aguilar/21421637","name":"Que Llueva Tequila","artistName":"Pepe Aguilar","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I’m not sure if I’m a staunch defender of the ranchera genre—it’s more about being true to my ideals and the integrity of my musical perspective,” Pepe Aguilar tells Apple Music. “I keep playing mariachi music because I like it, but mariachi can defend itself just fine.” With a career that spans more than 35 years and 23 studio albums, the legendary singer-songwriter has sustained a balance between preserving ranchera tradition and updating a sound that survives generational changes because of its ability to renew itself. When it comes to making music, Aguilar believes in a world without frontiers.\n\nThe new chapter in his artistic saga is <i>Que Llueva Tequila</i> (“Let It Rain Tequila”), an ingenious title that adds a contemporary touch to his pioneering brand of Mexican folk. The sound of the album draws from rock, adding a new dimension to mariachi music. “It’s infused in rock ’n’ roll from the inside out, beyond the addition of drums or electric guitar,” he explains. “From the harmonic circles to the chords, structure, and arrangements—it’s all different. This album proposes a real fusion of styles.” Here, Aguilar dives deep into some of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Te Confirmo”</b>\n“At first listen, you will like this song if you’re into mariachi. If you pay closer attention, you will identify a number of curious little touches. After the intro, the bridge goes somewhere completely different, and the outro has nothing to do with the bridge. Now that I’m singing it in concert, people like it quite a bit. They may not be familiar with it, but it has that trademark mariachi punch that makes you scream when you listen to those first trumpet notes. They’re not in the intro, but appear in the middle of the song, and at the end, they morph into something else. People who know about arrangements and production would tell you that you can’t do those things—you are meant to repeat the patterns to make people happy, but I saw it differently. The lyrics are a bit unusual, too. I’m not complaining about love being a disaster. On the contrary, I’m telling you how happy I am that you left. I’m confirming that I’m still here, alive and kicking, just in case you harbored any doubts about it.”\n\n<b>“Corazón a Medio Día”</b>\n“It’s funny, because when Pablo [Preciado] gave me these songs, I had a couple of tequilas in me, and I told him, ‘My intention is to reinvent the sound of mariachi.’ This is doable, of course, because you’re as good a singer and producer as the songs that you’re working with. There was so much meat in this material that I knew something incredible would come to light. This is a more rockish tune from its very inception, and I wanted the drums to play a leading role. Even though it kicks off with an accordion—an instrument I love—there are other elements, especially rhythmic. Some of the tom-tom sounds remind me of Peter Gabriel. Even though I haven’t played the drums myself in a long time, I’m good about mimicking the sounds that I want.”\n\n<b>“Sólo Es Cuestión de Tiempo”</b>\n“This one was written by Enrique Guzmán Yáñez, better known as Fato. It’s a bachata, but I added a drum kit so that I could lower the rhythm. It’s like a club anthem, a bachata-ranchera. Fato wrote the greatest hits of my career, and our relationship included moments of love and hate. Now we’re a little more mature, and we plan to continue singing and working together. Originally, he gave me a couple of bachatas, and I transposed them to ranchera territory, because he didn’t write mariachi music. In fact, no one had recorded his songs with a mariachi backdrop until I did. Some of those bachatas I love, because they groove like a bolero. It was logical to add this kind of beat—the chorus is like a power ballad. The lyrics speak about life from a different perspective. It’s not about dying of heartbreak, but rather a reflection about being able to bounce back from anything and the importance of staying positive.”\n\n<b>“Que Llueva Tequila”</b>\n“This is the most traditional track in the entire album. Still, there is a novel approach, a modern touch to the arrangement. The title works really well for a song—but it could also be an album, a television show, or even a novel. I really like it, and we decided to name the project after it. My lifelong friend Manuel Eduardo Castro wrote my first mariachi songs, back in 1993, for my first self-produced record. Now we’re working together again on this song after a long time, and it became the title track. There’s always one or two songs like this one on my albums, paying tribute to traditional mariachi, but with unusual arrangements. We have an organ, and a Leslie, and it adds a unique vibrato—it makes the organ sound a bit raspier.”\n\n<b>“Hojas de Otoño”</b>\n“In lyrical terms, this is the saddest song, because it’s about resigning yourself to a love that couldn’t be. Or a relationship—not necessarily romantic—that went beyond its expiration date, whether it’s family ties or a friendship. This is a more traditional approach to mariachi, very elegant, with a heartfelt arrangement. In comparison to ‘Que Llueva Tequila,’ meant to be danced with your boots on and a sombrero, this should find you wearing a suit, with your girlfriend on the dance floor. It’s the darker side of love—the suffering, the sadness that lies underneath the affection. I love the arrangement, even though orchestrations of this kind are not in vogue anymore.”\n\n<b>“Hasta Que Me Duermo”</b>\n“I knew that this would be the first single from the beginning. It’s written by Pablo Preciado and produced by myself. In terms of the melody, it’s a rock ballad. When I first talked to Pablo, I explained to him that I wanted to make an album like this one. It was something I had in mind, recording tracks with huge choruses, great hooks, and delicate instrumentation. He understood the concept and wrote a number of gems. I don’t usually include many songs from the same composer on a single record, but in this case, I recorded five songs by him, because they were too good to ignore.”\n\n<b>“Mira Quién Lo Dice”</b>\n“Edgar Barrera wrote this one. He’s an amazing composer. This is the first time that we worked together, with my people and music team. It veered into country when I added a steel guitar, something I had done before. When I produced a Guadalupe Pineda album in 1994, there’s a song in it named ‘Enamorarse Así’ that I mixed in Nashville. While I was there, I found the best steel guitarist in town, and those tracks sounded really cool. I’ve returned to that sound a number of times in order to recapture that same texture.

With early hits like “Tutu” and “Vida de Rico” in the rearview, the Colombian singer continues to voraciously indulge in a veritable genre buffet on his fourth album, the aptly named <i>cuatro</i>. His taste for tropical styles comes across repeatedly throughout, beginning with the stormy salsa opener “Gordo” and peaking with the emotional Carín León team-up \"Una Vida Pasada.”\n\nAccordions throb over “Misión Imposible” and brass creeps into “No Se Vale,” adding a lushness to the proceedings. No matter what format he chooses, his lyrical gaze almost invariably remains on matters of the heart, be that the gushing sentiments of “Amor de Extranjeros” or the eternal promises of “La Boda.” His status as a balladeer still very much intact, he whispers sweet nothings over acoustic guitar and subtle percussion for \"Corazón de Hojalata.”","short":"The Colombian singer-songwriter pours his heart out."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9a/60/f5/9a60f520-41ec-3b1c-3ce1-bf988b6128d7/196872064391.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbc39d","textColor2":"dbd8da","textColor4":"b1b3b2","textColor1":"fbecc0","bgColor":"0b1f14","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cuatro/1746152543","playParams":{"id":"1746152543","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1IwCEfVYg8KlEankYmqeP7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746152543/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1457386767","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1457386767?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716553208684,"RTCI":0}}},"1746565141":{"id":"1746565141","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746565141?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-04-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marshmello/980795202","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"It’s Riddim Time -

More than a year after he emerged as one of the brightest rising stars in the art of the corrido, his commitment to música mexicana is as authentic as his Sonora roots, creating a personal sonic universe where his voice transcends the other elements of traditional corridos tumbados.\n\n<i>THE GB</i>, Ballesteros’ first solo studio album, showcases the breadth of his musical abilities, including his talent for embracing new styles and a generosity of spirit that leaves space for other voices to shine. “This record features the sound that people know me for, but it also delves into other styles in the company of the artists who were present at the beginning of my career and who are making it big now,” he says. Here, Ballesteros dissects some key album tracks.\n\n<b>“Sad Loqueron”</b>\n“I did this one by myself, without any featured artists, and I wrote it together with composer Jorge Jiménez. People loved it on social media, so we decided to open the album with it. On the production side, this song includes sounds that are new to my usual style. The phrasing of the melody is a bit different; the fans seem to love that.”\n\n<b>“Lucky Charms” (feat. Natanael Cano and Peso Pluma)</b>\n“I worked on this together with my friends, songwriters Daniel Candia and Alan López. We produced it in step with my personal style, then offered it to Nata and Peso. Both added their harmonies and individual touch. It’s one of the strongest cuts. We recorded the vocals in Mexico City. We did several takes, and finally settled on this particular fusion of their voices.”\n\n<b>“La Niña” (feat. Kenia Os)</b>\n“With Kenia Os, we went for a song that would showcase our individual styles, but it ended up sounding different from the usual Gabito vibe. It has a special touch, with a kind of unusual instrumentation that is not embraced by either of us. We spent a lot of time on this one, changing it as we went along. We had planned to collaborate for the longest time, and finally found the right moment to make it happen. The result is great, and I’m proud that it found its place in the album.”\n\n<b>“Neta” (feat. Junior H)</b>\n“This song is steeped in pain—a sad tune, just like my friend Junior likes them. It was the second tune that we sent him, and he chose this one. We also added a lot of melodic content. Songs tend to have two separate melodies, one for the verses and one in the chorus; this one has four. The rhythm and the sequence keep changing, and Junior added his special touch.”\n\n<b>“Sin Yolanda” (feat. Peso Pluma)</b>\n“This one combines both styles—a bit of Peso Pluma and a bit of myself. It’s a very propulsive song, it keeps you on this upbeat mood, and it reminds me a bit of [Peso and Gabito’s 2023 collaboration] ‘LADY GAGA.’ It’s such a pleasure working with him, and the vibe in the studio was excellent. Everything flows, and the creative process happens naturally.”\n\n<b>“Sonrisa Colgate” (feat. Fuerza Regida)</b>\n“This one was custom-made for Fuerza Regida, and it follows the band’s sound. It has a strong melodic line and an addictive chorus, just like their hits. We hope this one will be a major success. We’ve known each other for a long time, and their support of my career has been unwavering. We’ve done many songs together, but this is my favorite.”\n\n<b>“Balenciaga Rose” (feat. Blessd)</b>\n“I had saved up this one for a long time. Blessd loved it; he heard it at an event, asked me to collaborate, and I ended up sending it to him. It’s a corrido that steps out of the usual genre confines. It has a bit of an urban touch so he can feel comfortable adding his voice. I have no problem switching genres—I’m really versatile—and I’m always looking for a good opportunity to experiment with different sounds. In this case, the end result speaks for itself.”","short":"Sonora’s rising corridos star shares the spotlight on his full-length debut."},"playParams":{"id":"1746983102","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-gb/1746983102","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1O51JYs5jdmREsm45dyeGc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746983102/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"968949255","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/968949255?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716552909641,"RTCI":0}}},"1747072325":{"id":"1747072325","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747072325?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c8/d6/0c/c8d60cfa-415a-487d-9145-9197bd9b3980/Jobdbe908bb-fd12-4129-93b3-7b1ba6947b09-168304494-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327375630_1773744982-Time1716008912345.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"c8c8c9","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"bfbfc0","textColor1":"f3f3f3","bgColor":"1b1d20","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/88/6a/25/886a251c-a4fd-7ec9-c646-321985d5a4b9/475cc61e-31ca-4245-87f7-0d86ae83c3b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b38d7b","textColor2":"da9e81","textColor4":"af806a","textColor1":"dfaf97","bgColor":"03060f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e0/59/18/e0591811-300b-797c-10f1-42c37565435f/Job143baf2b-a6e2-465e-8864-7e092e4d8ef7-168304495-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327375629_1773744979-Time1716013059851.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c5bebd","textColor2":"efe6e3","textColor4":"c5bebd","textColor1":"efe6e3","bgColor":"1d1e22","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5a/ce/76/5ace7689-82aa-717e-efaf-34aa3c0ffc06/61cd2052-071e-4b17-8756-5e204effe4c9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c3c6","textColor2":"ededef","textColor4":"c3c3c6","textColor1":"ededef","bgColor":"1e1f20","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vince-staples/566639154","name":"Dark Times","artistName":"Vince Staples","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/6e/26/686e2660-e743-3b05-aea0-37bd16c061c4/24UMGIM53340.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5bdb7","textColor2":"f0e5dd","textColor4":"c5bdb7","textColor1":"f0e5dd","bgColor":"1b1c1e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Vince Staples knows his songs aren’t soundtracking too many wild Friday night parties; they sound way better on the long, contemplative walk home. “I’ve always been aware of where I fit within the ecosystem of this whole thing, and that allows me to create freely,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “No one’s coming to me from a fan standpoint looking for a single, or looking for a party record. But I do know the people who listen to my music are probably looking for thoughtfulness or creativity.” Since breaking through a decade ago with his debut EP <i>Hell Can Wait</i>, the Long Beach rapper has been the go-to guy for heady West Coast rap: songs that may not make you dance, but always make you think.\n\nStill, his sixth studio album (and the last one on his Def Jam contract) isn’t quite the downer that the title suggests. Where its predecessor, 2022’s <i>RAMONA PARK BROKE MY HEART</i>, looked back at his bittersweet youth, <i>Dark Times</i> is a snapshot of Staples right now: on top of the world on paper, but the reality is trickier. (“I think I’m losing it,” he raps on the bass-heavy “Black&Blue.” “Hope you’re along for the ride.”) On “Government Cheese” he grapples with survivor’s guilt, mourning his brother and lying that all’s well to his friend in prison who saw him on TV. \n\nStill, light enters through the cracks with breezy, soulful beats from frequent collaborators Michael Uzowuru and LeKen Taylor, not to mention Staples’ trademark dry wit: “Don’t be no crab in the bucket, be a Crip at the Ritz,” he quips on “Freeman.” There’s even a few tracks you could bump at the function: “Étouffée,” a love letter to New Orleans rap, and “Little Homies,” a lo-fi house jam on whose hook Staples crows, “Life hard, but I go harder.” \n\nAnd no matter how heavy things get, Staples is realistic about what his work means in the grand scheme of things. “They're just songs, man,” he says. “It doesn't need to go past that point. I know everybody values things differently—but for me at least, put it out, people listen to it, they like it or they don't. And then if you get to do it the next time, that's the gift that you get is the ability to do it the next time, because most people don't get that.”","short":"All isn’t as bleak as the title makes it seem on Staples’ sixth studio album."},"playParams":{"id":"1747072325","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dark-times/1747072325","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/30BFY5VHii4PyWqkTubUWX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747072325/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"566639154","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/566639154?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716539264425,"RTCI":0}}},"1747359693":{"id":"1747359693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747359693?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":69,"releaseDate":"2024-05-22","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/55/1d/f1/551df135-3bea-2870-d353-6b27be2a25be/ef66b40d-a6d8-4270-8a02-dc1e1e07c70b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bba27f","textColor2":"dea76c","textColor4":"b2885b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a5/aa/d6/a5aad635-261a-39ba-d422-48e2f830e69f/4634eb5c-462d-4396-a221-4c3b6d803387.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8ab85","textColor2":"d29d68","textColor4":"b0865b","textColor1":"f0cb9c","bgColor":"2a2a2a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=301751033-1747385753","name":"100 Best Albums (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Zane Lowe & Gus Mejia","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/28/2d/a4/282da4f1-3aaa-c389-64c6-09ddb0940923/dj.clownkxu.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cec9bd","textColor2":"f3c07b","textColor4":"c89f68","textColor1":"fbf4e6","bgColor":"1c1c1c","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Zane Lowe and Gus Mejia spin a special DJ mix featuring music from the list.","standard":"Zane Lowe and Gus Mejia spin a special DJ mix featuring music from the list."},"playParams":{"id":"1747359693","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/100-best-albums-dj-mix/1747359693"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747359693/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"301751033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/301751033?l=en-US"},{"id":"1747385753","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1747385753?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716443203862,"RTCI":0}}},"1747822148":{"id":"1747822148","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747822148?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/14/20/f6/1420f67f-54f6-e8c5-2a2b-fd7e05bb55f9/ba419254-21b9-4b98-b724-c8f51eb5a2ed.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bd9072","textColor2":"d5b250","textColor4":"ad9243","textColor1":"e8b08b","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coi-leray/1358539712","name":"Lemon Cars - EP","artistName":"Coi Leray","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Coi Leray can buy herself flowers. Too busy amassing mind-boggling streaming numbers or playing the biggest festivals in the world, the Jersey-bred rapper and singer doesn’t often pause to ponder lames who might invade her headspace. But behind her trademark massive hooks and viral smashes, a more vulnerable side to Leray’s artistry has been rumbling to life in the years since her 2018 breakout hit “G.A.N.” On <i>Lemon Cars</i>, the softer supporting harmonies that resonated on tracks like 2023’s “Come and Go” become central refrains, and Leray’s weakest moments become her strengths.\n\nFrom the hoarsely whispered rejection that drives “Can’t Come Back” to the sweet dreams she conjures on closer “Poster Girl,” this raw EP finds Leray deep in her bag and begging, “Come sweep me off my feet.” Where her last full-length, 2023’s <i>COI</i>, burst with big flexes and classic samples, <i>Lemon Cars</i> strips back the player-girl armor to reveal a young woman still healing from heartbreaks and hard times. Driving until the sun peeks over the horizon, partying until being unstoppable feels a lot like being stuck, longing until she’s lost in it: Leray faces it all over bittersweet fingerpicked guitar licks and undulating 808s. Her accomplishments aren’t what hold her close at night, and Leray beckons to lovers as boldly as she kicks them to the curb across these six tracks, each one a postcard from the edge of superstardom.\n\n<i>Lemon Cars</i> isn’t all teary eyes, exit signs, and escape routes, though. The Skilla Baby-featuring “Coke Bottle Body” is Leray at her most charismatic and carefree. Setting aside some of her struggles for a moment, Leray dances the night away on the penultimate track, confident she’s not just a trendsetter—she’s <i>the</i> trendsetter. As she puts it, “When I walk in, set the tone.”","short":"The ultimate player girl shares a softer side."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/79/3a/0d/793a0d07-13b8-d94d-c42d-21c1b51095ab/24UMGIM50734.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7b6a6","textColor2":"f0c541","textColor4":"c7a135","textColor1":"f0dfce","bgColor":"251006","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1747822148","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lemon-cars-ep/1747822148"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747822148/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1358539712","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1358539712?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1716552259565,"RTCI":0}}},"1748026811":{"id":"1748026811","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748026811?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-05-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sexyy-red/1409330762","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"In Sexyy We Trust","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sexyy Red","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e6/3a/e2/e63ae247-7bb8-2026-f868-347cf9b7cca2/797885187680_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"292624","textColor2":"2c281f","textColor4":"49443a","textColor1":"030304","bgColor":"bfb3a5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"If runaway smashes like “Pound Town,” “SkeeYee,” and “Get It Sexyy” told us anything about St. Louis MC Sexyy Red, it’s that the <i>Hood Hottest Princess</i> trades in anthems.

Across the tape, we hear Red rap about upholding a particular standard of courtship (“Boss Me Up”), the joys of puppy love (“U My Everything”), how hard she goes in the streets (“Ova Bad”), and also the very precise sexual maneuvers she enjoys (“Lick Me,” “Awesome Jawsome”). The bulk of it is delivered over charging Tay Keith production, the likes of which you can be sure a certain kind of person will be excited to shout back at her during an unknowable number of Rolling Loud sets. Red’s work here is enough to make guest appearances from Drake and Lil Baby seem like an afterthought, but they, too, very obviously recognize an aspiring hitmaker when they hear one.","short":"The
