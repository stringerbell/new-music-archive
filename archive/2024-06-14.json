Album and Interview","standard":"For fourth studio album, Hockey Dad reinvented the way the band writes music. “We had to just let our guard down and go, ‘OK, let’s peel back a few layers and actually understand what we’re doing here and what songs we want to write,’” drummer Billy Fleming tells Apple Music. “Let the songs write themselves, in a weird way. If it’s a delicate song, let it be delicate.”\n\nRestraint isn’t a characteristic fans would have previously associated with the Windang duo, but it’s well and truly on display in piano closer “Dancing on the Other Hand,” the lounge-esque “Burning Sand” and the power-pop-flavored “That’s on You.” The desire to explore new sounds was borne out of a simple resolve not to replicate the thrashy rock of their first three albums—although they did try, recording an entire LP’s worth of material before scrapping it. “We just started doing what we had always been doing,” explains Fleming. “We weren’t quite feeling it.”\n\nSalvation came in the shape of producer and former Sparkadia vocalist/guitarist Alex Burnett. “He flipped our whole songwriting process,” says Fleming. “[Previously] we would do the music first and lyrics were an afterthought. But he was like, ‘Sit here with an acoustic and actually focus on the lyrics first.’ Some of the best songs on the record were because of that.” \n\n“It was good for us to get that jolt and push in a different direction,” adds vocalist/guitarist Zach Stephenson, “and rebuild what we were trying to do.” Here, Fleming and Stephenson take Apple Music through <i>Rebuild Repeat</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Base Camp”</b>\nBilly Fleming: “That’s just a bit of a bop, like a little friendly introduction to the record. It was just a song title—Alex had written down some titles, and our challenge was to write something straight off the bat. ‘Base Camp’ is about always striving for more and attaining the goals that you really want to.”\n\n<b>“Still Have Room”</b>\nZach Stephenson: “It’s about no matter how badly you can be treated by a person, you’ve always got this section in your heart and in your head of the time you spent with them. There’s always a little bit of room there for somebody, no matter how the relationship ends.”\n\n<b>“Safety Pin”</b> \nZS: “That was another song title. I was thinking about this person being a literal safety pin, holding me together when shit starts to fall apart, and things are falling out of my pockets, and I need someone to coddle me and say it’s OK.”\n\n<b>“Wreck & Ruin”</b> \nZS: “It's a nod to [Sydney band] Royal Headache—we used to cover Royal Headache when we first started. So this one felt like a bit of a throwback, but we fell in love with it straightaway. It’s such a fun one to play.”\n\n<b>“Burning Sand”</b> \nZS: “It’s another love song. This one’s a little more specific—it’s about my girlfriend, talking about walking our dog and walking down on the beach, and the sand’s bloody hot. It’s really just a nice, sweet love song for her. There are a few little Easter eggs in there for us.”\n\n<b>“That’s on You”</b>\nZS: “That was the first song we worked on with Alex. I think I’d had an argument with [my landlord] two days before, so it was hot off the presses. I moved pretty quickly after that song was written.”\nBF: “You were pretty pissed off, but it’s such a nice song. It should have been a thrashy punk song but it just turned into this beautiful, spacious song with heaps of layers. I never would have expected that to come out of such angry lyrics.”\n\n<b>“Seething”</b>\nBF: “Alex came in; I think he was seething. And he was just like, ‘I’ve got the word: seething.’ And he was trying to get us revved up again. Trying to make us angry.”\nZS: “He was the one who was pissed off during ‘Seething.’ I think someone had done him dirty the day before. We just helped him figure the rest of that song out.”\n\n<b>“Unhinged”</b>\nZS: “I had this image of a wayward man, a drifter, being taken in by a family, and getting back on his feet. I don’t know where it came from, but that was the story I was running with on that song.”\n\n<b>“Backup Plan”</b>\nZS: “That’s a pretty correct assessment of my domestic fixing-things skills. That’s me tearing myself down. I can’t fix anything. I can’t deal with anything. That’s what that song’s all about.”\nBF: “It’s definitely accurate.”\n\n<b>“Road Signs”</b>\nBF: “It’s a very spacious song, and it felt really good to just rip it apart at the end and go heavy. It’s our first fade-out too, by the way.”\nZS: “That one’s [about] the drive from Sydney Airport down to Wollongong at 11 at night or midnight after you’ve flown home or you’ve just done a show in Sydney. That dark, lonely National Park drive. It’s kind of an ode to that muscle memory on that drive, going down that every single night.”\n\n<b>“Dancing on the Other Hand”</b>\nZS: “I had a demo for that as a full-band song with drums and everything. I might have just been showing everybody how it went on the piano. I think Alex was like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s it. Don’t do anything else. We’ll just do that.’ It’s kind of a sad, sooky song. I don’t remember what I was thinking about when I wrote it, but it’s a downer.”","short":"“We had to just let our guard down,” says Billy Fleming of LP

Album","standard":"The Decemberists’ first album in six years feels like a homecoming. After the somber and reflective <i>What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</i> in 2015 and the synth-laden protest songs of 2018’s <i>I’ll Be Your Girl</i>, their ninth LP, <i>As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again</i>—their first-ever double album—is a freewheeling and deeply pleasurable odyssey through the Portland folk-rockers’ estimable history. No stone in the band’s past is left unturned here: There are echoes of the wistfulness that drew so many listeners in circa 2002’s instant classic <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i>, as well as the flamboyant instrumentation and arched-eyebrow storytelling that marked 2005’s star-making <i>Picaresque</i>. Even <i>As It Ever Was</i>’ stormy and surprisingly bruising closer, the nearly 20-minute “Joan in the Garden,” instantly recalls the band’s 2009 proggy opus <i>The Hazards of Love</i> in its “Aqualung”-esque stomp, complete with meaty guitar riffs.\n\nAt first glance, Colin Meloy and co. are doing a lot across the ample framework of <i>As It Ever Was</i>—but their successfully executed sense of ambition is perfectly complemented by the sweet musical simplicity of these 13 songs, some of Meloy’s most straightforwardly gorgeous music put to tape. Accompanied by The Shins’ James Mercer and R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, the easy jangle of “Burial Ground” is practically The Decemberists’ own take on The Byrds’ classic “Turn! Turn! Turn!” while “America Made Me” leavens Meloy’s acerbic sociopolitical observations with a horn-laden bar-band boisterousness. “Don’t want stunning wordplay/All I want is you,” Meloy nakedly intones on “All I Want Is You,” perhaps a cheeky self-referential moment towards his own penchant for lyrical verbosity. But <i>As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again</i> reaffirms that The Decemberists are at their strongest when embracing their most long-held creative tendencies.","short":"The band’s first album in six

Album","standard":"Say what you will of their notoriously unruly behavior, $uicideboy$ fans know how to leverage collective power. The loyal cohort helped catapult the New Orleans duo’s cathartic emo-trap to a first official album debut within the Billboard Top 10. They’ve also come down hard when $uicideboy$’s menacing dirges for drug binges and depressive episodes past don’t meet expectations. On <i>New World Depression</i>, $crim and Ruby da Cherry’s first full album since 2022, the cousins address this doubt and dedication in equal measure, introducing newly measured textures to outline the long journey from a dark-sided fast life to international success. \n\nSobriety has only synthesized $uicideboy$’s perspective on drug dependence and depression. That personal progress leaves these 13 tracks more meditative than ever, despite the bacchanalia still simmering on the back burner. Triplet flows and pounding 808s link the different moments across this record, but $crim and Cherry find new pockets to play in, maintaining a thread through their work without tweaking a style until it frays. “Are You Going to See the Rose in the Vase, or the Dust on the Table” channels the joy of Southern icons Big K.R.I.T. and Kevin Gates, while “Us Vs. Them” clatters and cascades through all the movements of a jazz symposium, the kind that lays $uicideboy$’s New Orleans heritage thrillingly bare. \n\n$crim’s new beats still favor classic Memphis flows rejuvenated in post-2010s cloud-rap sound baths. But his elegant touches on <i>New World Depression</i> still allow for playful experimentation, moments where Ruby da Cherry or $crim take unexpected leaps to tumble through vignettes recalling near-death nadirs and cloud-nine career highlights; $crim even throws in a snippet from a news interview with a confessed serial killer.

On <i>Why Lawd?</i>, the producer from New Jersey uses his backpacking past to conjure up dusty grooves that serve as the perfect counterpoint to .Paak’s silky-smooth voice.\n\nOn “Distractions,” Knx cues up Spanish-inspired guitar and echoing drum clicks to give .Paak the perfect stage from which he can sing of long nights and beautiful days: “I don’t need no more distractions, but I’m gassed to see what might happen.” It’s an album of impeccable textures and an ode to the “you only live once” mindset. “SheUsed” is a throwback gospel track with soaring vocal harmonies that finds .Paak unearthing his scratchy falsetto. “Said I’ll be back but won’t be mad if this time is the last,” he raps after multiple innuendo-laced bars. It’s all good, though. <i>Why Lawd?</i> is what happens when two of the game’s best link up in the pursuit of pure hedonistic joy.","short":"Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge team up for their first joint album in eight years."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/why-lawd/1739842642","playParams":{"id":"1739842642","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0LlzHi8Erl8zpTumqt88Qe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1739842642/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"971531019","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/971531019?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718384034732}}},"1740838547":{"id":"1740838547","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740838547?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bb/a0/b1/bba0b146-f988-f2af-078a-d4cbae8c1e57/9bd5c175-172c-4e68-8901-3d5885c32315.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a3a6a1","textColor2":"dba580","textColor4":"b2896a","textColor1":"c8c9c5","bgColor":"101913","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lalah-hathaway/3895759","name":"VANTABLACK","artistName":"Lalah Hathaway","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/04/f6/97/04f697fd-a57a-559a-71ad-2590e90966c8/24UMGIM41402.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9cbca","textColor2":"c2c1bd","textColor4":"9b9a97","textColor1":"fcfefd","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vantablack/1740838547","playParams":{"id":"1740838547","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2OObNk2YheZrtE1YYZLhD7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740838547/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3895759","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3895759?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718354832801}}},"1740958745":{"id":"1740958745","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740958745?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fireground/1628385357","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Love Letter -

We're so often not given the credit as innovators of style and art—and we are the blueprints for a lot of it.”\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ee/99/71/ee997115-db46-977a-22ad-012ab8071207/0ea7df41-0545-4d87-ad56-e72629508652.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"32212b","textColor2":"211d1e","textColor4":"4c3843","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fba6d7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1744664316","playParams":{"id":"1744664316","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744664316/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"689468419","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/689468419?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752211847}}},"1744963062":{"id":"1744963062","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744963062?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fb/5a/17/fb5a17e6-bf9a-1ab5-4733-1dc91969f3df/9f413ccf-a4bc-4a9f-8f2b-12ad22e65667.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"310a23","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320a23","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e928a3","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/6f/1f/3d6f1f4e-95ac-e325-14f3-211835fcad6e/7da96acf-f822-451a-b426-d28a9ced9ff1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"edc5df","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"ebbfdc","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81d84","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/72/75/d2/7275d2cf-67a3-bfb1-8a60-f966754af00f/4fe4a4b3-3107-463c-9dac-4a07c66d5a2b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"d0c1c0","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"e0b7cc","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81c84","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/68/11/64/6811645d-d24c-8e78-f0f9-5e1abe796718/2b705833-f8e5-4c50-84ea-0cae9db5ee2b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"310b24","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320b24","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e52da5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d6/ec/1b/d6ec1be1-1cb9-057c-d3b3-bca2ed914ce5/7a9a0294-26ec-4e94-922d-a04a799978b5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"ecc5de","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"ebbfdc","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81d83","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/3b/23/0f3b23ae-2790-6322-8704-70cda99fd521/b634e306-8f62-4f92-8ff8-9177a678b48e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"edc6df","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"ebbfdc","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81d84","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/u-r-trax/1509294529","name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"u.r.trax","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"A “freaky and energetic” mix from the Paris-based DJ.","standard":"u.r.trax’s Pride DJ mix was tried and tested at clubs before it was compiled: “I selected tracks especially for this mix, tried some things with them live, and compiled the great moments it created in this recording,” she says. “It’s a mix to make you party, and a mix for the afterparty. I see it being played during the daytime, following a sleepless night. It’s freaky and energetic, it’s meant to channel your c**ty, unapologetic self. I think it would fit as much wide-open-air gatherings as much as intimate celebrations.” \n\nThe Paris-based DJ describes the mission of her mix—and DJing, broadly—as creating “an ephemeral space-time where problems are left at the door. A moment to let go of the ‘real world’—a world that is already difficult to navigate in itself, even more if you’re a queer POC—and to reconnect with your community.”\n\n“There’s no need to intellectualize club music, as its main function is to have fun. Still, having fun and occupying the space <i>is</i> political when you’re part of a minority. It is time to reclaim our spaces back.”\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/75/e9/08/75e9087a-f5ef-b3c6-9e72-cc05085acc74/7f782b2a-b397-44cb-8999-205fe01e334a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"f0c0e1","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"e0b9d4","textColor1":"fceff8","bgColor":"c20083","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1744963062","playParams":{"id":"1744963062","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744963062/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1509294529","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1509294529?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717751672518}}},"1745594617":{"id":"1745594617","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745594617?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e9/43/f7/e943f7d5-6ca8-6abd-a121-c7ebab882873/Job91d9acbe-57c3-40bd-8146-17dc31b7211f-169438119-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329783428_1793085118-Time1717531590429.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","0d0706"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"eac8ad"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"372422","textColor2":"0d0706","textColor4":"362423","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"eac8ad","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a3/f1/9e/a3f19ecd-cb07-ef2f-7f9c-82cface07328/046fd1e1-f3ae-4946-af9e-d93cf96d69c9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2b2726","textColor2":"0b0808","textColor4":"2b2827","textColor1":"0b0808","bgColor":"aca5a1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d1/1e/7a/d11e7a07-920a-3947-e47b-a656006669a0/Job4426cb18-570c-4f7d-b53a-51285ab9937a-169438120-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329783429_1793085119-Time1717534083016.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"564948","textColor2":"402b2a","textColor4":"655350","textColor1":"2d1f20","bgColor":"faf1e8","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nayeon/1625812861","name":"NA","artistName":"NAYEON","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/93/43/9f/93439f30-01bc-5bbf-9f98-94769ea2a1d9/8809928951058_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"362527","textColor2":"31071f","textColor4":"57263b","textColor1":"080606","bgColor":"efa4ab","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/na/1745594617","playParams":{"id":"1745594617","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5zQI9dFbS9TrhvC9clgjz7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745594617/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1625812861","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1625812861?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718380634427}}},"1746209476":{"id":"1746209476","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746209476?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/badsista/1076110776","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/04/49/a8044968-f6d0-ec03-069d-0d8e1b95cadc/ad75aa04-c39c-4c51-8bfb-be50fabc3b8a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"3f1e34","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b2c40","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ca/35/7b/ca357bc9-5d87-7cac-6c63-a348a1eaf834/f9f3f9c2-f333-4855-b4ac-103cf99c2d2c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ec/46/b5/ec46b56f-45b2-f10d-f686-4ceeda7bf860/3997e2ef-6fb1-4e62-be17-fb2db35c169d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"562a48","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/82/01/eb82018b-d470-e282-7558-97d6a6f19b62/18b24720-4107-4d62-82c3-2e3b14d30f17.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/09/90/64/09906447-8237-0855-c34f-e552782ea13f/b54a73a7-5a85-4d11-839b-18b538cb2f3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46233b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5a2b4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6acf","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https:/

“joyful riot” of a mix inspired by—and in honor of—queer history.","standard":"“Pride is not just confetti and rainbows,” The Blessed Madonna tells Apple Music. “It's supposed to be so much more. Pride starts as a riot. I want this to feel like a joyful riot.” The US-born, UK-based DJ and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion has crafted a Pride DJ mix that looks to history for inspiration.\n\n“If you can listen to the medley from Sylvester's live album <i>Living Proof</i> and not cry, then I don't know what's wrong with you,” she says, paying tribute to the queer trailblazer’s 1979 album and citing it as the starting point for her mix. “It's a record that for me has so much built into it. I wanted it all to be a part of this. There’s victory, but also sadness and loss. I can't listen to it without thinking about what would come next, which was the total decimation of a whole generation of queer elders,” she says.\n\n“I hope this mix conveys that I’m so proud to be the child of those elders—the spiritual and literal child of queer people who lived through a time that is so different to my own. My own grandmother was a lesbian, and my family is full of gay people. What they went through, and lived through, and who they lost, all of that is built into this.” Her mix has been curated in honor of the “untold queers that we lost before I came of age,” she says, “that we continue to lose when we don't stick up for kids who are learning who they are, and losing their lives for who they are. This is for them.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746812792","playParams":{"id":"1746812792","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746812792/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1524829861","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1524829861?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752351856}}},"1746987972":{"id":"1746987972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ligrye/1746985963","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/4d/9c/664d9c2e-da58-70bc-02a4-5cee3fb899d5/506c699f-d895-4a7c-9ba9-a28afa20434e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"38172d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"401f35","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/ec/46/beec4643-e4a3-eb21-3f3c-af51393395cd/5bc9c93a-131b-4ec7-b6d3-53b086c29ae8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/b9/80/ceb98053-fbaf-6d70-ed52-4e589c97bdbd/524910a2-ef9f-4d9d-9202-c3385cc38458.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4f2f44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/51/00/0651006d-0f0a-067c-ec78-9771add01651/bc3967cc-b6ab-4f4c-82e0-ecd3901acf16.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b0/83/2d/b0832d2c-be4a-2a39-fbe9-bdf0613d06f2/9519d231-09b4-4c83-96ab-7de97d891110.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46243b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b2d40","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6fd0","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/a9/05/16a905ef-701f-d9aa-e176-cc28da1ac6ea/c74dab08-de76-4121-ac33-24cf44db7350.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47243c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false}},"name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Ligrye","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/d3/66/4ad366d0-f4ff-a034-54d0-b57f7e12edd9/be24ea6d-1032-4e58-ae01-c401f04abc94.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"321629","textColor2":"242021","textColor4":"503144","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe71cf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Seoul-based DJ honors the city’s LGBTQ+ community and parties.","standard":"“I want to take people on a musical journey,” LIGRYE tells Apple Music about his exclusive Pride DJ mix. The South Africa-born, Seoul-based DJ carefully curated each step of the mix. “I took my time to build and tell a story—halfway through, you might have a moment where you say, ‘Okay, I see where this is going.’” LIGRYE curated the mix at home, in Seoul, and credits so much to the city. “South Korea is the first place where I actually celebrated Pride, in Seoul, and fully came out,” he says. “This place is extremely special to me.” It’s only fitting, then, that the mix directly represents the queer nightlife scene in Seoul—and queer music and community around the world. \n\nHighlighting one of his favorite moments on the mix, he draws attention to “Freak Like U” by Masarima. “It resonates on the personal level of growing up, being different, and not understanding why you’re different. And then getting to the point where you’re able to fully accept who you are and celebrate that. I never got to celebrate Pride in my home country, so Pride in Seoul is very, very important to me,” he says. “It started with something so tiny, in Hongdae, and has progressed to something so big—yet we still see a loud minority exhibiting hate. It gives you goosebumps to see queer people with their flags against those trying to prevent this joy. You just wonder, ‘Where’s the love?’ But we still fight. They try to change the location and we still show up. We still put on our brave faces and stand together.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746987972","playParams":{"id":"1746987972","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1746985963","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1746985963?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718214743030}}},"1747318695":{"id":"1747318695","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747318695?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-lesoul/1205296907","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f7/42/a0/f742a0b2-6968-e028-7e93-33168ea73a15/d4243567-fd06-49d1-9f8c-3ebadf2406b5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"3f1f34","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"422036","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/17/82/c7/1782c712-23b1-c859-0e19-2ee82d7cad3e/079382f2-b6f1-4cea-894e-75cd43cae444.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c4/0b/77/c40b7742-9b6a-929e-b035-dee8557ae8fe/4729ab40-ed37-4e07-a337-eecca15a9e4c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4d2f42","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e4/c8/c8/e4c8c8f0-ff4b-1c5e-4c51-398861c51023/41ce34fa-f526-4baf-85b7-250defd7150f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/aa/57/a1aa579b-409c-5cb8-3e88-e031c28f7e79/db169d61-a5c1-4041-b33d-a975b91739b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46233b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5a2b4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ace","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/72/18/db/7218db10-7e4e-614d-7aa6-f8cf68b3273a/f44857b4-1b93-4619-aab5-0563556dcd3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47243c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false}},"name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"DJ LeSoul","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/06/dd/3f/06dd3f68-0624-0f37-6210-56551b4b6531/05f76a74-add4-4fa6-9a96-fc1e38c1b927.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"321729","textColor2":"262223","textColor4":"513245","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe72ce","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The South African DJ’s mix showcases musical and cultural diversity.","standard":"“The mix was created to show just how much diversity there is in music right now,” South Africa’s DJ LeSoul tells Apple Music about her exclusive DJ mix, curated in honor of Pride and the queer community. “The mix was meant to evoke all the good, vibrant emotions.

It's not too uptempo—it loosens the fit between EDM and electro-house versus amapiano; you’ll hear those drums every now and again.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1747318695","playParams":{"id":"1747318695","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747318695/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1205296907","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1205296907?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717751774356}}},"1747518365":{"id":"1747518365","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747518365?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-06-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/love-letters/403808485","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Falling Star - EP","artistName":"Love Letters","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/82/ee/95/82ee95fd-cf77-777d-67b2-9c7f1b4b27b0/8718723258753.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"9da0c2","textColor2":"b4b0d4","textColor4":"928eae","textColor1":"c2c6ed","bgColor":"090817","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/falling-star-ep/1747518365","playParams":{"id":"1747518365","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747518365/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"403808485","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/403808485?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718338206060}}},"1747612960":{"id":"1747612960","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747612960?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5d/f8/45/5df845c2-4f54-7ea8-7853-a99b69f5685f/Job4ad3776b-eba6-4a80-885c-00b559dcb39e-170036549-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331038814_1804247673-Time1718324754606.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b2c0d2"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"090a0a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"9ea3a9","textColor2":"b2c0d2","textColor4":"909eab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"090a0a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/b7/7d/8ab77d47-c9e8-2f65-7512-1eb915356764/434b9a9c-dc84-4553-b319-b766914e2401.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3f3d39","textColor2":"382315","textColor4":"59473a","textColor1":"171713","bgColor":"ded8cf","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b9/8a/07/b98a07b7-4140-1b5c-f58a-591abb68a62c/Jobde5fc7c1-963a-4731-be73-24890019ac98-170036548-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331038815_1804247674-Time1718320471702.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","adbfc8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"090a0a"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"929fb0","textColor2":"adbfc8","textColor4":"8c9ca5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"090a0a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b5/0f/5b/b50f5b15-dd45-c28c-ce5b-9495ba0c7a69/2cfc81ad-ab50-45ce-914a-e8d8c671cdb2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cecebc","textColor2":"d9eff6","textColor4":"b8cdd2","textColor1":"f4f1d9","bgColor":"374346","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0f/2d/46/0f2d462b-0f07-f9bb-0647-98337ec4994d/8da93a55-ee78-4a70-ae20-c8dcc6ab0d40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"adb3b5","textColor2":"b6cdd2","textColor4":"95a7ab","textColor1":"d4dbde","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/don-toliver/1237012992","name":"HARDSTONE PSYCHO","artistName":"Don Toliver","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/85/6a/7b/856a7b37-50fb-1132-6996-2beda9a4f1a9/075679660756.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"aea499","textColor2":"c5cace","textColor4":"9fa5aa","textColor1":"d8c8b9","bgColor":"081317","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Where 2023’s <i>Love Sick</i> provided a means for Don Toliver to live out his funk-soul fantasies, the subsequent <i>HARDSTONE PSYCHO</i> finds him on an arena-rock-star wave. To be sure, this doesn’t at all mean the Houston rapper/singer is awash in gaudy guitar noodling or engaged in performative posturing here. Instead, he treats his chosen premise like a new state of mind, transmuting the weight and complexity of his catalog into this larger-than-life version of his artistry. So when some distinct riffs launch “BANDIT” and “TORE UP,” he effortlessly slips into the leather-jacketed cool in a manner that historically has eluded most rappers who’ve attempted such a move.\n\nDivided into four movements, <i>HARDSTONE PSYCHO</i> may mirror classic-rock indulgence in terms of overall structure, but more specifically it delivers on what fans from his <i>Heaven or Hell</i> or <i>Life of a DON</i> days desire. His voice, pliable and otherworldly, carries the muted fuzz of “KRYPTONITE,” the bleep-laden R&B of “DEEP IN THE WATER,” and the trippy trap of “4X4.” On “HARDSTONE NATIONAL ANTHEM,” he follows through on the titular promise with a showstopper that expertly reconfigures the pop-wise power ballad format.\n\nAs before, Toliver’s brought a few guests along to amplify and augment himself on record. Naturally, his Cactus Jack benefactor Travis Scott makes a handful of appearances, first as a sleek spitter on “ICE AGE” and later as his crooning co-conspirator on “INSIDE.” <i>Love Sick</i>  standout Charlie Wilson returns to briefly feature on the Cash Cobain collab “ATTITUDE,” its low-end rumble and inventive Pharrell callback giving considerable chills, while Future and Metro Boomin reignite their “Too Many Nights” torch for “PURPLE RAIN.” \n","short":"Cactus Jack’s hitmaker assumes his new arena-rock-star

queer, and unapologetically trans,” Lady Shaka tells Apple Music, setting the bar high for her Pride DJ mix. The UK-based, Aotearoa New Zealand-born artist of Māori descent dedicates her mix to “the trans women who have come before me and the trans women who are yet to come. I honor Georgina Beyer, the now-passed trans Māori icon—and the first trans member of parliament in the world. Kia au to moe (rest in peace).”\n\nListen out for her debut single “E Tu” on the mix. “For me as an Indigenous woman, there is nothing like playing music in queer spaces in my language, te reo Māori (the language),” she says. “I dedicate this Pride to all my queer and trans Indigenous whānau (family), tangata Māori (Māori people), tangata moana (people of the ocean), and tangata whenua (people of the land).”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748014447","playParams":{"id":"1748014447","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748014447/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1596372606","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1596372606?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718299409212}}},"1748021002":{"id":"1748021002","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748021002?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nick-grant/1148213710","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"SUNDAY

the drag icon’s mix, inspired by NYC and its vibrant queer nightlife.","standard":"“I envision my Pride mix to be a source of euphoric energy,” Aquaria tells Apple Music. “I’ve crafted it using songs that uplift my spirits in one way or another, and give me no choice but to find the nearest dance floor and sweat it out in the name of life. The best Pride celebrations are where all members of our community feel free and celebrated, and I can imagine myself playing this mix at all sorts of steamy clubs across the city.” The city in question is New York City, of course—the drag icon took inspiration from the city itself while creating the mix: “I’ve been working on it from my home office in Brooklyn, overlooking the East River and Manhattan skyline. I’m always so inspired when I look out and reflect on my past 10 years living in this city and working in queer nightlife. I’m reminded of countless unforgettable moments, and I wanted to encapsulate the spontaneity and excitement of my experiences here.”\n\nOf all the tracks on Aquaria’s mix, Romy’s “Enjoy Your Life” is a particular standout. “To me, this represents one of those songs that you can put on at any time, and even if you’re feeling down, its message and energy will always be there to uplift you,” Aquaria says. “The track reminds you that despite the obstacles life can throw at you, sometimes the solution really does boil down to the simple old-fashioned advice to enjoy your life. I’m all for lyrics with lots of nuance and deeper hidden meaning, but sometimes you don’t need a convoluted metaphor to express pure joy through music. Romy does that so perfectly on this track, and the DJ HEARTSTRING remix pushes that BPM—and message—even harder.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748666072","playParams":{"id":"1748666072","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748666072/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1097091378","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1097091378?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752258407}}},"1749120066":{"id":"1749120066","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749120066?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/infinity-song/1032063566","name":"Metamorphosis

studio and in the streets building the genre up. His <i>Trap Capos</i> mixtapes in the mid- to late 2010s featured future stars such Anuel AA, Bad Bunny, and Bryant Myers as well as their Puerto Rican hip-hop predecessors like Baby Rasta and Ñengo Flow. On <i>Trap Island</i>, the rapping impresario continues this intergenerational trend while also giving himself much-deserved props for his undeniable role in taking this music to the great heights it has reached. Following the lengthy albeit necessary intro “Otros Tiempos,” he thrives in solo settings like “Viaje” and the melodic “Igual Que Ayer,” the latter full of after-hours exhortations. His longtime collaborators Gigolo Y La Exce and Juhn show up on “Pesándote” and “Uno Más,” respectively, while comparative newcomers Hades66 and Ovi join on the edgy and defiant team-up “100.” ","short":"The pioneering trapero thrives both solo and in multigenerational collabs."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3f/c0/64/3fc06409-5b43-6fba-07f4-7c7a107ac054/196871923606.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6b2b1","textColor2":"c7cac8","textColor4":"9fa1a0","textColor1":"e3dedd","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trap-island/1749666299","playParams":{"id":"1749666299","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2YiziMql3dRV3ic0gkEDgv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749666299/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"582366656","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/582366656?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718390309306}}},"1750288353":{"id":"1750288353","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750288353?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/37/fe/41/37fe4187-0dc0-427b-a810-c34473a3ef47/8c457499-1057-4769-a3ab-4ec740cbcb4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6a282","textColor2":"dbad87","textColor4":"b18d6c","textColor1":"f6c8a1","bgColor":"060b03","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/40/8f/9f/408f9f21-f13b-8f6d-3999-d50752e5c6e8/e7c03732-4190-41f9-920e-1ea3f6741650.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c0bec3","textColor2":"dbd0bb","textColor4":"bfb2a0","textColor1":"dcdee6","bgColor":"503e37","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luke-bryan/20131064","name":"Mind Of A Country Boy","artistName":"Luke Bryan","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/78/da/e0/78dae0e1-5236-0ccf-23ad-14ffc8e37b43/24UMGIM60049.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9bbb8","textColor2":"f1b592","textColor4":"cc9a7b","textColor1":"dadfdd","bgColor":"352b21","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A career-spanning project, released to coincide with Luke Bryan’s massive tour of the same name, <i>Mind of a Country Boy</i> opens with its newly released title track, a hooky peek into the things that make Bryan tick, like whether to hit up “a honky-tonk or the river bend” and “old school Alabama” music.

Released days before Father’s Day in the US, the country superstar’s fifth studio album, <i>Fathers & Sons</i>, finds Combs in a tender place. Opening track “Front Door Famous” is a sweet and vivid ode to coming home after time out on the road and “walking through the front door hearing, ‘Daddy.’” “The Man He Sees in Me” is Combs at his most vulnerable, as he expresses the fearful hope that his son “never finds out that I didn't hang the moon.” \n\nOn “My Old Man Was Right,” Combs revisits advice from his own father, connecting his own experience of being “too young” to listen to his “old man” to how he hopes to parent his own children. And he closes the project with “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” a clever and nuanced celebration of going to the ballpark with Dad. Combs tapped an all-star band for the project, with players including Sam Bush on mandolin, Stuart Duncan on fiddle, Bryan Sutton on acoustic guitar, and Charlie Worsham on acoustic guitar. The group recorded the record live with Combs co-producing alongside Chip Matthews and Jonathan Singleton.\n","short":"The patriarchal-minded follow-up to Growin’ Up and Gettin’ Old."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/30/cd/9530cd97-d001-99d9-ac2e-32c2633f6ec3/196872117424.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"d5d2d3","textColor4":"b1afb0","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"212121","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fathers-sons/1750297439","playParams":{"id":"1750297439","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02GDaShX8vOw5tcak3OXow"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750297439/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"815635315","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/815635315?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718348288204}}},"1750968444":{"id":"1750968444","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750968444?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bd/ba/78/bdba7887-296a-40c8-5f1c-e32255d4ead2/Job1a1ffdfa-dbf0-4bcb-935d-e83fbbc79318-170056369-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331075742_1804572380-Time1718351901435.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dfb4b3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"170708"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cd9f9e","textColor2":"dfb4b3","textColor4":"c49393","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"170708","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2d/cf/af/2dcfaff0-5a96-1a31-7182-ae947453769d/f8d54372-de7a-45e3-bd21-e6e6eaf5447d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cabfbd","textColor2":"f9675f","textColor4":"cf5650","textColor1":"f2eae8","bgColor":"271111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/d4/27/19d427e2-f0b5-2589-01ce-c86db6059677/Jobfa75425c-7cb2-4917-bf25-d07165438ede-170056370-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331075741_1804572379-Time1718353566522.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d9b7b6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"170708"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c7a5a3","textColor2":"d9b7b6","textColor4":"bd9595","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"170708","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fd/2d/d7/fd2dd780-c2d9-c504-a240-c85fe0f4a2d2/01054688-efd9-41da-af03-c5b1b9eb865b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dba8a0","textColor2":"f5b5a3","textColor4":"dd9a8b","textColor1":"f4c7be","bgColor":"7a2d2b","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/50/f1/b6/50f1b6a5-4bec-1c73-b02e-ddf65ee55d50/b8bb81e4-b514-45f3-9220-6d3d077c4c3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b09c9d","textColor2":"cd9b9d","textColor4":"a87f81","textColor1":"d8bfc0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/moneybagg-yo/991187319","name":"SPEAK NOW","artistName":"Moneybagg Yo","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Where 2023’s <i>Hard to Love</i> found Moneybagg Yo deep in his thoughts, often exploring trap’s darker themes while willfully faded, <i>SPEAK NOW</i> feels like a reinvention of sorts. The Memphis rap star fixes his gaze here on the pleasures more so than the pain, overtly evident on the hypersexual subject matter that dominates the project. Leading with earned confidence on the booming opening pair “ALL YEAR” and “SPEAK,” he proceeds to pursue extravagances on “TIC TAC TOE” and “TRYNA MAKE SURE.”\n\nClearly he’s out looking for someone to match his freak on “BUSSIN” and the club-ready “TABOO MIAMI,” his lyrics as unapologetically explicit as ever in his sprawling discography. Chris Brown puts his swarthy R&B spin on “DRUNK OFF U,” a metaphorical mixology lesson where the lust is as strong as top-shelf liquor, while Lil Durk keeps it reliably real on the street feast “GANGSTAS RELATE.” Later on, Moneybagg’s fellow Tennessee native Morgan Wallen brings that country grammar to his “WHISKEY WHISKEY” verse and hook contributions.

Album and Interview","standard":"“It's a special moment for me,” Dei V tells Apple Music on the eve of his full-length debut. “After this, it's blessings that's coming.” Though the Puerto Rican rising star had been grinding for some time, he became a ubiquitous and welcome presence in recent years via standout singles and some stellar collaborations with the likes of KAROL G, Mora, and YOVNGCHIMI. This momentum culminates with <i>Quién es Dei V?</i>, a revelatory proper introduction to one of Latin music’s most promising would-be leaders.\n\nTeaming with hitmaking producers like Foreign Teck, Hydro, and Sky Rompiendo, among others, he delivers on the promise of fan favorites like “CLIMA” and “Martini” while ambitiously broadening his genre range further. “What I wanted to do with this album was throw a bunch of flavors in there, not just what I'd done before,” he says, citing Afrobeats and R&B alongside the trap and reggaetón styles the fans have come to expect from him. “I just threw a whole bunch of flows in there.” Read on to learn more about <i>Quién es Dei V?</i>—in the artist’s own words.\n\n<b>“David”</b>\n“I say something in the song that's like, 'I feel good because I'm sustaining my family.' That's what it's all about to me, so that's why I wanted to make it the first song. I named it how I named it because it says a lot about me.”\n\n<b>“Ticke” (feat. YOVNGCHIMI)</b>\n“That one came together after we did ‘Los Que Son’ and ‘Tu$$I.’ I wanted to do something different to what we already did, and that's where the reggaetón old-school beat came about. Chimi was the perfect one to hop on it. I did it first by myself, [then] I called him. I knew he was the one for it, and he killed it.”\n\n<b>“VNKLF” (feat. Foreign Teck)</b>\n“Foreign Teck is a New York guy. Me and him just clicked as soon as we met. We just go to the studio, vibe, and music just comes out. I think we got 10 songs that haven't dropped. I enjoy working with him. We worked in Miami, we worked in New York, we worked in LA.”\n\n<b>“Hot” (feat. Lunay)</b>\n“I'll be listening to Burna Boy like crazy. That's one of my favorite artists, so that's where the Afrobeats thing came from—like he does it, but with the Puerto Rican flow. I was in the studio one day and Gaby Music put on that beat out of nowhere. I just started doing the melody in my head. I wanted to do something for the beach, for people to go on boats, that want to ride Jet Skis, girls that want to get a suntan. And I wanted to do it with somebody that was big commercially, and Lunay was in the studio. He hopped in it right away.”\n\n<b>“Mueve el QLO”</b>\n“I just wanted to put something out there like ‘Trending,’ ‘Single,’ and ‘Tu$$I’ and go a little harder with it. I wanted to do something for the girls to dance and party in the strips clubs, go crazy on the TikToks. It's about to go crazy in the clubs.”\n\n<b>“PPV” (feat. De La Ghetto)</b>\n“[De La Ghetto] is one of my favorite artists since I was a kid, because he had that New York thing, that Puerto Rican New York style. It's a dream come true. He threw a bar from the famous song to 'Tu Te Imaginas.' That's a song that I had in the stash for a very, very, very long time, like three years maybe.”\n\n<b>“Rapido” (feat. Cris Mj)</b>\n“I got stuff for everybody in the album—for the old people and for the young people. I wanted to do some old-school reggaetón, and I think ‘Rapido’ is the perfect song, where it got the essence of the old-school vibe. I did the ‘Diabólica’ thing with Cris Mj, so this song is going to go crazy. People are going to definitely want to listen to it.”\n\n<b>“Maña”</b>\n“I wanted to do some Money Wayy flow. I called Hydro; he sent me a couple of beats, and I picked that one. That one just stood out, that gave me a feeling that it was going to be a hit. I think people going to go crazy with that one. That's going to be one of the favorites in Puerto Rico.”","short":"The rising star drops a diverse debut. “It's a special moment for me.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/qui%C3%A9n-es-dei-v/1751357435","playParams":{"id":"1751357435","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2i6InsyHZPR6NBFniDivF5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751357435/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1515317241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1515317241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718397476273}}},"1751392500":{"id":"1751392500","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751392500?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/andrea-datzman/148045778","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/14/c2/67/14c26753-fae9-5f02-c59e-8d62d7d4aa41/006298bd-b0eb-4de5-ab39-7ed4164dc2f5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bd8063","textColor2":"ed764f","textColor4":"c16242","textColor1":"e89c77","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Inside Out 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Andrea Datzman","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d8/5f/8e/d85f8e28-80ba-ebd3-0643-e328e15d1489/24UMGIM61706.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2aeb0","textColor2":"a1a4d6","textColor4":"8183ab","textColor1":"dfdadb","bgColor":"000002","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inside-out-2-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1751392500","playParams":{"id":"1751392500","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7GxqnKjMYDDxdAftzeAGfD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751392500/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"148045778","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/148045778?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718392817276}}},"1751753140":{"id":"1751753140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751753140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-06-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/normani/1351375726","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/63/2d/f2/632df233-f40e-e023-f3ef-cfc498225334/f2ae5b68-7572-44d1-9455-e1552f519d07.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d8d1cc","textColor2":"eaebeb","textColor4":"cbcccd","textColor1":"faf0ea","bgColor":"515354","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/bb/6d/abbb6d72-16be-399a-3df5-711480accd1c/8fa13fdf-fbf0-4244-93fc-2296dbf35037.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292a2a","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"343635","textColor1":"080708","bgColor":"afb6b1","hasP3":false}},"name":"DOPAMINE","artistName":"Normani","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b0/3f/4e/b03f4e60-5311-aeaf-3f09-2e316105cd96/196871857482.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3435","textColor2":"1b191a","textColor4":"464545","textColor1":"0c0406","bgColor":"f4f4f4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Normani knows some things are worth the wait, and nothing more than a debut album. The Fifth Harmony alum’s 2019 song “Motivation” introduced the triple threat as a solo performer. The hit single boasted an irresistible cascade hook and a choreography-rich music video to rival Britney Spears’ and Janet Jackson’s best. In the years since, while navigating family crises and online criticism, Normani has continued to hone down a full-length introduction to her singular voice. She completes that leap with <i>DOPAMINE</i>, a studied, seductive pop record that coats reflections on sex, love, and confidence with a glistening trap sheen. While smoother ballads like “All Yours” and “Insomnia” stay in direct conversation with vanguard hip-hop, single “Candy Paint” turns up the cowbell to hit the sweet spot of early Destiny’s Child, Brandy, and Cassie hits. Meanwhile, standout “Tantrums” darts down experimental pathways with a little help from vocals by one of Normani’s self-proclaimed favorite artists, James Blake. Contributions from Cardi B and Gunna round out the elegant portrait of this intentional artist, who’s more than ready for the rocket-ship rise depicted on <i>DOPAMINE</i>’s cover.
