Album","standard":"Pondâs natural penchant for bombast made the Perth quintet perennial candidates for turning in a double album, and this 10th LP finally makes it happen. <i>Stung!</i> plays like a robust showreel of everything the band does so well, from the glam flourishes of â(Iâm) Stungâ and Day-Glo bluster of âNeon Riverâ to the tight, Prince-ly funk of âSo Loâ and Beach Boys-esque harmonies and hues of âLast Elvis.â Sudden scene changes are always a given with Pond: Observe how the dank drum-fills and Sabbath-style vocal effects of âBlack Lungâ lead right to the understated quietude of âSunrise for the Lonely.â Through it all, singer/guitarist Nick Allbrook leads the chameleonic efforts of multi-instrumentalists Jay Watson, Jamie Terry, Joe Ryan, and James Ireland on an extended roller coaster of contrasts. Packing the most disparate elements into a single sitting is âEdge of the World Pt. 3,â an eight-minute odyssey featuring dreamy flute and sax from guest Thea Woodward and a monster guitar solo by Dungenâs Reine Fiske. And yet Allbrookâs coolly charismatic stewardship keeps the album feeling more coherent than chaotic, right up until the well-earned comedown of the closing ballad, âFell From Grace With the Sea.â","short":"The Perth quintetâs first-ever double album revels in sharp

Country: A Country Music Celebration Of Tom Petty","artistName":"Various Artists","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Compilation","standard":"Itâs possible that Tom Petty was the last thing we could all agree on. Though his mid- to late-â70s come-up rode the wake of FM-radio-friendly post-punk New Wave and power pop, he had just enough of an anti-establishment bent to escape the scorn of punk purists. (See: his scorched-earth campaign against record labelsâ price gouging circa 1981âs <i>Hard Promises</i>.) Yet by the end of the â80s, heâd prematurely embraced an elder-statesman status that belied his years as the (by far) youngest Traveling Wilbury and eased into a late-career oldies-friendly jam-band kinda vibe with drawn-out sets performed on large Persian rugs. His music was a road-trip godsend: comfort at best, conflict avoidance at worst.\n\nAll of which is to say that <i>Petty Country</i>, a comprehensive and heartfelt 20-track compilation of A-list country stars covering favorite Petty songs, makes absolute perfect sense, yet is revelatory nonethelessânot just in the way some of the genreâs most distinctive voices seem to find another gear in tribute, but in the way these songs sound like they were formative underpinnings of their own work to begin with, as modern mainstream country came to resemble nothing so much as â80s mainstream rock. \n\nRyan Hurd and Carly Pearceâs âBreakdownâ sounds like a song either of them could have made, yet is wholly faithful to the Heartbreakersâ version; ditto Steve Earleâs tear through <i>Full Moon Fever</i>âs amiably sneering âYer So Badâ and the playful Wynonna and Lainey Wilson duet on âRefugee.â Luke Combs keeps that âFast Carâ energy for another faithful cover from that era, âRunninâ Down a Dream.â George Strait offers a live version of <i>Wildflowers</i>â âYou Wreck Me,â while Thomas Rhett gives the title track the quiet reverence it deserves. Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench bless Margo Priceâs âWays to Be Wickedâ and Rhiannon Giddensâ âDonât Come Around Here No More,â respectively. Justin Mooreâs âHere Comes My Girlâ preserves the originalâs musical arrangement but leans on the Southern accent for the spoken-sung verses. \n\nTom Petty and most of the Heartbreakers were from Florida but had never really identified as a Southern band, an ambivalence Petty wrestled with and ultimately corrected for on 1985âs <i>Southern Accents</i>. While no one tackles that albumâs feisty opener âRebelsâ here, the compilationâs crown jewel is Dolly Partonâs majestic take on the title track. It feels less like Dolly covering Tom Petty than a Dolly Parton song all along that just happened to have been first conjured by Tom Petty. For all the accolades and milestones Petty racked up over a decades-long, yet still abruptly shortened, career, itâs hard to imagine anything thrilling him more.

accents."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/3e/10/9f3e100a-ffca-657e-4d26-f2a1c8496061/24BMR0005054.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfbdb5","textColor2":"d2cdbc","textColor4":"a8a497","textColor1":"efece2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/petty-country-a-country-music-celebration-of-tom-petty/1737463733","playParams":{"id":"1737463733","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7n06T3DJ7TcRWtMebr0d0t"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737463733/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1718974213903,"RTCI":0}}},"1741770317":{"id":"1741770317","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741770317?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-06-21","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/orlando-voorn/203131019","name":"No

old enough to know risk and reward belong together. Since she began releasing music in 2019, the singer-songwriter has homed in on emotional leaps of faith, her tremulous vocals expertly evoking the tear-splattered diary scribbles a great young love inspires. On her stripped-down new record <i>The Secret of Us</i>, Abrams takes stock of every crush and contradiction that led her to this chapter, reflecting the glow of formative past romances through soft prisms of pop, folk, and indie rock. Anyone who missed her coveted stint as an opener on the Eras Tour will welcome Taylor Swiftâs feature on âus.,â a soaring centerpiece addressed to an older partner Abrams canât be sure ever took her seriously. She isnât afraid to face the anxiety around her own legitimacy, or face it aloneâSwift is the only feature across these 13 tracks. But between the cathartic power chords of âTough Love,â the twinkling balladry of âI Love You, Iâm Sorry,â and the delicate simplicity of âFree Now,â the real secret to Abramsâ success shines through in her craftsmanship: Sheâs as serious as it gets.","short":"Risk and reward walk hand in hand on these clear-eyed modern love songs.

That 2023 album capped off a stunning run of singles and features from the mÃºsica mexicana superstar. Arriving roughly one year after its best-selling predecessor, the two-part full-length maintains its overwhelming collaborative ethos with a dizzying array of features from Gabito Ballesteros, Natanael Cano, and Ãscar Maydon, to name but a few. After taking in these 24 songs spread over nearly 80 minutes, fans should be forgiven for virtually rewinding back to choice cuts with such luminaries as Ivan Cornejo (âRELOJâ) and Luis R Conriquez (âSR. SMITHâ).\n\nEven in this veritable sea of like-minded artists bobbing their way through contemporary corridos waves, some of <i>ÃXODO</i>âs finest moments come when Peso Pluma is essentially solo. The drifting quietude that completes the otherwise boisterous and aggressive âICEâ is something rarely found even among the sad sierreÃ±o set, while the plaintive piano sections that bookend âBRUCE WAYNEâ lend a certain emotional magnitude to the songâs vampiric isolation metaphor. \n\nHinted at in the brief tech-house outro for âVINO TINTO,â <i>ÃXODO</i>âs second part breaks from genre expectations to move into other sounds that suit Peso Pluma incredibly well. Atlanta trap stars Quavo and Rich The Kid celebrate the luxe life alongside him on âPA NO PENSARâ and âGIMME A SECOND,â respectively. That hip-hop spirit persists when veteran ArcÃ¡ngel comes through for the booming âPESO COMPLETO,â and Cardi B injects bilingual baddie vibes into the standout âPUT EM IN THE FRIDGE.â Pop-wise reggaetÃ³n and clubby styles end things on a high note, as he teams up with Anitta and DJ Snake.","short":"First came GÃNESIS.

my Pride mix to be a source of euphoric energy,â Aquaria tells Apple Music. âIâve crafted it using songs that uplift my spirits in one way or another, and give me no choice but to find the nearest dance floor and sweat it out in the name of life. The best Pride celebrations are where all members of our community feel free and celebrated, and I can imagine myself playing this mix at all sorts of steamy clubs across the city.â The city in question is New York City, of courseâthe drag icon took inspiration from the city itself while creating the mix: âIâve been working on it from my home office in Brooklyn, overlooking the East River and Manhattan skyline. Iâm always so inspired when I look out and reflect on my past 10 years living in this city and working in queer nightlife. Iâm reminded of countless unforgettable moments, and I wanted to encapsulate the spontaneity and excitement of my experiences here.â\n\nOf all the tracks on Aquariaâs mix, Romyâs âEnjoy Your Lifeâ is a particular standout. âTo me, this represents one of those songs that you can put on at any time, and even if youâre feeling down, its message and energy will always be there to uplift you,â Aquaria says. âThe track reminds you that despite the obstacles life can throw at you, sometimes the solution really does boil down to the simple old-fashioned advice to enjoy your life. Iâm all for lyrics with lots of nuance and deeper hidden meaning, but sometimes you donât need a convoluted metaphor to express pure joy through music. Romy does that so perfectly on this track, and the DJ HEARTSTRING remix pushes that BPMâand messageâeven harder.â\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/99/71/40/9971408b-29b2-1239-bb86-5010d3bef13a/75fb8657-aa33-43b7-b72e-aafda9b7dafa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"32212b","textColor2":"221f1f","textColor4":"4d3a44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fba6d7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748666072","playParams":{"id":"1748666072","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748666072/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1097091378","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1097091378?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1717752258407,"RTCI":0}}},"1748765418":{"id":"1748765418","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748765418?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"releaseDate":"2024-02-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eric-bellinger/395826107","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The

Almaguer","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"âRight now, I happen to be in a contemplative moodâbut I also experience moments of horror,â Luisa Almaguer tells Apple Music. âI feel horrified watching everything thatâs going on in the world.â On <i>Weyes</i>, her extraordinary second album, the trans singer-songwriter from Mexico City unleashes a musical exorcism as powerful as it is unsettling. Her lyrics stare reality in the face, from pervasive homophobia to the loss of friends from prejudice and the systematic cruelty with which humanity degrades the animal kingdom. âSo much of my life has been shaped by the lack of love, and the resulting angst definitely informs my songs,â she says.\n\nThe most surprising facet of <i>Weyes</i> is the heart-wrenching tenderness that defines its tracks, from the languid orchestral beauty of âWeyâ to the ethereal sophistication and psychedelic pop of the ambitious âNube.â In Almaguerâs aesthetic universe, beauty remains untarnished by all the pain and discrimination. âIâm deeply moved whenever young trans people approach me in the street to tell me that my music brings them solace,â she says. âStanding by those who feel a bit forlornâgiving them some sort of refuge, or containment, is the greatest success that I could have ever imagined.â Here, Almaguer guides us through the albumâs songs.\n\n<b>âUn dÃ­a nos vamos a morirâ</b>\nâItâs about unrequited love, the feeling that pervades my love lifeâthat urgency, the desire to be cherished. This was the one track on the album that we finished really quickly. I already had the lyric, one day I came up with the melody, and I just had to record it. I enjoy the process of singing, and this track has a lot of drama in it. I wanted to create an explosive song, with huge tempo changes, and a return to the hushed mood of the intro. I just love to experiment.â\n\n<b>âWeyâ</b>\nâThis oneâs directed to all the heterosexual men who love usâor claim they do. Itâs based on a text message I sent to a guy, confronting him. It didnât really matter if the words rhymed or not.â\n\n<b>âAdiÃ³s a los amigosâ</b>\nâWritten a long time ago, a good 10 years. I had a band called Lowboy, the band where I started my path in music. I was starting to transition, had some issues with the people who didnât accept me, and thatâs how I lost a bunch of friends. A friend of mine used to say this: âI should have loved you for your ephemeral qualities, but chose eternity instead.â Itâs important to know when to say goodbye. I wanted to reflect on that, especially following the pandemic, and with everything else going on in the world: wars, the climate crisis, all those things.â\n\n<b>âUna Perraâ</b>\nâA more personal song about the state of the worldâalways tainted by discrimination. Iâve been vegan for the past eight years, and I decry the consumption of animals. Discrimination begins with them, thinking that you are superior to a chicken and assuming that you can eat itâhow crazy is that? The illusion of privilege begins at dinnertime. We go to the marches and demand female liberation, but consume pigs, milk from cows that are raped and their calves stolen from themâthese creatures are 10 times more intelligent than dogs. Thereâs some serious cognitive dissonance at play. A bitch in the backyard, a pig in the slaughterhouse. Things couldnât get worse.â\n\n<b>âWeyesâ</b>\nâA short interlude, like a loverâs poetic complaint. âLove me with kindness, love me now, Iâm running out of time.â I keep repeating this to myself. Itâs the thread line that runs through the entire album: demanding tenderness from men.â\n\n<b>âNubeâ</b>\nâThis track surprised me. It started as a simple love song but evolved into something differentâmore of an epic composition, with instruments and melodies all happening at the same time. Itâs a bit like âWeyâ; I feel those are the most fully realized in musical terms. Here we managed to evoke a feeling like reverieâunique and ethereal. Itâs sad and dramatic, but also hopeful. Itâs one of my proudest moments as a musician, and it all started because a dude broke my heart.â\n\n<b>âTÃ­o Hugoâ</b> \nâA gay boy dedicates a song to her favorite uncle. This song reminisces about my first reference points in terms of masculinity. My uncle Hugo was a sweet guy who often took us to school and was part of the little disasters in our everyday life. To me, he was incredibly cool compared to my dad, a cold and violent man. It was important to rescue that archetype, and Iâm sure many of my dissident friends will identify. Thereâs always an uncle, a teacher, an ally during childhood who remains a reference of goodness for the rest of our lives.â\n\n<b>âEl mÃ¡s insoportableâ</b>\nâThe âmost unbearable dudeâ is my boyfriendâmy almost husbandâJuliÃ¡n. My notion of love is something that can be difficult to bear, and thatâs what JuliÃ¡n means to me: the one who is there, still there. Itâs a love song, but it also addresses our nonmonogamous agreement.â\n\n<b>âMarÃ­aâ</b>\nâI wrote this one after my motherâs experience with cancer, in reference to the public hospitals in Mexico. Weâre in the Tlalpan area, where the hospitals are prestigious, and yet the treatment of patients is unacceptable, especially to low-income people. I canât quite process the fact that a policeman decides who can enter the hospital. Itâs violence above everything else, and I will never be able to forget that. The message is harsh, but I made it as a happy song, so that it becomes more accessible. Itâs the sole cumbia on the album, and it brings closure in a positive way, even though the subject matter is thorny. People from Latin America are well-versed in this: talking about issues that are dark, dense, and profound. Itâs our own way of dealing with tragedy.â","short":"âStanding by those who feel a bit forlorn is the greatest

- The 1st Mini Album","artistName":"RIIZE","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"In less than a year as a K-pop boy band, RIIZE has built up a bright discography defined by smooth sounds and onomatopoeic hooks that express the groupâs unabashed appreciation of pop music as metaphorâor, sometimes, pop music as straight-up subject. Their first mini album, <i>RIIZING</i>, picks up where 2023 debut track âGet a Guitarâ left off (âYou play me like dun, dun, dun/Still I love it when our eyes meetâ) with âBoom Boom Bass.â The disco-driven explanation of the push-and-pull between two people doesnât let the music-making fade into subtext. Here, the relationship itself is a composition: âWe makinâ music/Every day we play â¦ Donât stop the music/Hands up on my bass.â Funky B-side âTalk Saxyâ isnât far behind, declaring to an object of affection, âRa-pa-pa-pa/When you call my name,â and asking for more âsaxyâ talk.\n\n<i>RIIZING</i>âs other six tracks serve as a yearbook for much of what RIIZE has done in their busy first year. âSiren,â which samples H.O.T.âs 1996 K-hip-hop hit âWarriorâs Descendant,â was released in August 2023, just before the rookies made their official debut. âLove 119,â a soft winter ballad (âStolen my heart, that girl's a killer/Love so good, feels like a thrillerâ), hit the internet in January 2024, with the sleek dance single âImpossibleâ (and breakup-themed B-sides âHonestlyâ and âOne Kissâ) hitting in April. Itâs the restless, synth-driven energy of â9 Daysâ that puts the flurry of releases that would become <i>RIIZING</i> in context: âOut of breath, but I'm doing my best/So that I won't regret.â","short":"The rookie K-pop boy band shows off an unabashed appreciation for

Album","standard":"After years of molding their lifeâs experiences into vulnerable (and often dark) songs about love, loss, and the sinewy spaces in between, Kehlani ushered in a new era of healing with their 2022 album <i>blue water road</i>. But while they were touring, they experienced another recalibration. âI had to perform this really sweet, airy music, and people just wanted to turn up,â the singer tells Zane Lowe. They absorbed that energy and channeled it into their fourth album, <i>CRASH</i>. Made specifically for performing live, it replaces thoughtful reminiscence with the thrill of freedom and living in the moment. âItâs a grand part of my personality to go outside and have fun,â Kehlani says. âI love that part of myself, so Iâm just gonna let her live.â\n\n<i>CRASH</i> ventures in several directions across its 13 tracks, never bound to one genre. The joyous âAfter Hoursâ is made for the dance floor, its hip, whining drums sampled from Nina Skyâs 2004 hit âMove Ya Bodyâ (which itself borrows from Cordel âScattaâ Burrellâs âCoolie Dance Rhythmâ). Elsewhere, they dip into amapiano on the Omah Lay-featuring âTears,â reference Y2K pop royalty Christina Aguilera on rap-R&B hybrid âWhat I Want,â belt alongside fuzzed-out electric guitars on rock ballad âCrash,â and melt into countryâs acoustic simplicity on âBetter Not.â\n\nKehlani lives, lusts, and loves harder than ever, capturing effervescent slices of life through their lyrics. âThis momentâs for the taking/Let me set it,â they purr on âGrooveTheory,â a track whose slinking rhythm embodies the titillation of a late-night tryst. â8,â a candy-coated come-on that coaxes pleasure from simple math equations, is followed by the syrupy and more direct âSucia,â on which Jill Scott introduces its subjects as âecstasy savages.â âVegasâ builds a protective bubble where lovers can fully exist away from a world on fire. <i>CRASH</i> still has its introspective moments, though: âDeepâ allows Kehlani to reflect on the obstacles theyâve overcome to finally be this free. âFor once, Iâm not attached to some story or some public thing or some trauma or some deep explanations,â they tell Lowe. âI have nothing but joyful things to say to you.

As such, <i>Freak Show</i> presents the Bay Area rapper as the lustful ringmaster of a veritable carnival of carnal delights. Following the enticing introduction âWelcome,â he glides into the spotlight heâs grown ever confidently into over the years. On the title track, he revels in self-described toxicity infused in a lotharioâs finesse, French Montana pushing the envelope with his own flashy hedonism on the back half. He gets that same energy back twofold from Coi Leray and Kaliii on âFemme Fatale,â a sex-positive standout that benefits from the mutual mischief. \n\nGiven his proven track record for flipping other artistsâ familiar songs into inventively fresh cuts for himself, nobody should be shocked to hear G-Eazy do so again here. He offers a few necessary warnings on the slightly sinister âShowbiz,â its Cypress Hill interpolation recalling the temptations and trappings of fame. Elsewhere, a classic from The Clash becomes a demon time stomper called âAnxiety,â where his inner monologue does battle with his detractors.\n\nAs he reflects upon a life that has taken him well beyond Oaklandâs borders, his storytelling prowess manifests on the druggy and profane New York chronicle âBackseat,â while âSouth of Franceâ finds him jet-setting high above his haters. Lest one think heâs gone full-blown rock star, âLove You Foreverâ breaks with the raw physicality of its preceding themes to exhibit some genuinely heartfelt sentiments.
