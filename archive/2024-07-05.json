Latin rock hero’s whirling electro-rock spellbinds on his second solo outing.","standard":"<i>Bocanada</i> is nothing short of a dream-pop wonderland, laden with rock ’n’ roll riffage and careful string orchestration. On his second album without his bandmates from Soda Stereo, Gustavo Cerati deploys his seductive baritone and majestic guitar arpeggios to prove his unstoppable electro-rock mastery. “Engaña” enchants with its happy, little canned beat and sudden bursts of distortion, and “Paseo Inmoral” unleashes an arsenal of guitar pedals. His songwriting may often be cosmic, with lines about immortality and spiraling stars, but his lyrics about earthly love are universal too."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bocanada/304792998","playParams":{"id":"304792998","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2rIdWbXPjcq8K7BCccBhhC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/304792998/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6059320","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6059320?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1719604384914,"RTCI":0}}},"1718555401":{"id":"1718555401","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1718555401?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/squarepusher/4514377","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dostrotime","artistName":"Squarepusher","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6f/5a/36/6f5a36d1-6e97-1e47-6168-a2a84a3adb3e/5056614794830.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"e0e0e0","textColor4":"b3b3b3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dostrotime/1718555401","playParams":{"id":"1718555401","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7q2TYQUhAg9mzIjybDBpGI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1718555401/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4514377","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4514377?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232711252,"RTCI":0}}},"1722347372":{"id":"1722347372","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1722347372?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-07-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kokoko/430729817","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e9/39/89/e93989f7-94aa-0010-b9c3-97c1b7b2cda7/1be18a5b-9723-49c0-951e-bc0526f56245.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"86a97e","textColor2":"ed7766","textColor4":"c16455","textColor1":"a3ce99","bgColor":"121512","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/77/d2/e1/77d2e159-caf8-2bef-a1fb-7df12288acd1/4ba3a634-ff82-46cc-86f8-ee736d84f0c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d8d0c6","textColor2":"dbcd9e","textColor4":"bcac94","textColor1":"fefadc","bgColor":"41296c","hasP3":false}},"name":"Butu","artistName":"KOKOKO!","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/95/8e/80/958e80d4-221a-be9c-248d-9fb74900927d/5400863155889_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1cada","textColor2":"b1c983","textColor4":"95a37a","textColor1":"fbf9fa","bgColor":"270c59","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New

Album","standard":"Hiatus Kaiyote’s fourth album finds the Melbourne quartet in a playful mood. “BMO Is Beautiful” is a 41-second appreciation of the <i>Adventure Time</i> character BMO, featuring its voice actor Niki Yang on vocals. “Longcat” is a woozy tribute to “the longest cat in the world.”\n\nIt’s fitting, then, that the band’s trademark jazz/R&B/future soul excursions are unshackled from traditional song structure in favor of a looser, more improvised form that emerged from late-night jam sessions, steering the album from cacophonous freak-outs like closer “White Rabbit” to the celestial opener “Dreamboat” and elastic jazz of “Make Friends.” Vocalist Nai Palm draws her lyrical inspiration from a diverse well. The Brazilian and sambalike rhythms of “Telescope” lay the foundation for a journey into space, the song inspired by photographs from the Hubble telescope on each band member’s birthday.\n\n“Cinnamon Temple,” a schizophrenic, head-bending mélange of noise, funk, and jazz that’s been in the band’s live set since 2015, takes its title from the mud-brick mosques in Mali, which look like they have cinnamon stuck in them, while “Make Friends” riffs on deep platonic love, with its one verse repeated three times, each from a different gender perspective. Acclaimed Brazilian producer Mario Caldato Jr. (Beastie Boys, Björk, Beck) proves himself a willing accomplice, harnessing the band’s devil-may-care, genre-bending approach to arrive at a record that is equal parts engrossing, befuddling, and intoxicating, but never, ever dull.","short":"The quartet’s looser, more spontaneous fourth

Album","standard":"Since the mid 1980s, Joe Hisaishi’s soundtracks have breathed life into the fantastical, animated worlds of Studio Ghibli. Here, however, away from the narrative and graphic demands of cinema, Hisaishi is able to express himself more freely as a composer in his own right. In these live performances from Vienna’s Musikverein, Hisaishi fans will recognize the large-scale scoring, hints of traditional Japanese music, and melodic inspiration—but there’s a lot more to discover, too.\n\nSymphony No. 2, a three-movement work conceived and written during the pandemic, bubbles with an abundance of influences. In the opening two movements, the music has the sweeping optimism of 20th-century American symphonic music (think Aaron Copland or early Bernstein) tempered with the rhythmic insistence of John Adams’ large-scale minimalism. The final “Nursery Rhyme”, based on an ancient Japanese folk tune, sparkles with rhythmic and melodic vitality, settling in its final few minutes into a pared-back, crystalline beauty reminiscent of Arvo Pärt or Henryk Górecki.\n\n<i>Viola Saga</i>, written for and performed here by violist Antoine Tamestit, is an intensely expressive work. There’s a playful, driving energy to the opening movement—the sort that suffuses the best of Hisaishi’s Ghibli scores. And the beautiful, rippling second movement takes Bach as its inspiration in the twisting, turning harmonic directions of the arpeggiated solo part, and the pulsating underlying orchestral accompaniment.","short":"Stirring symphonic works by the acclaimed Studio Ghibli

Album and Interview","standard":"The follow-up to Headie One’s chart-topping 2020 debut, <i>EDNA</i>, finds the Tottenham MC in a state of gratitude. <i>The Last One</i> draws up hard-hitting home truths, clear-eyed reflections, and flashy verses on success, failure, and the thin lines that separate them. “I could approach it any way I want, to be honest—it all depends on my frame of mind,” he tells Apple Music’s Dotty about surveying the pains of his past. “Naturally, as I’m growing up and maturing, I do change my view on things, so I had to see what I was doing from the outside, analyze it properly, and see what I needed to progress and take steps forward.” To that effect, Headie frequently flashes to key crossroads. Opener “I Could Rap,” credits inspiration from fellow inmates (while serving a sentence in Scotland at HMP & YOI Polmont) for his unlikely conversion from prison ID number A6436CK to UK drill kingpin. “I wouldn’t say that I use it as fuel,” Headie says. “But I don’t think the world’s against me now either, so it’s just important that I keep doing what I’m doing.”\n\nThe album’s immersive opening chapter throws up a string of tricky predicaments, including crashing at the house of an addict on “Martin’s Sofa,” touring the UK in custody on “I Still Know Better,” and having the law hamper his early career on “Form 696.” Later, he basks in the warm glow of success on collabs with Aitch, D-Block Europe, and a trio of club steppers that draws in acts from Nigeria, but it’s these bold, feature-less tracks—tackling homelessness, inequality, and government tyranny—that wonderfully illustrate how one of life’s winners almost fell through the cracks. Though its title suggests a pump-faked retirement threat, <i>The Last One</i> is best described as a testimony to the rapper’s ability to survive and thrive through the toughest of trials. “I’m letting go of a lot of things,” Headie explains. “I’m speaking on them, and deciding to wash my hands of it and move forward. I actually accept what is now and what was then.”","short":"The OFB star on his clear-eyed story of survival: “I’m letting go.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-one/1740778963","playParams":{"id":"1740778963","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/26PpclJsqvQlP50d5XcLWp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740778963/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1235623728","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1235623728?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232933508,"RTCI":0}}},"1740852209":{"id":"1740852209","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740852209?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/johnny-cash/70936","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/7b/50/ce7b5083-23d4-2be0-38a4-8cf0d9281721/Joba2b74911-b0ef-4928-b661-93dcb61e52f5-168026982-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_326846913_1768332320-Time1715721864003.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c4cbcf"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b5babc","textColor2":"c4cbcf","textColor4":"a2a8ac","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c9/14/78/c9147841-2b3c-ff34-5186-6c997853d26a/eef526b2-ea58-46ed-8b34-3bc87ff52031.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c5","textColor2":"d1d1d1","textColor4":"ababab","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fb/75/10/fb7510d9-55d2-6d3f-f148-9f3b6730a5ec/Jobf929a98b-0e38-4970-b12d-0b0b0220053f-168418543-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327587200_1775380150-Time1716241884945.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d3d4d4","textColor2":"c6cdcf","textColor4":"a6acae","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"27292b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/10/78/88/10788803-da1b-7ced-78b2-ac16dc8a9c9a/65c9b93a-edad-496d-85af-3b88807cb828.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cccdce","textColor2":"dbdbdc","textColor4":"bababb","textColor1":"f2f4f4","bgColor":"343536","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/74/08/5d740837-992b-f68a-35ee-43b15b4cdb9c/78ee28f7-720c-4490-991d-a28c7d340e93.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bac1c3","textColor2":"d1d2d2","textColor4":"aaabab","textColor1":"e5edf0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Songwriter","artistName":"Johnny Cash","artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/36/d8/ff/36d8ff7d-d0c0-18ef-56f4-ffab18288747/24UMGIM38883.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"d2d2d3","textColor2":"e3e5e4","textColor4":"bcbebe","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"222325","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"<i>Songwriter</i> takes a set of demos Johnny Cash recorded in early 1993 and builds them out with posthumous recordings from a full band. Casual fans may find this a weird proposition, but those versed in Cash will recognize ’93 as the year preceeding the career-changing <i>American Recordings</i> and hence a kind of tremor before the quake. With the exception of “Drive On” and “Like a Soldier,” both of which showed up on <i>American Recordings</i>, and 1962’s “Sing It Pretty Sue,” these songs are new to us. Several are great: the cosmic “Hello Out There,” the gritty “Drive On,” the quaintly noble “Have You Ever Been to Little Rock?” and, best of all, “Well Alright,” in which a man meets a woman in a laundromat on a “dangerous, beautiful night” and, having helped her with her load (“she was washin’ extra hot”), begins a life with her. Mysterious, mundane, funny as a bird and deep as a well where you’ll never hear the penny hit bottom: Johnny Cash.

Here, the South African-born violinist takes a deep dive into his Irish heritage in this evocative album of traditional and classical pieces. Trad comes first in “Morning Nightcap,” where Hope trades sprightly licks with the whistles and uilleann pipes of the group Lúnasa, who also collaborate on the zesty dance-set “The Minor Bee.” Musicians of AIR Ensemble are Hope’s other main partners, contributing the crackling reel “The Red-Haired Boy” and a heart-piercing take on “O’Carolan’s Farewell to Music.”\n\nOn the classical front, Hope posts a sparkling account of a violin concerto by Vivaldi, a favorite composer in 18th-century Dublin, and a rhapsodic “Phantasy” written in 1926 by Irish composer Ina Boyle. Sir James and Lady Jeanne Galway add flutes to the ever-poignant “Danny Boy,” curated by Hope with the same affection and empathy which suffuses the entire album.","short":"A violinist’s Irish roots are unearthed in a sparkling and poignant recital."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/irish-roots/1741521958","playParams":{"id":"1741521958","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4lJpsKbpfhzB4ikJqpkZly"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741521958/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"73671116","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/73671116?l=en-US"},{"id":"185991932","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/185991932?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720233961701,"RTCI":0}}},"1741841621":{"id":"1741841621","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741841621?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/imagine-dragons/358714030","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cc/8b/69/cc8b69ce-b8e9-a880-530d-346c9f22c578/Jobd245efd4-c868-415b-af59-4bbd16f5cbf4-167228313-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325212577_1756307055-Time1714530465308.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","050404"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"384249"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"291c1b","textColor2":"050404","textColor4":"291c1b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"384249","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/65/af/3d/65af3d6d-eff7-2d4a-0825-6ea2d0088e48/e982c798-b3ea-41dc-9ee4-fc18f35adb94.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac8f78","textColor2":"d59f7f","textColor4":"ae8268","textColor1":"d3b093","bgColor":"110b0e","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/76/89/48/768948be-5309-7f33-dc0a-123b7336fcbd/Job1f205f1a-34af-4b34-b852-320b1acde71e-167228314-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325212576_1756307057-Time1714536134031.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d9dac6","textColor2":"fde4ad","textColor4":"e6c89c","textColor1":"edfbe1","bgColor":"895759","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/58/94/b258944d-7789-a5c2-93de-22bfb6ffdc56/cbd2848b-36b7-41a0-af1e-1469921c92d2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c5c6ae","textColor2":"dcc2ba","textColor4":"bda9a4","textColor1":"e6e5c7","bgColor":"42484c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/14/4a/fe/144afeab-c427-f587-4c97-b7641c974193/cdaab530-2d57-4213-acc5-5281009c39bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"33251a","textColor2":"13110e","textColor4":"32251c","textColor1":"14110b","bgColor":"ae7454","hasP3":false}},"name":"LOOM","artistName":"Imagine Dragons","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/11/ad/84/11ad84d7-2baa-cfe8-6616-02e7045d7ab0/24UMGIM43945.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e6d6c2","textColor2":"f6e9b2","textColor4":"e0cca0","textColor1":"fff6dc","bgColor":"85595a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On <i>LOOM</i>, Imagine Dragons’ sixth LP, Dan Reynolds and his band weave dexterously between poles. The album is playful at times but intense during others, building from the act’s signature pop-rock style to incorporate more elements of rap and electro than ever before. On <i>LOOM</i>, they also reckon with their own legacy, noting how the project simultaneously marks the end of one era and the beginning of something new.\n\nOn “Take Me to the Beach,” Reynolds infuses his signature melodic delivery with a hopping pace, giving the song a gleeful edge even as he digs into hot-button issues like the surveillance state that surrounds us. The chorus extols the virtues of a warm, relaxing day on a sandy hideaway, but Reynolds uses the refrain as an opportunity to dig at his personality: “You take the snow/It’s way too cold/My heart is cold enough,” he sings. It’s funny, but the vocalist grimaces as he chuckles.","short":"At turns playful and intense, and a reckoning with their legacy."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loom/1741841621","playParams":{"id":"1741841621","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7EPrkhjTBrwAV8yAKCmY0Y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741841621/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"358714030","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/358714030?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720441466963,"RTCI":0}}},"1742012449":{"id":"1742012449","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742012449?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lupe-fiasco/2851441","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/72/95/b2/7295b2f6-e829-ecd7-9947-ccffff9edd2d/406cca18-a9f1-42c8-ac9d-6649402a226d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0a98d","textColor2":"c7c7a7","textColor4":"aea789","textColor1":"dec8ac","bgColor":"4a2b11","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3b/8f/49/3b8f4915-d962-616d-b4d7-31f308ef82a0/feab2f47-0683-459b-927d-db463cd739fd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d1c8","textColor2":"dce4f6","textColor4":"bfc7d6","textColor1":"f6f1e5","bgColor":"485254","hasP3":false}},"name":"Samurai","artistName":"Lupe Fiasco","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c4/f4/bc/c4f4bce2-9c54-fc8b-47a6-3f450c457a65/198391855535.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2ccd2","textColor2":"ded7c3","textColor4":"c1beb6","textColor1":"f3e9e7","bgColor":"4d5981","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Across his varied, genre-pushing discography, Chicago spitter Lupe Fiasco has kept one thing consistent: He remains one of the best bar-for-bar rappers in the game. His ninth album is a milestone in many ways, although it continues his trend as one of hip-hop’s strongest lyricists: The entire project was produced by Soundtrakk, making it their second full-album collaboration, following 2022's <i>DRILL MUSIC IN ZION</i>, and it’s the first album that Lupe and Soundtrakk worked on with their longtime manager Charley \"Chill\" Patton since 2007's <i>The Cool</i>.\n\nConsidering it’s a family reunion of sorts, Lupe and his go-to producer wanted to make the album as personal as possible, weaving narratives with anecdotes unique to the Windy City wonder. On the throwback “Mumble Rap,” Fiasco tells the story of a woman entranced by a mysterious sound before realizing its danger, which Lupe highlights by mumbling his way through the chorus. It’s conceptually daring commentary on the industry Lupe has made his name in, while still reflecting his singular POV. In that way, too, <i>Samurai</i> is more of the thrilling same from rap’s poet laureate.","short":"His ninth album continues his streak as one of rap’s strongest

Release","standard":"On the one hand, maybe there’s such a thing as too many Neil Young archival releases; on the other…is there? More so than <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, the recordings here capture the extremes of folk prettiness and rock ’n’ roll ugliness that made Young’s music with Crazy Horse so gnarly and ultimately influential. A “Winterlong” weak with heartache and a “Helpless” that trudges forward like a beggar at death’s door. A wild first take of “Down by the River” and an equally wild 14th of “Come On Baby Let’s Go Downtown” on which the band crosses from good and loose into bloodshot and a little unhinged. You can hear why he was considered both forbidding in his rawness and so eminently breakable in his vulnerability, and why he went back to this band over and over and over again: Who else could play with so little grace and make it sound so beautiful?

And even now, if you go to taxi ranks, you’ll hear all the taxis are playing gqom sounds. In South Africa, the taxis have their own culture; they have big sound systems. [As a driver] if you have the big sound system, you’re going to get more customers. And that was another way we used to push our music.”\n\nLike the minibus taxi system that helped gqom artists get their sound out there, DJ Lag remains a driving force behind the growth of the scene, and with his 2024 album <i>THE REBELLION</i>, he presents the next chapter of the drum-heavy sound’s evolution. “I think if I stop [producing gqom], a lot of people will just stop,” Lag explains. “It’s my responsibility to keep pushing stuff. The style I’m trying now is gqom mixed with amapiano. And I just had to call it <i>THE REBELLION</i>. It’s slow like ’piano, but the beats—you can hear it’s gqom. I like experimenting a lot, and I think that’s how most of the producers are moving right now in Durban. It’s a mix of Afro-tech, but you can still hear the bass and the darkness of the song—so you can hear it’s two different sounds. On the album, we have three-step, we have proper gqom—like the old style—we have gqom with hip-hop, and we also have gqom mixed with amapiano.” Below, he talks through key tracks from the album.\n\n<b>“Iza Ngamandla” (with Sykes & Vanco)</b>\n“It’s a mixture of two genres. It’s three-step, but it changes and becomes darker in the middle, and then it goes back to Afro-tech-ish. And Sykes is really good with the vocals. I made it number one because it’s chilled, but it’s talking about how hot the album is. When they say ‘Iza Ngamandla,’ they’re saying, ‘This album is coming with force.’”\n\n<b>“Hade Boss” (feat. K.C Driller) (with Mr Nation Thingz)</b>\n“I started producing that style around 2021, trying to link gqom with ’piano, but I don’t think I was really good at it. In 2023, that’s when I started perfecting the sound. We sent three beats that are made with K.C Driller to unleash things, and one of them was the one he used for ‘Hade Boss.’ I thought he was going to release that song, but he was like, ‘No, you release it.’ I was like, 'OK, cool—but I don’t know when.’ Then he started doing this challenge on TikTok and the song started growing. We just uploaded a small clip of the song, and some guy who was a dancer started dancing using the song. Then everybody started doing it. It was crazy. So that’s why I wanted to release more music which is on that style. Another song called ‘Bamba’ is the same style but with no vocals, just a beat.” \n\n<b>“Trouble” (feat. Novaboy)</b>\n“That’s the new wave. That’s the new wave that these new guys are making in Durban. Novaboy is one of the new good producers from Clermont, where I come from.”\n\n<b>“Yebo” (feat. Thobeka)</b>\n“I made the beat around December [2023], and it’s one of the songs I’ve been playing in all my gigs. The vocals, the first part, the deep voice, it’s K.C Driller. What is he saying is something that we always shout in the club. It’s something everybody just likes to shout in the club, and we just created a song out of it. I used to always use that thing on the mic when I’m DJing and the crowd would say [it] back. So now I’m playing the actual song, everybody’s going crazy when I’m playing it. It’s nice to bring that live element into a song.”\n\n<b>“Oke Oke” (with Jazz Alonso)</b>\n“I was on tour, and I was working with different producers. That’s when I went to [producer] GG’s studio. Then Jazz came along, and one of the beats that we made that day she jumps on. It’s about love.”\n\n<b>“Kwenzakalan” (feat. BIxckie, Leodaleo & Dezzodigo)</b>\n“This is the second song that I tried mixing gqom with trap. Dezzo is another producer, and Leodaleo is an MC—so it was Blxckie and Leo on the vocals. And Blxckie is one of the biggest hip-hop artists here in South Africa. He’s amazing. Blxckie is crazy, man. He is crazy. He wrote that verse, he just listened to the beat for two minutes, and then he was like, ‘Yeah, record.’ And he was like, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, fast. Every time [I’m in the studio with another artist], I know they’re doing a different sound, but I always try to put my sound with their sound, trying to fit in. Because I really love hip-hop, but I don’t want to do proper hip-hop. I want to mix it with my style.”\n\n<b>“Yeyeyeyeye” (feat. Sane & Charlie Magandi)</b>\n“We did that song and we were coming from a club. I just decided, ‘You know what, let’s just go to the studio.’ I made the beat. While I was making the beat, my friends behind me, they were like doing those chants, ‘Ye ye ye ye ye ye.’ We just decided, ‘You know what, let’s just put this thing on the beat.’ And yeah, we just left it like that, because there’s no verse on that song, there’s nothing. It’s just the chants and the beat. Sane’s not singing—she’s just saying that boys are dogs. I’ve seen people pointing at each other when I’m playing that song. This one causes trouble.”\n\n<b>“Umlilo” (feat. Holy Alpha & Kay Faith) (with YoungstaCPT & Dee Koala)</b>\n“This one is gqom trap. All the artists who are on that song are from Cape Town. I was doing a show when I was there and I just brought everyone to the studio. They have their own style in Cape Town, their own gqom style. These new guys who are rapping on gqom, their beats are also insane and different. Everybody has his own taste, every province has their own style. Even in East London, they have their own style. I know all of the producers, actually. We share music.”\n\n<b>“Hade Boss (Re-Up)” (feat.

Despite the album’s rather downcast outlook, Apollo continues to populate his songs with candy-sweet melodies and inventive textures that separate him from pop’s mainstream pack.\n\nTake “Spite,” which gallops along with pulsing tom drums and a whimsical synth hook that Apollo engages with in a call-and-response format. Is it worse to feel love in a diminished form or spend the night alone? The Indiana-born songwriter relishes these moments of pain, because they often yield his best writing. He tells Apple Music, “It was a dark time in my life, but usually when I’m in that zone of uncomfort, I get a lot done. I learn a lot about myself, the introspective thoughts start to surface, and I’m able to write how I’m feeling.”\n\nDespite this, Apollo ultimately sees the album as a testament to his self-improvement and growth as an artist and person. “I had to be the best version of myself…rewiring my brain to think in that way, somebody who deserves all this,” he says. “I have this, I can do this. This is different.”","short":"A rising pop star treats good times with a wary eye on his second

Album","standard":"The first sign that a new era had arrived was Camila Cabello’s platinum blonde locks. Then came “I LUV IT,” the shake-up of a lead single for the Miami native’s fourth studio album—loud, brash, and diamond-hard, with a hook that interpolates a 2009 Gucci Mane classic (“Lemonade”) and an expressionistic verse from Playboi Carti. Speaking to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, the 27-year-old singer emphasizes <i>C,XOXO</i>’s most crucial evolution: For the first time in her career, the songwriting feels like her own. “Letting go of the safety net of other co-writers in the room allowed for there to be more space for me to hear my own voice,” she tells Lowe. “When you are younger, you feel like you are looking for other people to point out the way a little bit more, and that voice inside you, you’re listening to, but you don’t totally trust. I think as I’ve gotten older, I’m like, you know what? I’m just going to listen to myself. I’m comfortable being, like, it’s on me today, and whether it fails or succeeds, I can trust myself to do it.”\n\nCall it a vibe shift or a reintroduction or, as Cabello cheekily called <i>C,XOXO</i>, her “hyper-femme villain arc,” with dreamy production from Spain’s El Guincho. There are odes to her tropical hometown, as she recruits City Girls to twerk out the sunroof on Collins Avenue for “Dade County Dreaming.” She’s covered in glitter and dressed for revenge on “pretty when i cry” and tempting an ex on the scorching “HOT UPTOWN,” which features Drake in peak <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i> form. Things get deeper on moody, wispy tracks like “June Gloom” and “Twentysomethings,” downcast odes to messy, complicated relationships: “Twentysomethings, gotta have a sense of humor/When it comes to us/Don’t know what the fuck I’m doing,” she coos on the latter.\n\nBut it’s the gorgeous and strange “Chanel No.5” that best represents Cabello as a songwriter. It’s an ethereal experiment she describes as having “pop melodies, but with rap structure,” with twinkly piano and lyrical nods to Haruki Murakami and Quentin Tarantino, spritzes of perfume, and chipped nail polish. “It is the thesis statement for the album,” she tells Lowe. “I was like, this is literally the voice of <i>C,XOXO</i>. It’s playful. She’s in control. She’s putting on her lip gloss. She’s toying with this guy. She’s magical. She’s sensitive.”\n","short":"Call it a vibe shift or a reintroduction—the Miami native’s fourth album is

Album","standard":"Some two years after the sublime <i>Candydrip</i>, Lucky Daye ensures that his third studio album is required listening for R&B fans and lovers everywhere. Despite the seeming coldness of its title, <i>Algorithm</i> allures with its series of sensual come-ons and pillow-talk confessions. The carnal delights depicted on “Top” feel downright palpable thanks to the singer’s earnest and eager delivery, a move that proves equally efficient on relatively more abstract cuts like the title track.\n\nA standout swirling with circular rhythms and squelchy bass, “Think Different” makes an assertive plea for cuffing in order to break an unfulfilling cycle of one-night stands. You can hear how much he’s enjoying himself on the blues-inflected novelty “Mary,” a steamy entry in the canon of lothario lore. At the same time, he’s also coming to understand the existential terror of being alone, particularly via “That’s You.” On the guest front, Teddy Swims adds his countrified soul-pop seasoning to the vulnerable duet “Blame,” while RAYE nudges Daye closer to commitment on the tender “Paralyzed.”","short":"The R&B sensation drifts through the sensual and existential sides of

Album","standard":"During the Latin R&B wave of the late 2010s, Lyanno emerged as a breakout star via posse cuts like the “A Solas” and “Toda” remixes. Nearly halfway into the 2020s, the Puerto Rican singing sensation has since developed into an artist capable of solo standouts like “JOLLY” as well as memorable collaborations within and beyond his reggaetón roots. The concise yet diverse <i>PARA TODAS LAS MAMACITAS</i> offers a sampling of how his skill set applies across styles. Naturally, there are ample perreo opportunities, as “LO QUE TE DOY” and the pulsating “PTLM” plainly show. Continuing their long-standing back-and-forth creative exchange, Rauw Alejandro helps slow things down for the bump-and-grind prospects of “LA NENA.” Throughout the album, he steps into other sounds, basking in the reggae vibrations of “MÁS DE UN BESO” or emoting over the broader bombastic pop of “NOTAS DE VOZ.” Leaning fully into the explicit territory alluded to by the album title, the provocative “CRÈMEPIE” makes his intentions clear over a scintillating hip-hop beat.","short":"The Latin R&B star does a little something for the

Album","standard":"“Never put a artist in a box/They only thought I could do house,” Channel Tres sings on the title track of his debut album, <i>Head Rush</i>. Since debuting in 2018 with the gliding “Controller,” the LA-based artist has become the purveyor of what he calls “Compton house,” a distinctly West Coast blend of house music, hip-hop, and funk. But his skill set extends beyond the dance floor. Early cuts such as “Black Moses” and “2000 chevy malibu” showed his hard-hitting yet atmospheric approach to rap, and collaborations with artists including Terrace Martin, Jungle, Tove Lo, and Gus Dapperton proved his versatility across genres. On <i>Real Cultural Shit</i>, Channel’s 2023 EP, he leveled up his songwriting, boosting his euphoric production with catchy hooks as heard on the defiant “6am.”\n\nChannel’s ever-growing Rolodex comes through on <i>Head Rush</i>, with Thundercat, Teezo Touchdown, Ty Dolla $ign, and more appearing throughout the album. It’s familiar in that it still pulses with Channel’s slick dance grooves, but it’s also where he expands upon his songwriting focus and sonic experiments. “Joyful Noise” is a modern take on gospel house, while “Type” brings celestial, speaker-busting rap. Even his signature suave baritone becomes another instrument to play with, getting rugged and fervent on the industrial-coated “Black & Mild.”\n\nMuch of <i>Head Rush</i> finds Channel enjoying the perks of fame. “Cactus Water,” on which freak flags fly atop swirling disco, is the album’s summer joint with its inviting chorus and funky bassline. He celebrates the luxury goods he previously couldn’t afford on the chugging “Candy Paint” and the beaming “Chain Hang Low,” and “I’m Him” is well-earned braggadocio. But embedded among the joy is a sobering vulnerability as Channel peels back layers of struggles past and present. It’s how on the beat-switching “Head Rush” he can juxtapose the triumph of buying a house with the survivor’s guilt of childhood trauma. Closing track “Here” is a bittersweet tribute to his late friend and fellow artist AUGUST 08, who helped Channel break into the industry: 08 “was a tutor/I was a student/Now we are the future.”","short":"The LA artist levels up his “Compton house” on his debut

Album","standard":"“I hope that I’m genuinely breaking down walls and opening doors for kids like me that think they can only do rap,” Lil Yachty tells Apple Music. After the ambitious yet effective psychedelic pivot of <i>Let’s Start Here</i>, the artistic possibilities afforded to Yachty grew exponentially like multiversal timelines. Here was someone who could step outside of hip-hop’s comfort zones to credibly deliver a rock odyssey for the 2020s.\n\nEvidently, that intrigued singer-songwriter James Blake enough to join forces with the Atlanta-based rapper for a joint album that further blurs the lines of their respective discographies—with captivating and even magnificent results. “Most of the songs started by me playing [him] a piece of beatless ambient and then him literally just writing a song in about 20 seconds,” says the British songwriter and producer.\n\nAt times, <i>Bad Cameo</i> can feel like a push-and-pull between the two talents, something to be expected when seemingly disparate artists enter into such a venture together. A flurry of narcotized love and burnt rubber, “Woo” comes closest to the jittery clubwise energy of Yachty’s singles. Meanwhile Blake, a consummate collaborator for everyone from Beyoncé and ROSALÍA to Oneohtrix Point Never and Nico Muhly, seems to have the upper hand on the meditative “Midnight.”\n\nAnd yet, that dynamic also seems a function of the thematic gravity of these shared songs that focus heavily on internal monologues and relationships, with all the inherent messiness and complexity intact. One can detect the fundamental empathy amid the ambient drift and retro breakbeats of “In Grey,” as both Blake and Yachty turn their all-too-human vulnerabilities into open secrets. Propelled by intentionally slippery beat switches, “Transport Me” reveals commonality and camaraderie through their long-distance dramatics and poetic ruminations. “There were no boundaries whatsoever musically,” Blake says. “There was nothing cynical on any level about the process.”\n\nBy the time the harmonious finale “Red Carpet” arrives, it’s clear how respectively and collectively transformative the process was for them. “When you have two people who come from different worlds, I think at the end of the day it’s all a love for music,” says Lil Yachty.\n","short":"Teacups and double cups collide on this captivating joint album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bad-cameo/1751980321","playParams":{"id":"1751980321","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5zncNknK8hrQyTTVWpUyAf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751980321/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"59504818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/59504818?l=en-US"},{"id":"1080733657","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1080733657?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232694765,"RTCI":0}}},"1752024169":{"id":"1752024169","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752024169?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/megan-thee-stallion/1258989914","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e5/31/d5/e531d5f7-ab45-cc20-a3ba-bb7afb01b8fd/Jobb3774096-f32b-4660-9cb0-22d5eab0510e-170819882-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332563622_1817338458-Time1719438222324.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2a3728"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"676565"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"333739","textColor2":"2a3728","textColor4":"515b4f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"676565","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/83/ec/3b/83ec3b6b-0f00-a0bd-434a-78e182297635/8e5deeb1-47f9-4c5d-b173-2506b45ae937.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"be772d","textColor2":"f58821","textColor4":"bf7120","textColor1":"f59132","bgColor":"121e1d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/94/80/b8/9480b83c-d714-e0be-2212-fb3cfeeb0e05/Job120c3a0b-a8cd-428a-b4e3-fbf295a36b8e-170819881-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332563623_1817338457-Time1719435915359.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"34383c","textColor2":"311b13","textColor4":"57453f","textColor1":"050b10","bgColor":"efecec","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bb/1a/db/bb1adbac-5bcc-4a0f-4b12-87b7b23bf4e1/03151955-4e74-47cc-8b3b-4589ee795ae7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"3f3635","textColor2":"3e1f12","textColor4":"573e34","textColor1":"1f1614","bgColor":"bcb8b9","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8a/7c/e9/8a7ce9d5-7ae8-fa48-2aa2-b532a7ebd981/b7540199-9dbc-48f9-9980-2307a9846b74.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4e443f","textColor2":"3c281c","textColor4":"5c4c43","textColor1":"2b1e17","bgColor":"dedcdf","hasP3":false}},"name":"MEGAN","artistName":"Megan Thee Stallion","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/93/1d/8e/931d8ec8-5191-f0df-201b-100731c58cac/075679642554.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363739","textColor2":"321e13","textColor4":"58473e","textColor1":"080a0d","bgColor":"f1edec","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Looking at the stats, you’d think Megan Thee Stallion was on top of the world: “HISS,” the second single from her third studio album, was her first solo chart-topper. But as the silver-tongued Houston native has risen from cult-favorite Instagram freestyler to full-fledged cultural force after breaking through with 2019’s “Hot Girl Summer,” the rapper’s been weighed down by grief and betrayal, all highly public and intensely scrutinized. On 2022’s <i>Traumazine</i>, Megan began to let down her guard and open up about her pain. She teased its follow-up in late 2023 with a statement: “Just as a snake sheds its skin, we must shed our past, over and over again.” On <i>MEGAN</i>, she’s still going through it, but she’s not going down without a fight.\n\nThe motif of the snake, coiled and waiting to strike, winds its way through <i>MEGAN</i>’s 18 tracks with cool, collected menace. “Still going hard with the odds against me,” she spits on “HISS” over an eerie beat from go-to producer LilJuMadeDaBeat. She’s got devastating burns for everybody within earshot on “Rattle,” snapping at an unnamed peer, “Your life must be boring as fuck if you still reminiscing ’bout shit that we did.” (Her claim to be “a motherfuckin’ brat, not a Barbie” on “Figueroa” might clarify its intended target.) There are moments of levity: “Otaku Hot Girl” flexes her arcane anime knowledge, while “Accent” recruits Hot Girl Summer tourmate GloRilla for a country-girl ode to being “thicker than a Popeye’s biscuit.” \n\nBut you get the sense that for Megan, it’s awfully lonely at the top: On “Moody Girl,” she switches her trademark tagline to “real motherfuckin’ sad girl shit.” And over the metalcore guitar chug driving “COBRA,” she tells you how it feels to break down while the world is watching.\n","short":"Meg sheds her skin, spits venom, and shows how it can feel lonely at the top."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/megan/1752024169","playParams":{"id":"1752024169","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0FzWvaeMBfKBCqxHTLVlB8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752024169/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1258989914","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1258989914?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720444456502,"RTCI":0}}},"1752190002":{"id":"1752190002","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752190002?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-06-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fto-sett/1611231975","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"King Crook","artistName":"FTO Sett","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b9/76/7e/b9767e09-c306-75ed-64c5-0cd1059c560d/075679645838.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"cdbdbb","textColor4":"ab9e9c","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"222222","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/king-crook/1752190002","playParams":{"id":"1752190002","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6KPMI0S90Y1MKfiwjCpD4Z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752190002/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1611231975","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1611231975?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720300274520,"RTCI":0}}},"1752549411":{"id":"1752549411","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752549411?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-07-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bayker-blankenship/1700165686","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Younger Years - EP","artistName":"Bayker Blankenship","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a3/34/67/a334677d-e40b-e537-c97e-a87fb082f35e/41827.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b57c5c","textColor2":"df7937","textColor4":"b5632f","textColor1":"df986f","bgColor":"0c0c0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/younger-years-ep/1752549411","playParams":{"id":"1752549411","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752549411/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1700165686","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1700165686?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720233420506,"RTCI":0}}},"1752574102":{"id":"1752574102","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752574102?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chase-matthew/1454254169","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f7/46/1d/f7461da2-de35-a45b-af97-22e5b719ade7/4f37b3d4-e6e1-4f57-95d1-d36f79c9058e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"58544d","textColor2":"31302a","textColor4":"585753","textColor1":"312c23","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false}},"name":"Always Be Mine - EP","artistName":"Chase Matthew","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/72/48/aa/7248aab3-ad47-6cdf-375b-8a7242e16a0e/093624840237.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f2f2f","textColor2":"440504","textColor4":"602d2d","textColor1":"070707","bgColor":"d0d0d0","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Though it’s still early in his career, Chase Matthew is proving to be one of country’s more prolific young artists.

Like earlier outings, the project shows Matthew to be not just after quantity but quality too, as he and a team of producers pull together the many sounds that influence him, like a Sam Hunt-esque, R&B-heavy twang on the title track and poppy, melody-driven songwriting à la Old Dominion on “First.” Other highlights include “Saltwater Cinderella,” a sweeping, midtempo ballad about a love who is like “sunshine when it’s storming,” and closer “How You Been (Letter to the County Line Girl),” a nostalgic recounting of the one that got away.","short":"The prolific rising singer-songwriter doesn’t

With 14 tracks, <i>Metamorphic</i> is far more substantial than most other contemporary K-pop offerings, and it notably eschews the common tactic of adding instrumental, sped-up, and English-language versions of the same tracks to pad out a release. \n\nLooking to expand beyond the “teen fresh” self-descriptor they debuted with in 2020 which defined much of their first three years as a musical group, STAYC makes a declaration of musical evolution with <i>Metamorphic</i>. Rather than leaning into the bouncy brightness of 2023 hits “Teddy Bear” and “Bubble,” STAYC’s first full-length album leaves behind much of the group’s energetic earnestness for something slightly more muted, measured, and mature in its expression of confidence. Nowhere is this more apparent than in lead single “Cheeky Icy Thang.” Reminiscent of the group’s 2022 retro synth hit “RUN2U,” the runway-ready electro beat shuffle launches with a killer hook: “If it’s beauty and the beast, I’m the beast.”\n\nElsewhere on the album, the individual members get a chance to take up more of the spotlight. <i>Metamorphic</i> includes two unit songs—“Find,” featuring main vocalist Sieun, vocalist Seeun, and rapper J, and “Fakin’,” featuring rapper Sumin and vocalist Yoon—as well as a solo track, “Roses,” from vocalist Isa. All the members contributed lyrics for fan song “Stay WITH me.” Eight of <i>Metamorphic</i>’s tracks come from High Up Entertainment’s producer-founders Black Eyed Pilseung, aka B.E.P., who have crafted much of STAYC’s discography thus far. Under B.E.P.’s continued guidance, the album is not a departure from the group’s signature singles, but rather a more textured expression of STAYC’s high-teen homage to classic K-pop sounds.\n","short":"The K-pop girl group trades “teen fresh” earnestness for maturity."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/metamorphic/1752835376","playParams":{"id":"1752835376","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6eTCq3XOz0rVJnelXro3Vk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752835376/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1538881438","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1538881438?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720453795266,"RTCI":0}}},"1752943485":{"id":"1752943485","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752943485?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2024-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/42-dugg/1277595465","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f9/cb/1f/f9cb1fb0-ef00-c29a-770e-61694e84769e/e9f8994b-7b19-426b-9338-2fc85bacd907.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"423b27","textColor2":"2a1e12","textColor4":"483c27","textColor1":"231c11","bgColor":"c0b57e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/64/af/70/64af703c-899d-b629-1b91-143b34d652da/1e2af095-b744-4f05-b8bc-f75a68047c3e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2e383d","textColor2":"1d2428","textColor4":"354044","textColor1":"131a1f","bgColor":"99adb5","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/17/7b/57/177b579b-e7c7-c644-ca3d-7fd781ca3583/e7abe5df-bb98-40fc-8b1a-c68feeda9f5a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"51473a","textColor2":"34271b","textColor4":"584d3f","textColor1":"2a2015","bgColor":"ece3cf","hasP3":false}},"name":"4eva Us Neva Them","artistName":"42 Dugg","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ea/35/2d/ea352dbc-11de-83c0-fe1d-a24eab1a0583/24UMGIM63445.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9cecc","textColor2":"c6edf3","textColor4":"a0c0c3","textColor1":"e5ffff","bgColor":"0b0e03","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Criminal charges and incarceration have thwarted many a rapper’s career. For 42 Dugg, ongoing issues with law enforcement over the years threatened his momentum on more than one occasion, but none worse than the 18 months he spent in a federal penitentiary at the height of his popularity. On his proper album debut, <i>4eva Us Neva Them</i>, the Detroit native finally capitalizes on the mixtapes, singles, and features that propelled him to rap stardom.\n\nThe impact of imprisonment on his point of view is felt early on in this roughly hour-long effort, beginning with the defensively hardened “Win Wit Us.” On “Fresh From the Feds,” fans get a closer look at his ever-defiant attitude as he navigates relatively newfound freedom. Things get personal on the brooding and mournful “Need You,” while “My Mama” lays out life lessons and experiences that inform his enduring survivor’s principles.\n\nEven though the topics can well in dark corners, <i>4eva Us Neva Them</i> is hardly some dour affair. On “N.P.O.,” he turns up with Sexyy Red over a booming beat that reliably supports their respectively explicit lyrics. Though inherently menacing, “Catch 1” accomplishes the aims of his aggressive intentions over a rugged trap instrumental that works in the whip as well as the club. Along the way, he’s also joined by friends and frequent collaborators like EST Gee and Lil Baby, who continue to have his back on “Since When” and “No Love,” respectively. A couple of choice cosigns from more experienced street rappers feel like hip-hop coronations for Dugg as well, particularly when going back and forth with Young Jeezy on the slang-heavy “BMF.”","short":"The Detroit rap star navigates freedom on his proper album debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/4eva-us-neva-them/1752943485","playParams":{"id":"1752943485","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2OzHv0qu65juqIUaCWlq6j"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752943485/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1277595465","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1277595465?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720233944040,"RTCI":0}}},"1753101056":{"id":"1753101056","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753101056?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-06-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/karan-aujla/914892130","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/31/27/5c/31275c21-8331-d85e-dc55-348947117c13/7fcf9106-be25-42fb-87a0-55c8d3398483.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b39e9f","textColor2":"e46c65","textColor4":"ba5756","textColor1":"dac5c1","bgColor":"15061a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2c/c9/20/2cc920e5-397a-2dc9-d106-e01d62fb4662/c40b3eae-19d3-4659-aa23-3fbcac5921a3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9fa0bd","textColor2":"aaa8d2","textColor4":"8887b3","textColor1":"c6c6df","bgColor":"020539","hasP3":false}},"name":"Four Me (Apple Music Edition) - EP","artistName":"Karan Aujla","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c2/ce/a0/c2cea088-dbde-43db-346f-e536058fdcfb/5063483978438_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b38b74","textColor2":"d59a7d","textColor4":"ab7c65","textColor1":"e0ae91","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The last few years have been big for Punjabi singer, rapper, and lyricist Karan Aujla.

Preempting any stagnation, Aujla showcases his signature lyrical prowess and emotional earnestness on four diverse tracks. He brings melodious and lovesick vocals on “IDK HOW” (over a sample of the 1999 Punjabi folk hit “Aaja Sohneya”) before switching to the brooding, trappy punches of “Who They?”. “Antidote” and “Y.D.G.” feel like an extension of Aujla’s upbeat work on <i>Making Memories</i>, groovy and addictive while still grounded. If anything, despite his burgeoning career in recent years, <i>Four Me</i> is a bold reminder that Karan Aujla is only just getting started. \n","short":"His quick wit and innovative melodies take

This month’s edition, curated by Los Angeles producer BAE BAE, is geared toward your next cycling session. “I wanted to make a high-energy blend of different rhythms and genres that could keep cyclists stimulated and ready to undergo shifts in gears and speed,” she tells Apple Music. “It starts with a blend of slow dub and speed garage, then powers up quickly into house, techno, baile funk, and jersey club, which will help them test their speed and strength with increasingly challenging gears.” Among her favorite selections: Cajmere and Dajae’s “Brighter Days (Marco Lys Remix) [ance. Edit],” which she uses to introduce speed and intensity, and Doja Cat’s “URRRGE!!!!!!!!!!” (feat. A$AP Rocky) for a long, grinding, slow-build push. “Its chopped-and-screwed intro [makes it] the perfect heavy trap song for an intense climb up a mountain or hillside,” she says. “It arrives 45 minutes in for a different kind of challenge after a bunch of fast-paced tracks.”","short":"Techno, trap, and baile funk: Let LA’s BAE BAE transform your next ride."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-ride-june-2024-dj-mix/1753344952","playParams":{"id":"1753344952","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753344952/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1541260247","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1541260247?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1719585349005,"RTCI":0}}},"1753350920":{"id":"1753350920","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753350920?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cupcakke/1048655899","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dauntless Manifesto","artistName":"cupcakKe","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/70/a2/32/70a232e1-8135-3c79-af65-74ead71c813f/859790046992_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"e0d9c4","textColor2":"f9efcf","textColor4":"dfcfad","textColor1":"fafdec","bgColor":"794b25","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dauntless-manifesto/1753350920","playParams":{"id":"1753350920","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2g8S9vqA5k6Xb6Yvjldya3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753350920/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1048655899","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1048655899?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232847506,"RTCI":0}}},"1753352305":{"id":"1753352305","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753352305?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dua-lipa/1031397873","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Radical Optimism (Extended)","artistName":"Dua Lipa","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ae/04/47/ae044739-21a9-acac-95d4-edf32cff791e/5021732405807.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"102a35","textColor2":"261d11","textColor4":"1e3934","textColor1":"140a12","bgColor":"00a8c1","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/radical-optimism-extended/1753352305","playParams":{"id":"1753352305","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0XY0qeZ7czMgtb340QJRxK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753352305/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1031397873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1031397873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720131233448,"RTCI":0}}},"1753666913":{"id":"1753666913","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753666913?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-07-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/g-i-dle/1378887586","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/82/48/9d/82489dcb-ac74-eee3-a840-746bcf3b87d1/45a15594-d7d9-42ea-bf59-29a6caabfba3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cdbfce","textColor2":"ecc2dd","textColor4":"cdacc3","textColor1":"eddaea","bgColor":"50545b","hasP3":false}},"name":"I SWAY - EP","artistName":"(G)I-DLE","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3f/43/6f/3f436f02-7e09-96d2-5718-6bd9f71dd972/198704037542_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"cecccb","textColor2":"fffe00","textColor4":"d6cb00","textColor1":"f5ffff","bgColor":"330300","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"Known as a “self-producing” idol group for the active role they play in writing their own songs, (G)I-DLE makes hits that hit a bit different. Seventh mini album <i>I SWAY</i> is no exception. Though the EP is slim at only four tracks, the members were active in writing all of them. Soyeon, the group’s rapper-leader and most prolific producer, oversees lead single “Klaxon,” a summer bop explicitly designed to be played in the car with the windows down: “How about driving in an open car?/Play ‘Wannabe’ by Spice Girls and say okay?” Opening with laughter and horns, the track builds on the execution of its “So hit the klaxon/Hon, hon, hon, hon, hon, honk” hook, bringing the feel-good song to a layered, liberatory climax.\n\n<i>I SWAY</i> is the first (G)I-DLE album that doesn’t have Soyeon credited on multiple songs. Instead, vocalist Minnie led composition on “Bloom,” a dreamy synth-pop love song (“Feelin’ them butterflies/When you look into my eyes/Only you can make me bloom”). And Yuqi, the group’s Chinese dancer and vocalist, penned sentimental pop tracks “Last Forever” and, along with member Miyeon, “Neverland.” While the latter is a fan song (named after the group’s fandom), the former is perhaps better at communicating the group’s commitment to their art, six years after their debut and in the lead-up to contract negotiations: “Stay here/Don't sway, seek dreams/I wanna make my passion last forever.”\n","short":"Four self-written tracks from the girl group that hit a little different."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-sway-ep/1753666913","playParams":{"id":"1753666913","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753666913/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1378887586","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1378887586?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720452939508,"RTCI":0}}},"1753811658":{"id":"1753811658","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753811658?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tiago-pzk/1418625625","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/05/eb/98/05eb98f1-d05d-2fe4-9123-aa42600f0adf/135bfaa1-1317-4892-bc5b-caab03e259aa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a0a7af","textColor2":"d4b4a6","textColor4":"aa9187","textColor1":"c7d0d8","bgColor":"03050a","hasP3":false}},"name":"GOTTI A","artistName":"Tiago PZK","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/37/a7/e3/37a7e3cf-fbc9-0de7-1cd4-2eef8cb97816/5021732411136.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cba189","textColor2":"e0bc9d","textColor4":"be9e84","textColor1":"f1bfa3","bgColor":"34271e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Already a star in his native Argentina, Tiago PZK made the most of his genre-hopping 2022 debut, <i>Portales</i>. With the even more diverse follow-up album <i>GOTTI A</i>, the rapper/singer further adjusts his ambition toward a more global Latin stardom. His broad hip-hop bona fides remain very much intact, particularly when vibing with repeat collaborator Trueno on the popwise “I’m Blessed.” Yet he’s increasingly interested in engaging with other sounds, resulting in balladic moments like “Griselda” to counter the furious wordplay of “Todas Las Estrellas.”\n\nTropical rhythms drive “Adicción” and the Manuel Turizo team-up “De Vuelta,” the latter soaring via its merengue foundation and romantic theme. “Piel” bears a distinctly homegrown cumbia essence, with help from no less than the group Ke Personajes. Elsewhere, he demonstrates a knack for dance-floor fare opposite Anitta and Emilia on “Alegria” and in duo mode with Duki on the thumping “RCP.” All in all, Tiago PZK showcases so much range that there seems no style that he can’t try his hand at going forward.","short":"The Argentine artist takes a more global approach on his latest album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gotti-a/1753811658","playParams":{"id":"1753811658","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3s6jmSUxBLRxzKdevnFmJS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753811658/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1418625625","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1418625625?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720444149916,"RTCI":0}}},"1753847884":{"id":"1753847884","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753847884?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jorge-rivera-herrans/1660193130","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"EPIC: The Thunder Saga (Official Concept Album) - EP","artistName":"Jorge Rivera-Herrans","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/00/6d/67/006d674e-5a41-865e-f1bb-a0597753734a/artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c06d27","textColor2":"e3782c","textColor4":"b76124","textColor1":"ef8730","bgColor":"060503","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/epic-the-thunder-saga-official-concept-album-ep/1753847884","playParams":{"id":"1753847884","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0DsMhU0ERzMt6xvtGpgXvW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753847884/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1660193130","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1660193130?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232544978,"RTCI":0}}},"1753856721":{"id":"1753856721","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753856721?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/olamide/389401008","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e8/fd/5c/e8fd5cf4-013e-2208-61db-ddf162d9f052/Jobf8f48adf-d04e-4a4e-b933-e01f6dc4fc62-170825267-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332575407_1817447358-Time1719444245514.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d3d3d3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1f1f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cece03","textColor2":"d3d3d3","textColor4":"adadad","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/15/8b/13/158b1325-7565-add0-8c44-31402ab018d4/2992922e-637b-471d-a2b3-6934c455b7c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cbacc7","textColor2":"e0c4ea","textColor4":"cbacc7","textColor1":"e0c4ea","bgColor":"774d3d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4a/e2/2f/4ae22fae-6bff-8914-272b-fcab22b03e1c/Job75000ad9-f51c-46d5-8db5-af8affa02896-170825268-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332575406_1817447357-Time1719447465107.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c3c3c3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1f1f"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"aeaeae","textColor2":"c3c3c3","textColor4":"9f9f9f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false}},"name":"Ikigai / 生き甲斐, Vol. 1","artistName":"Olamide","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fe/9e/cc/fe9ecc76-31bc-3187-8ce8-68f01d951d75/197342670760_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"cfcfcf","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"ececec","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Across his previous body of work, hip-hop stalwart Olamide’s sonic explorations borrowed from the different worlds that his street-hop orbits. Tapping everything between Afrobeats, house, and indigenous Nigerian sounds, the rap veteran has conjured genre-bending, space-folding creations. <i>Ikigai / 生き甲斐, Vol. 1</i> subtly treads that path by traversing the richness of sonic cultures, and suggesting synthesis is Olamide's artistic reason for being. The lyricism offers a slick account of his lifestyle across an assortment of sounds. A coalescence of percussion, sitars, harps, and Arabian flutes follows as Baddo spreads his doctrine. “Oh Lord have mercy,” he raps on “Hello Habibi.” “This is how we’re living every day in case you’re guessing.” \n\nThe flow is signature here, melodic yet surefooted and the content hints at the EP’s breadth. It’s in this context that the Asian inflections which tail-end opener “Metaverse” meet the log drums animating “Uptown Disco” (which features Asake and Fireboy DML). Moroccan Algerian vocalist SABRI’s raspy tone accentuates the sensuality of “Knockout,” before a voyage deeper into Arabic terrain occurs on the lavish “Hello Habibi.” On the spiritual “Morowore” Olamide’s croons are abetted by ethereal crowd vocals that eventually yield to electric riffs. Closer “Synchro System” sees Olamide, Lil Kesh, Young John, and Pheelz stage a YBNL alumni reunion.","short":"The street-hop legend explores new territories."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ikigai-%E7%94%9F%E3%81%8D%E7%94%B2%E6%96%90-vol-1/1753856721","playParams":{"id":"1753856721","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4L4439Ev3pC3bRZdmKUCgI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753856721/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"389401008","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/389401008?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720426361886,"RTCI":0}}},"1753991179":{"id":"1753991179","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753991179?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-gotit/1274243358","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Shut the Door, Nobody Listening","artistName":"Lil Gotit","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/0c/57/320c578a-01b5-bed6-a1da-a2a6afeaa069/198622031844_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c9c7","textColor2":"f6000c","textColor4":"c5000a","textColor1":"f5fbf9","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shut-the-door-nobody-listening/1753991179","playParams":{"id":"1753991179","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6QFw2gKbtC5TNwm3AuGms3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753991179/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1274243358","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1274243358?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720399975232,"RTCI":0}}},"1754026486":{"id":"1754026486","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754026486?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-06-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/muyeez/1734992586","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Hat-Trick - EP","artistName":"Muyeez","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2b/6d/13/2b6d1345-a6a8-b144-6302-17c8297f2f82/198704040290_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"3a2c15","textColor2":"160f0a","textColor4":"3e3019","textColor1":"120a04","bgColor":"ddb556","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hat-trick-ep/1754026486","playParams":{"id":"1754026486","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754026486/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1734992586","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1734992586?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720427115150,"RTCI":0}}},"1754032345":{"id":"1754032345","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754032345?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amaarae/1292405220","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play","artistName":"Amaarae","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4f/39/6c/4f396cf1-f2c7-b058-d406-8572aba4a36d/24UMGIM63959.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"83b6c8","textColor2":"5890e2","textColor4":"4b78be","textColor1":"9fddef","bgColor":"15192d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Conforming to the expected has never been Amaarae’s strong suit. And it should come as no surprise that the Ghanaian American artist would create a sonic otherworld where the trappings of R&B, hip-hop, Afropop, punk, and alternative rock mesh with globetrotting instrumentation and exist harmoniously without question on her album <i>Fountain Baby</i>. The result? A culmination of what a transnational pop star is in 2023—boundless.\n\n<i>Fountain Baby</i> lends its credence to Amaarae’s continued quest for growth and mastery, but not in a contrived way. There are pockets of carefully crafted yet carefree melodies like the dreamy “Angels in Tibet” and sultry “Reckless & Sweet.” On “Counterfeit,” the singer-songwriter swiftly glides with confidence on production by KZ Didit that’s reminiscent of an early-2000s movie soundtrack. “Wasted Eyes” opens with a quick koto solo and progresses as Amaarae soliloquises about a wounded romance. The 14-track solo project pushes the ante of its 2020 predecessor, <i>The Angel You Don’t Know</i>, towards newer heights.\n\nThe 2024 deluxe edition, <i>roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play</i>, adds seven new tracks.","short":"Amaarae rounds out her otherworldly album with seven new tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/roses-are-red-tears-are-blue-a-fountain-baby-extended-play/1754032345","playParams":{"id":"1754032345","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7zgIcnbeNavZHeaTuVd6Po"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754032345/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1292405220","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1292405220?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720411222814,"RTCI":0}}},"1754057286":{"id":"1754057286","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754057286?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-tony-official/1540769205","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Taken For Ransom","artistName":"Lil Tony Official","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/32/ac/5a32ac59-356b-61a5-8ead-5534e9a1a0c2/24UMGIM63439.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"373533","textColor2":"352824","textColor4":"594d48","textColor1":"0a0b09","bgColor":"ebe0dc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/taken-for-ransom/1754057286","playParams":{"id":"1754057286","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4WJC3Dre5HIebzmMwDxRRd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754057286/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1540769205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1540769205?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232627384,"RTCI":0}}},"1754412678":{"id":"1754412678","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754412678?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2024-07-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jordan-rakei/705284964","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bd/ce/b5/bdceb56a-7817-2b97-9cbe-068cdc7dbaf3/f911bdc5-e806-4a5f-b73d-f32a2a1007e3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"b1afab","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"baaa9b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d6/02/70/d602701a-5c8c-757d-67fb-837532780325/1395b02e-c704-4dfd-a273-c0206f27e63d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"beac9a","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b6947b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/4a/a6/1e4aa6d6-e00c-5926-5e43-bc95951c0024/920680e2-6abe-4973-881e-caccbf3ea6ff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c1a990","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"aa8f7c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d4/1c/49/d41c495b-ad9b-06e4-01f8-90392cdd4945/ae5b2733-67fe-487f-a78f-6b8e7603fa37.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"bca997","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b7927a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/50/af/71/50af71a7-0bb2-989a-b24a-6af9e85a36a5/8d5d16c4-3c14-4f72-b2ad-bdd2f9a7ffa7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"b5afa2","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b38165","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5e/25/33/5e25330c-9660-1842-c79b-e652db38f98e/c7a98c72-ce54-4336-b9bb-0a7ee8137426.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"c8b6a2","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"bdb595","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/c8/d3/1ec8d33c-2ab9-dc71-bb30-e712341b6efb/4643b371-5f58-43e3-84ef-73fc700efda9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"b09b89","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b1856e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false}},"name":"Apple Music Session: Jordan Rakei -

It was really fun doing it all in my little meditation den.” That day also gave the Aotearoa New Zealand singer-songwriter the chance, finally, to cover a song he’s loved for years: Frank Ocean’s “Swim Good.” “‘Swim Good’ is one of my favorite songs ever,” he says. “It's the first song I ever heard from Frank Ocean—it was such a fresh, new take on R&B. I always sing it around the house, but it’s nice to do an official cover of it.” Here, you can hear him perform the song in, as he puts it, “more of a singer-songwriter way” (“the lyrics are so amazing and I wanted to shed more light on them”), alongside, of course, one of his own songs: “Everything Everything” from 2024 record <i>The Loop</i>. Rakei wanted to do something different to the originally layered, building track for this session. “I aimed to strip it back to its original form, which was just me and the guitar,” he says. “I kept elements like the bassline and some of the piano, but I love hearing it without the groove. It gives the song more of a halftime feel.” Sink in—with or without your own cup of tea—and let Rakei’s delicate, crystalline vocals wash over you.

Stay tuned!”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/summertime-sounds-2024-dj-mix/1754425350","playParams":{"id":"1754425350","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754425350/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"159264092","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/159264092?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720232723866,"RTCI":0}}},"1754472969":{"id":"1754472969","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754472969?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2024-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zach-bryan/1436413980","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/c2/4d/13c24dfb-98d1-1a1d-7d90-6ed3d81f3c5f/ca6c924b-9a26-4303-aee7-9586f8662f70.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"d5d6d5","textColor4":"adafad","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/6f/9f/956f9fa2-e876-f31d-7a78-d01af43fc252/80e0dc92-3143-49b7-9605-884953b931ec.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e2c2b8","textColor2":"facfba","textColor4":"e1b1a0","textColor1":"fae5d9","bgColor":"803937","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/80/e6/b7/80e6b74f-4f81-fc59-5bc2-2a6fcf14e254/f64902bf-f7c0-4bb8-a71f-5e712ed6b138.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d8b5ac","textColor2":"e0cdc1","textColor4":"cfafa4","textColor1":"edd5cb","bgColor":"883530","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Great American Bar Scene","artistName":"Zach Bryan","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2e/14/d4/2e14d494-34c3-d6ee-2189-9710afff7906/093624839996.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"561b1a","textColor2":"430f11","textColor4":"662727","textColor1":"300100","bgColor":"ef8683","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In the 313 days after Zach Bryan released his self-titled fourth album, he scored his first No. 1 single alongside Kacey Musgraves and headlined no fewer than 58 arenas, stadiums, and festivals, further cementing his legend as a self-made megastar whose ascendance looks, at least from the outside, like it’s skipped all the hard parts. And then, on the 314th day, he released <i>The Great American Bar Scene</i>, a 19-track follow-up that dispenses with any questions about his ability to remain almost laughably prolific as he’s learning how to adjust to it all in real time.\n\nLike its immediate predecessor, <i>The Great American Bar Scene</i> opens with a spoken-word soliloquy about good fortune and good morals that burnishes the Oklahoman’s earnest, everybro cred, serving as a mission statement of sorts for the 18 songs that follow—and, really, for Bryan’s whole deal. At only 28, he is a master of nostalgia, bathing the libertine spirit of past generations and 2021 in the same sepia light.\n\nBryan’s grappling with his recent past isn’t just subtext; it’s in the songs. In “Northern Thunder,” a wistful slow-burn ballad characteristic of the album’s overall vibe, he’s still processing a mix of homesickness and shock: “And please don’t ask me how these last years went/Mama, I made a million dollars on accident/I was supposed to die a military man/Chest out too far with a drink in my hand/But I’ve got folks who like hearing me rhyme/I think of thunder under metal roofs all the time.” \n\n“Like Ida” reaffirms his aversion to the Music City machine, even if the feeling isn’t mutual: “When you make it to Nashville you can tell from one hat tilt/That shit just ain’t my scene/I like out-of-tune guitars and taking jokes too far/And my bartenders extra damn mean.” <i>This</i> is Bryan’s great American bar scene: less shout-along rave-ups exhorting you to go out and get drunk than evocative meditations on your inalienable right, and frequent need, to go out and get drunk. \n\nThe title track is a barroom serenade that name-checks Springsteen’s spare, pitch-black <i>Nebraska</i> track “State Trooper”; “Sandpaper” pays off the reference with an appearance by Springsteen himself that plays like a heartland-rock <i>Looper</i>—a weathered elder meeting a younger version of himself who already has seen so much. (It also sounds more than a little like “I’m On Fire.”) And for all of Bryan’s humility, he’s self-aware enough to lean into the romance of his origin story and underdog status, numbers be damned—he is nothing if not an elite storyteller.","short":"Belly up to another round of blue-collar ballads and near-instant nostalgia."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-great-american-bar-scene/1754472969","playParams":{"id":"1754472969","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1U0Z7QjSzlg3gMeUOuUldz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754472969/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436413980","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436413980?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720445528785,"RTCI":0}}},"1754629216":{"id":"1754629216","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754629216?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"releaseDate":"2019-07-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mgk/465954501","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Hotel Diablo: Floor 13 Edition","artistName":"mgk","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/41/39/3f/41393f73-1b9d-def5-3743-5e6ed7c01371/24UMGIM71294.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"adbca5","textColor2":"bdcdba","textColor4":"97ab9c","textColor1":"d7e3c6","bgColor":"022225","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Cleveland rapper bares all on his fourth studio album.","standard":"The cover of Machine Gun Kelly’s <i>Hotel Diablo</i> features the Cleveland MC as a child, hanging upside down with his head cracked open, his innermost thoughts ostensibly falling out for the world to hear.

Across the album, he catalogs a number of anguishes, including the continued and unrelenting jeers of the internet (“Floor 13”), battles with suicidal tendencies (“Glass House”), and what sounds like an extremely strained, if not irreparable, relationship with his own mother (“Burning Memories”).

If Outkast were the original aliens out of the ATL, Ken Carson is a cyborg, reprogramming the city to sound like Young Thug soundtracking <i>Blade Runner</i>.\n\nLyrically, Carson reflects on struggles, successes, anger, heartbreak, trauma, and more. From the song titles alone, it’s clear that <i>A Great Chaos</i> is a deeply personal effort. “Fighting My Demons” and “Paranoid” reflect the bad, but “Rockstar Lifestyle” provides an ample turn-up moment. The album ends with “i need you,” a metallic, bass-heavy ode to true love that finds Carson stripping the window dressing and revealing his rawest self: “Like oxygen, without you, baby girl, I can't
