Love You So F***ing Much","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Glass Animals","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Glass Animals’ 2020 album, <i>Dreamland</i>, and its global sleeper hit, “Heat Waves,” gave the group a level of chart-topping, multi-platinum success most bands can’t even imagine. Yet, having put the record out during the pandemic, that newfound status only served to heighten feelings of alienation for band-leader Dave Bayley. “It was this amazing thing that we never expected, but we couldn’t be part of it,” he says. “It didn’t feel real, so there was this huge sense of detachment. It started this existential crisis.”\n\nTouring the record under strict COVID protocols didn’t help matters, and when the band came off tour, Bayley was struck down with the virus and forced to self-isolate. Alone in a rented house in the LA hills as storms raged across California, however, Bayley looked down on the twinkling lights of Los Angeles and the eureka moment that sparked <i>I Love You so F***ing Much</i> came to him.\n\n“I’d tried to make a space record before but it came out too cold. It didn’t feel human or relatable enough,” he says of his plan to make a grand, sci-fi-sounding album. “Being in that house literally put it in perspective. I looked out and saw all these people walking around, the families and people in the gas stations having an argument. You see these human relationships and how complex and important they are and you realize how powerful those human interactions we have are. Those relationships and those feelings are much bigger than everything else. The little things right in front of you are actually more important.”\n\nThe result is a record that combines the epic scope of Bayley’s sci-fi production visions with some of his most personal songwriting to date. From opener “Show Pony”’s solar-flare reflections on love, through the futuristic claustrophobia of “A Tear in Space (Airlock)” to the gentle landing of final track, “Lost in the Ocean,” <i>I Love You so F***ing Much</i> deftly encapsulates the human condition and our place in the universe. Discover more as Bayley talks us through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“Show Pony”</b>\n“We all build up these ideas of love when we’re growing up, before we even know what love is. We experience it and absorb it and see it and we build this fairytale idea of love and an idea of what relationships should be. You build these ideas of love in your head before you experience it properly. This song is a summary of that blueprint that I would’ve had at a young age—about how I might have perceived love—and put into a short story. It’s almost like a table of contents for the album.”\n\n<b>“whatthehellishappening?”</b>\n“At the time I wrote it, I thought it was about what’s in the lyrics, which is when you find yourself in a situation and you’re just being pulled along for the ride. It’s quite overwhelming, but you find a joy in it. Or maybe you’re trying to convince yourself there’s a joy in it. Then, I realized, after finishing it and getting back to England from America, that actually there’s another angle to it, which is that it’s similar to being thrown into the boot of a car. There’s a parallel there between me being stuck in that house and being in the boot of this car and being helpless. In the lyrics, it touches on how complex that situation is, that that helplessness is actually amazing. You’re not calling the shots and there’s a thrill and an excitement to that. You don’t have to make any decisions. There’s no more responsibility. You can be who you want, say what you want, be completely and utterly open and make any mistakes that you want. You’ve got an excuse because you’ve been kidnapped and shoved into a car.”\n\n<b>“Creatures in Heaven”</b>\n“This song is really personal. I was pushing myself to be tender and vulnerable and just lay it out as nakedly as possible. It’s meant to show that these tiny moments can completely change your life. It can be one second where you didn’t say something and you regret it for the rest of your life and it changes every decision you make in a similar context forever. It’s trying to say how fragile and vulnerable those moments are. It’s an emotional one. For me, it’s a very personal story, but I hope people can relate different instances of their own life to it.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful Nothing”</b>\n“It is about hate as a type of love. It’s a very complex thing. To hate someone you have to love them and to love someone means that you might hate parts of them. They’re strongly linked and strongly attached. I think with that complexity and two-sidedness came a complex arrangement and a very two-sided arrangement that keeps flip-flopping [in the track]. It explores the duality and the two different sides of that. That was the idea, I tried to have a bit of fun with it.”\n\n<b>“A Tear in Space (Airlock)”</b>\n“I wanted it to sound like the air was being sucked out of the song. It’s all about being pushed into the cracks and falling through them and being forgotten. This is super nerdy, but there’s this sidechain compression thing that squeezes everything and it feels like pressure. It can be a really naff production technique that is overused in a lot of modern pop. I had to have a reason to justify it and I think I got away with it because of the context in the lyrics and the story and the song. It emphasizes that side of the lyrics.”\n\n<b>“I Can’t Make You Fall in Love Again”</b>\n“This is probably the rawest moment on the album. I was so uncomfortable with it that I didn’t want to put it on the album for a bit. It reminded me of certain things that are not so nice to think about. It’s about exactly what it says on the tin. It’s quite a blunt title in that respect. It’s about how you can’t fix everything and no matter how hard you might want love to exist somewhere, it’s not really a choice. It’s not up to you. It’s quite a tough realization.”\n\n<b>“How I Learned to Love the Bomb”</b>\n“It’s about realizing that there’s a side to someone that you’ve never really seen before and it comes out and it’s fucking petrifying because it’s dark. You’re just asking yourself this question: Actually, does it excite you? Are you a psychopath for getting a bit of a thrill from it? Are they a bit of a psychopath for hiding this from you? Who’s the psychopath here? We’re all psychopaths. I don’t know if that’s the conclusion, but it is asking the question. On one hand, it is absolutely thrilling, and on the other hand this is dangerous territory, you should fucking run.”\n\n<b>“White Roses”</b>\n“‘I Can’t Make You Fall in Love Again’ is about you being unable to change someone’s mind and ‘White Roses’ is about someone not being able to change <i>your</i> feelings, even though you really want to. You want to give them everything that you can and you want them to be happy and you do love them and you think they’re the best thing in the world, but there’s something inside of you that doesn’t feel it. It’s almost like if the person who ‘I Can’t Make You Fall in Love Again’ is about had written ‘White Roses’ and they’re facing each other.”\n\n<b>“On the Run”</b>\n“There’s a line in it: ‘Thanks for all the fish…’ Douglas Adams and <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i> were a big influence on the record [‘So long, and thanks for all the fish’ is a line from the book and became the title of the fourth novel in the series]. I love that book and I love the old radio show. The soundtrack for that used a lot of the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop magic, and I actually used a lot of the equipment that they used to make sound effects on this album. I bought a few of the synths and these crazy space-age-looking beasts. The whole idea of the sound of the record was to get all this stuff that was used in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s to make futuristic sounds. I’ve got too much of that stuff now and it never works. I spent a lot of time with a soldering iron trying to get things working, but it’s worth it in the end.”\n\n<b>“Lost in the Ocean”</b>\n“It’s the conclusion that we’ve come through all this. The spaceship has literally landed in the ocean. It’s a letter to myself in that way. It’s not necessarily about understanding everything that’s happened, it’s more just saying that it’s all chaos and that’s quite exciting. It’s a good thing to remember that these little things are there and they’ll never go away. They’re always going to ground you and bring you back to earth in the end.”","short":"Dave Bayley on how life influenced GA’s album: “It’s all chaos—that’s exciting.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cd/57/49/cd574928-97af-234b-2099-539262e163ce/24UMGIM27646.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdaea2","textColor2":"d9c7b7","textColor4":"b4a698","textColor1":"e4d2c3","bgColor":"22211f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-love-you-so-f-ing-much/1738435901","playParams":{"id":"1738435901","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5i6LJyHq9wxLSecf0N2Iuw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738435901/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"528928008","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/528928008?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721392516301}}},"1738461195":{"id":"1738461195","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738461195?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1a/62/00/1a6200ab-d061-4381-821f-d4f278d72a5f/a43667db-2dfe-48e4-abde-b6a6951564ee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"424e51","textColor2":"282b31","textColor4":"494f52","textColor1":"1f2930","bgColor":"cde3d6","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e2/8a/0b/e28a0baf-77eb-4647-ed24-94f0e42fdfd5/ace95b13-39ed-4688-94d0-3e85772ddd3e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2f302f","textColor2":"222221","textColor4":"414140","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"bdbebb","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gorgon-city/504531222","name":"Reverie","artistName":"Gorgon City","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"For its fifth album, <i>Reverie</i>, North London dance music duo Gorgon City had a specific vision in mind. Booked to headline Coachella’s iconic indoor club stage, the Yuma tent, for its 2024 edition, Kye Gibbon and Matt Robson-Scott set about crafting a special selection of tracks to play during their slot. “We decided to make a record with the intense vibe of that space in mind,” Gibbon tells Apple Music. “All the tracks had to be primed to deliver a massive, club-room sound.”\n\nSince the release of their debut EP, <i>The Crypt</i>, in 2012, Gibbon and Robson-Scott have crafted a globe-trotting, dance-floor-focused sound that blends thundering basslines with earworm vocal melodies. On <i>Reverie</i>, the duo delivers a darker, amplified version of this sonic signature, traversing everything from growling drum ’n’ bass synths to ’90s acid house and sun-filled soulful breaks—a combination guaranteed to make you move. “When we got to Coachella and played the first masters of the album, it blew the roof off,” Robson-Scott says. “This is instinctual music made to be played loud.” Read on for Gorgon City’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track. \n\n<b>“Are You Feeling It Too?”</b>\nKye Gibbon: “Since we wanted to make <i>Reverie</i> a clubbier album, we decided to experiment more with sampling tracks, rather than our usual process of writing with songwriters and vocalists. On ‘Are You Feeling It Too?’ we sampled the hook of a song by [LA singer-songwriter] syd B [also called ‘Are You Feeling It Too?’], since it felt so euphoric and uplifting, and it perfectly fit our production to create a big club moment.”\n\n<b>“Breathe You In” (with NORTH)</b> \nMatt Robson-Scott: “We collaborated with the songwriter Paul Harris a lot on this album and he brought us a song by the singer NORTH that we were just blown away by. We decided to create a completely new track around their mesmerizing vocal and it was a challenge to honor such an amazing performance in the final edit. When we played it at an Elrow show in Dublin [in March 2024] it connected so well, we knew we had done it justice.”\n\n<b>“All That You Need” (with Caroline Byrne)</b> \nKG: “We wanted to throwback to the older Gorgon City sound on this track and the summery piano house music that was on the scene when we came up in 2012. We had to get back into our old mindset of making music when writing this, and then we added a modern twist with the hard edge of the unexpected drop that really catches audiences off guard. We also love how Caroline’s vocal sounds just like a processed sample.”\n\n<b>“One New Change”</b> \nKG: “This is one of the main tracks made with Coachella in mind. We were experimenting with analog synths like the Moog Sub 37 and trying to make a tune where everything fell into place, rather than overthinking or planning how it would sound. Sometimes, it’s important to not have a plan in the studio because it takes you away from your usual formulas. The song became a beautiful, atmospheric moment at Coachella that really got people going.”\n\n<b>“Biggest Regret” (with Bbyafricka)</b> \nMR-S: “We both grew up on drum ’n’ bass from the ’90s and love the growling synths on those tracks. We had a lot of fun incorporating that sound into this song and, when it came to recording with [US rapper/singer/poet] Bbyafricka in LA, since she hadn’t done much dance music before, her performance came out so interestingly. It helped make it another track where the drop takes people by surprise.”\n\n<b>“How Do You Love?” (with Mougleta)</b> \nKG: “We wrote ‘How Do You Love?’ just after ‘Biggest Regret,’ and we decided this would be a good point in the album to take a step back and add some lightness to make it a proper summer record, something we could play on our Ibiza residency. We loved the tone of Mougleta’s voice, and it was really enjoyable to write a song that counteracts some of the darkness on the rest of the album.”\n\n<b>“Make It Happen” (with DJ Pierre)</b> \nKG: “We’re massive fans of DJ Pierre as a pioneer of acid house and techno. We came across a remix of one of his tracks 10 years ago that really stuck with us. When it came to writing this song, we decided to sample the original and then give it a modern twist by making it more of a big-room sound, as well as adding in an acid feel. This is a huge one to play in the club and it’s an honor to have DJ Pierre’s seal of approval on the record.”\n\n<b>“Landslide” (with Poppy Baskcomb)</b> \nMR-S: “Poppy is an amazing artist we have wanted to work with for years. She came up with this super catchy melody that is emotional without being over the top and we just fell in love with it. It has similar production to our track ‘Voodoo’ from the last album, <i>Salvation</i>, and it was fun to revisit those sounds when we were writing, along with lots of vocal chopping. We’re really happy with the finished result.”\n\n<b>“Keep Your Head Up” (with Harry Romero)</b>\nMR-S: “The analog synth sound on this track reminded us of The Chemical Brothers and made me feel like I was in the middle of a field in Glastonbury! We built the track around that classic feel, along with a sample from a house record that Harry Romero released in the early 2000s [‘Keep Your Head Up’ (as Harry Choo Choo Romero)]. He rerecorded the original vocals for us to deliver a modern take.”\n\n<b>“You Know It”</b> \nKG: “We have worked a lot with the amazing singer and producer Poté in the past and ‘You Know It’ stemmed from a vocal idea he sent us five years ago. It’s been a staple of our DJ sets ever since and, when it came to making <i>Reverie</i>, we realized it would be a perfect fit for the album, so we redesigned it from scratch to make it another big clubby moment on the record.”\n\n<b>“Dreaming”</b> \nMR-S: “It can be a real challenge to keep a track deliberately simple and not overcomplicate things. With ‘Dreaming,’ we wanted to go back to our older sound, which is filled with disco drums and bright, clean instrumentals to match the vibe of the vocals. It comes full circle back to the sound of one of our earliest releases, ‘Real’ [2013], and this was the last track we finished on the album. It’s an ideal, uplifting moment to finish the record on.”","short":"“This is instinctual music to be played loud”: The duo unveils its fifth

JELLY","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"SOFT PLAY","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Across three albums as Slaves during the second half of the 2010s, Kent duo Isaac Holman and Laurie Vincent established themselves as a playful, charismatic arm of UK punk, earning a Mercury nomination, festival headline slots, and the patronage of Mike D, who produced 2016’s <i>Take Control</i>. In a tale as old as rock ’n’ roll, though, their bond dimmed in a fog of miscommunication and weariness. By 2019, the band had been indefinitely decommissioned as they worked on solo projects and contended with personal upheaval, including Vincent losing his partner to cancer in 2020 and Holman living with OCD. However, when Blur sounded them out towards the end of 2022 about a support slot at Wembley the following summer, it catalyzed the gentle steps Holman and Vincent had been taking towards a reunion. Beginning to write together again, they changed their name to SOFT PLAY, having reflected on criticism they’d regularly faced as two white males trading under the name Slaves. \n\nThus <i>HEAVY JELLY</i> arrives as a reset, and it’s the sound of a band revitalized by recovering the joy and love in their friendship. “We’re obviously older and have gone through some shit, and in a way life is totally different now,” Holman told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in May 2024. “But we found the original recipe and it just feels like super fun again. We’re not thinking about anybody else—we’re just enjoying having a laugh together and making some tunes, and it feels like good stuff’s coming out of that.”\n\nNowhere is that more obvious than on “Punk’s Dead.” When they announced their new name on social media in December 2022, it raised anger in some corners of the comments sections, and here, against pummeling riffs, they turn an amusing flamethrower on themselves as well as people whose punk fundamentalism became reactionary foot-stamping. “I don’t like change,” spits Holman, mocking the outrage. “Punk’s dead/Pushing up daisies/Come and get a load of these PC babies.” To pour a bit more fuel on the ire, they then invite Robbie Williams to sing the middle eight while some of their critics read out their Instagram comments to the sound of a crying child. \n\nThis is the duo’s heaviest-sounding record to date, embracing a childhood love of nu metal on “Mirror Muscles,” a tale of feeling intimidated and inadequate in the gym. It’s also their most vulnerable. Holman examines his OCD on “Worms on Tarmac” and “Isaac Is Typing…,” while folk-rock closer “Everything and Nothing” is a heart-grabbing study of grief. However heavy the jelly gets, though, there’s always that playful humor to leaven the taste. Speaking to Lowe about writing “Act Violently”—a profane outburst of excessive rage inspired by the pair almost being knocked over by an e-scooter—Vincent said, “You have to give yourselves permission to write the song, and it was similar back in the day when we wrote [2014 single] ‘Where’s Your Car Debbie?’: You see a wry smile from the other guy and you think, ‘Can we actually get away with this?’ And then, when you’re in a good place—which we weren’t before now—we can give each other permission to write the song.”","short":"The revitalized punks open up on album four: “We found the

Lives","artistName":"Koe Wetzel","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"An “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality works well for some artists, but Koe Wetzel likes to take things apart. On his follow-up to 2022’s <i>Hell Paso</i>, the cult-favorite singer-songwriter finds fresh sounds with a new collaborator, tapping Gabe Simon (Noah Kahan, Zach Bryan) to produce a genre-bending album that’s also his most fun and freewheeling. “There’s different layers to who I am as a musician, as an artist, and I wanted people to see that from this record,” Wetzel says. “So, if they can come away from listening to the entire record, not just picking a couple songs apart and having their idea of it, [but] listening to the whole record and be like, ‘OK, now we get it a little bit more. Maybe he is a decent artist, a decent musician.’”\n\n“Decent” is an understatement, as Wetzel’s deep, rich voice and refreshingly cliché-averse songwriting make for some of the more interesting tunes coming out of the country genre. Highlights on <i>9 Lives</i> include the title track, with its stomping beat and an irresistible chorus hook, as well as “Leigh,” a clever, humorous tip of the hat to a popular variation on women’s names. Guests include HARDY on “Bar Song,” another catchy sing-along sure to become a fan favorite, and up-and-comer Jessie Murph, who lends her swagger to “High Road.” Wetzel includes two covers on the album, both from late artists: the hip-hop wunderkind XXXTENTACION’s “Depression & Obsession,” and beloved country singer-songwriter Keith Gattis’ “Reconsider.” Below, Wetzel breaks down several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Leigh”</b>\n“We had a list of names, probably 30 names, and it was like, ‘This would be really cool to write this song.’ And I think we started off as a joke, and then, once we got kind of into it, we were like, ‘This kind of slaps.’ I was like, ‘People are going to take this the wrong way. These girls are going to take all this stuff the wrong way.’ It was a fun song for us to make. And yeah, it’s kind of a diverse song. It kind of has its ups and downs, but it’s a fun song.”\n\n<b>“High Road” (feat. Jessie Murph)</b>\n“We went back on a past relationship that I had had a while back. And we just deep-dove into every detail of what would happen whenever we’d fight. And I would go back on past experiences of a certain fight or how I would react to it. Sometimes, I would be there. I’d be like, ‘Hey, if we’re going to do it, we’re going to lay it out there. Let’s do it.’ And then other times, I’d be like, ‘You know what? I’m going to let you chill out, and then I’m out of here.’ So, I don’t know. We just went around and around and nailed out all the details. And then this was another song that pretty much wrote itself pretty quick.”\n\n<b>“Reconsider”</b>\nI hope that I did the song justice, but rest in peace to Keith [Gattis] and to Charlie [Robison]. I’m a little upset that I never got to see [Gattis] while he was around. The influence that he had on so many artists in Texas and in Nashville and just country music in general, it’s crazy and it’s beautiful. I sent the song to Wade Bowen, and [Gattis] and Wade were really good friends. He left me a voicemail, and he was like, ‘Dude, I’m happy and I’m sad and I’m crying.’ He was like, ‘Dude, the song, it’s phenomenal. You killed it.’ Hopefully I did the song justice, but I just wanted to throw a little ode to Keith Gattis and Charlie for the record.”\n\n<b>“Bar Song” (feat. HARDY)</b>\n“We’ve always wanted to put together a song. He asked me to be on ‘.30-06’ on his record and I couldn’t—I was trying to finish up mine at the same time, and I couldn’t get it figured out. So, we get ‘Bar Song’ and we’re thinking about people to put on. I was like, ‘I think HARDY is the only real answer for this.’ And so, I hit him up. I was like, ‘Dude, would you be down to throw a verse on here?’ And he went in and did his verse, and it turned out great.”\n\n<b>“Last Outlaw Alive”</b>\n“[An] outlaw, for me, is people who blaze their own trail and [are] not going by the norm, not confined into what people think they should be or what music thinks artists should be, just doing your own thing and not giving a shit what anybody thinks about it. So, if we’re going to use it like that, then there’s a shit ton of outlaws in this genre, and just music in general. But yeah, there’s a lot of them around. I think it’s only, with the way social media and everything’s going right now, I think we’re in for a lot more of them to pop up.”","short":"The singer-songwriter shows his range. “There’s different

golden, luminous hooks. On his sophomore full-length, <i>Kansas Anymore</i>, he sings of love, sometimes, but mostly of love lost. He’s a broken spirit, looking for a way forward, and this angst is perfectly opposed by the sugary sweet deliveries he sprinkles throughout the project.\n\nTake opener “Writing’s on the Wall,” which finds Pillsbury nursing his wounds, unable to explain to his father that his feelings are different from the way his old man felt. “Dad’s on the phone and he’s lecturing me/’Bout a girl that he met when he was 19,” he sings a cappella, before pulsing drums and crunching acoustic guitar chords transport the singer to the rolling hills of Laurel Canyon circa 1970.\n\nOn “Superglue,” Pillsbury finds himself in the middle of a fling turned serious, employing stripped-back instrumentation that allows him plenty of room to outline the narrative stakes. “I can make it complicated,” he

He unites rappers of all different generations on the project, taking cues from the Raider Klan crew he cut his teeth with in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Key Nyata and That Mexican OT represent the new school, while 2 Chainz and Juicy J hold it down for the old heads.\n\nAs is often the case with Curry, the album is full of high-energy bangers, like the Maxo Kream-assisted “SET IT,” which burns and bounces with the half-speed swagger of Maxo’s Houston roots. Employing his now-classic triplet flow, Zel recalls how real the struggle was when he was cutting his teeth in the game: “They always told me more money, more problems/But when I was broke, they gave me shit for less.” On the Armani White-featuring “WISHLIST,” the duo turn in a club anthem, beaming with arena-ready synths and drums that will be perfect for one of Denzel Curry’s rowdy concert mosh

Album","standard":"Jimin returns with his sophomore solo album, <i>MUSE</i>, released while the BTS vocalist and dancer was in mandatory military service. The seven-track check-in is more lighthearted and lyrical than Jimin’s debut. Where <i>FACE</i> was stormy and cathartic, an intentional effort to accept and express the darker feelings evoked by the pandemic, superstardom, and life in general, <i>MUSE</i> hews more closely to a specific, familiar theme: the search for a “good love, real love,” as Jimin calls it on “Rebirth (Intro),” and the inspiration it can bring.\n\nIn lead single “Who,” an energetic, Jon Bellion-produced pop track that lets Jimin’s emotive vocals loose, the artist is on the lookout for love: “We never met but she’s all I see at night/Never met but she’s always on my mind/Wanna give her the world/And so much more/Who is my heart waiting for?” “Who” is the only <i>MUSE</i> track on which Jimin does not have a writing credit, though Ghstloop and Pdogg, two of Jimin’s frequent collaborators, do. Along with Evan, the four songwriters make up the Smeraldo Garden Marching Band, a fictional band named after a fictional flower from BTS lore. The album’s third track, a <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>-inspired song featuring marching-band percussion and a rap from Korean artist Loco, takes its name from the Big Hit production team. \n\n“Be Mine,” with its Spanish guitar and unabashed sensuality (“Movin', comin', lovin', yeah, yeah, yeah/I want you to be mine”), feels like a spiritual successor to Jimin’s 2020 BTS solo track “Filter,” while the lilting R&B tune “Slow Dance” featuring Sofia Carson offers “a warm melody/Relax your mind to that rhythm.” The album comes to a close with “Closer Than This,” a gift to fans released after the singer left for the military in December 2023: “'Cause anytime you want me (I'll be)/Right here where you call me (I'll be)/I could never let you go.” In <i>MUSE</i>, it’s all inspiration. Here, the search for love is not arduous, but whimsical, warm, and occasionally a bop—always a yearning worth singing about.

In July 2024, at Paris’ Pantheon, a troupe of 35 acrobats and 26 dancers performed <i>Möbius Morphosis</i>, a choreographed exploration of the Olympic values of excellence, friendship, and respect, inspired by the natural phenomena of flocking and schooling.\n\nFor his score, composer JB Dunckel, one half of the French pop music duo Air, mixed choir, electronics, and percussion to conjure a panoply of textures and moods. “The ballet itself is highly acrobatic. It’s a constant effort to defy gravity, with dancers soaring into the air and forming pyramids,” Dunckel tells Apple Music Classical. “So, given the highly acrobatic nature of the dance, I aimed to avoid creating a circus-like sound. Instead, I focused on dark, wild rhythms to maintain an intense tempo.”\n\nInspired by the choral works of Eric Whitacre and the brooding soundtracks to the movies <i>Dune</i> and <i>Blade Runner</i>, Dunckel sought to create a contrast between the spirituality of the voices and the visceral sounds of digital percussion. “The choir represents a pure soul, while the percussion symbolizes demons,” he says. “They coexist in our real world, embodying the duality of good and bad, of right versus evil temptations.” Steering clear of a techno or pop aesthetic, Dunckel imagined how ancient drums might have sounded: “The rhythms needed to have a somewhat religious tone,” he says, “but not for something joyful—rather, something dangerous.”\n\nYou can hear that meeting of dark and light in the opening track, “Corps Échangés,” where ethereal voices and primeval rhythms coalesce—contrasting yet complementing one another. The gentler “Ballade de Géants” feels improvisatory in style, its ebb and flow mirroring the ordered chaos of the natural world. Dunckel also draws our attention to “Dieu Léger” with its choral textures accompanied by a catchy keyboard arpeggio played on a PPG Wave 2.2 synthesizer. We end where we began, with “Poids Céleste,” Dunckel’s unique and compelling blend of choir and drums marching on as if into eternity.","short":"JB Dunckel on the “dark, wild rhythms” of his dramatic ballet score."},"artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/38/07/04/380704b9-ec3d-13e1-2ff5-aca8392a35ba/5021732404138.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3500,"textColor3":"272524","textColor2":"2a2521","textColor4":"48433d","textColor1":"000002","bgColor":"c0baae","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/m%C3%B6bius-morphosis/1752210125","playParams":{"id":"1752210125","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6WeIVQbwLRTkwkzDzg5pu7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752210125/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"193502899","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/193502899?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721362484567}}},"1752739357":{"id":"1752739357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752739357?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stray-kids/1304823362","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/05/ce/d4/05ced47d-b2cf-ed48-f037-57cd81d380c1/Job0a655a79-f20b-4740-a482-a9f24a5b5c7e-171353006-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333675510_1826008611-Time1720225376504.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c8c8c8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b3b3b3","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a0a0a0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/83/c1/20/83c12058-c3a4-8e4a-20b8-689ead0ffb0c/3e9fbb61-f0ac-4bcc-96a7-bc03816947b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor2":"262223","textColor4":"413d3f","textColor1":"0f0f0f","bgColor":"ada8ae","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/1e/97/4d/1e974d14-f8aa-c653-4f7f-e529c18deb71/Jobb55d8299-5a27-44e3-8ab4-331d3784d889-171353097-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333675509_1826008612-Time1720230832363.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bcbcbc","textColor2":"cfcfcf","textColor4":"a6a6a6","textColor1":"eaeaea","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fe/ea/0a/feea0abf-d227-dc04-8cff-05de9807fa40/98ac3a09-d507-4950-8d6f-721527827439.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383637","textColor2":"2b2524","textColor4":"453f40","textColor1":"1a1a19","bgColor":"ada8ae","hasP3":false}},"name":"ATE","artistName":"Stray Kids","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"In between world tours and festival-headlining performances, fourth-generation K-pop superstars Stray Kids released their ninth mini album. Titled <i>ATE</i>, a reference to the TikTok-maximized slang that comes from “dominate” and refers to an action done with unqualified style, the eight-track effort takes the theme to heart. Lead single “Chk Chk Boom,” a thumping Latin-pop-inspired hip-hop track, goes characteristically K-pop-hard with its confidence: “I'ma pop, pop, pop, take a shot, yeah/Shoot down my goals one by one, I snipe them.” The eight members are metaphoric giants in anthem “MOUNTAINS” (“Tower over crowds, don’t pause ’cause I’m lovin’ it”), but approach the central theme sonically softer in “Stray Kids,” a sentimental drum-and-bass number reflecting on the group’s ascension since their 2018 debut: “Know that this is who we are/There ain't no last step out, oh, we'll never stop.”\n\nStray Kids’ members—mostly Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han, aka producing subunit 3RACHA— have production credits on every track. Australian rapper Felix helped write the English-language “Runners,” which begins with his husky vocals declaring the group’s energy: “I'm just getting started, yeah, I know/I’m on my way ’cause this is all about me, ’bout me.” As with most pop albums, there’s still room for love songs. The upbeat pop track “I Like It” explores the heady beginnings of love (“I think I’m addicted to the title ‘You & Me’/Don’t ask, ‘What are we?’/Ooh, ooh, I like it, baby”), while the moody Korean-language ballad “twilight” takes on the chilly aftermath (“It cooled down, did the temperature of you and me burn so hot that it turned to ashes?”).\n\nIt’s not all serious, though. Trap-pop track “JJAM” gets deliciously silly with its cross-cultural wordplay, making plenty of English-language jelly jokes (“We stick together day and night, yeah”) while also bringing in the Korean-language slang phrase “노잼,” pronounced similarly to “no jam” and meaning “no fun”: “I got no 잼/You got no 잼/We gotta jam.” At the top of their game as K-pop superstars, Stray Kids refuse to sacrifice their fun: “It’s our playground, it's getting crowded.”","short":"A confident cross-cultural statement from one of K-pop’s biggest groups."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/24/c1/47/24c147fc-cf70-0a4e-3e21-bd9a42617572/8809928952123_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c4c5c6","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"f5f6f8","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ate/1752739357","playParams":{"id":"1752739357","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3WdsoMKRqtw5Sgg67YrpnY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752739357/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1304823362","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1304823362?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721387700901}}},"1752865000":{"id":"1752865000","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752865000?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/summer-salt/496028082","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Electrolytes","artistName":"Summer Salt","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/0e/67/c90e6720-a69d-7713-fc3c-a1f068804184/198588401392.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c3631","textColor2":"13171b","textColor4":"393837","textColor1":"171414","bgColor":"d1bca7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/electrolytes/1752865000","playParams":{"id":"1752865000","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0xG515RDO6i7y3pPOirUag"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752865000/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"496028082","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/496028082?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721362827439}}},"1753091505":{"id":"1753091505","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753091505?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Chamber Music","Orchestral","Cello"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/54/a9/69/54a96914-7838-6180-ac17-cc2903f1d7e5/feaceff1-11bd-4098-b08a-3d3d7a4c6ba7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1f1f1f","textColor2":"050505","textColor4":"1f1f1f","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"898a8a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mischa-maisky/4317514","name":"Mischa Maisky in Verbier (Live)","artistName":"Mischa Maisky","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Nobody could ever accuse Mischa Maisky of being timid or reserved.

The 6th Album","artistName":"NCT 127","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"While NCT 127 debuted as the second subgroup of SM Entertainment’s larger NCT project in 2016, it wasn’t until 2017 that the group would get a breakthrough hit with “Cherry Bomb,” an off-kilter hip-hop banger with a hook that boasts, “I’m the biggest hit on this stage.” Seven years later, and NCT 127’s messaging has evolved from a broad-stroke swagger into something smoother. On the title track off <i>WALK</i>, the group’s sixth album, the raps positively saunter: “I’m creaking creaking/Walk as if your gait is broken/Don’t care ’bout a thang I walk as I feel.” The boom-bap drums and retro guitar riffs are sonically low-key, but the group keeps its signature edge as its members high-key warn: “Ay, get, get out my way…Ay, get, get off my lane.”\n\nThe 11-track LP takes the momentum of a walk as its larger theme, simultaneously encouraging NCT 127’s fans to continue on with them, and making their own commitment to move forward. The choice, especially as it comes after leader TAEYONG became the first to enter mandatory military service, implies a future that is perhaps slower and steadier than what has come before. “All the lines I’ve been spitting out/When will it end?/Orange in Seoul at night/Float my name in the sky,” the group wonders in nostalgic, mooning opener “Intro: Wall to Wall.” The image of a burning urban sky is evoked again in “Orange Seoul,” a jazzy tribute to the city from which NCT 127 gets their longitudinal name. The group is similarly sentimental on “Time Capsule,” a melodic pop song that (along with “Can’t Help Myself,” “Suddenly,” and “Meaning of Love”) gives the group’s vocalists a chance to shine. Still, there’s room for some shameless speed. On electronic trap track “Gas,” members TAEIL, JOHNNY, TAEYONG, YUTA, DOYOUNG, JAEHYUN, JUNGWOO, MARK, and HAECHAN “hit the gas.” Whatever happens next, NCT 127 promises there will be more of the boy band’s unshakable self-assurance: “Welcome to my new age vivid Blu-ray/We gon’ take you higher.”","short":"The veteran K-pop group keeps it moving on its sixth album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/51/84/dc/5184dc48-7416-a86f-d113-f3b997cc6c57/24UMGIM62603.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3cac6","textColor2":"9fcee3","textColor4":"7fa6b6","textColor1":"f3fcf7","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/walk-the-6th-album/1753670978","playParams":{"id":"1753670978","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1iep1fjubMic2G5ItHxwpb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753670978/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1235849306","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1235849306?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721387730589}}},"1753794604":{"id":"1753794604","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753794604?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blxst/1332205635","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/86/8c/4b/868c4b5c-261c-a2a1-3eeb-e1ec90b2e170/Jobc88672a1-06ed-4251-b685-fa32a302b760-171560904-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334089068_1829036758-Time1720590813604.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","bed4e7"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1a1a1a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cdcece","textColor2":"bed4e7","textColor4":"9aacbb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1a1a1a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/18/40/6f/18406f4d-b942-8e71-95c0-712c394b4e45/f2d4a39a-0fe8-4c31-91db-b7c4e8748631.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2af9c","textColor2":"cdc9b5","textColor4":"a8a694","textColor1":"d9d4bf","bgColor":"161b11","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ed/fe/00/edfe0014-b2ef-910e-144f-d59887e471f3/Job5cac31fc-9c24-46cd-92af-09f76520bb8d-171560905-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334089067_1829036759-Time1720593928159.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cecfd2","textColor2":"d1d4d8","textColor4":"aeb0b3","textColor1":"f9fbfe","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/99/de/75/99de75d2-ae29-0c1d-1b45-8717f1e61538/651b10f5-86a0-43d7-8ef3-5b60712572e9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c4ccc6","textColor2":"d9eef0","textColor4":"b8c9cb","textColor1":"e7f1e9","bgColor":"353739","hasP3":false}},"name":"I'll Always Come Find You","artistName":"Blxst","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Conceptually and stylistically speaking, it’s hard to discern why the 20 tracks on LA crooner Blxst’s debut are separated into four distinct acts; <i>I’ll Always Come Find You</i> is synergistic despite these groupings, which is no small feat considering the diverse array of personalities (Anderson .Paak, Becky G, Offset, Fatman Scoop, Ty Dolla $ign) and the jazz savant (hello, Kamasi Washington) whose contributions bolster the project. As program conductor, Blxst delivers a kind of open-format R&B party that features jaunts through the genres of house (“Too Many Friday Nights”), Afrobeats (“Risk Taker”), NOLA bounce (“I Had To”), reggaetón (“Rewind”), neo-soul (“To the Moon”), and dance pop (“I Need Your Love”). The tie that binds is, of course, the same distinctive croak and South Central charm that have made Blxst one of the most in-demand chorus specialists of the 2020s. He’s singing more than choruses here, however—while handling production and orchestration to boot—leaving us to wonder what, if anything, the man <i>can’t</i> do.

While that statement alone could be misconstrued as optimistic, rest assured that the sad sierreño star’s follow-up to his 2022 effort <i>Dañado</i> continues his moody explorations of romantic setbacks and the long tail of heartbreak. \n\nWhile the album offers plenty of what Cornejo’s youthful fanbase desires from him, here he intentionally expands his artistry through this genre he’s been so key in defining. “I think I have grown up a little bit more as an individual and just through experience,” he says, further citing <i>MIRADA</i>’s expanded instrumentation—the majority of which he plays himself. \n\nNestled among these original compositions about irrevocable breakups and perpetual longing is a cover of “Quiero Dormir Cansado.” Made famous by Mexican pop balladeer Emmanuel way back in 1980, it nonetheless feels very much at home within Cornejo’s oft-dour modern repertoire. “A lot of influence comes from sierreño and sad music,” he acknowledges, “but I’d definitely say it's not only sad sierreño.” Read on to learn more about <i>MIRADA</i>—in the artist’s own words.\n\n<b>“Sale Para Ser Feliz”</b>\n“That song actually started on my last tour, the Terapia Tour. It was my second show out of, like, 47 shows. I remember wanting to spice up the intro to my concerts and kind of guiding the <i>musicos</i>, telling them to do this little melody I had in my head. And funny enough, that’s the melody you hear in ‘Sale Para Ser Feliz,’ which is the lead guitar in the beginning. It just felt suspenseful and it fit perfect for the intro.”\n\n<b>“Intercambio Injusto”</b>\n“It’s such a soft and sparkly song. I don’t think I have one like this one yet, and so I’m really excited to just share this. Lyrically, the story of this one is really deep and relatable. My fans tend to be very young, and I remember when I was barely in high school, I was going through my first breakups. I think those are the ones that really torture you. I feel like maybe my music touches them in the way that just makes them feel a bit of comfort.”\n\n<b>“Quiero Dormir Cansado”</b>\n“My parents would play this song a lot when I was seven, eight years old. I just have these vivid memories of when that song would be playing on a Sunday or something and my mom’s cleaning or something. I hadn’t heard it in a while until this year. I felt like I heard it for the first time again. All the classics just grow onto you and you start to understand the lyrics. They hit you more and you relate to it. I wanted to just recreate it with my little twist. These are the songs that make my parents the most proud. It’s a wholesome moment. It’s the one that they’re very excited to hear, and it creates a connection with my parents and me.”\n\n<b>“Mirada”</b>\n“Something about the song just felt euphoric. It felt very happy, but with a twist of darkness with the lyrics. The storyline, too, just really fits with the whole idea of a gaze, of a stare. There’s very Spanish guitar in there, there’s very alternative guitars in there, and it’s all meshed together. When we first recorded it, I did it with an acoustic guitar and then we put an effect on it that made it sound like a classical nylon-string guitar. We were like, <i>We’ve got to do it with the real deal.</i> So we switched it over to the nylon.”\n\n<b>“Atención”</b>\n“I incorporated the corrido trombone and tololoche, which I don’t normally do, but I really wanted to step my feet into that direction, into that world. I love the new sound that’s going around right now, and I wanted to just step my feet into it a little bit. I feel like the song ties in the album a lot, because it has to do so much with falling in love with someone with just a gaze and creating this whole fantasy over eye contact.”\n\n<b>“Dónde Estás”</b>\n“I remember being in the studio just having that gut feeling that it’s going to be a really good song. I knew there was a lot of emotion being put into it, but I was hoping that fans would also feel that, and they did. Every concert I’ve done, they show nothing but love.”","short":"“It’s not only sad sierreño.” The música mexicana star explains his new album."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/93/2d/2f/932d2fab-0679-a185-e8aa-20eba7bb76ff/198704042225_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"bf7034","textColor2":"df7826","textColor4":"b56120","textColor1":"eb8a3f","bgColor":"110808","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mirada-apple-music-edition/1754234421","playParams":{"id":"1754234421","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754234421/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1531646916","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1531646916?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721385481075}}},"1754339021":{"id":"1754339021","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754339021?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["J-Pop","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/10/3e/30/103e30cc-7903-b1a9-305a-47c49f4b28d0/de19d3ff-4d6c-4471-a382-dea70967b6dd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ad9da1","textColor2":"c5b8c0","textColor4":"a1979e","textColor1":"d3bfc5","bgColor":"121215","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/43/0a/b8/430ab8c4-fd56-d800-fb9b-b854e5dd678a/0359a281-5a08-4909-974d-8ce1c446b068.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b0afac","textColor2":"e2bcb9","textColor4":"bea09e","textColor1":"d0ceca","bgColor":"323233","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twice/1203816887","name":"DIVE","artistName":"TWICE","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b4/b0/57/b4b057c4-b500-ebb8-88c6-c2943177d885/5021732417923.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"bb8e8b","textColor2":"d69c98","textColor4":"b18380","textColor1":"e3aaa5","bgColor":"1e1f21","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dive/1754339021","playParams":{"id":"1754339021","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0riep5s1F9ynpobjOSzbcr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754339021/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1203816887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1203816887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721388479232}}},"1754455724":{"id":"1754455724","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754455724?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jt/1590403119","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/fd/59/4e/fd594ec5-e743-746d-ef60-f9641d899615/Jobedaefc8f-a8b2-4cb1-baba-7fdfd2e0117d-171895111-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334837105_1834488429-Time1721073247503.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dcd5db"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"010101"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bfc0c2","textColor2":"dcd5db","textColor4":"b0aaaf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2b/31/19/2b31196b-acfb-c53e-49b5-52b7d58bc22c/3dfea8f9-7cd6-4eca-bd53-622d3ead1e30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"323337","textColor2":"201817","textColor4":"464142","textColor1":"070608","bgColor":"dde4ef","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d5/23/75/d523753e-9777-4ef7-cd05-68d3fac25c69/Jobbbe258fb-58f0-4101-8bec-2b3e353be6bb-171895112-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334837104_1834488428-Time1721074556871.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c6c0d1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"010101"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"a8abae","textColor2":"c6c0d1","textColor4":"9f9ba8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false}},"name":"City Cinderella","artistName":"JT","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"If rap fans know the Miami-hailing duo City Girls for anything, it's women's empowerment anthems, but just because JT and Yung Miami aren’t recording as a group right now doesn’t mean that train has to stop.

/ Hindemith / Mendelssohn","artistName":"Vienna Philharmonic & Riccardo Muti","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Captured live at Vienna’s glorious Musikverein, and exclusive to Apple Music, this concert of three contrasting works brings out the best of the Vienna Philharmonic (VPO)—and in particular from its magnificent brass section.\n\nMozart’s “Haffner” Symphony is repertoire familiar to the VPO. Riccardo Muti takes its first movement a touch slower than usual, which makes the sudden appearance of minor-key clouds in its central section all the more striking. Muti’s care over the work is also evident in the third movement “Menuetto,” in which, following Mozart’s original manuscript, he cuts the usually played final two notes.\n\nThe Mozart proves a surprisingly effective preface for Hindemith’s modernist Konzertmusik, Op. 50. Unusually scored for just brass and strings, it was composed in 1930 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Viennese brass sound magnificent in their punchy delivery of Hindemith’s jazzed-up chorales, while the strings cover themselves in glory in the unexpected lament which appears midway through the second movement.\n\nWith Mendelssohn’s “Reformation” Symphony, the entire orchestra shines, with glowing woodwind complementing both the VPO’s rich string tone and the organ-like brass. It is a difficult work to pull off, but Muti and his musicians reveal both its purposefulness and essential dignity.","short":"Three striking works provide a superb showcase for the Vienna Philharmonic."},"artwork":{"width":3400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7e/39/6a/7e396a87-8a7c-0bae-82e8-7f33b25ee715/5059449184630.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3400,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"372c29","textColor4":"5f5654","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mozart-hindemith-mendelssohn/1755842086","playParams":{"id":"1755842086","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755842086/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2355964","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2355964?l=en-US"},{"id":"322709","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/322709?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721394491691}}},"1756346537":{"id":"1756346537","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756346537?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luhh-dyl/1665750742","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Cart Music","artistName":"Luhh Dyl","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f3/3c/e2/f33ce2c1-457b-b455-56db-3b54d952748d/075679637666.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"efebd9","textColor4":"c2c0b1","textColor1":"fffdfe","bgColor":"0f1410","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cart-music/1756346537","playParams":{"id":"1756346537","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Rvy3JF8Wdte8ClwuQbIdr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756346537/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1665750742","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1665750742?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721384239012}}},"1756603503":{"id":"1756603503","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756603503?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-17","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/fc/9f/2c/fc9f2c38-0077-f54c-c443-16c9167846d5/Joba30dba65-1ba5-498f-984e-881f6ab7d057-171614096-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334200871_1829848415-Time1720647009986.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d6dee9"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b7b5b9","textColor2":"d6dee9","textColor4":"adb4bf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b5/d9/cd/b5d9cd48-fd9d-84cf-b06a-3dd4abab2f87/Jobbc99bc41-a711-43be-b66c-249b20c44a7a-171614367-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_334200870_1829848430-Time1720647846498.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","73b7d0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bbb9c1","textColor2":"73b7d0","textColor4":"5f95ab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/obn-jay/1400254689","name":"Lit Rocket","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"OBN Jay","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/db/a4/b4/dba4b44a-7741-9ec1-4a3e-741e31bcecc1/24315.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7bbbe","textColor2":"7ab2d2","textColor4":"6592ae","textColor1":"e0e5e6","bgColor":"14121f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lit-rocket/1756603503","playParams":{"id":"1756603503","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YoxLtSSLEo9pUGvuEwylj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756603503/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1400254689","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1400254689?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721362503724}}},"1756791932":{"id":"1756791932","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756791932?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deadmau5/78011850","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"some ep - EP","artistName":"deadmau5","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"In the two years since releasing his 2022 single “XYZ,” deadmau5 has been on an extended collaborative streak, teaming up with his protégé Rezz (as REZZMAU5) and releasing an album with fellow North American dance-music superstar Kaskade (as Kx5). The Canadian artist also celebrated his 25th anniversary in music. <i>some ep</i> is a return to solo status and to the classic sounds that have made deadmau5 a singular name. The opening track “Quezacotl” is an exercise in tension-release, as looming waves of enveloping drones and beaming synths crest into his signature progressive-house melodies. \n\n“Sever” leans more eerie, its kick drum rhythm speeding past ominous blaring synths and sidewinding accents, and “Input Output”—a tribute to the late producer and mau5trap affiliate i_o—is a nearly 10-minute odyssey of swelling chord progressions and thundering drops. <i>some ep</i> also revives deadmau5’s techno-centric TESTPILOT alias, which started in 2013 and released one track in 2014. New addition “Wet” is unadulterated warehouse techno, dark, slippery, and squelching as if it were submerging into murky depths.

The malleability of that moniker provided the right fit for his restless creative spirit, via the wry alt-rap adventures of <i>Camp</i> and <i>Because the Internet</i> and subsequently through the gripping P-Funk-meets-BLM expressions of <i>“Awaken, My Love!”</i> Few, if any, artists of his generation could make television as profound and unique as the critically acclaimed <i>Atlanta</i> while also charting Billboard hits as diverse as “Redbone” and “This Is America.”\n\nSo it’s with a certain sadness for his fans across mediums that Glover has declared <i>Bando Stone and the New World</i> the last Childish Gambino album. The ostensible soundtrack to a feature-length movie of the same name, the hour-long project includes snippets of dialogue that hint at the film’s apocalyptic subject matter. Yet even without the benefit of the full visuals, these 17 tracks make for a satisfying swan song that synthesizes what came before with fresher ideas gleaned from the threshold of finality.\n\nFrom the industrial dancehall clatter of “H3@Rt$ W3re M3@Nt T0 F7¥” to the post-EDM edge of “A Place Where Love Goes,” he borrows from the zeitgeist in order to tell a story that’s all his own. That process makes <i>Bando Stone</i> a more rare and diverse effort, merging multiple styles into an oddly cohesive listening experience. “Lithonia” applies soaring guitar and dramatic keys to the single’s self-realizations, while the genuinely sentimental “Real Love” liberally mixes subtly squelching synths with breezy breaks. Elsewhere, he pops out and shows his haters what’s what with the punchline-laden bars of “Talk My Shit,” keeping that same energy on the power-pop bop “Running Around.”\n\nGlover’s personal life understandably bleeds into the mix, marked most poignantly by the presence of his son Legend on the tender duet “Can You Feel Me.” That meaningful guest appearance exists alongside collaborations with other noteworthy guests culled largely from the hip-hop and R&B world, such as Flo Milli, Fousheé, and Yeat. With the help of Amaarae and Jorja Smith, he makes a meaningful case for love on standout cut “In the Night.” ","short":"Donald Glover retires his musical persona with cinematic flair."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3c/d3/37/3cd3376c-55f6-26ea-1dad-5d26b9391a45/196872224030.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9cab2e","textColor2":"beca4c","textColor4":"98a63f","textColor1":"c3d136","bgColor":"00150c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bando-stone-and-the-new-world/1757678472","playParams":{"id":"1757678472","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4yUqNSK6jMi7Y6eWl03U5r"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757678472/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466842536","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466842536?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1721393112487}}},"1757886352":{"id":"1757886352","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757886352?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rich-the-kid/561444659","name":"Life's A Gamble","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Rich The Kid","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Queens rapper Rich The Kid is widely seen as one of rap’s premier voices. Yet on <i>Life’s a Gamble</i>, his fourth album, he approaches the booth as if he’s an upstart rookie. Though features on the project range from Peso Pluma to Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, Rich The Kid raps like he has everything to prove. As the title suggests, all this can go away in a second, and he isn’t willing to take any chances.\n\nThe New York spitter keeps his perspective sharp but still aims for the stars. On the Takeoff-assisted “Warren Buffett,” he grabs inspiration from the Berkshire boss, copping a plane and positioning himself less as a rapper than a CEO of a multifaceted operation. On “How,” which features Jadakiss, Rich showcases his technical chops, going bar for bar with one of the game’s legends. “How I made a million dollars and didn’t go to college?” he asks. The answer? Hard work and, of course, a little bit of gambling.","short":"On his fourth album, the Queens MC raps like he has everything to
