Beginning with 2019’s breakthrough <i>Die a Legend</i>, the Chicago rapper’s first trio of full-length efforts came at a reliably annual pace. Yet even as he racked up successes upon successes, run-ins with law enforcement disrupted his upward trajectory enough to slow his release flow. With <i>HOOD POET</i>, however, he returns to the fore with more life experience and rededicated to spitting about what he knows best.\n\nBefitting the title, he shares unflinching narratives of pain and pleasure on cuts like “Darkside” and the bombastic “God’s Favorite.” He reaffirms his drill-rap integrity with features from G Herbo and Lil Durk, who bring their long-standing street cachet to “No Recruits” and “We Uh Shoot,” respectively. Noticeably more versatile than he was five years prior, he mourns while soaring over the Southside-produced “Barely Holdin’ On.” Switching from hood parables to romantic woes, “Same Me” probes a changing relationship, with Fridayy’s echoey chorus emphasizing the depths of love lost. Later, GloRilla matches his energy on the explicit “Bad Kids” and Future relates to rising above the struggle on “Survival of the Fittest.”","short":"The wait is over.

Holler</i>, the follow-up to the band’s 2022 label debut, <i>Fortune Favors the Bold</i>. The small-town Virginia-bred six-piece recorded the album during a particularly arduous stretch of touring, grabbing pockets of time on off days in various cities to pop into a studio and lay down tracks. You can hear that gritty, live energy across the LP, which the band produced with the help of Stewart Myers (Gomez, Jason Mraz). Standout tracks include “Yearnin’ for You,” a vulnerable account of missing loved ones while out on the road, and the record’s title track, which features an appearance from singer-songwriter Maggie Antone. Another highlight is “Fast Asleep,” which singer/guitarist Isaac Gibson wrote when he was 19 and the band was in its infancy. The song seamlessly fits within the broader record as a testament to their creative development.","short":"The small-town Virginia band channels its Appalachian

Is How Tomorrow Moves","artistName":"beabadoobee","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"There was a time, not so long ago, when things felt relatively simple for Beatrice Laus: She’d write and record songs in her London bedroom, she’d post them online, the world would come to her or it wouldn’t. But it did—very much so. To such an extent and at such a dizzying clip that, still 23 and just two albums into her career, the Up Next alum found herself taking a meeting with Rick Rubin—part mystic, part producer, part institution. “I think we just wanted to meet each other,” she tells Apple Music. “The entire meeting was about life and just catching up. It was almost like a therapy session. I think at the end I was like, ‘Oh, I’ve been making some songs. Do you want to hear them?’”\n\nThose songs became part of <i>This Is How Tomorrow Moves</i>, a lush and supremely confident third full-length that Laus would go on to record with Rubin at Shangri-La, his legendary studio in Malibu—a long way from said London bedroom. It’s an album about self-realization and growing up, written in the aftermath of a breakup, as Laus—fully online and in the public eye, on tour and away from home—came to terms with a life that had become unrecognizable to her. “I really needed music to help me understand what my brain was going through,” she says. “I just had so much to say. I didn’t really think about the way it sounded. You know when you really badly need to go to the toilet? That’s what it felt like: I really badly needed to write a song.”\n\nAt Shangri-La, Rubin encouraged Laus to see and hear what she’d written in its simplest and clearest emotional terms. Though she still takes plenty of inspiration from a wide swath of ’90s alt-rock and pop (“Post,” the Incubus-like “Take a Bite”), she is equally at home here at the center of a spare piano ballad (“Girl Song”) as she is amid the fanfare of an incandescent indie-folk cut (“Ever Seen”). It’s the sound of an artist finding clarity and herself, an artist leveling up. “I think being in a space like Shangri-La, and knowing that you’re making this record with Rick, it definitely kind of kicks you,” she says. “Like, ‘All right, it’s time to shine.’” Read on as Laus takes us inside a few highlights from the album.\n\n<b>“Girl Song”</b>\n“I think you can argue that ‘Girl Song,’ out of all the songs on the record, is the most tragic. I wrote it because I’m still trying to figure that one out, just in terms of growing up and loving myself and the way I look and physical appearance and all that mumbo jumbo. But it sits at number six, just because I just felt like it was perfect. It had to be perfectly in the middle of the record because it didn’t suit the beginning or the end. It was just how I felt at that moment.”\n\n<b>“Beaches”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Beaches’ because of how terrified I was getting into this. I am the sort of person that values feeling comfortable and loyalty and trusting people around me, not changing a lot of things. But I would’ve been an idiot if I had said no [to Rubin]. I remember my boyfriend being like, ‘Are you crazy? You have to go.’ I’m so used to making music back at home, not in a massive, fancy place.”\n\n<b>“The Man Who Left Too Soon”</b>\n“I actually wrote it in LA, in my hotel room. I’ve never really experienced death in family. I always wondered how that felt like. My current boyfriend, unfortunately, lost his dad around his twenties; I really got to see how that would feel like and how that would affect someone. I wanted to write about it so I can understand what that would mean to other people and what that would mean to him and what that would mean to me.”\n\n<b>“This Is How It Went”</b>\n“It makes me so anxious: A very intense thing happened to me, and I needed to write about it. I have to say all this shit.”\n","short":"“It’s time to shine.” Bea seizes the moment with Rick Rubin on LP 3."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/78/fa/f7/78faf7a9-97c0-5aa7-df1e-547da9703178/196922946356_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"2b363b","textColor2":"0d1317","textColor4":"2d3b41","textColor1":"0b0d10","bgColor":"abdcea","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/this-is-how-tomorrow-moves/1741999882","playParams":{"id":"1741999882","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5oT7xqbRbQCevZ0XC5aBFu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741999882/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1307650474","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1307650474?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723197883052,"RTCI":0}}},"1742059761":{"id":"1742059761","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742059761?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dylan-dunlap/366488583","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/6d/22/05/6d22057d-5f76-a9ef-3724-1d23f484b7fc/Job73dd566a-48c1-429d-b975-fe9e0a194d42-166539695-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323756940_1745135764-Time1713478497065.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","0398e3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"030612"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"9cafd0","textColor2":"0398e3","textColor4":"037cbc","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030612","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/82/36/a0/8236a034-73c2-6c83-e9b5-2ee7ab1d7979/ea34ae03-cccb-44ce-845c-6ee300e6bade.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c59f7c","textColor2":"d1b495","textColor4":"a99279","textColor1":"f4c498","bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/77/30/45/77304536-76f7-5d61-fd2a-65a219e45eff/Job62be685e-72f8-4e03-947c-cbaedab34538-166539696-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323756946_1745135862-Time1713482458257.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"9badcd","textColor2":"0ba4e6","textColor4":"0a85bf","textColor1":"c0d5f7","bgColor":"050d25","hasP3":false}},"name":"ANGELENO","artistName":"Dylan Dunlap","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c7/92/5a/c7925a2b-92ee-e0fa-96df-764b1df610fa/196922946851_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"9cafd0","textColor2":"07b8f1","textColor4":"0695c7","textColor1":"c3d7fb","bgColor":"020c23","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/angeleno/1742059761","playParams":{"id":"1742059761","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1yP353aXW3SGxgiHFHxZS2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742059761/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"366488583","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/366488583?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723195550450,"RTCI":0}}},"1742676332":{"id":"1742676332","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742676332?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amy-shark/1083179259","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/ce/0c/01ce0c72-6b0f-62e0-5176-4c4bd43ffe22/2cab54d0-f0ee-406f-9173-65e203c92ba5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"351f31","textColor2":"241824","textColor4":"472a41","textColor1":"0e0910","bgColor":"d074b3","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/5d/2f/be5d2f11-2f05-1b84-4030-2639fd493d3a/82790ff2-a585-4165-9e9a-44dcd88718d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2a1522","textColor2":"030204","textColor4":"2a1523","textColor1":"030203","bgColor":"c6639e","hasP3":false}},"name":"Sunday Sadness","artistName":"Amy Shark","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Amy Shark has long struggled with the quiet of Sundays. “I like to keep busy, and whenever I’m not, memories creep in, and I don’t often like that,” the Australian singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “I started dreading Sundays because it’s like, nothing’s happening. And that’s when you remember and sit with a lot of things. So I just made it a night where I would work on this album and learn to sit with some uncomfortable memories and articulate them right and not be overwhelmed, but just be able to channel them through these songs.”\n\nGiven this creative process, it’s perhaps not surprising that <i>Sunday Sadness</i> is a deeply personal outing, one rich with references to her upbringing (“Beautiful Eyes,” “Our Time Together”), the downsides of fame (“I’m Sorry”), and lost and unrequited love (“Two Friends,” “Babe”), delivered in a clutch of songs that alternate between indie pop (“It’s Nice to Feel This Way Again”) and venom-laced pop punk (“Gone”). “I’m always cherry-picking moments from my life and putting a big magnifying glass on them,” she says. “But with this album I started seeing them as little movies that you watch. It’s like watching a drama, then a romantic comedy, then something that’s really high-energy. I feel like it’s an exciting album to listen to.”\n\nThough the LP was produced predominantly by Dann Hume, Shark also worked with Matt Corby on “Slide Down the Wall” and Grammy-winning producer Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus) on “Loving Me Lover.” Guesting on “My Only Friend” is blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, the final member of the pop-punk trio to work with Shark following bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus’ collaboration on “Psycho” from her 2018 debut <i>Love Monster</i> and drummer Travis Barker’s work on “C’MON” from 2021’s <i>Cry Forever</i>. Here, Shark breaks down each of the “little movies” that make up <i>Sunday Sadness</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Slide Down the Wall”</b>\n“I watched the Lizzo documentary [2022’s <i>Love, Lizzo</i>] on the way to LA, and she was going through a breakup and said, ‘Oh my god, I was so upset, I slid down the wall.’ And I was so taken by that. I rewound it and I wrote it in my notes, and I was like, imagine having that [in a positive] way. Because I’ve been that happy that I’ve got home and been like, ‘Oh, fuck, that was a good night.’”\n\n<b>“It’s Nice to Feel This Way Again”</b>\n“[Producer] Joel Little has this magical black book of incredible music that I’m so lucky he opens up to me. He obviously liked this one, because he showed it to me first. It made me feel like getting up and starting the day, it was just so bright and fresh. I love surprising people, and I thought this song would do that. The first lyric, ‘It’s nice to feel this way again, nice to be inside,’ just feels warm and comforting. And I really wanted the album to open up with a couple of songs [that feel] like you’re being held by someone.”\n\n<b>“Beautiful Eyes”</b>\n“The line ‘open your beautiful eyes’ just flew out of me, and I could have cried. I talk about ex-boyfriends and my mum being really young when she had me, and so many things that are very personal. I think what I was trying to say in that song was, you can have so much shit that happens, but it’s a really beautiful world if you can get past that and surround yourself with people and not be scared to do that, and not be scared to know that you deserve that. It’s OK to want more. It’s OK to search for more and switch it up if you’re not happy. We have one life.”\n\n<b>“Gone”</b>\n“I almost wanted to put it on <i>Cry Forever</i>, but it wasn’t there yet. You’re feeling all this hate for this person, and ‘why did you do this? Why did you let me down? You’re so gone, tell everyone you’re dead to me.’ Even that phrase I think is really cool and it’s gonna be really fun to spit at people live. But then in the bridge it is a bit vulnerable.”\n\n<b>“Can I Shower at Yours”</b>\n“It’s sexy—meeting someone you want to be around and falling for them really fast.”\n\n<b>“Loving Me Lover”</b>\n“[Co-writer and producer] Kid Harpoon knows I play guitar, so we grabbed the acoustic and just started strumming, fiddling around, and found a chord progression. The song came together really quickly. My head was a mess at the time. I was on this crazy trip to LA working with the biggest producers, going to all these wanky parties, but still having my eye on what was happening back home and missing it. That all came out in that song in a really cool, chill way.”\n\n<b>“Two Friends”</b>\n“It’s my favorite topic of all time, turning a friend into someone more than a friend. I might have had some experience a few times over! It’s just such a fun topic to sit back and write about when you’ve got through it—everything’s OK now and you can look back and be like, far out, that was an intense time. But now we’ve got this really cool pop-punk song out of it. That middle eight took me a while to do, just because the song sounded so fire and different for me. I was like, it needs this bridge that can’t be boring. It needs to be different. And it needs to pack a punch.” \n\n<b>“Babe”</b>\n“It’s basically hand in hand with ‘Two Friends,’ but a softer approach to it. I love the riff that I wrote. I’m proud of myself, because I’m not a shredder, but I learned from Tom DeLonge, who will say all the time that he’s not the best guitarist, but he makes up for it by being creative. I worked with [producer and co-writer] Jon Hume, and we wrestled about whether it should be a ballad, because he had some really nice keys on it. I was like, I really miss the guitar. So we made a little mashup and it’s a really nice balance.”\n\n<b>“I’m Sorry”</b>\n“I think it’s a combination of really unloading: unloading on me from younger years, like being a teenager and wanting to be a musician so bad, and spending all my money, spending all my boyfriend’s money. Being so relentless with it and going through some pretty tough times as well, in and out of jobs. Then you finally get signed and it all looks like it’s gonna be a fairy tale. Then there’s so much dark stuff that happens when you make it—it just gets harder. It’s more pressure. When I wrote that song, I was just sitting in my own misery and being like, if I just didn’t write all the songs, if I just didn’t fucking want to do this... What if another life would have suited me? It’s just a song about apologizing to [partner] Shane. I’ve put this guy through hell, and now he manages me and his life’s even more hell!”\n\n<b>“My Only Friend” (feat. Tom DeLonge)</b>\n“I just sent Tom the song, it was really easy. And he really liked the verse I had. I gave him the option—I said, ‘Hey, feel free if you want to add anything.’ Some artists are funny about it, they really want to have their ideas in there. But I was kind of proud of myself, and it kind of made him look like a real pro as well, that he didn’t really feel like he needed to do that. He listened to it and was like, ‘I really like what you’ve written, so I’d like to just sing that.’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah! That will really suit your voice too.’ So he made it really easy.”\n\n<b>“Our Time Together”</b>\n“I like leaving an album very emotionally charged. It’s just a real walk through my life and things that meant a lot to me.

approaches, evoking fellow Brisbane band Regurgitator’s channel-surfing 1997 classic <i>Unit</i>. Gurge’s <i>Unit</i> opener, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff,” is also echoed in this album’s opening quip about how Dune Rats’ recent releases suck—kicking off the title track’s triumphant sing-along. As always with Dune Rats, these songs are equal parts bratty and catchy, balancing cheeky self-amusement with easy hooks and big vocal harmonies. The mocking commentary of “High Roller Selling Dope” and “Rich Kid Rehab” harks back to the beachy pop punk the band does so well. Other tracks follow through on their mission to mix things up more. “Solar Eyes” detours into softly strummed indie pop more akin to DMA’S before “Cheapskate” flashes back to 1990s radio catnip like Smash Mouth and New Radicals, reminding us just how malleable Dune Rats’ self-aware bubblegum is. Meanwhile, the party-friendly vibe stoked by singer/guitarist Danny Beus, bassist Brett Jansch, and drummer BC Michaels is very much confirmed on closing track, “Beers, Bongs & Bullshit.” Leading one more sing-along, Beus celebrates simply sitting around and doing nothing much at the end of a long day: “I want beers, bongs and bullshit with my friends/And you’re my friend.”","short":"Brisbane’s

Langley","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Hangovers aren’t just for booze. On her debut full-length album, Alabama artist Ella Langley explores the kinds of emotional aftermaths that leave behind heartache, not headaches. The record opens with its title track, a soulful and somber account of learning lessons in love the hard way. Fan favorite “nicotine” likens a lover she “want[s] but just don’t need” to the irresistible allure of a cigarette fix. Riley Green joins Langley on the hit duet “you look like you love me,” an old-school honky-tonk jam. Another standout is “paint the town blue,” a clever subversion of a country trope: Finding no solace in painting the town red in the wake of a breakup, Langley opts to “fall to pieces” (one of several classic country references on the record) and indulge her broken heart. Langley wraps the project with acoustic versions of two other new songs, “cowgirl don’t cry” and “broken in.” ","short":"The Alabama singer-songwriter tackles the pain aspirin and water can’t fix."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/62/33/40/62334080-6129-4d0c-086b-921cc956cb7a/196872090895.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"beaca0","textColor2":"e08861","textColor4":"b67050","textColor1":"e9d4c4","bgColor":"100e0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hungover/1749121114","playParams":{"id":"1749121114","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Fzx4iNVKLcCo7x1yP5q9N"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749121114/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1384373733","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1384373733?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723197988586,"RTCI":0}}},"1749379116":{"id":"1749379116","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749379116?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/orville-peck/1319633580","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a2/9a/a5/a29aa508-5d20-9cf6-5f5f-0739cadccd87/Job8c229d46-ada4-4621-8279-c634ad0aa629-169117596-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329068067_1787601082-Time1717117364012.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cee0ef"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"222025"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c0c6cb","textColor2":"cee0ef","textColor4":"acb9c6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"222025","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/22/28/c9/2228c9bc-20e1-0e0a-44ec-b3f6a474b8e0/4d6353ad-0e41-4f3a-8ba6-fad49168843e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbc2b3","textColor2":"aac9dd","textColor4":"94acb8","textColor1":"dbe4d6","bgColor":"3a3827","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6a/70/35/6a703550-cb0d-0f14-7b8c-4d74dce836d6/Job48e50183-054b-4d5d-b708-534b329e9303-169117595-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329068056_1787601084-Time1717116462436.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"35343a","textColor2":"302a28","textColor4":"4e4c4d","textColor1":"120c11","bgColor":"c4d3df","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/68/59/52/6859523b-f1aa-197d-7917-6bf3906f0b07/79b59100-0ab0-4f02-9fc2-0244bec9679f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d6d2d1","textColor2":"efcdc4","textColor4":"d0b6b1","textColor1":"f6f0ed","bgColor":"565a64","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/08/70/ff/0870ffc0-bcf5-687a-d42f-f8d42a979c97/48cdf834-ace6-4263-ab85-3677f61a4e4d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfc3c9","textColor2":"c2c5cc","textColor4":"a4a8b0","textColor1":"e4e7eb","bgColor":"2d3241","hasP3":false}},"name":"Stampede","artistName":"Orville Peck","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Orville Peck rounds up more than a few of his most talented friends on <i>Stampede</i>, a collaborative collection with one hell of a guest list. The enigmatic, masked country singer opens the record with a Willie Nelson-assisted cover of Ned Sublette’s clever, queer 1981 song “Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other,” which Nelson famously recorded in 2006. Elton John joins Peck for a spirited take on the former’s 1973 hit “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),” with Peck’s Roy Orbison-esque croon a dramatic counterpoint to John’s masterful belt. Peck and Allison Russell make formidable partners on “Chemical Sunset,” with a loose, jazzy arrangement that’s one of the project’s better grooves.\n\nBluegrass virtuoso Molly Tuttle and her band Golden Highway get things loose and rootsy on “Papa Was a Rodeo,” a cover of the winking Magnetic Fields song off the band’s seminal <i>69 Love Songs</i>. Margo Price assists Peck on the impeccably titled “You’re an Asshole, I Can’t Stand You (And I Want a Divorce),” an original song that manages to be both funny and wrenching. And Peck closes the project with an extra-special cover of Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy,” performing the song with three other out, gay country artists: TJ Osborne, Fancy Hagood, and Waylon Payne.","short":"The masked singer duets with Willie, Elton, Margo, Beck, and more."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/74/e5/a074e530-0afb-aaae-462b-0f4ac246ef70/093624844136.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343132","textColor2":"29221f","textColor4":"494442","textColor1":"0f0b0b","bgColor":"cacacc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stampede/1749379116","playParams":{"id":"1749379116","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3vi7hLbbjQBJypfAA2gafE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749379116/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1319633580","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1319633580?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723198132701,"RTCI":0}}},"1749609176":{"id":"1749609176","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749609176?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/elijah-blake/541773549","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c8/07/87/c8078763-156c-1d06-21da-38929ff73ac7/Jobff912349-2823-43d1-8def-1ec45838008d-171338418-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333648521_1825813894-Time1720204451239.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","da945b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"291f17"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c39c4f","textColor2":"da945b","textColor4":"b27a4c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"291f17","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1b/7b/1a/1b7b1a00-8192-2a42-ea12-c47793da964e/9a7244b9-ec3d-4cd4-9ad2-c8c4b3faf71f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"beb0a2","textColor2":"d1bea8","textColor4":"a89987","textColor1":"eddbca","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/f6/f2/a4f6f254-753f-83da-2cb4-1d7c8ab81cde/Jobf3ea4bb6-a19e-43cd-8eb4-f94aa7078b0e-171338419-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333648520_1825813895-Time1720208227392.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cac9c9","textColor2":"e7a264","textColor4":"bd8553","textColor1":"f8f6f7","bgColor":"141511","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/f3/08/d0f30870-3be4-7a58-5b67-a7c1f7da8fff/2f725fd6-066b-4156-9944-86dd2d9138bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d59e78","textColor2":"f9af72","textColor4":"d69665","textColor1":"f8b989","bgColor":"4b3531","hasP3":false}},"name":"Elijah.","artistName":"Elijah Blake","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Elijah Blake’s illustrious career in the music industry started when he was a teenager, penning hits for Rihanna and Keyshia Cole, and most notably USHER’s 2012 track “Climax.” While songwriting and producing music, Blake was still an artist in his own right, releasing numerous EPs and albums.

The Georgia-born singer-songwriter first pursued football, playing nose tackle for Georgia Southern University before hanging up his helmet after a serious knee injury in 2021. While recovering, Adcock began writing and recording country music—something he’d dabbled in during high school—and soon decided to chase this new dream full time. <i>Actin’ Up Again</i> marks Adcock’s first partnership with a major label, the record licensed to Warner Music Nashville via his own Thrivin Here Records. The album opens with its title track, a southern-fried power ballad about moving on after a difficult breakup, with some profane well-wishes (“I raised my glass up and said, ‘Fuck you’”) thrown in for good measure. “Sober” is one of Adcock’s more vulnerable moments, as he admits he “might even cry” thinking of an ex-lover with someone else. And fan favorite and viral hit “A Cigarette,” with its somber pedal steel and raw, gritty arrangement, shows another flavor of heartbreak from Adcock, who cuts his hurt with gratitude: “I thank the

Still, they’d be justified in having mixed emotions over the auspicious arrival of <i>Ultra 85</i>, an epic project some seven years in the making, and one that he’d previously insinuated would be his last as a rapper. Either way, this veritable hip-hop space opera returns to the intergalactic interplay of 2015’s <i>The Incredible True Story</i> with skits and narrative segues pushing the entertaining story of Kai and Thomas along.\n\nWhile his devotees will exhaustively pore over the fresh lore, lyrical rap listeners don’t need to get bogged down in background to appreciate what the preternaturally gifted MC does on the mic for “Ghost in the Machine” and the Gucci Mane-nodding “Mission Control.” A continuation of his interior explorations, “Innerstellar” wrestles with concerns existential and emotional, with hope-filled encouragement and mindfulness over a jazzy beat by 6ix, his longtime production cohort. His earnestness remains core to his charm, proving as sincere and genuine as he is simply dope on “Peace Love & Positivity” and the West Coast-inflected “Teleport.”","short":"The rapper zooms through the cosmos on this hip-hop space opera."},"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b3/15/26/b315265f-37c6-6dab-5f25-d4f25b9ad34b/4099964032628.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"c5d3db","textColor2":"fabf8e","textColor4":"d5ac8c","textColor1":"e7eff1","bgColor":"406184","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ultra-85/1750765140","playParams":{"id":"1750765140","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6vVOpqIXPbM9vZWzesdTax"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750765140/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"30865945","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/30865945?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723188088678,"RTCI":0}}},"1750786165":{"id":"1750786165","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750786165?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tones-and-i/1488123516","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3f/77/7d/3f777d80-16a6-98de-d6e8-25868f2006dc/Job8553f987-6ab1-41a8-aa42-1b77357ae36b-172795079-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336765810_1848524139-Time1722374635320.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","181a19"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"90533d"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"312c29","textColor2":"181a19","textColor4":"36332f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"90533d","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/28/08/ca/2808ca54-dc99-c97f-d116-113260c8647d/7635b836-36db-4fe0-8e27-4fa31857784b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b2415","textColor2":"3a0b08","textColor4":"5e2919","textColor1":"0f0503","bgColor":"eea15f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f5/59/6c/f5596ca0-0fbe-2f2a-da47-745231714b65/Job292e299b-d682-4a7c-bee4-621e0c0fc835-172795078-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336765811_1848524138-Time1722373481670.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"dfd0b6","textColor2":"e6d6d8","textColor4":"cfbfbd","textColor1":"faebcf","bgColor":"726350","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c6/89/4c/c6894c58-c1eb-645e-4a0d-d2cb273aeb35/dc37057b-5046-4e2a-bc43-2e3d107fe86c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2725","textColor2":"090807","textColor4":"2b2826","textColor1":"0c0706","bgColor":"b4a9a3","hasP3":false}},"name":"Beautifully Ordinary","artistName":"Tones And I","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I knew I wanted to be vulnerable in this album,” Toni Watson—aka Australian singer-songwriter Tones And I—tells Apple Music. That much becomes clear a few seconds into the devastatingly raw opener “To Be Loved.” With piano and strings swelling around her, Watson offers a heartfelt apology to her sister and brother, before one of an altogether more confronting nature: “And to the guy that hit me, I’m so sorry that I stayed/But I wanted to be loved, but to me that love was pain/I let you break me down so I could build me up again.”\n\nSuch honesty is indicative of a record on which Watson was committed to digging deeper emotionally and musically than ever before. “The last album [2021’s <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i>] I’m not really happy with at all, I wanted to change so much,” she says. “I don’t want to regret this one like I regret the last one. The production was lazy. It was just lazy work. I wasn’t honest and vulnerable about myself, I [just] wrote poppy melodies. As a composer I really wanted to create an album that had more depth to it.”\n\nWhile <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i> came together in a matter of months, <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i> was written in and around touring cycles over a period of a year and a half. Determined to display her versatility, Watson sings in a lower register on the soulful, rootsy “Raise Me Up” and fragile “Lose Someone Like Me,” while musically she oscillates between emotive ballads, attitude-laden indie (“You Don’t Know Me Like That”), and all-out pop (“Call My Name,” co-written with Drake and BTS collaborator Jenna Andrews). The intensely personal family tale “Sorrento,” meanwhile, marks her as a formidable storyteller with a keen eye for detail. The album takes its name from a song Watson deemed unsuitable for the record, though its title resonated with her goals around being vulnerable and open. “I think you can see the beautiful in the ordinary, and I think all of us feel ordinary,” she explains. Here, Watson walks us through <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“To Be Loved”</b>\n“I brought things up that I’ve never brought up before. I think that’s me opening myself up to keep growing. But genuinely, I gave in that song as much as I could; I probably couldn’t go into much more detail comfortably. I think I need to slowly start edging towards opening up more, and this is kind of my first step into that ocean.”\n\n<b>“Lose Someone Like Me”</b>\n“It’s the biggest heartbreak that a young girl could have, which is with my best friend. It’s still raw. Even though it’s been a few years, I haven’t been able to write about it. And that’s why I almost didn’t release this song. And I know this person will know who it’s about. And this will be my version of reaching out. It’s important that I put it out there so I can move on.”\n\n<b>“I Get High”</b>\n“‘I Get High’ is about those best friends that you have, and you’re not old enough to go to clubs yet, but you get in cars with older boys at night, you sneak out, or you drink in the park, and you get up to mischief. Our feelings are so heightened at that age. As we get older, we have to subdue our emotions a lot more. There are great friendships when you’re that young and you share so much and go through so much together. I really wanted to touch on that.”\n\n<b>“We’ll See Stars”</b>\n“I wanted it to be about giving my sister one night of no worries. I just want her to be happy, and that flows into ‘Wonderful’ as well. This one’s about ‘let’s go out for the night, put all your worries aside, let’s have a sister night. I want you to experience life to its fullest and I want you to let go and have a good time.’ I picture my sister running around the city at night just having a good time.”\n\n<b>“Dance With Me”</b>\n“I wanted this song to feel bassy and ’80s, kind of giving a vibe of Robyn’s ‘Call Your Girlfriend’ or ‘Dancing on My Own.’ But even though sonically you’re moving to it, you’re dancing to it, the lyrics are sad. And I love that. The song doesn’t mean you’re physically dancing. Whatever the thing that you and your partner used to do when you were at your happiest moment, I’m sitting here in that spot waiting for you to come back to me, but you’re nowhere to be seen. So I’m just here on my own.”\n\n<b>“Figure It Out”</b>\n“This is the first track I wrote for the album. I wanted time to grow. I think everyone needs time to grow. People think that your first or biggest thing is just who you are now, and that’s such a defining factor of everything. But I think it’s important that everyone gets that opportunity to grow, and I think I’m asking for it in that chorus.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful”</b>\n“It’s about my sister, or it could be my best friend. There’s times where they’re at their lowest, and you just want to give them your perspective so that they could see how much potential they have, even though their brain isn’t letting them see that. It’s just about trying to help them at their worst.”\n\n<b>“Raise Me Up”</b>\n“Another song about desperation in a relationship, just wanting to be seen and heard. The song is about needing help and asking for it.”\n\n<b>“Dreaming”</b>\n“‘Dreaming’ could be about a friendship or love. For me it’s both. [It’s saying] I don’t know if it’s all in my head, but I think we’re growing apart. It goes into detail in the verses, but then it goes back to ‘but is it all in my head?’ So not really knowing.”\n\n<b>“You Don’t Know Me Like That”</b>\n“This is about a stalker. I have this stalker that comes to my house, leaves random stuff. I’ve got this massive thing they wrote me. I didn’t ever mean to talk about this. But my friend that I wrote it with, we just loved it so much. It’s got a nice vibe to it. But ultimately, it’s about trying to get rid of a stalker.”\n\n<b>“John Doe”</b>\n“‘John Doe’ is about someone that you meet and you have that instant connection, but you don’t want to say anything or do anything. It’s about wanting to go to that person and know more about them and see if there’s something there but [you’re] a bit hesitant.”\n\n<b>“Sorrento”</b>\n“David is my papa. A year before he passed I said, ‘For my wedding present I would love for you to write me your life story.’ And he wrote that for me. I just thought I’d share a little memory of him, and now it will be there forever.”\n\n<b>“Need You to Love Me”</b>\n“It starts a bit more vulnerable. It starts like you’re right there, I’m right there in front of you, singing about a relationship and the struggles of that. And then it turns into a little bit more of an upbeat kind of [song]. This album is the only time I’ve ever written about love. It’s really also about the struggles in relationships. It’s almost like I’m trying to convince myself, ‘Do I deserve better?’ Which is so vulnerable to say.”\n\n<b>“Only One”</b>\n“I was going through such a hard time when I wrote this song—serious heartbreak. And I couldn’t write anything. I was just so sad. I wanted to be so angry, but the chorus is [saying], ‘I still think that you’re the one for me.’ Which is the head fuck about it. ‘I have so much love for you, this is so hard.’”\n\n<b>“Live Without Your Love”</b>\n“This one was written a long time ago. This is about my friend; she is so happy. I realized the friendship that she gives me is so important. It helps me become a better person; it helps me see the brighter sides. If I was running around with another pessimist, then I would be doubling down on myself. And so it ended up being ‘we’re never going to be the same person, but I love you for that. And I can’t live without your love.’”\n\n<b>“Call My Name”</b>\n“I realized I had a lot of vulnerability in the album. So I wanted to have that more four-to-the-floor moment, just to showcase that a little bit more. I haven’t got a big, long story about the lyrics; it’s two professional songwriters [Watson and Jenna Andrews] in a room writing a pop song.

So it makes sense that Melbourne psych ensemble King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard set aside their usual album-corralling concepts this time to just capture six mates playing together in a room. More than that, leader Stu Mackenzie encouraged a pass-the-mic approach that sees every band member sing, including the vocal debut of drummer Michael Cavanagh on “Le Risque.” Fun little improvisations make the round-robin vibe feel all the more spontaneous—check out the scat section at the end of “Rats in the Sky”—as does each song launching into the next with no space in between. \n\nMusically, this material is more jaunty than heavy: Even when “Hog Calling Contest” shows off the band’s signature hairpin shifts, it’s in the service of a rustic romp. Equally rootsy is opener “Mirage City,” whose communal harmonies and twang evoke The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers alike. Yet, darker themes lurk behind the band’s sunny exterior, as that first track finds solidarity in escapism via lyrics about parents fighting at home and being desperate to “leave this nightmare behind.” The closing “Daily Blues” similarly offsets its harmonica-licked roadhouse flair with the ominous refrain “Gettin’ fucked up daily.” Just because King Gizz is doubling down on camaraderie doesn’t mean Mackenzie and co can’t air their troubles for each other. In fact, isn’t that the essence of friendship?","short":"A jaunty, often rootsy ode to finding solidarity in

this five-pack of songs. Joined by Julia Michaels, Morris pleads for a break from “put[ting] a hell of a show on” in favor of crying it out and taking a breather. A need for peace is a loose theme on this EP, which comes in the wake of Morris’ split from husband and fellow country artist Ryan Hurd. On “i hope i never fall in love,” she swears off romance entirely, asserting that “forever was a fuckin’ lie” with a deceptively pretty melody. “push me over” brings poppy, Ariana Grande-esque production and also turns up the heat as Morris asks a lover to “come closer.” The track seems to nod to her bisexuality, as she references “perfume” and a new kind of experience: “Don’t know what it is, but I like the flavor.” On “because, of course,” Morris shows her loyalty, reassuring with promises to be “a place to land” when the going gets tough.

Khalid’s unfiltered lyricism and earnest portrayal of adolescent frustrations and anxieties resonated with many and propelled him to stardom. At 21, he released <i>Free Spirit</i>, a soulful meditation that saw the singer-songwriter shedding the naivety of his teenage years and marking his first step into adulthood. Half a decade after <i>Free Spirit</i>, Khalid is back and better than ever and ready to show his fans his growth with the release of his third studio LP, <i>Sincere</i>. “I needed to take that break,” he tells Apple Music. “I needed to stop. And I don’t look at it in a place of being afraid to come back. If I’m going to take this break, when I come back, I’ll come back with more clarity. I’ll come back with a better choice of decisions, more maturity, more knowledge.”\n\nOn <i>Sincere</i>, Khalid proudly shows off that new knowledge, drawing inspiration from life experiences over five years and showcasing his evolution not only as an artist but as a person as well. “It was a very difficult process in naming this album, because I had to find one that summed up what I really felt in this music,” he says. “I thought of it as my most vulnerable in a while, because when I’m thinking of these songs, I’m saving them over the year like, ‘Okay, no, I have to keep this.’ And that’s vulnerable because I’ve known the songs’ impact on me when I was in the studio. I believe that if I trust my intention and I trust my heart, then it’ll have a similar impact to my listener.”\n\nThroughout the album’s 16 tracks, Khalid shares intimate vignettes about the lessons he’s learned, whether it’s about heartbreak (“It’s All Good,” “Broken,” “Tainted”), loneliness (“Who’s There to Pick Me Up,” “Decline”), or falling in love (“Adore U,” “Altitude”). However, not every song on the project is about love lost: Khalid is introspective on the soul-searching and dreamy track “Ground,” where he details his experience with psychedelics due to feeling uncertain within his career. On the Arlo Parks duet “Breathe,” Khalid is transparent as he yearns for freedom from the darkness of his mind. “When I listen to this album, you can see the time that it took,” he says. “You can see the time.”\n","short":"On his third album, the singer-songwriter showcases his

Balvin","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“When I'm telling you I have three albums ready, they're ready,” J Balvin tells Apple Music. “Maybe I’ll go crazy and start dropping a new song every Thursday.” The Colombian superstar’s claims of a surplus of some 200 songs make sense, especially given how little music he’s shared with the world in recent years. After paving a path for the next generation of reggaetoneros with his explosive mid-2010s albums <i>Energía</i> and <i>Vibras</i>, not to mention the artful <i>Colores</i> in 2020, his activity noticeably decreased following 2021’s personal yet poppy <i>JOSE</i>.\n\nOf course, he’d hardly vanished from the scene, dropping singles and features with everyone from Maluma and Ryan Castro to Imagine Dragons and USHER. Yet after keeping up an exhaustive schedule for the better part of a decade, his relative absence on the release front and principled retreat from social media suggested a greater focus on family and fatherhood, along with a publicly stated commitment to his mental health. “You will never see me blasting someone on IG,” he says, citing his young son as a reason for avoiding the negative gossip and tiraera bait common in the genre. “I just respect you or I don't respect you, but that's personal.”\n\nThree years after his last album, <i>Rayo</i> represents Balvin the way he sees himself right now. Clearly disinterested in resigning himself to legacy status, he devotes himself once more to music with a keen interest in the contemporary coupled with deep reverence for what came before. To this end, he reunites with some of the producers from across his discography, from hitmaking mainstays like Sky Rompiendo (“I wouldn't be J Balvin without Sky,” he quips) to still-rising talents like fellow Colombian L.E.X.V.Z. Even as he links with ascendant artists like SAIKO and Luar La L, he reconnects here with erstwhile collaborators whose own careers have taken off exponentially, not the least of which being Feid. “I have so much respect for him,” he says of the Medellín-bred star who co-wrote Balvin’s early hits “Sigo Extrañándote” and “Ginza” before coming into his own. \n\nReggaetón plays prominently throughout <i>Rayo</i>, though it’s not the sole sonic expression on offer here. Vibrant tracks like “3 Noches” and the surprising Carín León team-up “Stoker” reflect Balvin’s role as a pioneer of fusing Afrobeats with Spanish-language music, a practice now employed by an increasing number of reggaetoneros and Latin pop acts. “To me, it's like the new reggae,” he says. “It just sounds good everywhere you are at any time.” Having previously collaborated with genre leaders like Burna Boy and Wizkid, he comfortably and passionately operates within the style without fear of losing fans. “I'm in a really beautiful position where I don't have to prove myself to the world,” he says. Read on to learn about some of J Balvin’s favorite songs from <i>Rayo</i>—in his own words.\n\n<b>“Cosa De Locos”</b>\n“Normally when it comes to reggaetón, they do more the hard intro, more street, like, ‘I’m the man with the biggest balls’—which is dope. I respect that, and it’s part of our culture, but it’s just not what I wanted to do. My energy on this album was just so full of happiness and joy. When the beat starts, it creates an ambience. This is how my energy is right now to share with you, and this is the way I want to start it. I call it happy reggaetón. I love that that’s the first one on the album.” \n\n<b>“Polvo de tu Vida” (feat. Chencho Corleone)</b>\n“Me and Chencho, we do great things, and we haven't had the opportunity to work together solo. I never made these songs thinking about someone. When I finished the album, I was like, let’s see if there's any song that is screaming for a feature. This is a good thing of doing music, just not thinking about the features, about what's going to happen. It's better just to focus on the song, and then it's not premeditated. We flew to Dubai together to shoot the video. We had, of course, a long flight, so we went to the bar. He taught me a lot of reggaetón history. It’s priceless to share with a legend like him.”\n\n<b>“Swat” (feat. Luar La L)</b>\n“Luar La L’s song is one of my favorites. I love the way he raps, I love the way he flows on the beat. It's those types of features that you don't see it coming. He's definitely running the streets. The vibe was amazing.”\n\n<b>“Doblexxó” (feat. Feid)</b>\n“It gives me nostalgia, because I remember us back in time. I'm really grateful for him, and I knew he was going to make it. You can get lost a little bit when you start writing songs for everyone, and then you might lose your ID or DNA. I think what he did was discover himself. It's also beautiful how patient he was, because you got to understand, we—Maluma, KAROL G—blew up way before him. We went together to the studio in LA, just me and him. We just wanted to make it so intimate. This song is definitely a Medellín song. That's Medellín reggaetón, and it makes me so proud.”\n\n<b>“3 Noches”</b>\n“Afrobeats is one of my biggest passions. From me starting working with Mr Eazi, we both invest in the new artists from Africa; we’re partners in a company where we find who's going to be the next one. ‘3 Noches,’ man, it's a lot of people's favorite on the album, let me tell you. I did it with Michaël Brun from Haiti. It just comes so easy to make the melodies, because I listen to these guys all the time. I just try to be the most respectful I can be with their genre.”\n\n<b>“Gaga” (feat. SAIKO)</b>\n“This kid, he came like he knows us forever and he was giving us what to do, which we loved it because we knew that he knows and he is a great artist. We were so impressed. He definitely knows what he wants and his taste is top-tier, man. I see this kid humble, enjoying the process, which definitely makes me think about there were some moments that I didn't enjoy my success growing up. Maybe I was so caught up in the business that I didn't have the time to digest so many things and enjoy it to the fullest.”\n\n<b>“La Noche” (feat. Dei V)</b>\n“Dei V is the reason why I started the album, and he doesn't even know! I just went to the studio to have fun; I never thought about making an album. I remember being in Miami with Jeremy Ayala, a producer that I love and a close friend, and O’Neill, a great artist and songwriter/producer. We went to the studio, we invite Dei V. I remember me having fun as the way when I started doing music. We did this song so fast, but it was because we were so connected. It's a pure reggaetón, man.”\n\n<b>“Stoker” (feat. Carín León)</b>\n“This guy Carín impressed me of his vision of music. It reminds me of <i>Vibras</i>—so open to try different sounds. He listens to every type of genre, which is not normally what you see in these artists, because I understand that they're so into the regional and they're so into the corridos. When I start talking with this guy, he knew about vallenato from Colombia, he knew about salsa, he knew a lot of Ed Sheeran. This guy is so open-minded, I think I can do something that is going to take him out of the comfort zone. He sent us the song, but it was totally his sound. I’m like, wait, we can make a twist here. No one has heard [him] in an Afrobeats drum pattern. On respect, I called him before we made the surgery. He was just like, 'Yes, that's what I was looking for!'”\n","short":"The Colombian superstar returns with what he calls “happy

It for Me</i>, he eschews features entirely to reestablish his POV as one of hip-hop’s smoothest voices. In 2023, Larry dropped <i>The Great Escape</i>, which was produced entirely by The Alchemist and featured Action Bronson, Big Sean, Slum Village, and more. That same year, he linked up with another heavy-hitting producer in Cardo for <i>The Night Shift</i>, which featured guest bars from 2 Chainz, ScHoolboy Q, Too $hort, and plenty of others. The glitz and glamour from guest stars are nowhere to be found on <i>Doing It for Me</i>, which finds the Bay Area spitter delivering lovesick bars over classic West Coast funk beats.\n\nTake “Stinson Beach,” which sounds like Parliament remixing a Dr. Dre production and features June showcasing his best singing voice. “But when I’m not with you, baby girl, I don’t feel the same,” he croons, the desire in his voice practically palpable. Larry keeps the missed connections front of mind on “Meet Me in Napa,” a raunchy ode to the weekend getaway that finds the spitter going wine tasting with a lady who remains just out of reach: “Would have been my main girl,” he sings, before adding, “In another lifetime.”","short":"The Bay Area spitter drops lovesick bars over classic West Coast funk beats."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a5/f7/c6/a5f7c655-fa44-505b-07ea-f93b4cd4c375/197342641784_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"373935","textColor2":"283422","textColor4":"4e574b","textColor1":"0b0d07","bgColor":"e6e6ee","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/doing-it-for-me/1757508981","playParams":{"id":"1757508981","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4WTeIxAN7kzFcIQ0DsXHNc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757508981/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"675391681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/675391681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723180792242,"RTCI":0}}},"1757663442":{"id":"1757663442","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757663442?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ty-myers/1674345303","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Let 'Em Talk -

Well: Deeper into the Well","artistName":"Kacey Musgraves","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"“My Saturn has returned,” the cosmic country singer-songwriter proclaimed to announce her fifth album (apologies to <i>A Very Kacey Christmas</i>), <i>Deeper Well</i>. If you’re reading this, odds are you know what that means: About every 30 years, the sixth planet from the sun comes back to the place in the sky where it was when you were born, and with it, ostensibly, comes growth. At 35, the chill princess of rule-breaking country/pop/what-have-you has caught up with Saturn and taken its lessons to heart. OUT: energy vampires, self-sabotaging habits, surface-level conversations. IN: jade stones, moon baths, long dinners with friends, listening closely to the whispered messages of the cosmos. (As for the wake-and-bake sessions she mentions on the title track—out, but wistfully so.)\n\nMusgraves followed her 2018 breakthrough album, the gently trippy <i>Golden Hour</i>, with 2021’s <i>star-crossed</i>, a divorce album billed as a “tragedy in three parts,” where electronic flourishes added to the drama. On <i>Deeper Well</i>, the songwriter’s feet are firmly planted on the ground, reflected in its warm, wooden, organic instrumentation—fingerpicked acoustic guitar, banjo, pedal steel. Here, Musgraves turns to nature for the answers to her ever-probing questions. “Heart of the Woods,” a campfire sing-along inspired by mycologist Paul Stamets and his <i>Fantastic Fungi</i> documentary, looks to mushroom networks beneath the forest floor for lessons on connectivity. And on “Cardinal,” a gorgeous ode to her late friend and mentor John Prine in the paisley mode of The Mamas & The Papas, potential dispatches from the beyond arrive as a bird outside her window in the morning.\n\nAs Musgraves’ trust in herself and the universe deepens, so do her songwriting chops. On “Dinner With Friends,” a gratitude journal entry given the cosmic country treatment, she honors her roots in perfectly sly Musgravian fashion: “My home state of Texas, the sky there, the horses and dogs, but none of their laws.” And on the simple, searching “The Architect,” she condenses the big mysteries of human nature into one elegant, good-natured question: “Can I pray it away, am I shapeable clay/Or is this as good as it gets?”\n","short":"Kacey adds seven new tracks to her introspective 2024 album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c0/54/85/c0548525-41d6-d57b-6b0a-1278001e11fe/24UMGIM74372.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"464e3d","textColor2":"222f14","textColor4":"4d5742","textColor1":"19240f","bgColor":"f8f8f8","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deeper-well-deeper-into-the-well/1758870783","playParams":{"id":"1758870783","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1qkr1AJ7sc8IF2nLmjCBkZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758870783/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466044182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466044182?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723198366344,"RTCI":0}}},"1759290741":{"id":"1759290741","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759290741?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/acemo/949219289","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/8e/4a/a88e4a3c-adbd-c913-5f55-3bbdecd3e696/6c081101-04b9-4a46-ba15-9b96660cb8e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"30322d","textColor2":"282720","textColor4":"4b4b44","textColor1":"070804","bgColor":"d6dad3","hasP3":false}},"name":"Inter Transit","artistName":"AceMo","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/73/5f/aa/735faada-31c5-0be3-0dab-13dc3514a527/840200587556_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccccc4","textColor2":"00f1e9","textColor4":"00c2bb","textColor1":"fffff5","bgColor":"020403","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inter-transit/1759290741","playParams":{"id":"1759290741","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1KpYPR1f9vjA6JPFOEGnI8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759290741/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"949219289","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/949219289?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723184943670,"RTCI":0}}},"1759292539":{"id":"1759292539","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759292539?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-farren/257342","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/42/3c/a4423cf0-35e7-dcc4-b9dc-bfe2fda50328/Jobaee4d082-7ed5-46c4-874f-41206e85111c-172738425-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336647010_1847620141-Time1722294121114.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1f203d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1c1f33"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f3a48","textColor2":"1f203d","textColor4":"454052","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1c1f33","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/66/8d/4c/668d4c26-3181-5f60-23d8-7fd1f11ca432/Job33af5bfc-7aae-4bc9-af2e-d0cb9608a6b8-172738426-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336647011_1847620142-Time1722295057578.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1d1934"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1c1f33"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"433943","textColor2":"1d1934","textColor4":"443a4b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1c1f33","hasP3":false}},"name":"Doom Singer (Delux -

The critically acclaimed and award-winning album capped off an already impressive discography rooted in Atlanta artistry and augmented by the raw power of his duo Run The Jewels. Naturally, a project as profound and resonant as that 2023 full-length left many eager to hear more from him in this soulful yet unrestrained mode. Thankfully, roughly a year later comes <i>Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs for Sinners and Saints</i>.\n\nNo matter where one entered Killer Mike fandom, there’s something here for any and all of his listeners (albeit less for those craving RTJ’s signature sonic maximalism). Dungeon Family devotees will catch an immediate blast of that ATL energy within seconds of “BUSSIN BRICKS INTRO,” boasting production by no less than Outkast’s longtime DJ Cutmaster Swiff. Living up to the essence of this titular revival, gospel-infused cuts like “HAD TO GO GET IT” and the deeply reflective “LORD PREPARE ME” harken back to similar moments on his semi-eponymous prior album. Religious themes bleed through the soul-trap rattle of “SLUMMER 4 JUNKIES,” Mike’s confessional verses and Bishop Andrew Potter’s intercessions elevating the 10-minute centerpiece with the awesome power of a Sunday sermon.\n\nWhile the guest list doesn’t specifically mirror the artistic largesse of <i>MICHAEL</i>, the tightly curated feature selection here suits the setting undeniably well. Building on its companion’s “TALK’N THAT SHIT!,” fellow Southerners Key Glock and Project Pat add that Memphis seasoning to the Twhy x DJ Paul blend “STILL TALK’N THAT SHIT.” Blxst and Offset emphasize the gravity of the hustle on “EXIT 9 (SCENIC ROUTE)” while R&B fixture Anthony Hamilton gives a stirring performance on “NOBODY KNOWS.”","short":"Atlanta’s almighty MC testifies on this gospel-infused 10-track set."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8e/fb/7f/8efb7f19-70ea-d3da-4975-119dfeb13dc0/24CRGIM42272.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3bfb0","textColor2":"fbdcba","textColor4":"cfb599","textColor1":"ece9d6","bgColor":"1e1818","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/michael-the-mighty-midnight-revival-songs-for-sinners/1759458941","playParams":{"id":"1759458941","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4uusjgOWMeitjvIrSA1HXO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759458941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1320637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1320637?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723198114010,"RTCI":0}}},"1759555829":{"id":"1759555829","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759555829?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ikenga-project/805585816","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Ikenga Project","artistName":"Ikenga Project","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0a/a7/23/0aa723ad-42d3-e8cd-9c40-e71399b4cc62/4251804169356_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"3a3031","textColor4":"61595a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-ikenga-project/1759555829","playParams":{"id":"1759555829","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5qLYF6dit5XEKzTA0kuQr4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759555829/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"805585816","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/805585816?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723176800730,"RTCI":0}}},"1759581499":{"id":"1759581499","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759581499?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/floyymenor/1676497551","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a7/d9/b9/a7d9b99c-1400-d116-e409-cc11f5b73b1a/5fe5bd56-59db-4ccd-b854-7727ec556779.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb9178","textColor2":"e08e76","textColor4":"b77562","textColor1":"e6b191","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"EL COMIENZO","artistName":"FloyyMenor","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Chile’s vibrant reggaetón and trap scenes don’t often see their local artists reach international heights. Defying expectations, FloyyMenor’s 2024 single “Gata Only” with Cris Mj became an unstoppable viral force within and beyond Latin America, even charting in the upper half of the all-genre US Billboard Hot 100. (A pan-Latin remix with more established hitmakers Anitta and Ozuna certainly didn’t hurt its prospects either.) For the aptly named <i>EL COMIENZO</i>, the breakout star collects his 2024 singles to date along with a couple of brand-new cuts to maximize his global momentum. Echoes of his biggest song thus far reverberate through the similarly airy reggaetón of “A POKA LUZ” and “PELIGROSA,” while “LOREA MAMI” tries a noticeably more aggressive tack. Fellow Chilean acts Lucky Brown and FloyyMenor’s frequent collaborator Lewis Somes make their presence felt as well on perreo-primed moments like “ME GUSTA” and “TU TA RIKA,” respectively.","short":"The “Gata Only” hitmaker is just getting started…"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/18/03/2d/18032dc9-fb05-cd0b-c6f3-a2237f0516f1/198542781577-copy-d8f8bbd8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacaca","textColor2":"d19993","textColor4":"a87b77","textColor1":"fbfbfb","bgColor":"060608","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-comienzo/1759581499","playParams":{"id":"1759581499","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6MikZBKCtKfPM4439yzBRz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759581499/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1676497551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1676497551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723194398756,"RTCI":0}}},"1759932346":{"id":"1759932346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759932346?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yoon-san-ha/1345886898","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"DUSK - EP","artistName":"Yoon San Ha","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4e/65/df/4e65df0e-557f-0aba-13f4-41c28969d19d/cover_KM0020210_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"ccddee","textColor2":"e5c6bb","textColor4":"b8b0b9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"035aaf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dusk-ep/1759932346","playParams":{"id":"1759932346","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759932346/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1345886898","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1345886898?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723129886605,"RTCI":0}}},"1760057427":{"id":"1760057427","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760057427?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jack-white/826980","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b9/40/88/b9408897-aecd-f90f-f145-97cc4bdbf76d/Jobc0178681-7cd5-4fed-84e7-8976fc96919c-172978925-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337133656_1851346426-Time1722600175544.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e5e7e5"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000738"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c2c6c1","textColor2":"e5e7e5","textColor4":"b7bcb7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000738","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/63/4e/48634e11-2eec-32d8-1025-48f80c73cec8/0369fdd0-8cca-42b3-80e7-fdcb08a40330.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a19d","textColor2":"c9c1c6","textColor4":"a49ea2","textColor1":"d9c5bf","bgColor":"141416","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/33/c6/d8/33c6d8b4-a092-2289-82b9-828be5baa6aa/Jobaa7b763b-600a-4547-94fb-a917c29342e6-172978926-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337133655_1851346425-Time1722602183993.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e5e8ec"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000738"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c1c9d2","textColor2":"e5e8ec","textColor4":"b7c0ca","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000738","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0c/41/63/0c416303-fd6d-c4aa-ebd3-4701ea4b8f73/ac3d899d-4fb4-4ffc-9605-3a3f58fe12b4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7480df","textColor2":"6c79f9","textColor4":"5764e0","textColor1":"909cf8","bgColor":"05107d","hasP3":false}},"name":"No Name","artistName":"Jack White","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The White Stripes were nothing if not a formal exercise in exploring the possibilities of self-imposed limitation—in instrumentation, in color scheme, in verifiable biographical information. Since the duo’s dissolution in 2011, Jack White has continued playing with form (and color schemes), from the just-one-of-the-boys-in-the-band vibes of The Raconteurs to 2022’s sonically experimental <i>Fear of the Dawn</i> and its more restrained companion <i>Entering Heaven Alive</i>. Despite—or perhaps <i>to</i> spite—those who longed for a simpler, noisier, more monochromatic time, White tinkered away.\n\nThe rollout for <i>No Name</i>, White’s sixth solo album, was characteristically mischievous: It first appeared as a white-label LP given away at Third Man Records before being posted online without song titles, sparking an excitement that felt fresh, largely because the sound did not. Meg White is not walking through that door anytime soon, but the 13 tracks here channel the unadorned, wild-eyed ferocity of the band that made him famous more efficiently and consistently than anything he’s done since. There’s plenty of swagger from top to bottom, but most of all there’s <i>hooks</i>: big, fat, noisy guitars played in the catchiest combinations possible. \n\n“That’s How I’m Feeling” may not relieve “Seven Nation Army” of its ubiquity anytime soon, but it is a ready-made capital-A anthem with a euphoric jump-scare chorus that sticks on first listen and doesn’t get unstuck. “Bless Yourself,” “Tonight (Was a Long Time Ago),” and “Number One With a Bullet” are just as infectious, while “Bombing Out” may be the fastest, heaviest thing White has ever put out in any of his many guises. The casualness of it all is a flex—as meticulous and exacting as White can be, <i>No Name</i>’s modest arrival is a reminder of how easily he could have kept churning out earworm White Stripes songs. Good for him that he didn’t want to; good for us that he does now.","short":"We think you’re gonna be friends with this casual flex of a throwback."},"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/e2/9e/1ce29ea2-4ceb-e775-9b4f-1191ea6155ab/810074424233.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor4":"b7b7b7","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-name/1760057427","playParams":{"id":"1760057427","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4j6OkbZmVIqJYDLJbiWHbX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760057427/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"826980","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/826980?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723197950847,"RTCI":0}}},"1760167661":{"id":"1760167661","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760167661?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jimmy-brown/30938586","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"love ll","artistName":"Jimmy Brown","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ad/6f/c0/ad6fc0b3-f35f-8e04-e069-29b8851617f0/887928026165.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"252424","textColor2":"1e1c1c","textColor4":"353333","textColor1":"090909","bgColor":"929091","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-ll/1760167661","playParams":{"id":"1760167661","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2J77Vi9sThWmB0kqR57jrP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760167661/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"30938586","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/30938586?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723163547274,"RTCI":0}}},"1760199840":{"id":"1760199840","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760199840?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alt%C3%A9go/1606418899","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/af/d7/19/afd7193d-c2f3-f7d7-9c9d-91534903e9a2/f843ce10-b0dc-44dc-ae72-20ea4f59f587.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"cdb265","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a5a291","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9a/5c/dc/9a5cdcf6-a940-a007-5a7b-e00744355a19/c68b66a2-3c9f-409e-9a9b-ff8176d83374.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"b4a867","textColor2":"d2bd74","textColor4":"aa995f","textColor1":"ded07e","bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e7/a2/2f/e7a22f55-6193-2a2a-6c0f-aa6e830876a0/9b9ae2ad-0531-4f3a-924a-8628e8e6174d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c1ac6b","textColor2":"d5be77","textColor4":"b09e63","textColor1":"ead181","bgColor":"1e1c15","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/06/e2/eb06e293-fbc5-0160-96ec-da700a149cc4/803fc4db-9977-4dca-a9f4-0216536eb727.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a7a696","textColor2":"c9bc73","textColor4":"a2975d","textColor1":"d0ceba","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/de/97/67/de976795-095d-787c-14b1-eac7e08f22c4/4bf3781e-0a1a-4074-9ec3-7f488755691c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbb167","textColor2":"eccd72","textColor4":"c4ab62","textColor1":"f5d577","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/44/9e/a3/449ea3ce-6841-2074-6cf6-0ea52bb53245/ca0e0863-e47e-4d69-b0d2-88d8b6e15cf3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"b7b5a2","textColor2":"f1d684","textColor4":"c4ae6d","textColor1":"e0dec7","bgColor":"131210","hasP3":false}},"name":"Today's Hits: August 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"ALTÉGO","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"You already know Today's Hits—the playlist that keeps up with the most popular songs in pop, hip-hop, R&B, and more—but you’ve never heard it like this.

Since the mid 2010s, he’s been splitting his attention between his disco-influenced <i>Funk Wav Bounces</i> albums and the more electronic-leaning Love Regenerator project, alongside a constant stream of the dance-pop hits he is best known for. Arriving in August 2024, <i>96 Months</i> collects 15 of those singles together in one place: eight years worth of Harris-produced chart-toppers and his own anthemic floor-fillers—plus two more recent cuts with returning collaborators Ellie Goulding and Rag’n’Bone Man.\n\nWith the speed and intensity at which trends in music can shift and evolve over the better part of 10 years, it’s a testament to Harris’ timeless ear that <i>96 Months</i> (a “greatest hits” by any other name) plays more like an album of fresh material than a catalog retrospective. Indeed, the earliest releases included here—“How Deep Is Your Love” the ubiquitous 2015 teamup with Disciples and 2016’s equally omnipresent “This Is What You Came For,” a Taylor Swift co-write with a lead vocal from Rihanna—still sound just as commanding and au courant as the newer material these tracks sit alongside. So too, does the 2019 rework of “I’m Not Alone,” which beefs up the thumping dance beat to surpass even the stratosphere-busting levels of the original mix. \n\nElsewhere, “Nuh Ready Nuh Ready,” a pulsing, dancehall-flavored rhythm captained by Canadian R&B star PARTYNEXTDOOR showcases Harris’ versatility, while the back-to-back knockout of “One Kiss” featuring Dua Lipa and “Promises” with Sam Smith illustrates why the biggest artists in the world turn to the Scottish hitmaker when they’re looking to make a splash. Though it may not offer anything fans of Harris won’t have heard before, <i>96 Months</i> provides an excellent excuse to spin the classics all over again.","short":"An eight-year run of euphoric dance hits that still sound brand-new."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/96/ad/26/96ad26cb-b361-c810-0655-ce66df16b9d2/196872350296.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9995e","textColor2":"dbab5c","textColor4":"b98d4d","textColor1":"dab972","bgColor":"351611","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/96-months/1760348185","playParams":{"id":"1760348185","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1CfqWSAyfmYzHU9ktHxUqd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760348185/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"201955086","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/201955086?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723203194858,"RTCI":0}}},"1760431297":{"id":"1760431297","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760431297?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/screwly-g/1614763140","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Murda Man","artistName":"Screwly G","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2c/b9/78/2cb978da-a929-ddb0-c373-6efecba2ba09/24UMGIM77234.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcd","textColor2":"d6d6d6","textColor4":"adadad","textColor1":"fcfcfe","bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/murda-man/1760431297","playParams":{"id":"1760431297","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1wtzd2FP1y9AwbTklAJOA3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760431297/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1614763140","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1614763140?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723176672810,"RTCI":0}}},"1760460694":{"id":"1760460694","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760460694?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jeebanoff/1114460481","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/46/be/dc/46bedcd7-7e8f-8e68-fedf-c28eea422a42/70c98e70-8c08-443d-9448-752ede90b1c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d9b68e","textColor2":"f7cd97","textColor4":"d8af7d","textColor1":"f8d5ad","bgColor":"5b3a14","hasP3":false}},"name":"We Will Meet Again -

As the indigenous sounds that converge in Lagos interact with more diasporic influences, the singer-songwriter and performer articulates his identity through imaginative musical frameworks. “<i>Lungu Boy</i> explains my early beginnings in music and how it shaped me into the person I am becoming,” Asake tells Apple Music. “The English word is ‘ghetto.’ As you can tell from the choice of collaborations, <i>Lungu Boy</i> is my heritage and culture [spreading] to the rest of the world.”\n\nThe result is a project more expansive than his previous albums—<i>Mr. Money With the Vibe</i> and <i>Work of Art</i>—that welcomes LUDMILLA, Central Cee, Stormzy, Travis Scott, and Wizkid into Asake’s orbit, and where eras are collapsed via Fuji vocal samples, log drums, and nostalgic beat breaks. This is Asake’s crystallization of an iteration of Afrobeats that accommodates various influences adapted from domestic and international sources. “It’s a new field,” Asake says. “I refuse to limit myself, and strive to share my African heritage with the world through a blend that goes beyond just a sound.”\n\nThe sonic textures accrued from the merging of traditional styles with Afropop, samba, amapiano, funk, and hip-hop allow Asake to push the envelope, traversing moods and a range of subjects. “Consistency and exposure lead to growth,” he says. “I’m glad to see it reflected in my writing as well.” While there is growth and an embrace of new directions, the street-coded lyricism, dynamism, and stylish delivery lend a familiar feel. “Asake remains the same person,” the artist born Ahmed Ololade says. “But with increased value, content, exposure, and composure.” Here, he talks us through <i>Lungu Boy</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Start”</b>\n“As the name implies, I set the tone for what to expect on the album, where I am coming from and where I am going. The ‘space’ in this context means the rest of the world.” \n\n<b>“MMS” (with Wizkid)</b>\n“It’s no secret that Wizkid is one of my music inspirations. As a young striving artist in Lagos, I have always been waiting for the right song, so when the opportunity came it was a no-brainer. ‘MMS’ stands for ‘Mr. Money Sound’ and it explains my music journey.”\n\n<b>“Mood”</b>\n“‘Mood’ is a special record that reflects everyone’s varying emotions in life. It encourages embracing optimism and includes a Spanish translation on the second verse to reach a wider audience.”\n\n<b>“My Heart”</b>\n“Over the years, people have thought I am incapable of love, but I’m human and feel precisely like everyone else. On this record, I was pouring my heart into describing the kind of woman I would want.”\n\n<b>“Worldwide”</b>\n“With this record, I wanted my breakthrough into the global music space. I don’t want to be just a guy from Africa, but a guy who came to this world and made a difference in music. In the lyrics, I say, ‘Worldwide, Mr. Money don blow o’—a phrase for fame where I come from.”\n\n<b>“Active” (with Travis Scott)</b>\n“I went to hang out with Sarz at his house. He said he’d been working on a beat and offered to play it; when I heard it, the first thing that came to my mind was, ‘Oh man, I’m active.’ It sounded good and I thought it would work in that direction. I hung out with Travis at one of his house parties, and we connected. The best song to have him on was ‘Active’; the rest is history.”\n\n<b>“Suru” (feat. Stormzy)</b>\n“A big shout-out to Stormzy for collaborating on this track. The song is about patience, staying true to your dreams and never giving up. Blessings come to those who work hard and believe.”\n\n<b>“Skating”</b>\n“One of my new hobbies this year is skating. I love the thrills and precision needed for balance while moving! After my show in Canada I met up with Priime in LA, and we worked on ‘I Swear.’ He played the beat for ‘Skating’ and boom! Skating is a lifestyle.”\n\n<b>“Wave” (with Central Cee)</b>\n“I had recorded the chorus for this song during one of my sessions with Magicsticks in Lagos. I was expressing how I wanted to focus only on the positive things and not be distracted by side conversations. After meeting Central Cee at my Barclays show in New York, we decided to hang out. We offered to meet in a studio, and he wanted us to work together. He recorded the song that night, and we all loved it. We originally planned to work on another song in London, but ‘Wave’ was just the perfect record, so we stuck with it. Central Cee came to Lagos, we shot the video and had an amazing time.”\n\n<b>“Mentally”</b>\n“‘Mentally’ is for those who have faced peer pressure and insecurity. It’s about taking charge of your own destiny, embracing your truth, and being loved for who you are.”\n\n<b>“Uhh Yeahh”</b>\n“In the Lungu, songs like this are called ‘Vibes and Inshallah.’ It’s a situation where you let the music take control, no worries, just go with the flow of wherever the music takes you. But remember, don’t get into trouble, be mindful and respectful to people around you. Most importantly, don’t lose the fun!”\n\n<b>“I Swear”</b>\n“This slang term is one of my favorite words. It means ‘I am dead serious.’ I didn’t realize I used it a lot until Ghazi [Shami]—who is the head of Empire—pointed it out to me. On this record, I was talking about enjoying myself and giving updates on what I like and want to do. It’s personal; I love the good things in life, so I work hard to afford them easily.”\n\n<b>“Ligali”</b>\n“This song is for the bad boys who just want a special girl in their lives and appreciate her efforts to stay beautiful while they have fun, travel around the world, enjoy the little things in life, take risks, and be responsible at the same time.”\n\n<b>“Whine” (with LUDMILLA)</b>\n“When working with LUDMILLA, I wanted a song that matched her beauty and talent. She’s one of the best things to happen to music in Southern America. Have you seen how these girls dance? It’s a thing of beauty, and I wanted to be a part of it. Just letting all the beautiful girls know that I got them and they can keep shining to keep the world spinning.”\n\n<b>“Fuji Vibe”</b>\n“Before becoming famous, I had this song. It went viral during one of my shows when I used it as an interlude and the fans started a serious online campaign, wanting me to release it as a single. I love it because it allows me to express my heritage in the purest form. I’ve seen various online videos and really appreciate them.”","short":"Asake’s not holding back: “It’s my culture, shared with the world.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/38/34/59/383459da-ba6a-4bee-67df-7de269764383/197342707992_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"262424","textColor2":"211513","textColor4":"403534","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"bdb7b7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lungu-boy/1760853689","playParams":{"id":"1760853689","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3kS42vslfpYnxWkGN4JvlW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760853689/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436064480","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436064480?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723209306620,"RTCI":0}}},"1760864369":{"id":"1760864369","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760864369?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1281676587-1511788615","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Summertime Butch","artistName":"Benny the Butcher & Black Soprano Family","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c4/fd/94/c4fd94dd-7fd5-cc26-b580-220b1df3ed58/198588862254.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5b9a3","textColor2":"dbc3bc","textColor4":"bca59e","textColor1":"e6ddc2","bgColor":"422d28","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/summertime-butch/1760864369","playParams":{"id":"1760864369","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10FJPB8KEAOK6PLXe8PEvR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760864369/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1281676587","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1281676587?l=en-US"},{"id":"1511788615","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1511788615?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723189964336,"RTCI":0}}},"1760905142":{"id":"1760905142","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760905142?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1718573158-2715720-602917745","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/65/1b/ea/651beaff-b3e4-e893-ea7e-dbf00474ef88/0c175179-774d-43d4-b34d-1762dd6798a4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3a387","textColor2":"d1c5a7","textColor4":"aba28a","textColor1":"dbc6a3","bgColor":"131718","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ce/ac/fd/ceacfd9e-bb83-4e9f-e371-ed212590dff4/40451a9e-c5d5-4ecf-81fd-5049578048fc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbc0c4","textColor2":"f1ebd5","textColor4":"c2beac","textColor1":"e9edf2","bgColor":"060a0c","hasP3":false}},"name":"VULTURES 2","artistName":"¥$, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On <i>VULTURES 2</i>, the second collaborative album from Ye and Ty Dolla $ign, they continue to seamlessly fuse the R&B aesthetics of Ty’s world with the maximal ambition of Yeezy’s vision for rap. Released just six months after <i>VULTURES 1</i> arrived, the follow-up leans into lyrical themes of excess, joy, and betrayal established on the first album, while introducing a wider sonic palette.\n\nArmed with guests like Lil Wayne, Lil Baby, Young Thug, and Kanye’s daughter North, West and Ty go through the epic highs and demoralizing lows that come with life on top. On “PROMOTION,” which features a cheeky chorus from Future, Ye complains about his girl troubles, rapping, “When she want attention, she disguise it as a post/I forgot to mention, she was mine before she yours.” \n\nYe and Ty often expand their scope beyond ladies and luxury, like on “RIVER,” which features stirring string swells and a knocking drum groove. Yeezy pays tribute to the song’s featured artist, Young Thug, realizing that despite the pain in his life, freedom is priceless: “Too much money to be in the streets/Too much money to spend all on me/Too much hate and not enough love/Free Larry, free Young Thug.”\n","short":"The duo swoops in with a second helping of their VULTURES collab."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3c/85/03/3c850391-35f0-dd24-2aa6-38eed46752e0/354753.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"afa082","textColor2":"ccbb99","textColor4":"a89a7f","textColor1":"d6c29c","bgColor":"161719","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vultures-2/1760905142","playParams":{"id":"1760905142","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760905142/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1718573158","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1718573158?l=en-US"},{"id":"2715720","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2715720?l=en-US"},{"id":"602917745","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/602917745?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723193472256,"RTCI":0}}},"1761264602":{"id":"1761264602","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761264602?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Neo-Soul","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kali-uchis/894731301","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/93/6f/68/936f68a3-2637-24d4-de27-91f1dbf39efa/6d102e67-629f-4d7c-a609-3ada474ed5c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3f3e3e","textColor2":"1a1f21","textColor4":"394245","textColor1":"221b18","bgColor":"b3cdd4","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f0/d9/0d/f0d90de5-6cd4-5b91-5215-d9f3fd9b1115/e560c40e-277c-4739-bdbf-69be95401be6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"50555b","textColor2":"2d3132","textColor4":"565857","textColor1":"262d37","bgColor":"f8f5ea","hasP3":false}},"name":"ORQUÍDEAS PARTE 2","artistName":"Kali Uchis","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"No matter what language she chooses, Kali Uchis continually proves herself to be a versatile performer. Following 2020’s <i>Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)</i> and its hit single “telepatía,” the bilingual Colombian American singer returned to English for 2023’s soulful <i>Red Moon in Venus</i>. Then came <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i>, with lyrics primarily (though not exclusively) in Spanish. Here, she delivers an exquisite pop-wise R&B set, one replete with clubby highs and balladic depth. \n\nThe dance floor is well-served with cuts like “Me Pongo Loca” and “Pensamientos Intrusivos,” her ethereal vocals elevating them further. She indulges alt-jazzier leanings on “Tu Corazón Es Mío…” and embraces tropical pop fully on the tempo-shifting “Dame Beso // Muévete.” The collaborations reflect her journey as well as her status, linking with superstar KAROL G on the polished perreo throwback “Labios Mordidos” and música mexicana sensation Peso Pluma for the romantic duet “Igual Que Un Ángel.” On “Muñekita,” she bridges her two worlds with the aid of Dominican dynamo El Alfa and City Girls rapper JT, who combine to produce an irresistible dembow moment. Later, Rauw Alejandro brings his pop futurism to the thumping “No Hay Ley Parte 2.”\n\nThough the title <i>ORQUÍDEAS PARTE 2</i> might suggest an entirely new installment, this expanded edition arrives some eight months after the first with four additional tracks. “Adicto” returns to her R&B foundations with provocative lyrics and surging synths, while the dreamy “Simple” drifts between languages to deliver its inherently romantic message. The seductively slow pacing of “Young Rich & In Love” holds on KAYTRANADA’s remix, which augments the original with ample percussion and subtler choral accents. Finally, “Como Debe Ser” centers her as a Latin balladeer, its various genre shifts maintaining the emotionality of her impassioned performance.","short":"The Colombian American star updates her exquisite Spanish-language set."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/06/64/98/06649847-5932-d903-7c0b-8e35192a0568/24UMGIM79098.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8397b5","textColor2":"239ae1","textColor4":"1c7eb9","textColor1":"a4b9dc","bgColor":"000d1b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/orqu%C3%ADdeas-parte-2/1761264602","playParams":{"id":"1761264602","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1quQQFsx3AcBBotzj9UXfS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761264602/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"894731301","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/894731301?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723202785218,"RTCI":0}}},"1761439277":{"id":"1761439277","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761439277?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-kid-laroi/1435848034","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/5b/9d/305b9d68-eb65-a703-f771-574e1b44c639/318ee325-e8df-4a58-90ee-c8ef61f8ef46.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4a582","textColor2":"e4c49c","textColor4":"baa081","textColor1":"f0ca9e","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false}},"name":"THE FIRST TIME (DELUXE VERSION)","artistName":"The Kid LAROI","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"The rapper's debut album expands with nine new tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e4/30/87/e43087fa-8b61-56da-8c88-1c0a68e3a6dc/196872372113.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3a689","textColor2":"cab28e","textColor4":"a29173","textColor1":"dfcdaa","bgColor":"050b07","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-first-time-deluxe-version/1761439277","playParams":{"id":"1761439277","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/30H0cGghxhBJ93v4h28XEt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761439277/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1435848034","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1435848034?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723198545493,"RTCI":0}}},"1761451392":{"id":"1761451392","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761451392?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chl%C3%B6e/1571206848","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4e/d3/08/4ed30853-dd02-1016-4e03-ff48242a34b8/Job0a83d52b-a95d-48b4-92ef-e58aea667692-173293973-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337795086_1856187411-Time1723071238982.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","0dd336"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"030520"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"06acbf","textColor2":"0dd336","textColor4":"0baa38","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030520","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/73/ff/0e/73ff0e44-1d60-bb7c-56ca-1d6741a61b04/82c4063f-83a5-4e51-89c1-810e4e52d394.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ca3f0b","textColor2":"fa4408","textColor4":"cc390a","textColor1":"f84b09","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/9b/ab/9a/9bab9a53-5589-8716-d9e5-bc493beb8e0d/Job95805aac-a988-4145-8267-54de342295c5-173293974-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337795085_1856187412-Time1723073016584.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"08cde0","textColor2":"00cee4","textColor4":"00a8cc","textColor1":"0bfdfd","bgColor":"000f6c","hasP3":false}},"name":"Trouble In Paradise","artistName":"Chlöe","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Chlöe Bailey’s 2023 debut album <i>In Pieces</i> delved into the difficulties of relationships, exploring the delicate balance between her emotional, sexual, and romantic desires and the heartache that follows. However, her sophomore effort, <i>Trouble in Paradise</i>, embraces a more carefree persona, offering glimpses into her romantic journey—whether she’s falling in love or navigating the uncertainties that come with that.\n\nJust like on <i>In Pieces</i>, Chlöe is liberated and entirely in control, whether she’s disillusioned about her relationship and contemplating forgiveness (“Redemption”), candid about the freedom found within fleeting singlehood (“Temporarily Single”), or leaning into her sexuality while offering up on-brand zingers (“Rose,” “Nice Girls Finish Last”). \n\nThe album levels up sonically from its predecessor, as the studio's Saint Lucia locale provided inspiration and collaborators like Anderson .Paak, Jeremih, YG Marley, and sister Halle Bailey add their touch. Chlöe delivers melodic verses over a multitude of genres across the album’s 16 tracks—from pop (“Boy Bye,” “Strawberry Lemonade”) to Afrobeats (“Never Let You Go”) and moody R&B (“FYS,” “Same Lingerie”).","short":"Chlöe showcases a more carefree side of herself on her sophomore album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f4/c4/9f/f4c49f50-ebbd-b906-369c-ee21f0a42ba7/196872117615.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"00c6dc","textColor2":"00d5e6","textColor4":"00acca","textColor1":"01f6fe","bgColor":"000958","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trouble-in-paradise/1761451392","playParams":{"id":"1761451392","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4xD7yXdXUDdaen8uvanwIw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761451392/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1571206848","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1571206848?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1723197877703,"RTCI":0}}},"1761455575":{"id":"1761455575","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761455575?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/latto/419799506","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c6/b7/2c/c6b72cbe-a90a-8881-50e7-0bb2c9de9791/b95d1710-8e12-456d-a247-1d2a86296276.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2d2c","textColor2":"1d1916","textColor4":"3d3937","textColor1":"0a0808","bgColor":"bdbdbc","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6a/bd/4c/6abd4cd0-2c9e-5370-0227-fd7b08dd1e3e/cc0a8a4d-a05b-4b6b-961c-fbe9ce5ff65d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"26282d","textColor2":"1c130f","textColor4":"363032","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"9da4bf","hasP3":false}},"name":"Sugar Honey Iced Tea","artistName":"Latto","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I don’t be trying to get too involved in the ‘extra big shoes to fill’ shit,” Latto tells Apple Music of her provocative and spirited third album. “I just do me, and I really feel like that have worked for me. I feel like all that is due to just me being me.” On <i>Sugar Honey Iced Tea</i>, the rapper elevates her work beyond what she feels is a “single-driven and club-driven” culture. “I wanted to make a cohesive project,” she says. “And I think with that, to sit through, what, an hour of one person, you have to be dimensional and be multidimensional, and I think you have to showcase different sides and versions of your artistry.” And with “Big Mama,” she found a single that didn’t compromise her vision. “I was like, ‘Okay, this the best one. It shows the versatility in the song.’”\n\nThe album is also brimming with smooth collaborations—including Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Ciara, Flo Milli, Young Nudy, Hunxho, Coco Jones, Mariah the Scientist, and Teezo Touchdown—which was Latto’s goal. “Everybody on there, I’m a fan of personally,” she says. “I made the music first and then I was like, ‘Okay, I think this person. Let me call this person. I want them to get on it.’ Or ‘I feel like they could add to the song.’ So everything was very intentional.”\n\nThe bouncy and playful “Squeeze” with Megan Thee Stallion is Latto’s answer to the success of her 2021 hit “Big Energy.” “I didn't want to just run away from that pop fanbase that I had built,” she says. “So I wanted to incorporate some of that without it sounding too poppy, because I don’t think that’s where I’m rooted. I come from a rap competition show. I think it’s very clear, very evident that I’m a rapper first.”\n\nCertain tracks may shed light on her personal life, too. If “Prized Possession” featuring Teezo Touchdown tells the story of a toxic relationship (“I think I was very keen on it being a mood,” she explains), the sexy and sultry “Look What You Did” with Mariah the Scientist captures how Latto has been feeling running up to the album’s release. “This whole project is about my last two years,” she says. “And I feel like I found someone who uplifts me as a person.” But even so, Latto reminds us where the focus should be: “Listen to the music and you’ll know what you need to know.”\n","short":"The Atlanta rapper quenches a thirst on her new
