Album","standard":"Going three years without a new album isn’t exactly characteristic for Polo G. Beginning with 2019’s breakthrough <i>Die a Legend</i>, the Chicago rapper’s first trio of full-length efforts came at a reliably annual pace. Yet even as he racked up successes upon successes, run-ins with law enforcement disrupted his upward trajectory enough to slow his release flow. With <i>HOOD POET</i>, however, he returns to the fore with more life experience and rededicated to spitting about what he knows best.\n\nBefitting the title, he shares unflinching narratives of pain and pleasure on cuts like “Darkside” and the bombastic “God’s Favorite.” He reaffirms his drill-rap integrity with features from G Herbo and Lil Durk, who bring their long-standing street cachet to “No Recruits” and “We Uh Shoot,” respectively. Noticeably more versatile than he was five years prior, he mourns while soaring over the Southside-produced “Barely Holdin’ On.” Switching from hood parables to romantic woes, “Same Me” probes a changing relationship, with Fridayy’s echoey chorus emphasizing the depths of love lost. Later, GloRilla matches his energy on the explicit “Bad Kids” and Future relates to rising above the struggle on “Survival of the Fittest.”","short":"The wait is over.

Album","standard":"Based on the energy of Charly Bliss’ third album, <i>Forever</i>, the New York quartet decided at some point between this 2024 release and its predecessor, 2019’s <i>Young Enough</i>, to turn things up to 11, expanding upon the scuzzy, DIY pop punk they conjured on those first two records, and making everything bolder, louder, and more intentional.\n\n“Calling You Out” is a yearning and clever portrait of a relationship in distress, with vocalist Eva Hendricks pleading, “I wanna be the one to love you, not calling you out.” Acoustic guitars intermingle with synths, providing the song with intoxicating interplay between the synthetic and organic. “I’m Not Dead” features guitars taken from the alt-rock ’90s, but Hendricks infuses the song with a declaration that demands living life to the fullest: “I’m not, I’m not dead/Even if I was/I’d wish that I’d fucked up/At least twice as much and had like double the fun.”","short":"The NYC indie band’s scuzzy pop punk

Album","standard":"Morgan Wade’s life changed drastically in just a few years. The famously tattooed, rebellious country singer-songwriter broke out with 2021’s <i>Reckless</i>, attracting a rabid fanbase in the process. Wade seems to take stock of that dizzying experience on <i>Obsessed</i>, which follows 2023’s <i>Psychopath</i> and finds her digging deeper into solo songwriting—there are no co-writers on the album. Produced by her touring guitarist Clint Wells (a departure from her previous two outings, which Sadler Vaden of Jason Isbell’s 400 Unit produced), the record is Wade’s most vulnerable, with a quieter sound to match its introspective mood. Highlights include the title track, which explores the nuances of an all-consuming love, and “2AM in London,” a frank, folky homesickness song steeped in late nights and loneliness. Pop firebrand Kesha joins Wade on “Walked on Water,” a slow-building ballad about regret and accountability that makes great use of the two singers’ surprisingly complementary voices.

Album and Interview","standard":"There was a time, not so long ago, when things felt relatively simple for Beatrice Laus: She’d write and record songs in her London bedroom, she’d post them online, the world would come to her or it wouldn’t. But it did—very much so. To such an extent and at such a dizzying clip that, still 23 and just two albums into her career, the Up Next alum found herself taking a meeting with Rick Rubin—part mystic, part producer, part institution. “I think we just wanted to meet each other,” she tells Apple Music. “The entire meeting was about life and just catching up. It was almost like a therapy session. I think at the end I was like, ‘Oh, I’ve been making some songs. Do you want to hear them?’”\n\nThose songs became part of <i>This Is How Tomorrow Moves</i>, a lush and supremely confident third full-length that Laus would go on to record with Rubin at Shangri-La, his legendary studio in Malibu—a long way from said London bedroom. It’s an album about self-realization and growing up, written in the aftermath of a breakup, as Laus—fully online and in the public eye, on tour and away from home—came to terms with a life that had become unrecognizable to her. “I really needed music to help me understand what my brain was going through,” she says. “I just had so much to say. I didn’t really think about the way it sounded. You know when you really badly need to go to the toilet? That’s what it felt like: I really badly needed to write a song.”\n\nAt Shangri-La, Rubin encouraged Laus to see and hear what she’d written in its simplest and clearest emotional terms. Though she still takes plenty of inspiration from a wide swath of ’90s alt-rock and pop (“Post,” the Incubus-like “Take a Bite”), she is equally at home here at the center of a spare piano ballad (“Girl Song”) as she is amid the fanfare of an incandescent indie-folk cut (“Ever Seen”). It’s the sound of an artist finding clarity and herself, an artist leveling up. “I think being in a space like Shangri-La, and knowing that you’re making this record with Rick, it definitely kind of kicks you,” she says. “Like, ‘All right, it’s time to shine.’” Read on as Laus takes us inside a few highlights from the album.\n\n<b>“Girl Song”</b>\n“I think you can argue that ‘Girl Song,’ out of all the songs on the record, is the most tragic. I wrote it because I’m still trying to figure that one out, just in terms of growing up and loving myself and the way I look and physical appearance and all that mumbo jumbo. But it sits at number six, just because I just felt like it was perfect. It had to be perfectly in the middle of the record because it didn’t suit the beginning or the end. It was just how I felt at that moment.”\n\n<b>“Beaches”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Beaches’ because of how terrified I was getting into this. I am the sort of person that values feeling comfortable and loyalty and trusting people around me, not changing a lot of things. But I would’ve been an idiot if I had said no [to Rubin]. I remember my boyfriend being like, ‘Are you crazy? You have to go.’ I’m so used to making music back at home, not in a massive, fancy place.”\n\n<b>“The Man Who Left Too Soon”</b>\n“I actually wrote it in LA, in my hotel room. I’ve never really experienced death in family. I always wondered how that felt like. My current boyfriend, unfortunately, lost his dad around his twenties; I really got to see how that would feel like and how that would affect someone. I wanted to write about it so I can understand what that would mean to other people and what that would mean to him and what that would mean to me.”\n\n<b>“This Is How It Went”</b>\n“It makes me so anxious: A very intense thing happened to me, and I needed to write about it. I have to say all this shit.”\n","short":"“It’s time to shine.” Bea seizes the moment with Rick Rubin on LP 3."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/this-is-how-tomorrow-moves/1741999882","playParams":{"id":"1741999882","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5oT7xqbRbQCevZ0XC5aBFu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741999882/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1307650474","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1307650474?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806590149}}},"1742676332":{"id":"1742676332","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742676332?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/ce/0c/01ce0c72-6b0f-62e0-5176-4c4bd43ffe22/2cab54d0-f0ee-406f-9173-65e203c92ba5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"351f31","textColor2":"241824","textColor4":"472a41","textColor1":"0e0910","bgColor":"d074b3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/50/55/b0/5055b06a-064c-4882-1e31-8a82009cbb86/11159285-bb74-458c-a4a4-c7b7e0e98a43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d9ccc6","textColor2":"e6beae","textColor4":"cba89b","textColor1":"f7eae3","bgColor":"615252","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/5d/2f/be5d2f11-2f05-1b84-4030-2639fd493d3a/82790ff2-a585-4165-9e9a-44dcd88718d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2a1522","textColor2":"030204","textColor4":"2a1523","textColor1":"030203","bgColor":"c6639e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amy-shark/1083179259","name":"Sunday Sadness","artistName":"Amy Shark","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2c/e9/aa/2ce9aa37-198b-b023-e5c0-52101525aa09/196871990714.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"2d2324","textColor2":"160f0f","textColor4":"302727","textColor1":"120a0c","bgColor":"968687","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Amy Shark has long struggled with the quiet of Sundays. “I like to keep busy, and whenever I’m not, memories creep in, and I don’t often like that,” the Australian singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “I started dreading Sundays because it’s like, nothing’s happening. And that’s when you remember and sit with a lot of things. So I just made it a night where I would work on this album and learn to sit with some uncomfortable memories and articulate them right and not be overwhelmed, but just be able to channel them through these songs.”\n\nGiven this creative process, it’s perhaps not surprising that <i>Sunday Sadness</i> is a deeply personal outing, one rich with references to her upbringing (“Beautiful Eyes,” “Our Time Together”), the downsides of fame (“I’m Sorry”), and lost and unrequited love (“Two Friends,” “Babe”), delivered in a clutch of songs that alternate between indie pop (“It’s Nice to Feel This Way Again”) and venom-laced pop punk (“Gone”). “I’m always cherry-picking moments from my life and putting a big magnifying glass on them,” she says. “But with this album I started seeing them as little movies that you watch. It’s like watching a drama, then a romantic comedy, then something that’s really high-energy. I feel like it’s an exciting album to listen to.”\n\nThough the LP was produced predominantly by Dann Hume, Shark also worked with Matt Corby on “Slide Down the Wall” and Grammy-winning producer Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus) on “Loving Me Lover.” Guesting on “My Only Friend” is blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, the final member of the pop-punk trio to work with Shark following bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus’ collaboration on “Psycho” from her 2018 debut <i>Love Monster</i> and drummer Travis Barker’s work on “C’MON” from 2021’s <i>Cry Forever</i>. Here, Shark breaks down each of the “little movies” that make up <i>Sunday Sadness</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Slide Down the Wall”</b>\n“I watched the Lizzo documentary [2022’s <i>Love, Lizzo</i>] on the way to LA, and she was going through a breakup and said, ‘Oh my god, I was so upset, I slid down the wall.’ And I was so taken by that. I rewound it and I wrote it in my notes, and I was like, imagine having that [in a positive] way. Because I’ve been that happy that I’ve got home and been like, ‘Oh, fuck, that was a good night.’”\n\n<b>“It’s Nice to Feel This Way Again”</b>\n“[Producer] Joel Little has this magical black book of incredible music that I’m so lucky he opens up to me. He obviously liked this one, because he showed it to me first. It made me feel like getting up and starting the day, it was just so bright and fresh. I love surprising people, and I thought this song would do that. The first lyric, ‘It’s nice to feel this way again, nice to be inside,’ just feels warm and comforting. And I really wanted the album to open up with a couple of songs [that feel] like you’re being held by someone.”\n\n<b>“Beautiful Eyes”</b>\n“The line ‘open your beautiful eyes’ just flew out of me, and I could have cried. I talk about ex-boyfriends and my mum being really young when she had me, and so many things that are very personal. I think what I was trying to say in that song was, you can have so much shit that happens, but it’s a really beautiful world if you can get past that and surround yourself with people and not be scared to do that, and not be scared to know that you deserve that. It’s OK to want more. It’s OK to search for more and switch it up if you’re not happy. We have one life.”\n\n<b>“Gone”</b>\n“I almost wanted to put it on <i>Cry Forever</i>, but it wasn’t there yet. You’re feeling all this hate for this person, and ‘why did you do this? Why did you let me down? You’re so gone, tell everyone you’re dead to me.’ Even that phrase I think is really cool and it’s gonna be really fun to spit at people live. But then in the bridge it is a bit vulnerable.”\n\n<b>“Can I Shower at Yours”</b>\n“It’s sexy—meeting someone you want to be around and falling for them really fast.”\n\n<b>“Loving Me Lover”</b>\n“[Co-writer and producer] Kid Harpoon knows I play guitar, so we grabbed the acoustic and just started strumming, fiddling around, and found a chord progression. The song came together really quickly. My head was a mess at the time. I was on this crazy trip to LA working with the biggest producers, going to all these wanky parties, but still having my eye on what was happening back home and missing it. That all came out in that song in a really cool, chill way.”\n\n<b>“Two Friends”</b>\n“It’s my favorite topic of all time, turning a friend into someone more than a friend. I might have had some experience a few times over! It’s just such a fun topic to sit back and write about when you’ve got through it—everything’s OK now and you can look back and be like, far out, that was an intense time. But now we’ve got this really cool pop-punk song out of it. That middle eight took me a while to do, just because the song sounded so fire and different for me. I was like, it needs this bridge that can’t be boring. It needs to be different. And it needs to pack a punch.” \n\n<b>“Babe”</b>\n“It’s basically hand in hand with ‘Two Friends,’ but a softer approach to it. I love the riff that I wrote. I’m proud of myself, because I’m not a shredder, but I learned from Tom DeLonge, who will say all the time that he’s not the best guitarist, but he makes up for it by being creative. I worked with [producer and co-writer] Jon Hume, and we wrestled about whether it should be a ballad, because he had some really nice keys on it. I was like, I really miss the guitar. So we made a little mashup and it’s a really nice balance.”\n\n<b>“I’m Sorry”</b>\n“I think it’s a combination of really unloading: unloading on me from younger years, like being a teenager and wanting to be a musician so bad, and spending all my money, spending all my boyfriend’s money. Being so relentless with it and going through some pretty tough times as well, in and out of jobs. Then you finally get signed and it all looks like it’s gonna be a fairy tale. Then there’s so much dark stuff that happens when you make it—it just gets harder. It’s more pressure. When I wrote that song, I was just sitting in my own misery and being like, if I just didn’t write all the songs, if I just didn’t fucking want to do this... What if another life would have suited me? It’s just a song about apologizing to [partner] Shane. I’ve put this guy through hell, and now he manages me and his life’s even more hell!”\n\n<b>“My Only Friend” (feat. Tom DeLonge)</b>\n“I just sent Tom the song, it was really easy. And he really liked the verse I had. I gave him the option—I said, ‘Hey, feel free if you want to add anything.’ Some artists are funny about it, they really want to have their ideas in there. But I was kind of proud of myself, and it kind of made him look like a real pro as well, that he didn’t really feel like he needed to do that. He listened to it and was like, ‘I really like what you’ve written, so I’d like to just sing that.’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah! That will really suit your voice too.’ So he made it really easy.”\n\n<b>“Our Time Together”</b>\n“I like leaving an album very emotionally charged. It’s just a real walk through my life and things that meant a lot to me. I love that I got to name-check my other favorite band [New Found Glory] on an album where I got to finish working with my other favorite band [blink-182]. This album just all came together so nicely and it all makes sense to me and I really, really love it.”","short":"The singer-songwriter’s deeply personal third

Album","standard":"“It’s the things that break us that make us who we are,” The Script lead vocalist Danny O’Donoghue sings on “Home Is Where the Hurt Is,” a surging anthem from the Irish pop-rock outfit’s seventh studio album, <i>Satellites</i>. The tragic passing of lead guitarist Mark Sheehan in April 2023 imbues the old adage with a profound ring of truth; at the time of his death, Sheehan and O’Donoghue (who co-founded The Script with drummer Glen Power in 2001) had been best friends and creative partners for over 30 years. The immeasurable loss mired O’Donoghue in a grief-induced writer’s block that persisted for months until he was able to extract some candor from the chaos of his emotions. “The world ain’t the same since you left it,” he states, with beat-skipping finality in the pre-chorus of “Gone,” an unconventionally bright tribute song performed with heartbreak-concealing cheer, as though waving his late bandmate off on an adventure.\n\nWith O’Donoghue both unwilling and unable to replace Sheehan and his contributions to the band’s familiar, soft stadium-rock sound, <i>Satellites</i> also serves as an introduction to The Script’s new four-piece lineup and artistic direction. Reliable hitmakers Wayne Hector (Westlife, One Direction) and Steve Robson (Take That, Olly Murs) feature as co-writers and producers on the more unabashedly polished album highlights, including the persistently catchy lead single, “Both Ways,” an exuberant mix of early Bruno Mars and late Maroon 5 influences. Elsewhere, long-term collaborator Jimbo Barry preserves the essence of the band’s characteristically downbeat offerings (see the jaded resignation of the title track, credited to Sheehan), but there’s also a lighter touch that Iain Archer (Snow Patrol, James Bay) and Nolan Sipe (Benson Boone) bring across the album. Sweetly sentimental ballad “Promises” builds then plateaus gently into soft, twinkling guitar riffs rather than a half-expected crash of drums, while “Falling Flying” retains the propulsive energy of a morale-boosting anthem, played off against a feathery melody and ’80s-inspired keys. It’s broadly feel-good fare, a full-hearted grab for hope and happiness in the wake of tragedy. As they take their first steps into unexplored territory, <i>Satellites</i> indicates The Script are putting their best foot forwards.","short":"The pop-rock band generates light in the darkness of

Album and Interview","standard":"Felix Mendelssohn, a prodigious musical talent hailed by his contemporary Robert Schumann as the “Mozart of the 19th century,” has been the subject of shifting critical opinion since his early death in 1847. His finest compositions bridge the gap between ancient and modern, Classicism and Romanticism, always with brilliance and often with profound emotional intensity. Isata Kanneh-Mason has chosen an ideal selection of his piano pieces for her fourth solo album and placed them in company with works by his sister, Fanny Mendelssohn, whose fine music continues to enjoy increasing attention.\n\nKanneh-Mason crowns her program with Fanny Mendelssohn’s <i>Ostersonate</i> or <i>Easter Sonata</i>, a majestic four-movement work that vanished for a century and a half after her death (her brother died just six months later). Its initial attribution to Felix, following its rediscovery in the early 1970s, says much about the long reach of 19th-century patriarchal prejudices. Fanny, unlike Felix, was expected to preserve her wealthy family’s honor by not displaying her musical gifts in public; she could, however, perform in private to members of her own social class.\n\n“In terms of getting into Fanny’s mind, I always start with the music,” Isata Kanneh-Mason tells Apple Music Classical. “So I pay close attention to the score and use my musical instincts, too. For this album, I read a lot about her. I read some of her letters and books about her life, and tried to really get into her in that way as well. Fanny seems to me to be so very determined. She found ways to make music and compose, and she clearly had big hardships in her life that she took on the chin.” The pianist’s painstaking preparation returns rich dividends in her interpretation of the <i>Ostersonate</i>, notably so in its delicate expressive shadings and songful charm.\n\nThe Mendelssohn siblings came from a remarkable family: their father was a prominent German Jewish banker and philanthropist, their mother, an accomplished musician and champion of culture; their paternal grandfather, the philosopher Abraham Mendelssohn, was a towering figure in the Haskalah or Jewish Enlightenment, while their maternal grandmother, Bella Salomon, studied piano with one of Johann Sebastian Bach’s pupils. And what of another remarkable musical dynasty, the seven Kanneh-Mason siblings? Does Isata detect any similarities with the Mendelssohns? “No, I think they were much more aristocratic,” she replies firmly.\n\nThere’s no doubt about the aristocratic bearing of Isata Kanneh-Mason’s pianism in Felix Mendelssohn’s Piano Concerto No.1. Her virtuosity is breathtaking, likewise her feeling for the work’s tender lyricism and copious expressive nuances. The work, drafted in Rome in the early months of 1831, soars from the moment she enters like a whirlwind after the briefest of orchestral introductions. Kanneh-Mason is equally at home in the rapt Andante and the thrilling mood changes that run through the finale. “It feels incredibly exciting,” she notes. “It’s kind of nonstop—it just flies from beginning to end. Whenever I sit down to perform it, I have to take a deep breath before playing. Once it starts, there’s no time to catch up to yourself!”","short":"Isata Kanneh-Mason thrills to the piano music of Felix and Fanny

Album","standard":"On the first Foster the People album in seven years, the band led by Mark Foster aims to channel the 1970s to help energize his band’s direction, and the result is an album that pays tribute to a number of styles but is indebted to none. Opener “See You in the Afterlife” is a disco thriller that pulls inspiration from Prince and Chic alike. “Let Go” begins with warm keyboard chords before a shuffling drum groove and guitar melodies that sound like a long lost Parliament outtake enter the fray. \n\nThe band’s pop instincts are never far away, though, like on “Sometimes I Wanna Be Bad,” which shuffles along thanks to a dancing bassline and a horn part that ushers in a vocal melody that remains intoxicating, despite Foster’s morose lyrics. Even when Foster is at his lowest, the melodies the band conjures up lift the music to joyous heights. The sun is still shining, even when Foster sings: “Sometimes I wanna be sad and let the loneliness come and be my friend.”","short":"The band’s first album in seven years is a ’70s throwback with a modern edge."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paradise-state-of-mind/1747040856","playParams":{"id":"1747040856","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27ynHS80OjICdw3qLNMgQP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747040856/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"414023649","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/414023649?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723804521817}}},"1747361321":{"id":"1747361321","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747361321?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Folk-Rock","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8f/c5/76/8fc57640-0530-df22-daf7-06536a892658/57142d23-38ec-43c0-a792-e48953ee4d18.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b79799","textColor2":"ceafb2","textColor4":"ad9497","textColor1":"dbb2b5","bgColor":"28282a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ray-lamontagne/21917595","name":"Long Way Home","artistName":"Ray LaMontagne","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/60/81/5f/60815fba-e611-d02a-2486-cb374f25ee46/198588152744.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"eccdb0","textColor2":"edcea3","textColor4":"e4ad88","textColor1":"f6f5d5","bgColor":"c02b1c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The American folk hero’s ninth album reckons with resilience and hope."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/long-way-home/1747361321","playParams":{"id":"1747361321","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2p9oJBiFjBfz46rAa2lQ4x"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747361321/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"21917595","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/21917595?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806622013}}},"1747614501":{"id":"1747614501","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747614501?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Garage","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/skream/255055183","name":"The Warehouse Project: UP YA ARCHIVES with Skream, Dec 8, 2023 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Skream","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b7/5a/bf/b75abf76-7ee3-f14a-75fc-f363d142e467/dj.rtnqafkv.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e1d6de","textColor2":"ffa7fd","textColor4":"ec91e4","textColor1":"f1fcf6","bgColor":"a13e7f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"Attending Manchester’s The Warehouse Project is a rite of passage for many fans of electronic music—and for the names pushing it forwards.

Album","standard":"Orville Peck rounds up more than a few of his most talented friends on <i>Stampede</i>, a collaborative collection with one hell of a guest list. The enigmatic, masked country singer opens the record with a Willie Nelson-assisted cover of Ned Sublette’s clever, queer 1981 song “Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other,” which Nelson famously recorded in 2006. Elton John joins Peck for a spirited take on the former’s 1973 hit “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),” with Peck’s Roy Orbison-esque croon a dramatic counterpoint to John’s masterful belt. Peck and Allison Russell make formidable partners on “Chemical Sunset,” with a loose, jazzy arrangement that’s one of the project’s better grooves.\n\nBluegrass virtuoso Molly Tuttle and her band Golden Highway get things loose and rootsy on “Papa Was a Rodeo,” a cover of the winking Magnetic Fields song off the band’s seminal <i>69 Love Songs</i>. Margo Price assists Peck on the impeccably titled “You’re an Asshole, I Can’t Stand You (And I Want a Divorce),” an original song that manages to be both funny and wrenching. And Peck closes the project with an extra-special cover of Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy,” performing the song with three other out, gay country artists: TJ Osborne, Fancy Hagood, and Waylon Payne.","short":"The masked singer duets with Willie, Elton, Margo, Beck, and more."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stampede/1749379116","playParams":{"id":"1749379116","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3vi7hLbbjQBJypfAA2gafE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749379116/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1319633580","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1319633580?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723781900153}}},"1749611976":{"id":"1749611976","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749611976?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/girl-k/1280765051","name":"My Future","artistName":"Girl K","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e4/19/b2/e419b2e9-3898-ea2c-ca73-2c457357b9f0/605491112449.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"5891b9","textColor2":"66b6dd","textColor4":"5292b1","textColor1":"6eb6e8","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-future/1749611976","playParams":{"id":"1749611976","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2hTWpnp4NhwvsFu46a0bHb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749611976/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1280765051","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1280765051?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723781456142}}},"1750036519":{"id":"1750036519","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750036519?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":56,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2023-10-06","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gorgon-city/504531222","name":"The Warehouse Project: Gorgon City at All Night Long, Concourse, 2023 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Gorgon City","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ca/55/ee/ca55eef5-d80a-6e0c-ba44-ffd90c396d92/0f57a628-59e9-4cd1-96f0-174c57908320.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c5c5","textColor2":"d1d2d5","textColor4":"aaacae","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"0d1313","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"Attending Manchester’s The Warehouse Project is a rite of passage for many fans of electronic music—and for the names pushing it forwards.

It sees the Western Sydney-born singer heading in a more energetic dance direction than the R&B and soul of early singles such as 2020’s “2560,” drawing on genres such as Jersey club (“Think of You”) and drum ’n’ bass (“Bass Keeps Calling”).\n\n“Over the last few years, I was hitting the clubs a lot more, and club culture and dance music was more inspiring to me when I was making the project,” she smiles. “The original idea was to make a project that was just dance music.”\n\nThat idea evolved, however, as she called on the deeper emotional resonance of her soul and R&B roots to exorcise issues in her personal life. “It turned into a mixture of different things—dance music, but it still has that more R&B and soul writing to it,” she says. “When I was writing, I was in a pretty low mental state, I wasn’t doing too well. But over the journey of writing and working on the project, it [became] about resilience and growth and taking back your power. It turned into a love letter to myself, in a way.” Naming the EP <i>MAYDAY</i> because a lot of the songs “are like a call for help,” the singer here talks Apple Music through its ups and downs, track by track.\n\n<b>“Bass Keeps Calling” (with Tentendo)</b> \n“It’s a song about going out and having a mad time, just having a crazy night. When I wrote that song, that’s what I was doing.”\n\n<b>“Incapable”</b>\n“I wrote this towards the end of the project. I had been listening to a lot of 070 Shake and this producer called Tchami, and I wanted to make something that felt red and dark—something opposite from what people might expect from me. The song is about being hurt, and once you’ve been hurt it’s really hard to trust people and build those relationships up again. It’s the opposite of what I normally talk about, which is love and having a good time.”\n\n<b>“Think of You”</b>\n“The idea we were going for was when you’re trying to have a good time but have something constantly in the back of your mind that’s making it really hard to enjoy yourself. I guess it’s a song about when someone’s on your mind, or something keeps bugging you from having a good time.”\n\n<b>“One of One”</b>\n“This was written in the middle of making the project. A lot of the other songs were sad and about negative things, but this one is more about having someone who sticks by you through it all. Because when I was going through a really shit time, I had to remember, there’s actually people who’ve stuck by me, and I should be grateful for those people. So that’s what ‘One of One’ is about.”\n\n<b>“Leave Me Low”</b>\n“I don’t want to be someone who relies on a lot of people when I’m going through things. I don’t want to make someone feel stuck in a relationship or force you to be with me, because I know I’m a lot—I’m a very hectic person! I guess the song is about ‘Would you leave me low? If it came down to it, and something was to happen, would you leave me here?’ I’m asking the question.”\n\n<b>“Crash”</b>\n“When you’ve gone through hard times [and] you look back, you’re almost proud, or you almost have a little giggle to yourself. You’re like, I can’t believe I was sad, or I can’t believe I went through all of this. I guess that’s how I feel about this project and this song specifically, because this song is the heart of the whole project.”\n\n<b>“Hold Me”</b>\n“‘Crash’ felt like it was sitting in its own world, and I needed to make something that made ‘Crash’ and all the dance music fit together. That was the intention going into the session. But also, I’d been making all this sad music. I had a moment to reflect and be like, ‘I need to remind myself I’m not a bad person, I’m actually OK sometimes, and I need to listen to myself and trust my gut and actually take care of myself.’ Because sometimes, when shit gets really hectic, I always forget to put myself first. And that’s so important.”\n\n<b>“Settle Down”</b>\n“‘Settle Down’ was like a switch-up. It was the first time I stepped into a persona of like, ‘I’m taking back my power, and I’m not taking shit anymore, and I’m gonna actually do what I want, and not be afraid, and I’m not scared of you. You should actually be scared of me.’ That’s kind of how it felt when I made this song. I really struggle to make angry music. But that one day, I was really angry and I was like, ‘You know what? I’m just gonna fucking make a song where I’m like, “Man, fuck you. I’m taking back my power today, and I’m not gonna be afraid anymore.”’”","short":"“It turned into a love letter to myself,” says Becca Hatch."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mayday/1750654904","playParams":{"id":"1750654904","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wkb1ikv8zY8rMAeeIVG56"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750654904/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1499545148","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1499545148?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723736422506}}},"1750755054":{"id":"1750755054","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750755054?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ab/b5/b8/abb5b82c-6d7a-242e-809d-57d4da82aa9a/c5e81728-c96c-4270-a987-6d9385f83d58.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c3c3","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a3a3a3","textColor1":"f0f0f0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dark-tranquillity/18243687","name":"Endtime Signals","artistName":"Dark Tranquillity","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1a/c1/ee/1ac1ee65-d697-8369-a1e8-ca98422e1cda/196871962643.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8699a2","textColor2":"ea626a","textColor4":"bd5158","textColor1":"a5bcc7","bgColor":"0b0c11","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"More melodic mayhem from the Swedish death metal masters."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/endtime-signals/1750755054","playParams":{"id":"1750755054","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/23iJlCpjOvLgha8xkOkJBI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750755054/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"18243687","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/18243687?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806711739}}},"1750765140":{"id":"1750765140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750765140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/79/f7/b6/79f7b6aa-3913-4a6f-0285-a814f742f571/Jobcedfa4a4-d83b-4947-a987-b53807201677-173009520-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337199344_1851821250-Time1722631338739.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c1cedb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5e554c"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d4dbdf","textColor2":"c1cedb","textColor4":"a4b6c7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5e554c","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/1e/81/f5/1e81f57a-fe6f-1de5-c513-428f5bbbc0ba/Job482682bc-6371-4ed0-984a-d16fd1d7ff3f-173009521-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337199345_1851821249-Time1722633691741.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d3dbce"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5e554c"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d4d6d8","textColor2":"d3dbce","textColor4":"b4c1bd","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5e554c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d5/88/23/d588238d-e6f9-2b47-a8ab-017ee05d7d02/3401464e-dfea-474e-8710-d54d891fd6de.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cabfa8","textColor2":"dfd8d0","textColor4":"c0bab3","textColor1":"ebe0c3","bgColor":"473f3f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2e/b3/8c/2eb38c2a-3ef7-28d7-9b57-08879b128141/a6c51ac3-ddb2-4ad6-8de6-487560ee25ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"171d24","textColor2":"050504","textColor4":"181d24","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"6381a5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/logic/30865945","name":"Ultra 85","artistName":"Logic","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b3/15/26/b315265f-37c6-6dab-5f25-d4f25b9ad34b/4099964032628.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"c5d3db","textColor2":"fabf8e","textColor4":"d5ac8c","textColor1":"e7eff1","bgColor":"406184","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"By this point in Logic’s career, fans know better than to accept any more “final” album declarations.

That much becomes clear a few seconds into the devastatingly raw opener “To Be Loved.” With piano and strings swelling around her, Watson offers a heartfelt apology to her sister and brother, before one of an altogether more confronting nature: “And to the guy that hit me, I’m so sorry that I stayed/But I wanted to be loved, but to me that love was pain/I let you break me down so I could build me up again.”\n\nSuch honesty is indicative of a record on which Watson was committed to digging deeper emotionally and musically than ever before. “The last album [2021’s <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i>] I’m not really happy with at all, I wanted to change so much,” she says. “I don’t want to regret this one like I regret the last one. The production was lazy. It was just lazy work. I wasn’t honest and vulnerable about myself, I [just] wrote poppy melodies. As a composer I really wanted to create an album that had more depth to it.”\n\nWhile <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i> came together in a matter of months, <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i> was written in and around touring cycles over a period of a year and a half. Determined to display her versatility, Watson sings in a lower register on the soulful, rootsy “Raise Me Up” and fragile “Lose Someone Like Me,” while musically she oscillates between emotive ballads, attitude-laden indie (“You Don’t Know Me Like That”), and all-out pop (“Call My Name,” co-written with Drake and BTS collaborator Jenna Andrews). The intensely personal family tale “Sorrento,” meanwhile, marks her as a formidable storyteller with a keen eye for detail. The album takes its name from a song Watson deemed unsuitable for the record, though its title resonated with her goals around being vulnerable and open. “I think you can see the beautiful in the ordinary, and I think all of us feel ordinary,” she explains. Here, Watson walks us through <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“To Be Loved”</b>\n“I brought things up that I’ve never brought up before. I think that’s me opening myself up to keep growing. But genuinely, I gave in that song as much as I could; I probably couldn’t go into much more detail comfortably. I think I need to slowly start edging towards opening up more, and this is kind of my first step into that ocean.”\n\n<b>“Lose Someone Like Me”</b>\n“It’s the biggest heartbreak that a young girl could have, which is with my best friend. It’s still raw. Even though it’s been a few years, I haven’t been able to write about it. And that’s why I almost didn’t release this song. And I know this person will know who it’s about. And this will be my version of reaching out. It’s important that I put it out there so I can move on.”\n\n<b>“I Get High”</b>\n“‘I Get High’ is about those best friends that you have, and you’re not old enough to go to clubs yet, but you get in cars with older boys at night, you sneak out, or you drink in the park, and you get up to mischief. Our feelings are so heightened at that age. As we get older, we have to subdue our emotions a lot more. There are great friendships when you’re that young and you share so much and go through so much together. I really wanted to touch on that.”\n\n<b>“We’ll See Stars”</b>\n“I wanted it to be about giving my sister one night of no worries. I just want her to be happy, and that flows into ‘Wonderful’ as well. This one’s about ‘let’s go out for the night, put all your worries aside, let’s have a sister night. I want you to experience life to its fullest and I want you to let go and have a good time.’ I picture my sister running around the city at night just having a good time.”\n\n<b>“Dance With Me”</b>\n“I wanted this song to feel bassy and ’80s, kind of giving a vibe of Robyn’s ‘Call Your Girlfriend’ or ‘Dancing on My Own.’ But even though sonically you’re moving to it, you’re dancing to it, the lyrics are sad. And I love that. The song doesn’t mean you’re physically dancing. Whatever the thing that you and your partner used to do when you were at your happiest moment, I’m sitting here in that spot waiting for you to come back to me, but you’re nowhere to be seen. So I’m just here on my own.”\n\n<b>“Figure It Out”</b>\n“This is the first track I wrote for the album. I wanted time to grow. I think everyone needs time to grow. People think that your first or biggest thing is just who you are now, and that’s such a defining factor of everything. But I think it’s important that everyone gets that opportunity to grow, and I think I’m asking for it in that chorus.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful”</b>\n“It’s about my sister, or it could be my best friend. There’s times where they’re at their lowest, and you just want to give them your perspective so that they could see how much potential they have, even though their brain isn’t letting them see that. It’s just about trying to help them at their worst.”\n\n<b>“Raise Me Up”</b>\n“Another song about desperation in a relationship, just wanting to be seen and heard. The song is about needing help and asking for it.”\n\n<b>“Dreaming”</b>\n“‘Dreaming’ could be about a friendship or love. For me it’s both. [It’s saying] I don’t know if it’s all in my head, but I think we’re growing apart. It goes into detail in the verses, but then it goes back to ‘but is it all in my head?’ So not really knowing.”\n\n<b>“You Don’t Know Me Like That”</b>\n“This is about a stalker. I have this stalker that comes to my house, leaves random stuff. I’ve got this massive thing they wrote me. I didn’t ever mean to talk about this. But my friend that I wrote it with, we just loved it so much. It’s got a nice vibe to it. But ultimately, it’s about trying to get rid of a stalker.”\n\n<b>“John Doe”</b>\n“‘John Doe’ is about someone that you meet and you have that instant connection, but you don’t want to say anything or do anything. It’s about wanting to go to that person and know more about them and see if there’s something there but [you’re] a bit hesitant.”\n\n<b>“Sorrento”</b>\n“David is my papa. A year before he passed I said, ‘For my wedding present I would love for you to write me your life story.’ And he wrote that for me. I just thought I’d share a little memory of him, and now it will be there forever.”\n\n<b>“Need You to Love Me”</b>\n“It starts a bit more vulnerable. It starts like you’re right there, I’m right there in front of you, singing about a relationship and the struggles of that. And then it turns into a little bit more of an upbeat kind of [song]. This album is the only time I’ve ever written about love. It’s really also about the struggles in relationships. It’s almost like I’m trying to convince myself, ‘Do I deserve better?’ Which is so vulnerable to say.”\n\n<b>“Only One”</b>\n“I was going through such a hard time when I wrote this song—serious heartbreak. And I couldn’t write anything. I was just so sad. I wanted to be so angry, but the chorus is [saying], ‘I still think that you’re the one for me.’ Which is the head fuck about it. ‘I have so much love for you, this is so hard.’”\n\n<b>“Live Without Your Love”</b>\n“This one was written a long time ago. This is about my friend; she is so happy. I realized the friendship that she gives me is so important. It helps me become a better person; it helps me see the brighter sides. If I was running around with another pessimist, then I would be doubling down on myself. And so it ended up being ‘we’re never going to be the same person, but I love you for that. And I can’t live without your love.’”\n\n<b>“Call My Name”</b>\n“I realized I had a lot of vulnerability in the album. So I wanted to have that more four-to-the-floor moment, just to showcase that a little bit more. I haven’t got a big, long story about the lyrics; it’s two professional songwriters [Watson and Jenna Andrews] in a room writing a pop song. And that is what that is.”","short":"Tones reveals all on album no. 2: “I wanted to be vulnerable.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beautifully-ordinary/1750786165","playParams":{"id":"1750786165","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2TLyLOzYh6qo5N0blioQn8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750786165/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1488123516","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1488123516?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723781798196}}},"1750922465":{"id":"1750922465","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750922465?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c1/34/c9/c134c950-76c3-256b-2106-063665f76dbc/72f442e5-4c3d-47ab-93e0-b28a8275db2d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bec2bf","textColor2":"cdd0c9","textColor4":"acaca5","textColor1":"e4ebea","bgColor":"271e13","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/peter-cat-recording-co/526977614","name":"Beta","artistName":"Peter Cat Recording Co.","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8a/5c/4b/8a5c4b58-f528-9006-7d3d-fa3f4705c251/46624.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"efc2df","textColor2":"e7e7f4","textColor4":"e2badb","textColor1":"f8f1f9","bgColor":"cc0578","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On this follow-up to their international breakthrough, 2019’s <i>Bismillah</i>, Peter Cat Recording Co.’s lead singer Suryakant Sawhney hands over the mic to multi-instrumentalist Kartik Pillai and bassist Dhruv Bhola on three tracks.

Here, he leans in to the qualities that marked him out as such a compelling talent to begin with—melodic instrumentals, sharp wordplay, dexterous flows, emotional veracity—and ups his game. \n\nThe production is elevated: sleeker, more complex. “Diamond Blick” ornaments an otherwise ominous beat with sweet-toned flourishes reminiscent of early-2000s R&B, while skittering drums meet ruminative piano and soulful guitar licks on “Peepholes.” Collaborations with peers like Rylo Rodriguez, another leading figure in the Alabama hip-hop scene, sit alongside cuts featuring French Montana and Quavo—unambiguous indications of NoCap’s rapid rise through the ranks. \n\nThematically, women are a preponderance; often, the desire for success clashes with more primal needs: “And I know that it should be the money/But somehow I got you on my conscious,” he confesses on the moody ’90s-rock-influenced highlight “One More Summer.” And while NoCap’s raw honesty is still the most essential facet of his wide appeal, it’s the amalgamation of disparate musical inspirations and his versatile cadence that make <i>Before I Disappear Again</i> such an unpredictable and thrilling listen.","short":"The Alabama rapper clears his own bar on his dynamic second record."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/before-i-disappear-again/1751364209","playParams":{"id":"1751364209","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6agdmpAaTKDYHrG2R7dl0U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751364209/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1237732480","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1237732480?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806113443}}},"1751786094":{"id":"1751786094","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751786094?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trench/1512480456","name":"BETWEEN INVERTED WORLDS","artistName":"Trench","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/63/77/f7/6377f799-478d-5e78-9614-d4537013664e/821826038271.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbc5b6","textColor2":"b5ead6","textColor4":"91bbab","textColor1":"fff7e4","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Comeback Kid, Cult of Luna, and more join the metallic hardcore fray."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/between-inverted-worlds/1751786094","playParams":{"id":"1751786094","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21gevsZN8dkPfn2qqFODEo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751786094/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1512480456","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1512480456?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723753632295}}},"1751825129":{"id":"1751825129","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751825129?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f3/96/4d/f3964dbf-c822-988c-332a-302b9776f389/3c63ce1c-5eb4-4b4e-bda7-8a893fbaa5b2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a396","textColor2":"cbc3b5","textColor4":"a6a094","textColor1":"dac7b7","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5f/17/55/5f1755b2-0a6a-71a6-934b-b45c4fcae96b/506b7a28-8d53-4f8a-b01f-33d7c731315f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"152125","textColor2":"151415","textColor4":"202d32","textColor1":"070504","bgColor":"4b8fa8","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/440629621","name":"Flight b741","artistName":"King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/01/4a/9c/014a9c4b-b6c4-8edf-9921-c2119e183485/24UMGIM63041.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"0d232e","textColor2":"2b231c","textColor4":"2f3f43","textColor1":"000003","bgColor":"41b1de","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A band doesn’t reach the 26-album mark without its members feeling incredibly comfortable with each other. So it makes sense that Melbourne psych ensemble King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard set aside their usual album-corralling concepts this time to just capture six mates playing together in a room. More than that, leader Stu Mackenzie encouraged a pass-the-mic approach that sees every band member sing, including the vocal debut of drummer Michael Cavanagh on “Le Risque.” Fun little improvisations make the round-robin vibe feel all the more spontaneous—check out the scat section at the end of “Rats in the Sky”—as does each song launching into the next with no space in between. \n\nMusically, this material is more jaunty than heavy: Even when “Hog Calling Contest” shows off the band’s signature hairpin shifts, it’s in the service of a rustic romp. Equally rootsy is opener “Mirage City,” whose communal harmonies and twang evoke The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers alike. Yet, darker themes lurk behind the band’s sunny exterior, as that first track finds solidarity in escapism via lyrics about parents fighting at home and being desperate to “leave this nightmare behind.” The closing “Daily Blues” similarly offsets its harmonica-licked roadhouse flair with the ominous refrain “Gettin’ fucked up daily.” Just because King Gizz is doubling down on camaraderie doesn’t mean Mackenzie and co can’t air their troubles for each other.

He was just short of 20 years old, and a handful of months away from becoming a household name for his downcast but earworm-y rap melodies. As it turns out, he was off: The Texas-raised singer and guitarist was actually 29 upon the release of his first full-length foray into country music, a pairing so natural you wonder what took him so long.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to make a record like this, but for the longest time it seemed so inaccessible, because I didn’t know how the hell it worked,” Malone tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. He’d never recorded with a full band, nor understood the nuances of the well-oiled Nashville songwriting machine. But he’d grown up listening to his mom’s favorites like Hank Williams and George Strait while his dad played ’90s country stars like Brad Paisley and Tim McGraw. Soon enough, Malone found himself in Nashville with heavy hitters like Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, and HARDY, jamming out until 6 am. (“I learned that’s not usually how it goes,” he adds. “It’s usually a pretty nine-to-five-type deal.”)\n\nFrom the tracklist, you might peg <i>F-1 Trillion</i> as an album where the guests do the heavy lifting, loaded as it is with the hottest names in modern country (Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll) and legends like Dolly Parton and Hank Williams, Jr. But Malone’s a natural as a honky-tonk crooner, delivering down-and-out ballads like “Losers” with the pathos cranked to 11 and boot-scootin’ boogie numbers like “Finer Things” with grit and swagger (“Platinum on my teeth, wagyu on my grill, and George Jones crankin’ out my Coup de Ville,” he crows on the latter). And though singles like “I Had Some Help” (featuring Wallen) and “Guy for That” (featuring Combs) are plagued by heartaches and hangovers, the typically moody Malone sounds like he’s having more fun than ever.\n\nHe chalks part of that up to a much-needed change of scenery. “Working [in LA], I’ve always felt very distracted,” he says. “It’s nice to go to Nashville and meet people who are the best at what they do, and who are super kind and talented.” (Working with lifelong heroes like Parton, Paisley, and McGraw doesn’t hurt, either.) Part of that’s due to his own personal growth, especially since the birth of his daughter, now 2, to whom he dedicated the album’s sweet closing song. “For a while, it was heavy on me,” he admits. “And for once, I’m not sad anymore.” Nearly a decade into his career, <i>F-1 Trillion</i> feels like a joyful homecoming: an embrace of his youth through the lens of his improbable adulthood. “That’s the cool shit about music,” he says with a 12-carat grin. “You can love everything.”","short":"Posty goes Nashville: “I’ve always wanted to make a record like this.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/f-1-trillion/1752531522","playParams":{"id":"1752531522","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3gHZ4w03gbuZtGTEwztrtw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752531522/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"966309175","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/966309175?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723817548005}}},"1752642525":{"id":"1752642525","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752642525?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/manu-l%C3%B3pez-sound/1549422641","name":"Future Flux -

It clocks in at just over 11 minutes total, and not one of its five tracks hits the three-minute mark, catering to a younger demographic that doesn’t judge a track by its length and acting as a polished pop introduction to members Manon, Sophia, Daniela, Lara, Megan, and Yoonchae in the process. \n\nWhile the KATSEYE sextet is based in Los Angeles, the individual members hail from across the United States, Korea, Switzerland, and the Philippines, and include the first Indian, Filipino, Latina, and Black artists to be signed under Korean music giant HYBE. They were ultimately selected to be part of HYBE and Geffen’s girl group from more than 120,000 applications. <i>SIS</i> is a peek into why. \n\nEven without the K-pop-level choreography that accompanies many of these tracks, these teens and young adults—ages 16 to 22 at the time of their debut—impress in their execution. While pre-release singles “Debut” and “Touch” are airy earworms about pop-star confidence (“I don't need nobody tryna tell me how to run it/Found myself some baddies ’bout to turn it to a hundred”) and a foolish could-have-been lover (“You could've had my love, but you been so out of touch”), respectively, confessional-style anthems “My Way,” “I’m Pretty,” and “Tonight I Might” give <i>SIS</i> more texture.\n\nThe Bang Si-hyuk-penned ballad “My Way” (“Never wanna do what I'm told/Even if I mess it all up and make a million mistakes/At least I can say that I did it my way”) allows some gorgeous glimpses into main vocalists Lara and Sophia's texture. But it’s the moments of full-group vocal harmonies heard across the album that are the most satisfying—a taste of the kind of all-in, culture-shaping global group KATSEYE aspires to be.","short":"A five-track introduction to a new global pop girl group."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sis-soft-is-strong-ep/1753359526","playParams":{"id":"1753359526","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753359526/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1754284416","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1754284416?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723782714771}}},"1754126895":{"id":"1754126895","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754126895?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/miraj-au/1687435928","name":"Mondrian - Single","artistName":"Miraj (AU)","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4f/11/91/4f1191cb-a12c-010b-0278-7e509d7b58c3/4250101473555_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343333","textColor2":"2b2a2a","textColor4":"555455","textColor1":"010000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mondrian-single/1754126895","playParams":{"id":"1754126895","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754126895/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1687435928","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1687435928?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723782890420}}},"1754622972":{"id":"1754622972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754622972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bf/d5/48/bfd54826-c534-1dd5-9f87-989b2495342d/Jobe7d5e309-1739-4fdc-8af0-ac999cf0ce2b-173576933-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_338368639_1860541177-Time1723504973978.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","141412"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2b2b2a","textColor2":"141412","textColor4":"32322f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3e/fb/cb/3efbcbc2-0504-ea20-af81-37eb0b6f243a/40771efc-d29f-4dbc-9270-58aad28407fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b8a288","textColor2":"d39e7b","textColor4":"b58669","textColor1":"d6c2a3","bgColor":"3e2420","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/95/10/d4/9510d46f-1651-9fd0-0cfc-55e33fa1f227/Jobc0816847-8543-45d0-ae9d-fe9d41e941bd-173576934-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_338368638_1860541176-Time1723506770647.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","181818"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2d2d2b","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"383837","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/88/74/57/88745715-e56a-4196-e884-6ed530733e04/3617c5d5-ff72-4106-9176-e7f52d427871.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"1f1f1f","textColor2":"0e0f0e","textColor4":"282927","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"90908c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4b/24/9a/4b249a50-a956-7c4e-d02b-82f45d4a3acc/70f4d483-017d-4aaa-bf5c-6226e8974c17.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ab9b9a","textColor2":"c6afac","textColor4":"a2908d","textColor1":"d1bebd","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/khalid/82842423","name":"Sincere","artistName":"Khalid","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/92/2c/b5/922cb578-1316-ec02-73ad-c34d55f6254a/196872246032.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2b2c29","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"393938","textColor1":"080906","bgColor":"bbbab5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Khalid’s journey into the music industry began at 19 with the release of his acclaimed debut album <i>American Teen</i>—a coming-of-age story filled with the trials and tribulations of burgeoning adolescence. Khalid’s unfiltered lyricism and earnest portrayal of adolescent frustrations and anxieties resonated with many and propelled him to stardom. At 21, he released <i>Free Spirit</i>, a soulful meditation that saw the singer-songwriter shedding the naivety of his teenage years and marking his first step into adulthood. Half a decade after <i>Free Spirit</i>, Khalid is back and better than ever and ready to show his fans his growth with the release of his third studio LP, <i>Sincere</i>. “I needed to take that break,” he tells Apple Music. “I needed to stop. And I don’t look at it in a place of being afraid to come back. If I’m going to take this break, when I come back, I’ll come back with more clarity. I’ll come back with a better choice of decisions, more maturity, more knowledge.”\n\nOn <i>Sincere</i>, Khalid proudly shows off that new knowledge, drawing inspiration from life experiences over five years and showcasing his evolution not only as an artist but as a person as well. “It was a very difficult process in naming this album, because I had to find one that summed up what I really felt in this music,” he says. “I thought of it as my most vulnerable in a while, because when I’m thinking of these songs, I’m saving them over the year like, ‘Okay, no, I have to keep this.’ And that’s vulnerable because I’ve known the songs’ impact on me when I was in the studio. I believe that if I trust my intention and I trust my heart, then it’ll have a similar impact to my listener.”\n\nThroughout the album’s 16 tracks, Khalid shares intimate vignettes about the lessons he’s learned, whether it’s about heartbreak (“It’s All Good,” “Broken,” “Tainted”), loneliness (“Who’s There to Pick Me Up,” “Decline”), or falling in love (“Adore U,” “Altitude”). However, not every song on the project is about love lost: Khalid is introspective on the soul-searching and dreamy track “Ground,” where he details his experience with psychedelics due to feeling uncertain within his career. On the Arlo Parks duet “Breathe,” Khalid is transparent as he yearns for freedom from the darkness of his mind. “When I listen to this album, you can see the time that it took,” he says. “You can see the time.”\n","short":"On his third album, the singer-songwriter showcases his

Album","standard":"“When I'm telling you I have three albums ready, they're ready,” J Balvin tells Apple Music. “Maybe I’ll go crazy and start dropping a new song every Thursday.” The Colombian superstar’s claims of a surplus of some 200 songs make sense, especially given how little music he’s shared with the world in recent years. After paving a path for the next generation of reggaetoneros with his explosive mid-2010s albums <i>Energía</i> and <i>Vibras</i>, not to mention the artful <i>Colores</i> in 2020, his activity noticeably decreased following 2021’s personal yet poppy <i>JOSE</i>.\n\nOf course, he’d hardly vanished from the scene, dropping singles and features with everyone from Maluma and Ryan Castro to Imagine Dragons and USHER. Yet after keeping up an exhaustive schedule for the better part of a decade, his relative absence on the release front and principled retreat from social media suggested a greater focus on family and fatherhood, along with a publicly stated commitment to his mental health. “You will never see me blasting someone on IG,” he says, citing his young son as a reason for avoiding the negative gossip and tiraera bait common in the genre. “I just respect you or I don't respect you, but that's personal.”\n\nThree years after his last album, <i>Rayo</i> represents Balvin the way he sees himself right now. Clearly disinterested in resigning himself to legacy status, he devotes himself once more to music with a keen interest in the contemporary coupled with deep reverence for what came before. To this end, he reunites with some of the producers from across his discography, from hitmaking mainstays like Sky Rompiendo (“I wouldn't be J Balvin without Sky,” he quips) to still-rising talents like fellow Colombian L.E.X.V.Z. Even as he links with ascendant artists like SAIKO and Luar La L, he reconnects here with erstwhile collaborators whose own careers have taken off exponentially, not the least of which being Feid. “I have so much respect for him,” he says of the Medellín-bred star who co-wrote Balvin’s early hits “Sigo Extrañándote” and “Ginza” before coming into his own. \n\nReggaetón plays prominently throughout <i>Rayo</i>, though it’s not the sole sonic expression on offer here. Vibrant tracks like “3 Noches” and the surprising Carín León team-up “Stoker” reflect Balvin’s role as a pioneer of fusing Afrobeats with Spanish-language music, a practice now employed by an increasing number of reggaetoneros and Latin pop acts. “To me, it's like the new reggae,” he says. “It just sounds good everywhere you are at any time.” Having previously collaborated with genre leaders like Burna Boy and Wizkid, he comfortably and passionately operates within the style without fear of losing fans. “I'm in a really beautiful position where I don't have to prove myself to the world,” he says. Read on to learn about some of J Balvin’s favorite songs from <i>Rayo</i>—in his own words.\n\n<b>“Cosa De Locos”</b>\n“Normally when it comes to reggaetón, they do more the hard intro, more street, like, ‘I’m the man with the biggest balls’—which is dope. I respect that, and it’s part of our culture, but it’s just not what I wanted to do. My energy on this album was just so full of happiness and joy. When the beat starts, it creates an ambience. This is how my energy is right now to share with you, and this is the way I want to start it. I call it happy reggaetón. I love that that’s the first one on the album.” \n\n<b>“Polvo de tu Vida” (feat. Chencho Corleone)</b>\n“Me and Chencho, we do great things, and we haven't had the opportunity to work together solo. I never made these songs thinking about someone. When I finished the album, I was like, let’s see if there's any song that is screaming for a feature. This is a good thing of doing music, just not thinking about the features, about what's going to happen. It's better just to focus on the song, and then it's not premeditated. We flew to Dubai together to shoot the video. We had, of course, a long flight, so we went to the bar. He taught me a lot of reggaetón history. It’s priceless to share with a legend like him.”\n\n<b>“Swat” (feat. Luar La L)</b>\n“Luar La L’s song is one of my favorites. I love the way he raps, I love the way he flows on the beat. It's those types of features that you don't see it coming. He's definitely running the streets. The vibe was amazing.”\n\n<b>“Doblexxó” (feat. Feid)</b>\n“It gives me nostalgia, because I remember us back in time. I'm really grateful for him, and I knew he was going to make it. You can get lost a little bit when you start writing songs for everyone, and then you might lose your ID or DNA. I think what he did was discover himself. It's also beautiful how patient he was, because you got to understand, we—Maluma, KAROL G—blew up way before him. We went together to the studio in LA, just me and him. We just wanted to make it so intimate. This song is definitely a Medellín song. That's Medellín reggaetón, and it makes me so proud.”\n\n<b>“3 Noches”</b>\n“Afrobeats is one of my biggest passions. From me starting working with Mr Eazi, we both invest in the new artists from Africa; we’re partners in a company where we find who's going to be the next one. ‘3 Noches,’ man, it's a lot of people's favorite on the album, let me tell you. I did it with Michaël Brun from Haiti. It just comes so easy to make the melodies, because I listen to these guys all the time. I just try to be the most respectful I can be with their genre.”\n\n<b>“Gaga” (feat. SAIKO)</b>\n“This kid, he came like he knows us forever and he was giving us what to do, which we loved it because we knew that he knows and he is a great artist. We were so impressed. He definitely knows what he wants and his taste is top-tier, man. I see this kid humble, enjoying the process, which definitely makes me think about there were some moments that I didn't enjoy my success growing up. Maybe I was so caught up in the business that I didn't have the time to digest so many things and enjoy it to the fullest.”\n\n<b>“La Noche” (feat. Dei V)</b>\n“Dei V is the reason why I started the album, and he doesn't even know! I just went to the studio to have fun; I never thought about making an album. I remember being in Miami with Jeremy Ayala, a producer that I love and a close friend, and O’Neill, a great artist and songwriter/producer. We went to the studio, we invite Dei V. I remember me having fun as the way when I started doing music. We did this song so fast, but it was because we were so connected. It's a pure reggaetón, man.”\n\n<b>“Stoker” (feat. Carín León)</b>\n“This guy Carín impressed me of his vision of music. It reminds me of <i>Vibras</i>—so open to try different sounds. He listens to every type of genre, which is not normally what you see in these artists, because I understand that they're so into the regional and they're so into the corridos. When I start talking with this guy, he knew about vallenato from Colombia, he knew about salsa, he knew a lot of Ed Sheeran. This guy is so open-minded, I think I can do something that is going to take him out of the comfort zone. He sent us the song, but it was totally his sound. I’m like, wait, we can make a twist here. No one has heard [him] in an Afrobeats drum pattern. On respect, I called him before we made the surgery. He was just like, 'Yes, that's what I was looking for!'”\n","short":"The Colombian superstar returns with what he calls “happy

Album","standard":"Calvin Harris is one of the UK’s most prolific—and successful—DJs and producers. Since the mid 2010s, he’s been splitting his attention between his disco-influenced <i>Funk Wav Bounces</i> albums and the more electronic-leaning Love Regenerator project, alongside a constant stream of the dance-pop hits he is best known for. Arriving in August 2024, <i>96 Months</i> collects 15 of those singles together in one place: eight years worth of Harris-produced chart-toppers and his own anthemic floor-fillers—plus two more recent cuts with returning collaborators Ellie Goulding and Rag’n’Bone Man.\n\nWith the speed and intensity at which trends in music can shift and evolve over the better part of 10 years, it’s a testament to Harris’ timeless ear that <i>96 Months</i> (a “greatest hits” by any other name) plays more like an album of fresh material than a catalog retrospective. Indeed, the earliest releases included here—“How Deep Is Your Love” the ubiquitous 2015 teamup with Disciples and 2016’s equally omnipresent “This Is What You Came For,” a Taylor Swift co-write with a lead vocal from Rihanna—still sound just as commanding and au courant as the newer material these tracks sit alongside. So too, does the 2019 rework of “I’m Not Alone,” which beefs up the thumping dance beat to surpass even the stratosphere-busting levels of the original mix. \n\nElsewhere, “Nuh Ready Nuh Ready,” a pulsing, dancehall-flavored rhythm captained by Canadian R&B star PARTYNEXTDOOR showcases Harris’ versatility, while the back-to-back knockout of “One Kiss” featuring Dua Lipa and “Promises” with Sam Smith illustrates why the biggest artists in the world turn to the Scottish hitmaker when they’re looking to make a splash. Though it may not offer anything fans of Harris won’t have heard before, <i>96 Months</i> provides an excellent excuse to spin the classics all over again.","short":"An eight-year run of euphoric dance hits that still sound brand-new."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/96-months/1760348185","playParams":{"id":"1760348185","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5uRY0boZn48gDio0ASlgI0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760348185/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"201955086","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/201955086?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723782890540}}},"1760560528":{"id":"1760560528","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760560528?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/frankydrama/1701988414","name":"ODD002 - EP","artistName":"frankydrama","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d9/75/5e/d9755e92-af4b-736c-f522-6a1d47d8e14d/5056467387180_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"231f34","textColor2":"201727","textColor4":"25313a","textColor1":"1d001f","bgColor":"3b9c89","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/odd002-ep/1760560528","playParams":{"id":"1760560528","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760560528/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1701988414","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1701988414?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723781397845}}},"1760625610":{"id":"1760625610","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760625610?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alkaline-trio/2901509","name":"The Sacrifice / At Sickness - Single","artistName":"Alkaline Trio","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/79/90/4b/79904bd9-18ec-056f-b119-1e7ad020d240/4099964119558.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"ecc8b6","textColor2":"ffd4c7","textColor4":"f0aba0","textColor1":"faf8e2","bgColor":"b40a06","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sacrifice-at-sickness-single/1760625610","playParams":{"id":"1760625610","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760625610/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2901509","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2901509?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806780325}}},"1760674272":{"id":"1760674272","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760674272?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/14/9f/70/149f706d-0395-3043-cc28-6396384d834b/1ca46615-c61d-4db8-bc6c-556108876f35.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"5a4d47","textColor2":"442f25","textColor4":"67564e","textColor1":"34241c","bgColor":"f4f4f4","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e2/9f/03/e29f0372-0eca-8a87-7ab3-f659ebd2b8bd/62c0af86-6621-4405-8227-bfd07b3215a3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"564c47","textColor2":"382f29","textColor4":"605954","textColor1":"2c1f1a","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tinashe/464835513","name":"Quantum Baby","artistName":"Tinashe","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f4/f2/df/f4f2df5e-52b0-1ad0-b1c0-cb285fe97d06/43428.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9b1bc","textColor2":"cac6db","textColor4":"a7a2b4","textColor1":"e0d9e5","bgColor":"1b0f18","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"<i>Quantum Baby</i>, the seventh album from Tinashe and the second part of a trilogy following 2023’s <i>BB/ANG3L</i>, arrives with more eyes on the R&B star than ever before thanks to the viral success of “Nasty,” an intimate, intoxicating R&B-dance hybrid that quickly became one of 2024’s defining songs. “I crafted [it] to try to get that exact same energy when I was just driving in my car,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “The performance of it really affects just how people are interpreting the song and how people are receiving it.”\n\nThough there may not prove to be another song that finds as many ears as the single, <i>Quantum Baby</i> is still the portrait of an artist at the peak of their powers. There are plenty of other sterling moments to latch on to: “Thirsty” is light as air, with Tinashe’s falsetto floating above pillowy synths and percussion that bubbles like a cauldron. “When I Get You Alone” is a sexy R&B jam laced with deep desires and plenty of quotable lines. When Tinashe sings, “Flying, top gun/Feels like heaven/Wilding, we’re young/Fuck it, have fun,” she’s also recapping the philosophy of the <i>Quantum Baby</i> era.\n\nIt’s why, in part, Tinashe never let the success of “Nasty” change her approach. “I'm just trying to live in the moment as much as possible and not focus on that, because these moments don't happen every day,” she says. “And I hope that my continued hard work [can help me] maximize on it as much as we possibly can. We stay the course.” ","short":"Hello, “Nasty”—the viral hit anchors the R&B star’s seventh album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/quantum-baby/1760674272","playParams":{"id":"1760674272","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6lCHEpHcYgC24XO87InJjZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760674272/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"464835513","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/464835513?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723813544689}}},"1760710450":{"id":"1760710450","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760710450?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kard/1215832588","name":"KARD 7th Mini Album 'Where To Now?

On “PROMOTION,” which features a cheeky chorus from Future, Ye complains about his girl troubles, rapping, “When she want attention, she disguise it as a post/I forgot to mention, she was mine before she yours.” \n\nYe and Ty often expand their scope beyond ladies and luxury, like on “RIVER,” which features stirring string swells and a knocking drum groove. Yeezy pays tribute to the song’s featured artist, Young Thug, realizing that despite the pain in his life, freedom is priceless: “Too much money to be in the streets/Too much money to spend all on me/Too much hate and not enough love/Free Larry, free Young Thug.”\n","short":"The duo swoops in with a second helping of their VULTURES collab."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vultures-2/1760905142","playParams":{"id":"1760905142","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760905142/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1718573158","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1718573158?l=en-US"},{"id":"2715720","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2715720?l=en-US"},{"id":"602917745","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/602917745?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723806821045}}},"1760913470":{"id":"1760913470","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760913470?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/david-castellani/893716222","name":"Immutable - Single","artistName":"David Castellani","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/c9/40/0dc94070-d007-5c82-4e80-c08642c36f6b/4251804193627_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d0d0","textColor2":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"9f9f9f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"161719","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/immutable-single/1760913470","playParams":{"id":"1760913470","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760913470/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"893716222","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/893716222?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723781602129}}},"1761264602":{"id":"1761264602","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761264602?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Neo-Soul","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/93/6f/68/936f68a3-2637-24d4-de27-91f1dbf39efa/6d102e67-629f-4d7c-a609-3ada474ed5c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3f3e3e","textColor2":"1a1f21","textColor4":"394245","textColor1":"221b18","bgColor":"b3cdd4","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f0/d9/0d/f0d90de5-6cd4-5b91-5215-d9f3fd9b1115/e560c40e-277c-4739-bdbf-69be95401be6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"50555b","textColor2":"2d3132","textColor4":"565857","textColor1":"262d37","bgColor":"f8f5ea","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kali-uchis/894731301","name":"ORQUÍDEAS PARTE 2","artistName":"Kali Uchis","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/06/64/98/06649847-5932-d903-7c0b-8e35192a0568/24UMGIM79098.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8397b5","textColor2":"239ae1","textColor4":"1c7eb9","textColor1":"a4b9dc","bgColor":"000d1b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"No matter what language she chooses, Kali Uchis continually proves herself to be a versatile performer. Following 2020’s <i>Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)</i> and its hit single “telepatía,” the bilingual Colombian American singer returned to English for 2023’s soulful <i>Red Moon in Venus</i>. Then came <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i>, with lyrics primarily (though not exclusively) in Spanish. Here, she delivers an exquisite pop-wise R&B set, one replete with clubby highs and balladic depth. \n\nThe dance floor is well-served with cuts like “Me Pongo Loca” and “Pensamientos Intrusivos,” her ethereal vocals elevating them further. She indulges alt-jazzier leanings on “Tu Corazón Es Mío…” and embraces tropical pop fully on the tempo-shifting “Dame Beso // Muévete.” The collaborations reflect her journey as well as her status, linking with superstar KAROL G on the polished perreo throwback “Labios Mordidos” and música mexicana sensation Peso Pluma for the romantic duet “Igual Que Un Ángel.” On “Muñekita,” she bridges her two worlds with the aid of Dominican dynamo El Alfa and City Girls rapper JT, who combine to produce an irresistible dembow moment. Later, Rauw Alejandro brings his pop futurism to the thumping “No Hay Ley Parte 2.”\n\nThough the title <i>ORQUÍDEAS PARTE 2</i> might suggest an entirely new installment, this expanded edition arrives some eight months after the first with four additional tracks. “Adicto” returns to her R&B foundations with provocative lyrics and surging synths, while the dreamy “Simple” drifts between languages to deliver its inherently romantic message. The seductively slow pacing of “Young Rich & In Love” holds on KAYTRANADA’s remix, which augments the original with ample percussion and subtler choral accents. Finally, “Como Debe Ser” centers her as a Latin balladeer, its various genre shifts maintaining the emotionality of her impassioned performance.","short":"The Colombian American star updates her exquisite Spanish-language set."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/orqu%C3%ADdeas-parte-2/1761264602","playParams":{"id":"1761264602","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1quQQFsx3AcBBotzj9UXfS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761264602/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"894731301","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/894731301?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723805904261}}},"1761395961":{"id":"1761395961","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761395961?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/81/68/92/8168928c-9f39-a718-d380-d7953ca4391d/731a1b67-b61a-47e6-820b-02b0b67f7de8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3b3a6","textColor2":"c7d9ef","textColor4":"a2b1c2","textColor1":"efdccb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/benjamin-wallfisch/717362032","name":"Alien: Romulus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Benjamin Wallfisch","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/45/8b/4b/458b4be0-af2a-7d48-efa2-f953ee58008d/24UMGIM83849.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"f1cecd","textColor2":"f7c2bf","textColor4":"eb9e9a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"be0e09","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alien-romulus-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1761395961","playParams":{"id":"1761395961","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ATIqlNEKrhahipc3NiBqt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761395961/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"717362032","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/717362032?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1723769334986}}},"1761407127":{"id":"1761407127","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761407127?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1723886354-1594490446","name":"Disney Jr. Music: Playdate with Winnie the Pooh (Season 2) -

Babies bring inspiration and they make me want to be the best human being I can try to be.”\n\nHer sixth studio effort <i>Timeless</i> is a mix of vintage Trainor with a few twists, which she points out is intentional. “My fans love when I do pure pop,” she says. “And then a lot of the world likes when I do just the doo-wop stuff. So I try to make everybody happy, and so I tried to blend it together and was like, let's make a weird new genre that's different or something, or I haven't heard that in a while. And I love when that happens.” \n\n“To the Moon” certainly fits that bill, with a sound that meshes “All About That Bass” with circa-2006 Justin Timberlake. And “Been Like This,” a duet with T-Pain, starts with an old-timey jazz riff but transforms into a bouncy back-and-forth between the two singers, with Trainor’s signature sassiness in the lyrics (“Ain’t nothin’ new, still that bitch”). T-Pain, who also appears on “Love on Hold,” isn’t the album’s only special guest. \n\nThe pop-soul sibling duo Lawrence add their stylings to “Crushin’,” and “I Wanna Thank Me” features a snippet of Niecy Nash’s 2024 Emmys speech as well as the actor, her daughter, and her wife Jessica Betts on backing vocals. “I was like, ‘Please, I want you to feature on it, have publishing, because you inspired it, you're all over the song,” Trainor says. “And then I want your daughters and your wife to come sing background with you. Come over and we'll do the chorus together.'

off, he's got that voice. That voice which seems like it fell off of the classic rock convoy of 1972, but crossed with the gruff soul men of a generation before. It's hard not to feel something when he sings. LaMontagne knows this, but he doesn't go overboard. There's always that possibility that he could jump into the fire like Joe Cocker used to, but LaMontagne instead deals with musical atmospheres that revel in their love for soul and folk music, keeping things roots-y and never over the top. His voice and his songs simply add one more layer to the down-home, soulful mix."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ray-lamontagne/21917595"}},"24281998":{"id":"24281998","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/24281998?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["Alternative"],"name":"Panda
