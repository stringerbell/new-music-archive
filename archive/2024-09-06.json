Album and Interview","standard":"There are abundant signs of Max Richter’s love of minimalism on <i>In a Landscape</i>. The album features 19 short musical episodes written for stripped-back forces—string quintet, grand piano, Hammond organ, and MiniMoog, plus tape delays, vocoders, and reverbs. Its 10 compositions are interlocked with “Life Studies,” ambient interludes featuring snippets of recordings from everyday life to create snapshots of Richter’s world. \n\n“The title ‘In a Landscape’ can be heard in two ways: as it’s written, or as ‘in-ner landscape,’ as it sounds,” he explains to Apple Music Classical. “These are the kind of polarities that I’m exploring: between the external and the internal, electronic and instrumental, the technological world against the natural world.” \n\nThe album’s title is taken from maverick avant-gardist John Cage’s 1948 work for solo harp or piano, itself inspired by Erik Satie, and throughout Richter pays homage to the composers who have influenced him over the years. Along with the language of American minimalist composers such as Terry Riley and Philip Glass, who have made repetition an organizing feature of their work, and the beauty of everyday sounds that Cage himself explored, you’ll hear the influence of Baroque music—shades of Bach in the harmonies of “And Some Will Fall,” for example, and Purcellian sighs in “Late and Soon.”\n\nIn “Love Song,” the references are more explicit: its violin melody is borrowed directly from an opera by English 17th-century composer John Eccles, given added emotional resonance by Richter’s somber piano accompaniment. Elsewhere, most noticeably in “Andante,” it’s the light and dark of Schubert that Richter draws on, “just because I love his music and can’t leave him alone,” he says. \n\nRichter’s love of poetry—by Keats, Anne Carson, and Peter Redgrove, among others—is also drawn into the mix. “Late and Soon,” for example, takes its title from an 1802 sonnet in which Wordsworth laments the growing materialism of the Industrial Revolution, writing: “The world is too much with us; late and soon / Getting and spending, we lay waste to our powers; / Little we see in Nature that is ours.” “I was thinking, ‘Wow, he’s talking about Twitter basically, and the sort of distractedness of our lives,’” Richter says. “There isn’t any overarching poetic scheme; these are just jumping-off points and things that I have a kind of affection for. It’s a bit like you see something and you sort of love it. Then you want to explore it or elevate it in some way. And that’s really the way that these texts work in the piece.”\n\nThe same can be said of the way Richter appropriates found sounds to bring texture, atmosphere, and glimpses of autobiographical narrative to his interpolating “Life Studies.” Ranging from field recordings sourced in the woodland surrounding his studio to the noise of cities he travels through, they provide evocative “polaroid shots” of Richter’s life. “I love exploring places on foot,” he says. “So there’s lots of walking in nature. There’s downtown New York, Sydney, Berlin, bits of Paris, various airports. There’s stuff in our house. People jamming on the piano, while someone else is cooking, while someone else is whatever, feeding a dog or something—just domestic life.”\n\nIn many ways these interludes, both transient and ambient, bring us back to the playful ephemerality of Satie. But they are also a reminder of Richter’s love of using recorded material, first heard on his socio-politically aware breakthrough albums, 2002’s <i>Memoryhouse</i>, dealing in part with the Kosovo conflict in the Balkans, and 2004’s <i>The Blue Notebooks</i>, a protest album about the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While it makes no overt political statements, says Richter, <i>In a Landscape</i> is born out of his recognition of our need to reconcile differences. “We live in a very polarized world, and particularly, the online space is dominated by very shrill monologues. People who have a difference of opinion can’t talk to one another anymore. So I guess this principle of trying to put disparate elements together in one space creatively is a kind of political storytelling. It’s kind of a beautiful narrative.”","short":"Max Richter on putting the “polarities” of life under his musical

Never does he boast or get wild or throw his weight around, nor does he ever fall for trends, giving his plainness a Zenlike heft. He’s likable but a little quiet. You’d trust him with your car. To note that <i>Cowboys and Dreamers</i> marks his fifth decade in country is to suggest that it somehow feels different from his fourth decade, or his first. It doesn’t. \n\nHe counts his blessings (“The Little Things”) and salves some wounds (“People Get Hurt Sometimes”) and gives a little time to his rebellious side, which was always less of a rebellious side than a joke about a guy like George Strait having a rebellious side to begin with (“Honky Tonk Hall of Fame”). But best and most felt is Guy Clark and Keith Gattis’ “Rent,” in which a guy ponders what his life was worth only to conclude that at least he paid his rent. Sad on paper, maybe.

No, not the chillwave roots he became celebrated for in the late 2000s and early 2010s with initial singles and <i>Causers of This</i>, but his actual roots as a fan of pop punk, alternative, and rap music. “Hollywood,” which begins with a melodic bassline that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early Green Day record, features Death Cab for Cutie’s Ben Gibbard and finds Bear waxing somewhat nostalgically about his early days as Toro y Moi. “Poor navigation, who am I to blame?/No one even calls me by my real name,” he sings. “Heaven,” which features BROCKHAMPTON alumni Kevin Abstract and Lev, begins with a campfire-worthy acoustic guitar riff and layered vocals from Bear and his guests. The slow-burning alt-R&B jam finds Toro y Moi showcasing the natural beauty of his voice and imploring the song’s subject to find the joy he finds throughout the album: “Baby, let it go/Let it go.”","short":"On his eighth album, Chaz Bear taps into the music he grew up

EP","standard":"Fcukers arrived almost as explosively as the music they create, crashing down in New York City like a supernova to serve up electropop made for late nights and even later mornings. The trio of Shanny Wise, Jackson Walker Lewis, and Ben Scharf first emerged in 2023, but on their debut EP, <i>Baggy$$</i>, which came the following year, they sound like veterans of the indie-sleaze revival prevalent in the hippest corners of New York and across the country.\n\nEP opener “Bon Bon” is a shuffling dance cut built around Scharf’s propulsive percussion and low-end bass wobbles that will shake even the sturdiest club speakers. There’s an intoxicating nihilism reminiscent of turn-of-the-millennium acts like Death from Above 1979 and Basement Jaxx that runs through the track and the entire record. On “Homie Don’t Shake,” which has become a catchphrase of sorts for the band, Wise sings a mantra that might as well be a mission statement for the band: “Silk’s real, leather’s fake, say you’ll DJ at my wake/Blacked out, show up late, ’cause homie don’t shake.”","short":"The NYC band’s debut EP brings back indie sleaze and intoxicating

It’s a fitting name for an especially personal project from Kent, who pushed himself and his collaborators to go bigger and bolder after the success of his debut album, 2023’s <i>Blacktop</i>.\n\n“Instead of trying to make something that sounded like ‘Wild as Her,’ or something that sounded like any of the last record, it's like, ‘How do I create something new instead of recreating what’s already happened?’” Kent says. “It was important to me, too, to take some chances and do some new things and create some new sounds and let my voice be the common thread through the songs.” Highlights include “Nothing But Neon,” a ’90s-inspired ballad heavy on melody and mood, and “Damn Good Country Song,” a fresh take on finding inspiration in heartbreak. Lauren Alaina joins Kent on “Now or Never,” lending her powerhouse voice to an already affecting track. Below, Kent shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Ain’t Gonna Lie”/“Damn Good Country Song”</b>\n“I wanted a really starkly contrasted one-two punch to start the record, to throw out any stereotypes. What any fan would preconceive this record to be is out the window after song two, because you get hit with the opposite ends of the spectrum on the record. And, hopefully, what that shows is that we’re diverse and the thing that holds it all together is my voice and my ability to tell a story.”\n\n<b>“Black Bandana”</b>\n“We were actually at our ranch in Texas, and it was me, Rocky Block, Jordan Dozzi, and Brett Tyler. And Brett wrote ‘Wild as Her,’ so he knows my story and he’s been there for a lot of it. And he’s like, ‘I’ve been wanting to write this song with you called “Black Bandana.”’ And I was like, ‘Well that’s really cool, but what does that mean?’ And as we worked through that, I was like, ‘What’s the opposite of a black bandana?’ And there was this light-bulb moment. I wish there was a camera there to capture it because no one person had the idea before the next. We all looked at each other, and we were like, ‘A white flag.’”\n\n<b>“Now or Never” (feat. Lauren Alaina)</b>\n“I cut it as a song that I was just going to do by myself on this record and lived with it. The song was done. And then, over the next couple months was just like, ‘Man, I think maybe this should be a feature.’ We waited for months and months until we found the right fit. We’re playing this radio event, and it’s a songwriter’s round, if you will. And I’m sitting right next to Lauren, and I hear her sing, and I went, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ The tone, the control—she’s so powerful, man. There was just this beautiful mutual respect for each other and the work that we’ve put in on our crafts, to be capable of doing this live. And it was really cool. And then, we got in the studio and…I mean, she’s a professional. She had so many great instincts. She’s awesome.”\n\n<b>“So Far”</b>\n“I wrote that song on the day that I signed our record deal. And it was just a nice end to a chapter of life. I mean, I’d never had a record deal. Had a couple offers, but they didn’t work out, and it was a long and winding road of even leaving the music industry and exiting Nashville and moving to Texas. It was the end of a great chapter of crazy. And to go, ‘OK, and now the new chapter begins. How do I tie a nice bow on this?’ And my co-writers were awesome enough to go down that path with me, and I really wrote it as almost a love letter to my wife.”","short":"A sophomore album built

Album","standard":"The dream of the mid-2000s is alive in New York City, where Harrison Patrick Smith (better known as The Dare) has become the figurehead for a revivalist movement of a certain Myspace-era jouissance. The DJ, producer, and one-man electroclash band blew up in 2022 with “Girls,” a raunchy throwback to DFA Records’ heyday in feverish celebration of the ladies of the demimonde: “I like the girls that do drugs/Girls with cigarettes in the back of the club.”\n\nHis first full-length as The Dare refracts the touchstones of the indie-sleaze era: Blog Haus’ sawtooth synths, LCD Soundsystem’s sardonic punk funk, Peaches’ unrepentant horniness, Benny Benassi’s electro scuzz. “I’m in the club while you’re online!” Smith crows on “Good Time,” a Lower East Side jock-jam that doesn’t skimp on cowbell; “Open Up” and “You’re Invited” further extol the healing powers of touching grass. Glimmers of “Guess,” the Dare-produced Charli xcx bonus track, echo through the charmingly louche “Perfume.” Now, throw on your best vintage American Apparel and don’t come home ’til sunrise.","short":"The dream of mid-2000s NYC is alive in the producer’s throwback

Album","standard":"Sporting one of the most outsized personalities in all of hip-hop history, LL COOL J made rap braggadocio into an art form. During his mid-’80s emergence, the Queens-bred MC used his inherently aggressive delivery to prove himself bigger and deffer than the competition. In the ’90s, he channeled that tenacity even more effectively on the seminal <i>Mama Said Knock You Out</i> and its gritty successor <i>14 Shots to the Dome</i> while increasingly amplifying his libidinous loverman side to great commercial effect. It worked so well that, by the time he popularized the term “GOAT” on his sexually charged 2000 album of the same name, few could argue he wasn’t a contender for that prestigious title.\n\nYet those who arrived during James Todd Smith’s R&B crossover era, or the many more who’ve come to know him primarily as an actor on television and in film, may not know what a tremendous rapper he was—and remains. His first studio album in some 11 years, <i>THE FORCE</i> shows his microphone prowess has in no way waned over the past decade. There’s a core combativeness to his contemporary approach, unquestionably bolstered by the distressing and galvanizing events of recent years.\n\nOut the gate, on the Snoop Dogg-assisted “Spirit of Cyrus,” he conjures a vivid Black vigilante fantasy where racists receive their comeuppances in brutal fashion. With a similarly vibrant Busta Rhymes in his corner, he outlines a revolutionary mindset on the thunderous “Huey in the Chair.” As should be expected with an artist with his tenure, he also reveals a sentimentally nostalgic streak in a number of instances here, calling back to his come-up on “Basquiat Energy” and realizing that the you-can’t-go-home-again axiom rings truer than expected on “30 Decembers.” “Black Code Suite” synthesizes his tendencies quite beautifully, its Afrocentric bent mixing memory with militancy.\n\nPart of what makes <i>THE FORCE</i> such a tremendous record comes from producer Q-Tip. Rather than chase trends, the Natives Tongues veteran gives LL a series of instrumentals (and, on more than one occasion, hooks) that veer far from legacy-act stagnation and instead towards a mature yet rugged vibe. This translates to the laidback synth slap of the Saweetie duet “Proclivities” as much as the far squirmier funk of his Eminem collab “Murdergram Deux.” From the reconfigured throwbacks of “Passion” and “Post Modern” to the timeless grooves of “Runnit Back” and “Saturday Night Special,” their robust artist pairing ensures that <i>THE FORCE</i> is an album to reckon with.","short":"Don’t call it a

Album","standard":"“It's the most honest and it's the most vulnerable and it's what I've wanted to make for the longest time,” Alex O'Connor tells Apple Music's Matt Wilkinson. “So, having finished that and sending it out to the world now, it's kind of a strange feeling.” <i>The Alexander Technique</i>, O'Connor’s fifth album as Rex Orange County, finds him turning inward, examining the person he is and the way he wants to live in the world. On the sweet, experimental pop lullaby “2008,” Rex goes back to a simpler time, wishing he could clear his head like he did as a child. “Free your mind and treat it kindly/Ten years old, I was unbothered/Spent my hours in the garden/I was all right.”\n\nMany of the album’s themes are introduced on album opener “Alexander,” a beautiful piano ballad that finds Rex as naked and raw as ever. “I’ve had back pain for most of my life,” he sings with such clarity that you can practically hear fingers hitting the piano keys beneath his voice. Rex, at his doctor’s urging, begins to explore the mental effects that play a role in physical pain. He sings from the doctor’s point of view when he adds: “He said ease up on stress/You don’t help yourself much/It’s too intense for you to take/You’ll only tense up.” \n\nIt was this clarifying moment that led O’Connor to create <i>The Alexander Technique</i>. “It's about looking at yourself and trying to be present,” he says. “It’s not about doing the most or expecting things to be fantastic. It's mostly about trying to find peace and be well physically and mentally.”","short":"“It’s mostly about trying to find peace and be well,” says Alex O’Connor."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-alexander-technique/1757507089","playParams":{"id":"1757507089","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5HSZsS7TGsyMvur547zjVe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757507089/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1171059232","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1171059232?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725636267282}}},"1757742828":{"id":"1757742828","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757742828?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock","Pop","Pop/Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bleachers/824434533","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/89/fd/46/89fd46a7-e418-9aaf-893f-37faccdf1d85/bf98cd60-eb34-47a3-8032-eff4c9fbc1f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c3","textColor2":"d8d8d7","textColor4":"b1b1b0","textColor1":"f1f1ef","bgColor":"141414","hasP3":false}},"name":"A Stranger Desired","artistName":"Bleachers","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6a/0b/70/6a0b70aa-ada8-1a14-caf5-db68e518ae75/198704068782_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"434343","textColor2":"333333","textColor4":"5a5a5a","textColor1":"161616","bgColor":"f7f7f7","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","short":"Debut album Strange Desire reimagined with hindsight, clarity, and vulnerability."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-stranger-desired/1757742828","playParams":{"id":"1757742828","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0x56WwFMhKCTmSvXqo0UTC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757742828/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"824434533","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/824434533?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725618494613}}},"1758249156":{"id":"1758249156","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758249156?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jackson-dean/1101771218","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/50/83/ce5083e0-d05c-eb63-44c5-3b4c529ac544/Jobdedd4a7a-f09e-4b01-bad7-f39041d024d5-172950645-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337082103_1850991612-Time1722570373791.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","25120e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"1c212b","textColor2":"25120e","textColor4":"2f2d34","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a5/b1/3a/a5b13a86-e9ef-b4e9-bf29-ce8cab60e48e/2d075357-4502-453a-9f38-928f622ba1bc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2b6af","textColor2":"f2b094","textColor4":"c5907a","textColor1":"efe0d6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/72/92/4d/72924d39-dda9-1f3e-d488-1b4d4de7dc3b/Job693fafc9-f192-491d-ab2a-2942c586ef96-172950646-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_337082104_1850991613-Time1722571891935.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fcead0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d3dcdd","textColor2":"fcead0","textColor4":"d3d0c5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"On The Back Of My Dreams","artistName":"Jackson Dean","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6f/f8/d4/6ff8d4dd-a784-b55e-2b5e-b1fb90d5c5c7/24BMR0005574.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3c2c4","textColor2":"74c1f6","textColor4":"61a8e2","textColor1":"eee1d0","bgColor":"154794","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/on-the-back-of-my-dreams/1758249156","playParams":{"id":"1758249156","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58OONWKDrW7oJHfWUy68Vc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758249156/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1101771218","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1101771218?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725607665513}}},"1758761681":{"id":"1758761681","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758761681?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Ambient","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aphex-twin/39883194","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"th1 [evnslower] -

Album","standard":"Fred Gibson (aka Fred again..) is the kind of artist who can turn his formidable talents to anything—glossy pop productions for acts like Little Mix and Rita Ora; crowd-pleasing radio hits fronted by George Ezra and Ed Sheeran; thumping UK rap cuts featuring Stormzy and Aitch; electrifying club collaborations with Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia. His intuitive ability to create moments for others notwithstanding, Gibson—as previously demonstrated on his <i>Actual Life</i> series of albums—truly excels as a musical diarist of sorts, documenting short flashes of the world around him through sound. <i>ten days</i> is the latest chapter in the Grammy-winning producer’s story: 10 slices of contemplative electronica, each preceded by a short interlude of candid or off-the-cuff audio that grounds the track in a palpable experience.\n\nFront-loaded with softer grooves and evocative vocal performances, <i>ten days</i> is never too far removed from the ambient roots of Gibson’s tutelage under mentor Brian Eno—starry-eyed love song “adore u” utilizes the peerless tones of Obongjayar to great effect, while Sampha’s understated performance on “fear less” seems to ascend through sun-warmed air to end in the cool, echoing outer reaches of the atmosphere. Conversely, “just stand there” freefalls through SOAK’s poignant spoken-word delivery into a momentum-building drop that rattles on re-entry. \n\nThe lively zeal that Anderson .Paak and CHIKA bring to “places to be” at the album’s midpoint signals a switch-up in energy, and the latter half is dominated by more euphoric, emotional beats. “glow,” featuring a who’s who of leading dance music figures—Four Tet, Skrillex, Duskus—caters to the ravers; Joy Anonymous lend their signature class of boundless rapture to the anthemic “peace u need.” Elsewhere, a remix of “where will i be” strips the bright optimism from the original Emmylou Harris recording, rebuilding it into something more warped and existential. \n\nDespite his meteoric rise, Gibson is a DIY producer at heart, driven to find the soul-stirring sample potential in even the most mundane, everyday noises, and it’s cheering to note this romanticized inclination hasn’t been lost along the way. <i>ten days</i> may find him at that rarefied level of success that often translates as isolating and detached, but his discerning artistic choices—hi-hats that sound like they’ve been struck with cushion-tipped drumsticks and resonant basslines—soften the edges, retaining the intimacy and connection at the core of the Fred again.. brand.

A rare artist who balances the earned respect of legacy with a keenly contemporary understanding of the genre, the Puerto Rican American star has hardly left the scene since the mid- to late 2010s, participating in countless hits and timely collabs. Three years after the celebratory <i>Infinity</i>, his eighth studio album gives his restless energy another creative outlet. Its name acknowledging the late-night origins of the songs’ ideation, <i>INSOMNIO</i> turns scary hours into vibrant moments. Perreo opportunities obviously propagate here, particularly alongside Luar La L on “LA CYBER” and Ryan Castro on the rugged throwback “CHICOKIS,” yet he hardly settles on any one sound. The title track and his Beéle team-up “CALOR” burst with distinctly different tropical vibes, while “EXÓTICA” eases into Afrobeats chill and “BRAND NEW” goes for maximalist EDM impressions.","short":"The reggaetón veteran channels restless energy into his eighth

Album and Interview","standard":"“When you believe in something and allow life to flow, then you can understand that everything happening in your path—including the bad stuff—brought you to where you are now,” JHAYCO tells Apple Music. “Lately I go to bed and feel excited about waking up. There’s so much to do that I look forward to the next day.” Ultimately, Jesús Manuel Nieves Cortes was patient and believed in the process. Much has changed since his beginnings as a producer and songwriter for other artists. After concocting <i>Famouz Reloaded</i> and searching for eternity in music with <i>Timelezz</i>, now he’s found fulfillment with <i>Le Clique: Vida Rockstar (X)</i>.\n\nThree interconnected chapters make up this 2024 album. The Puerto Rican artist’s avant-garde tendencies find inspiration in punk rock and deep house to depict the specific moment in time when the luxuries of a cosmopolitan rock star finally made sense to him. “This was the perfect moment for this project,” he explains. “An album is a fragment of your soul, and your life is reflected in the finished songs. They stem from your experiences, and this is me having fun with music.” We talked with the artist known as La Presión about some of the key tracks on the album.\n\n<b>“Vida Rockstar”</b>\n“This is so important to me, because the album cannot justify its title without a punk rock tune that sums up its energy. I worked on this one with Tainy and Hype. It reminds me of going to stores like Hot Topic or Vans—the punk energy of the 2000s. It mirrors this particular moment in my life, because this is what I dress like today, using that era as inspiration. It has sentimental value, and it’s the perfect track to kick things off.”\n\n<b>“Porsche Carrera” (feat. Yandel and Haze)</b>\n“This one’s very special to me. In Puerto Rico we have something called <i>residenciales</i>—government-sponsored buildings for people of low income, and yet there’s a lot of culture in them. You take a shower, get dressed, and go outside at 6 or 7 to ride motorbikes and get together with your friends. There was always a lot of music in those apartments, from morning to night, and obviously we listened to a lot of Wisin & Yandel. They led an entire era. I remember listening to their music through the window and feeling inspired by the moods and colors of what they did. Creating a fusion based on that sound, marked by the nostalgia of my youth, but blending it with today’s style—that feels like a huge achievement to me.”\n\n<b>“En La Bentley”</b>\n“I like this one because it’s different—it has that deep-house essence. I love deep house, and it’s always present in my music, like on ‘En Mi Cuarto’ or ‘DÁKITI.’ It sounds a bit techno, but I’m not a hardcore electronica fan. Here I wanted to feel like I was a DJ at a club, showing off what I can do with my set. Starting in a deep-house mood and suddenly morphing into reggaetón.”\n\n<b>“Passoa” (feat. Kapo)</b>\n“When I recorded ‘DÁKITI,’ I wanted to make a song that everybody could like. I tried to repeat this with ‘Passoa’—a song that is not linked to any culture, language, age, or ethnicity. It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl, a surfer, rapper, or doctor. You will like it either way. I think it’s a transcendental song, because it’s ageless and multicultural. Every track on this album reflects a different hobby of mine. I love sailing. Whenever I return home, I rent a boat and sail away into the sea as a way of disconnecting myself from everything. The sea rejuvenates my mind, energy, and ideas. Here I explain what I feel like when I’m at the beach, my favorite pastime.”\n\n<b>“XX”</b>\n“There was a time, before I started singing, when I wrote for an artist who will remain unnamed. That’s when I learned about storytelling through song. In this day and age, sometimes it’s all about focusing on a catchy chorus and the punchlines, without thinking of a narrative. That’s what this song is about—a proper story—and it lacks the structure of a bubblegum chorus. I tend to be passionate and sentimental, and this song allows me to showcase that side—the same thing I did before, when I was writing songs for the stars.”\n\n<b>“Viene BASQUIAT…”</b>\n“This talks about a different time in my life, one that was absent from this album. If you pay attention, you will notice that the sound is different. It’s a clue, a part of me that is not rosy. It’s more about Jesús Manuel, another perspective that focuses on the person who loves art and paintings, going to museums, drinking coffee in the morning, listening to jazz when I wake up. I love film, the art of cinematography and scoring, the work of Hans Zimmer. My other pastime, when I’m not at the beach, is watching movies and paying attention to who was the director, who wrote the music. Those details are very important to me.”\n\n<b>“Murci”</b>\n“My Miami alter ego makes an appearance here. This song talks about things that many people may not understand, starting with the title, which stems from the word <i>murciélago</i>. It’s a high-end trap, far away from the streets and the gunfire. It talks about hotels, restaurants, and luxury items, with lines like ‘<i>Llamaron del lobby que tengo que atender una noche</i>’ [‘They rang from the lobby, I have to attend a gala’] or ‘<i>ando en Zuma</i>’ [‘I’m at Zuma’], which happens to be my favorite Miami restaurant. It’s about some of my experiences, so you will understand what’s going on if you have lived well. It’s not only about the money, but also about having traveled, been to restaurants, gone out with many women. Only then can you write a trap song like this one.”","short":"The star producer and songwriter levels up: “This is me having fun with music.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/le-clique-vida-rockstar-x/1761909009","playParams":{"id":"1761909009","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/67JIMv9vCB2ukBdEbtUmUG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761909009/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1275242928","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1275242928?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725599632749}}},"1762038411":{"id":"1762038411","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762038411?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ashe/1234718215","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Willson","artistName":"Ashe","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/80/2d/8c/802d8ce2-d062-3978-2ad5-711fa0140357/193436395489_willsonfinalalbumcover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"c9ac96","textColor2":"df9353","textColor4":"b87c48","textColor1":"f5cfb5","bgColor":"1b221b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/willson/1762038411","playParams":{"id":"1762038411","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7yi77MD43JR5KZAgrOFdrz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762038411/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1234718215","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1234718215?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725596348283}}},"1762091094":{"id":"1762091094","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762091094?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Vocal Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2023-07-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nicole-zuraitis/287226817","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"How Love Begins (Extended Edition)","artistName":"Nicole Zuraitis","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ea/20/02/ea200201-5745-bbed-6cd8-32db5535eef8/198588986288.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c08777","textColor2":"e08572","textColor4":"b96f60","textColor1":"e8a38f","bgColor":"1d1717","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-love-begins-extended-edition/1762091094","playParams":{"id":"1762091094","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762091094/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"287226817","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/287226817?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725639207187}}},"1762097689":{"id":"1762097689","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762097689?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/astn/1287274825","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/81/51/30/81513072-e7ce-fcff-7aa6-28eac63b3e38/1b5b2626-c17d-4de0-abf6-2642df93b9ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202121","textColor2":"070707","textColor4":"212222","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"898f8c","hasP3":false}},"name":"WHAT A NIGHT TO BE IN LOVE -

It’s an acoustic-guitar jam called “Talent Show,” and it’s ostensibly a performance from a high school talent event. She showcases her dexterous voice on the unvarnished cut, and it establishes some of the themes she explores on the record. Laila!, whose father is celebrated rapper Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def), presents her unfiltered self on the collection, using this “gap year” between childhood and her foray into professional music as an official introduction.\n\nOn “R U Down?” she cues up a disco-inspired groove and asks a potential partner to come at her from a place of mutual respect. “I’m not that mean,” she sings, before adding, “I just mean what I say/You know that.” She lets her vulnerability lead the charge when she concludes, “I’m just a girl, and I don’t know what I’m feeling.” Laila! saves the pre-release smash “Not My Problem” for the end, and after she spends the album ruminating on her place in the world as an adult, the song’s message hits all the harder: “Bitches talkin’ shit, it’s not my problem.”","short":"A hip-hop progeny!

Working with the man who’s helmed albums by Fontaines D.C., Wet Leg, and Foals was a by-product of the Sydney duo’s desire to experiment.\n\n“We’d always worked with the same people, so I think we wanted to see what it was like to work with someone else in a completely different environment,” says guitarist Maddell. “He’s a wizard. He’s so cool. He’s very intimidating, but he’s the sweetest intimidating guy in the world.”\n\nDuring three weeks of recording, Carey embellished Royel Otis’ loose-limbed, woozy indie pop with samples, loops, and synths, though never at the expense of the band’s musical DNA. Here, Maddell and Pavlovic take us through <i>PRATTS & PAIN</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Adored”</b>\nOtis Pavlovic: “Sonically, I think it's a good opener to the record. It's a bit fast and hard-ish. It just talks about self-care and promoting self-pleasure.” \nRoyel Maddell: “Masturbation. It’s something you shouldn't be ashamed of.” \n\n<b>“Fried Rice”</b>\nRM: “It's about being at a party, but the party is an orgy that you didn't realize you were getting yourself into, and you want to leave with the one girl but they want to stay and really take it all in.”\nOP: “She wants multiple slices of the cake.”\nRM: “Is it based on experience? Yeah, there was a New Year's Eve party one time. There was a lot of inspiration drawn from that.”\n\n<b>“Foam”</b>\nRM: “That one just started with a bass riff. During COVID I bought a bass, [and] it was an exercise I was doing to get better and it ended up being a decent riff. And we built from there. And then I think one of us got a message that annoyed us. We were just like, ‘Are you fucking serious? Why is this person even talking about me right now?’ It’s a pretty aggressive song, but sung in a melodic way that's not aggressive.”\nOP: “If you read the lyrics you’d probably think this is a hectic song, but it doesn’t really come across that way.”\n\n<b>“Sonic Blue”</b>\nRM: “I was seeing a girl for a little bit, and she didn't drink, didn't do drugs. She had her head together and was really career-driven, while I was just a bit of a mess and being like, I’ve got to get my shit together. But it was making me depressed that I didn't have my shit together. It's a spiral.”\n\n<b>“Heading for the Door”</b>\nRM: “It was something we used to jam on quite a bit. I think we were even doing it for the first EP, but we just didn't quite get the vocal parts done. But that's about the realization that your relationship might be failing, and the nonsensical arguments that you have.”\n\n<b>“Velvet”</b>\nRM: “‘Velvet’ is like the entire evolution of a failing relationship.”\nOP: “Dan’s [11-year-old] nephew plays drums on it. We recorded it all live, pretty much.”\nRM: “He had a really bombastic way of playing. He was like a mini Ringo Starr. He was real cool and excited and hit hard.”\n\n<b>“IHYSM”</b>\nOP: “It talks about [dating] someone [who’s] too into it and then becomes a bit of a hassle.” \nRM: “Just being pestered by someone who won't leave you alone. Even the people you love can be so annoying.”\nOP: “It’s about feeling the weight of someone.”\nRM: “Feeling like they're putting too much pressure on you.”\n\n<b>“Molly”</b>\nRM: “We were doing all these sessions with all these different producers, just seeing if it gelled, and we met up with James Ford [Arctic Monkeys] and worked on this. And he had this crazy harp thing that we played with a bow to make that distressing string sound, and it became really dark. We didn't quite have it finished and we took it to Dan, and Dan showed us this instrument that he invented that could hit really crazy low notes, and we tried to make it as sinister as possible. It’s just kind of depressing.”\n\n<b>“Daisy Chain”</b>\nOP: “This [came] after we recorded the album with Dan. And we were like, maybe there's space for a more positive, uplifting song, so we recorded this in Byron and then sent it over to Dan and he mixed it and added a bunch of things.”\nRM: “We did it with Chris Collins. He's amazing.”\n\n<b>“Sofa King”</b>\nRM: “That's about feeling like you're not moving as fast as other people. People are having careers or buying a house or getting married—all that Disney shit—while you're just sitting on the couch, enjoying some Netflix.”\n\n<b>“Glory to Glory”</b>\nRM: “I think we got the name when we were in an Uber on the way to Dan’s studio. I think it was on a laundromat or something. I don't think it said ‘Glory to Glory,’ but it looked like it did. That was one we came up with in the morning before heading to the studio, and then we just had fun with it. Dan plays bass on it, and he's an amazing bass player. It’s my favorite track on the album. And I think that’s a lot to do with how it came out and how easy it happened.”\n\n<b>“Always Always”</b>\nOP: “That was one of the first ones we ever worked on together. Roy had a little sunroom where he’d set up his computer and recording stuff. But I think that’s about someone being away and not being near them. Like you’re living different lives, but you can still think about them a bit.”\n\n<b>“Big Ciggie”</b>\nRM: “I've noticed that everyone says the same thing at funerals. And I just think you shouldn't shy away from saying something shit about someone at a funeral. Be honest. Not everyone's the greatest and the warmest and the kindest and most thoughtful. So at a funeral, be like, ‘They were shit, but they were endearing and I loved them the way they were.’ I think it's more important loving someone the way they are even though they've got shit qualities, rather than just loving them only if they’re perfect.”","short":"The Sydney duo unveil their long-awaited debut LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pratts-pain/1762777443","playParams":{"id":"1762777443","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7IoPY9MnsHUoG5Emfp3R6q"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762777443/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1537647213","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1537647213?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725618914466}}},"1762843122":{"id":"1762843122","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762843122?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flora-cash/641609864","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"My Ex Would've Left By Now -

Even after all these years, the band’s irrepressible cheekiness animates their insouciant riffs, whirlwind drums, and yelped vocals. They may be elder statesmen of punk rock at this point, but they’re still kicking against anyone who might get in their way. The reunion of DeLonge with bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker (who produced <i>ONE MORE TIME...</i>) grew out of the members dropping their past differences in the wake of Hoppus’ cancer diagnosis. “I feel like there’s a real sense of brotherhood with us,” DeLonge told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe during a full-band interview. “Like any brothers, you have your little spats over the years, and you grow apart. You come back together. You’ve always got a foundation, you’re connected. You’re still inseparable energetically.”\n\nThat connection is apparent throughout <i>ONE MORE TIME...</i>, which Barker calls “very collaborative.” It calls back to blink’s past at its outset, opening with the speedy “ANTHEM PART 3”—the third part of a trilogy that dates back to the band’s <i>Enema of the State</i> era, although this time out, things are more optimistic than the angst-filled first two installments: “If I fall, on some nails/If I win or set sail/I won’t fail, I won’t fail,” DeLonge wails as the song comes crashing to an end.\n\n<i>ONE MORE TIME...</i> has other moments of introspection: The title track is a very blink-182 take on a power ballad, with DeLonge and Hoppus musing about life being too short to not get over past differences. The anthemic “WHEN WE WERE YOUNG” turns the old phrase about youth being wasted on the young into fuel for one last trip to the mosh pit and closing track “CHILDHOOD” pivots on the always pertinent question, “What’s going on with me?”\n\nNot that <i>ONE MORE TIME...</i> is exclusively built on self-affirmations and serious business. “DANCE WITH ME” opens with a gag about self-pleasure before jumping off into a peppy chronicle of lust, while the bouncy “EDGING” channels love-’em-leave-’em brashness into a giddy power-pop jam. The brief interlude “TURN THIS OFF!” manages to channel gags about bad sex and old scolds into 23 seconds of blissful riffing. <i>ONE MORE TIME...</i> represents a new era of blink-182, although the most important aspect of the music Barker, DeLonge, and Hoppus make remains the same: “Every single time that we’ve just put our heads down and done our own thing,” said Hoppus, “and write music that the three of us love, that’s important to us—it has served us well.”","short":"The 2023 reunion album is released one more time...with eight new

Deluxe Edition","standard":"The first sign that a new era had arrived was Camila Cabello’s platinum blonde locks. Then came “I LUV IT,” the shake-up of a lead single for the Miami native’s fourth studio album—loud, brash, and diamond-hard, with a hook that interpolates a 2009 Gucci Mane classic (“Lemonade”) and an expressionistic verse from Playboi Carti. Speaking to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, the 27-year-old singer emphasizes <i>C,XOXO</i>’s most crucial evolution: For the first time in her career, the songwriting feels like her own. “Letting go of the safety net of other co-writers in the room allowed for there to be more space for me to hear my own voice,” she tells Lowe. “When you are younger, you feel like you are looking for other people to point out the way a little bit more, and that voice inside you, you’re listening to, but you don’t totally trust. I think as I’ve gotten older, I’m like, you know what? I’m just going to listen to myself. I’m comfortable being, like, it’s on me today, and whether it fails or succeeds, I can trust myself to do it.”\n\nCall it a vibe shift or a reintroduction or, as Cabello cheekily called <i>C,XOXO</i>, her “hyper-femme villain arc,” with dreamy production from Spain’s El Guincho. There are odes to her tropical hometown, as she recruits City Girls to twerk out the sunroof on Collins Avenue for “Dade County Dreaming.” She’s covered in glitter and dressed for revenge on “pretty when i cry” and tempting an ex on the scorching “HOT UPTOWN,” which features Drake in peak <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i> form. Things get deeper on moody, wispy tracks like “June Gloom” and “Twentysomethings,” downcast odes to messy, complicated relationships: “Twentysomethings, gotta have a sense of humor/When it comes to us/Don’t know what the fuck I’m doing,” she coos on the latter.\n\nBut it’s the gorgeous and strange “Chanel No.5” that best represents Cabello as a songwriter. It’s an ethereal experiment she describes as having “pop melodies, but with rap structure,” with twinkly piano and lyrical nods to Haruki Murakami and Quentin Tarantino, spritzes of perfume, and chipped nail polish. “It is the thesis statement for the album,” she tells Lowe. “I was like, this is literally the voice of <i>C,XOXO</i>.

The 2020s have been especially good to him, with hits like “PTSD” and features opposite Gunna and Nardo Wick and an ambitious yet well-received double album, <i>Survivor’s Remorse</i>. On the comparatively leaner <i>Big Swerv</i>, he quickly calls back to his beginnings on “Strike You,” an anti-nostalgic opener that demonstrates how the past informs his present. \n\nFrequent production partners Oz on the Track and Southside cast long shadows over the project, the former wielding bass frequencies on the soulful “Yup” and the gnarly Sexyy Red team-up “Ten” and the latter present on potent trap variants “Spend That Bag” and “Trim.” With such reliable beatmakers behind the boards, Herbo pops out and shows off for “Drunk AF” and the evocative “Splat.” Reuniting with Chief Keef for “No Pics,” he rejects the downside of his celebrity status while serving his day-one fans alongside the drill pioneer. Elsewhere, he speaks on familiar themes with Skilla Baby on “Shoot” and 21 Savage on the unsettling “In the A.”","short":"Past and present come together on the Chicago rapper’s latest."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/big-swerv/1765630658","playParams":{"id":"1765630658","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4edTR1SjuWVje3GlLb0pxN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765630658/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1036753321","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1036753321?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1725637004064}}},"1765780265":{"id":"1765780265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765780265?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sleazyworld-go/1503917115","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"More Than A Shooter","artistName":"SleazyWorld Go","contentRating":"clean","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1d/76/46/1d7646ae-74da-e307-3cb1-263024d72e3d/24UMGIM85706.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"aba89b","textColor2":"c9c6b4","textColor4":"a3a092","textColor1":"d2cfbf","bgColor":"0f0b0c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In 2022, SleazyWorld Go went viral with the now-signature “Sleazy Flow.” Having achieved chart success following a remix with Lil Baby, the Kansas City rapper rode that single’s momentum onto his <i>Where the Shooters Be</i> mixtape that same year, bringing high-profile guests like G Herbo and Offset along with him. Nearly two years later, his first proper album <i>More Than a Shooter</i> pushes his narrative arc further as he continues to hone both his voice and his craft from the trenches. Soundtracked largely by executive producer Turbo, a hitmaker chiefly known for working with Gunna, the roughly hour-long project benefits from the cohesiveness of its instrumentals as the Midwestern spitter speaks on serious matters of street business and the surrounding lifestyle.\n\nHe goes hard here whenever possible, calculatingly cold on the ultraviolent “Who the Who’s” and dismissively confident on “3 Pack.” He scoffs at haters and opps on a macro level on “Drill Ain’t Dead,” a perfectly timed counterpoint to the commercial rise of the titular genre’s sample-meets-sexy variants. Features from like-minded artists Rob49 on “I Like That” and Lil Zay Osama on “SHHHH” enhance his world-building efforts, though Skilla Baby makes a strong impression on the sexually charged single “What You Need.” Whether cleverly likening himself to John Cena on the isolationist “Lesson Learned” or giving the tough talk a deserved rest on the seductive “Turks & Caicos,” he shows off the versatility he’s gained in the intervening years. Nowhere is that more clear than on “Depression 2,” a pain-rap catharsis that offers up a great deal of relatability.
