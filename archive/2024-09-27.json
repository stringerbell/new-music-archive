Album","standard":"On Mustafa’s 2024 debut album, the Sudanese Canadian songwriter moves from topic to topic with the deft narrative craft of a seasoned wordsmith. “Dunya,” which translates from Arabic to “the world in all its flaws,” perfectly encapsulates Mustafa’s approach to songwriting: It's raw and unfiltered but totally in awe of the planet on which we find ourselves. \n\nOn opener “Name of God,” Mustafa surrounds himself with little outside of an acoustic guitar melody, letting his powerful voice carry the song’s emotional heft. He blends the personal and universal on the song, asking, “Whose Lord are you naming/When you start to break things?” Elsewhere, on the percussive “Old Life,” he looks back with mixed feelings on a relationship long in the rearview. He croons, “I'm not yours/But there's a part of your life that is mine.” All we are, Mustafa asserts, is the experiences we have.","short":"The Sudanese Canadian songwriter blends the personal and the universal."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dunya/1746818527","playParams":{"id":"1746818527","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/16sGrLUTzqz0Z43j9qMn8S"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746818527/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1501533511","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1501533511?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727445230537,"RTCI":0}}},"1747272271":{"id":"1747272271","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747272271?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/high-parasite/1747272288","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Forever We Burn","artistName":"High Parasite","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a5/3c/e2/a53ce23b-3934-8d2c-ecd0-bb1d242f6a6b/5401148006803_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363636","textColor2":"242424","textColor4":"484848","textColor1":"0e0e0e","bgColor":"d8d8d8","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"A fiery debut from the UK death-rock group."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-we-burn/1747272271","playParams":{"id":"1747272271","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/35PPUdDdkAcrvUZ3p9rQjB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747272271/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1747272288","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1747272288?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727411369724,"RTCI":0}}},"1747890479":{"id":"1747890479","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747890479?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joo-kraus/15098954","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"No Excuse","artistName":"Joo Kraus","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ed/33/86/ed3386b2-36f9-0576-b2d3-ec22ec54dfa8/198391650178.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"342d28","textColor2":"502b08","textColor4":"704c2a","textColor1":"050405","bgColor":"eed1b3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-excuse/1747890479","playParams":{"id":"1747890479","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6xANNamfUvG2bPAr4ezjHJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747890479/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15098954","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15098954?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727432716519,"RTCI":0}}},"1747954897":{"id":"1747954897","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747954897?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ezra-collective/1103640281","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/ec/74/a1ec7403-a18d-ea9d-b1b5-a9720148aa35/d1c18a26-baa1-4b59-82c4-f894a71a5ee5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a99880","textColor2":"d4b36e","textColor4":"ae935b","textColor1":"cdba9c","bgColor":"191411","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f3/04/11/f304112e-d67d-4653-5dd4-812b6ef5314c/ed73403d-25ad-45e6-9825-cc2920759d5d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cda57d","textColor2":"f59a6d","textColor4":"cc835f","textColor1":"f5c492","bgColor":"2a292a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5d/2e/37/5d2e376a-77cb-0ba0-94a6-4a6b493b098a/79fa1b96-d9c0-43bb-927d-1952e0320130.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1ab93","textColor2":"f2c9a3","textColor4":"c4a385","textColor1":"efd3b5","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false}},"name":"Dance, No One's Watching","artistName":"Ezra Collective","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e4/8e/17/e48e1718-7a1a-f4b2-c3c0-02e2145a48f1/0720841304906_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdc187","textColor2":"f7c975","textColor4":"cca361","textColor1":"f9eea4","bgColor":"1d0d13","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“This album is the sound of release, the story of a world tour condensed into one night out,” Ezra Collective bandleader Femi Koleoso tells Apple Music. “It moves from getting into the club to sussing the vibe, losing yourself to the music and feeling its euphoria. The dance floor is full of the highs and lows of life and that’s what we’re channeling.”\n\nAfter the London-based quintet became the first jazz act to win the Mercury Music Prize for their 2022 album <i>Where I’m Meant to Be</i>, their follow-up arrives with a dance-floor-focused bang. Featuring the band’s typical blend of jazz improvisation with West African rhythm, Afrobeat horns, and fizzing, upbeat energy, the 19 tracks of <i>Dance, No One’s Watching</i> inspire infectious movement. Written during a triumphant 2023 world tour, the record encompasses the fanfares of “The Herald,” gentle highlife rhythms on “Palm Wine,” hip-hop swing on “Streets Is Calling,” and emotive neo-soul on “Why I Smile.”\n\n“We’re questioning what ‘dance music’ actually means, since everything from klezmer to reggae and waltzes make you dance,” Koleoso says. “This album is an honest expression of all the things that move us.” Read on for Koleoso’s in-depth thoughts on a selection of songs from the album.\n\n<b>“The Herald”</b>\n“The word ‘herald’ means ‘bringer of joy’ and that’s what the dance floor brings to us. Ezra Collective has a mandate to bring joy when we play live and it’s what makes our shows feel so connected. We wanted to start the record deliberately with this battle cry. It’s a big shout, a manifesto of what you need to hear when you’re first getting on the dance floor. The right amount of joy will shatter your insecurities.”\n\n<b>“Palm Wine”</b>\n“West African highlife is a strong influence for us and this is the first time we’ve referenced it on a record. We were interested in exploring what kinds of music are allowed to be called ‘dance music’ and we think highlife is the perfect example of music for peaceful, elegant dance floors. Palm wine is a drink associated with things being relaxed and going well, and it’s the perfect title for this track that embodies when things are confident and sexy in the dance.”\n\n<b>“God Gave Me Feet for Dancing” (feat. Yazmin Lacey)</b>\n“This track carries on the bouncy, beautiful feel of highlife from ‘Palm Wine.’ I wrote the horn line in the shower but, once the track was done, I had a conversation with [DJ, broadcaster, and author] Annie Mac about joy and how it feels like God didn’t just make our feet for running and hunting, he made them for dancing, and I realized it needed a vocal too. Yazmin sings those lines perfectly, saying, ‘God gave me feet for dancing/And that’s exactly what I’ll do,’ because we can all access this joy in ourselves.”\n\n<b>“N29”</b>\n“I find Berlin beautifully fascinating because of their dance culture, where it’s like people are in deep meditation or being struck by the Holy Spirit on the dance floor. I wanted to recreate that depth of being in the dance on ‘N29.’ It’s named after the night bus that goes from Trafalgar Square to Enfield, through every part of North London, and it encapsulates how a huge part of the dance floor is getting there and getting back from it. This track is the middle of the record, since the middle of the night can see people arriving, already there, or leaving, and that’s what you find on the night bus with people having their different phases of the night on it. At one point, I strike my hi-hat bell like it’s pressing the button to stop the bus!”\n\n<b>“No One’s Watching Me” (feat. Olivia Dean)</b>\n“I’m a big fan of Olivia’s, and I was gripped when I watched her at Forwards Festival in 2023 since she was performing with such honesty. I knew I had to get her on the record, and we had such an honest session where we just started talking about life, and she said the best feeling you get when dancing is when it’s like no one’s watching you and you let the music take control. That was the song right there! Musically, it’s modeled on the marriage between Afrobeats and Afrobeat, where the horns are like Fela Kuti but the bassline and drums are like Tems and Wizkid, while Olivia soulfully drops in on top.”\n\n<b>“Hear My Cry”</b>\n“This is a reimagination of a church song, something I grew up listening to, since I wanted the record to take us to the church dance floor now. It’s all about how the dance floor can feel bigger than you, it can sweep you up and overcome your feelings of overwhelm. I wanted to do justice to how I hear the song in church with a marching energy but also adding a calypso/soca feel on top. I’m excited for this to come out because we’ve been playing it on tour and people go insane for it. They’ll finally know what it is now since it never had a name before!”\n\n<b>“Shaking Body”</b>\n“‘Shaking Body’ does exactly what it says! It’s inspired by how I fell in love with salsa music in lockdown and began writing songs in that vein, including ‘Victory Dance’ from our last album. Salsa is my favorite acoustic dance music, there’s no help from computers, just instruments tearing it to the floor and being full of aggression. We then wrote the bridge to the track separately to take some of that aggression out, like adding more mixer to a strong drink, and letting the listeners know they can still dance once it’s gone.”\n\n<b>“Streets Is Calling” (feat. M.anifest and Moonchild Sanelly)</b>\n“We wanted a hip-hop moment on the album as it has a rich heritage of dance in the music and it’s a big part of our palette. We wanted to bring hip-hop with an African accent, hence getting M.anifest and Moonchild involved, blending Afrobeats and amapiano with the Ezra horn lines. I’m really proud of this song, it’s worlds colliding that people wouldn’t expect from us.”\n\n<b>“Why I Smile”</b>\n“This is the sound of falling in love on the dance floor. It’s that moment in the night when you’re getting dramatic because the DJ played a couple of your tunes and so you’re having the best time of your life—everything feels right with the world. I’ve been down that hole in Shangri-La in Glastonbury, when the sun is rising and I feel like, ‘I could die today and I’d be good, all my friends are here!’ Musically, I wanted to keep broadening that idea of which music gives you permission to dance, since this has a laidback, neo-soul energy.”\n\n<b>“Everybody”</b>\n“‘Everybody’ is based on another church tune, the Nigerian Baptist song ‘Everybody Blow Your Trumpet.’ I love the word ‘everybody,’ since this album is for everybody, and this track is meant to evoke the end of a great night, when you’re not worried about how you’re going to get home, you’re just ascending. It’s a finishing feeling of euphoria, something we recorded in single takes with all our friends in the room, capturing a real feeling.”","short":"Bandleader Femi Koleoso: “This is an expression of the things that move us.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dance-no-ones-watching/1747954897","playParams":{"id":"1747954897","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/08jeayZieCHTosu0K5tzf9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747954897/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1103640281","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1103640281?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727429764529,"RTCI":0}}},"1748145547":{"id":"1748145547","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748145547?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/heriot/1152244293","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Devoured by the Mouth of Hell","artistName":"Heriot","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/68/71/28/68712868-c944-f659-eb01-f20cf0cf7bbd/196871951791.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cb3002","textColor2":"f53121","textColor4":"c62a1d","textColor1":"fc3800","bgColor":"0a100e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The UK metalcore group’s pummeling debut—10 years after they formed."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/devoured-by-the-mouth-of-hell/1748145547","playParams":{"id":"1748145547","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4vZr6vNAUHUjLNmbjGI62l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748145547/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1152244293","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1152244293?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727410520184,"RTCI":0}}},"1748995478":{"id":"1748995478","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748995478?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pale-waves/1204484734","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/d4/20/d3/d420d3d3-1770-fa09-e85a-807bec10bf80/Job6a6b1f71-5951-4ab2-856b-23b61f27127b-169927315-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330813081_1802459141-Time1718196108338.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d68e40"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0c0f0b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"a97b50","textColor2":"d68e40","textColor4":"ac7336","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0c0f0b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/29/a6/e3/29a6e3a5-3f89-2935-ee0a-a22be948ede7/76e83129-1ad3-47df-8179-cda084e4ce42.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d9d9d9","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"d1d1d1","textColor1":"f7f7f7","bgColor":"5f5f5f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/10/ea/d9/10ead9b3-067d-1ba9-ba8c-5387e7ede98c/Job6bf8f5fb-134b-4f3d-8947-a70626df5340-169927316-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330813080_1802459140-Time1718201545365.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bfaf86","textColor2":"dda963","textColor4":"b18851","textColor1":"eedaa5","bgColor":"02050a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c6/ae/de/c6aede23-a973-fe33-4fd6-1c8fec6105f8/4ef9a826-5ef1-49da-9b11-25f98c6eb964.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c6acb1","textColor2":"f3b989","textColor4":"c99a74","textColor1":"f0cfd4","bgColor":"202124","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/a8/fb/52a8fb8a-7cef-0684-db6a-bce646c860a4/4e641534-70b9-499d-8a15-0cd58b2da4dc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bdc1ae","textColor2":"efd187","textColor4":"c0a86d","textColor1":"ebf0d7","bgColor":"030308","hasP3":false}},"name":"Smitten","artistName":"Pale Waves","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b8/4a/ff/b84aff1c-0604-7c20-7e32-761a7a17e475/198704000393_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c2b087","textColor2":"dba04c","textColor4":"b18341","textColor1":"f1d9a3","bgColor":"080c18","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"On their second album, 2021’s <i>Who Am I?</i>, and follow-up <i>Unwanted</i> (2022), Pale Waves presented a tough, punk-pop- and rock-informed exterior for singer Heather Baron-Gracie’s emotionally bare confessionals. Fourth album <i>Smitten</i>, however, finds the Manchester quartet back wandering through the gothic spires and ethereal dream pop that had marked 2018 debut <i>My Mind Makes Noises</i>. Epic, swooning, and romantic, the likes of “Perfume,” “Gravity,” and “Seeing Stars” sparkle with an iridescent color palette, blending shades of jangling ’80s indie pop, Cure-like atmospherics, and lush, Cocteau Twins-inspired washes of sound.\n\n“I wanted this record to sound very British,” Baron-Gracie tells Apple Music. “The visuals of the album came first for me before the music. I wanted it to look grand, like the English countryside, and romantic and feminine and just beautiful. That came before any of the music. Once I had that imagery, I moved on to the music.” With the sonic architecture for the record in place, Baron-Gracie penned a set of songs that looked back across the key moments and relationships of her past, taking stock and reassessing the person she was with a new perspective as she approached her thirties. \n\n“I don’t think I could have written these songs at any other point in my life until now, I would have justified a lot of things and made excuses,” she says. “I thought it was important for me to look back at a lot of my life, because I’ve had some huge experiences that I haven’t ever written about. I felt comfortable, and I felt in a good position in my life to be able to do that this time around.” Read on as Baron-Gracie takes us on a tour of <i>Smitten</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Glasgow”</b>\n“A lot of the songs are looking back at certain moments. ‘Glasgow’ is about a situation I had with another woman. It was a quite brief encounter, but it felt amazing and then, all of a sudden, it came crashing down. We both had a realization that this definitely wasn’t going to work, that our personalities were never going to work together and, if we carried this on, we would’ve burnt everything down in flames. It could have just gone totally toxic and, at that point, I just don’t think I was ready to add any more toxic feelings into my life.”\n\n<b>“Not a Love Song”</b>\n“This is a ‘fuck you’ song. I fall hard and I fall deep, and I did in this situation. Behind closed doors, I was the one and only, I was the person that this person was willing to commit to and she adored me, but then in front of everyone else I was nobody. That really frustrated me, and I would question myself, ‘Am I not good enough? Why do you want me behind closed doors, but then you don’t when anyone else is around, and then you chase boys to just piss me off?’ I had to list all of these amazing things that I could’ve been and that she’ll never be able to get from me anymore.”\n\n<b>“Gravity”</b>\n“The story in ‘Gravity’ is about me and another woman. She was religious but also secretly gay. Her family were very religious too, and she couldn’t choose between me and her religion and her family and her world outside of me. In the end, it was too much for her and she chose her religion over me. I wanted the song to feel quite religious so that’s why it has all the stacks of the harmonies. You can imagine those harmonies being sung in church.”\n\n<b>“Thinking About You”</b>\n“We’ve had multiple versions of all of the songs on this record. I think that’s why it’s our strongest record, because these songs have been worked through again and again and again and had so many different personalities and so many changes. So much thought and consideration has gone into them. The original version of this was a straight-up acoustic ballad. In the studio, everyone started to say that it didn’t fit with the rest of the record, but I was so attached to this song from day one. I felt a weird connection to it, so we had to rework it with this guitar riff. It was perfect, it made the record better.”\n\n<b>“Perfume”</b>\n“‘Perfume’ had to be the first single for <i>Smitten</i>. It was the star of the show for me. It sets up this expectation for the record and it captures everything that’s going to follow. It’s romantic, it’s feminine, it’s dreamy, it’s grand. It paints the perfect picture. It’s all the things I love about music in this one track. ‘Perfume’ is about that infatuation you get, it’s a need, it’s a want. It’s lust as well. It’s all these falling-in-love moments captured in a song. The lyrics and the music take you on that roller coaster that you go through when you meet someone for the first time.”\n\n<b>“Last Train Home”</b>\n“It’s about a situation when I was just figuring out my sexuality and this was the first girl that I was figuring that out with. She had already embraced it and was confident with who she was and her sexuality, but I definitely wasn’t there. I couldn’t commit to her the way she wanted me to. I wasn’t ready to walk down the street holding her hand and I kept her a secret. I feel incredibly guilty and ashamed about that, but I just wasn’t ready. I broke her heart because I wasn’t confident or strong enough yet. It took me a few years to get there and to get comfortable, but I definitely wasn’t ready when I was in my early twenties. But everyone’s different. Some people instantly feel comfortable with it. Others take a few years. Others take decades.”\n\n<b>“Kiss Me Again”</b>\n“I wanted a really fun song on the record. We’ve been rehearsing this, and it’s really fun to play live as well. It was about a time where I knew this girl was just having me on for fun and as her little experiment but, at the time, I just didn’t care because I just wanted her attention and her touch. She was willing to give it to me, and I wasn’t willing to think about it at all. I just dived in deep and didn’t really think about it. And I didn’t want to, either.”\n\n<b>“Miss America”</b>\n“It’s definitely the most aggressive song on the record. We had so many dreamy songs that we felt we had the space to write something a bit more aggressive that would translate really well live. We always think about how things are going to be received live, and people love an upbeat, aggressive moment in a set. We like to intertwine a lot of things in our music. The lyrics are very delicate and honest and raw, about me holding my hands up about being a shit person. But then we contrast it with this music that is very in your face, punchy, and aggressive.”\n\n<b>“Hate to Hurt You”</b>\n“‘Hate to Hurt You’ was the last track that we wrote for <i>Smitten</i>. A lot of the songs are quite yearning and heartfelt. I love that kind of music. That’s what I listen to the most. But I felt like we had to give people a moment where they could dance. It’s about a situation where I want to leave, but I feel awful doing so. I’m kind of pushing and pulling: I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m looking at other people, but I respect you as person and I don’t want to upset you. I don’t want to cause you harm, but I’m causing you harm by staying in this longer than necessary.”\n\n<b>“Seeing Stars”</b>\n“After we finished touring <i>Unwanted</i>, I started going into the studio and writing. I didn’t know it was going to be <i>Smitten</i> at the time, it went through loads of different genres and cycles and it was only when we wrote ‘Seeing Stars’ that we realized: <i>This</i> is the kind of sound that we want for our fourth record. It was those big jangly guitars. Previously, I was trying for a more rock sound, and then I instantly heard these guitars and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s what heaven sounds like…OK, this is what the record is going to be.’”\n\n<b>“Imagination”</b>\n“I was taking inspiration from a girl that I was infatuated with in high school who was straight. I was never going to be able to receive an ounce of her love in that way. Nor did I ever want to admit it to her because I knew that she was straight, she wasn’t queer. So, for me, the only way we could exist together was in my imagination, and that’s what inspired that song: when you know something is unachievable and it’s never going to happen. It’s that realization.”\n\n<b>“Slow”</b>\n“‘Slow’ is very anthemic, and it felt like it had to be the song that we finished the record on. I didn’t want to end on the slow sad song, because we’ve done that in the past. We wrote this quite early on in the process, and we changed a lot of things about it in the studio. It was definitely more of an aggressive track previously, but I thought it sounded a bit too dad rock, so I wanted to strip away a lot of things about it. I replaced the riff and we replaced a lot of the other guitars. I changed the structure and I changed the lyrics as well. It is quite a defiant way to end the album. It’s kind of like, ‘OK, the record is done. I’ve said everything I need to say. I’m out of here now.’”","short":"Heather Baron-Gracie: “I couldn’t have written these songs until now.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/smitten/1748995478","playParams":{"id":"1748995478","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/20L5ONbidQxNKj0yMP1mWO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748995478/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1204484734","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1204484734?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727445271988,"RTCI":0}}},"1749105116":{"id":"1749105116","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749105116?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Contemporary Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-herskedal/295675206","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/58/ce/79/58ce79d3-dc13-8a21-bfde-55df36b6586f/c17ad147-8d84-4b64-89ab-7cf540d4a6c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383a3e","textColor2":"26282b","textColor4":"4b4e53","textColor1":"0e0f11","bgColor":"e1e7f2","hasP3":false}},"name":"Call For Winter II: Resonance","artistName":"Daniel Herskedal","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/b2/17/aab217f8-60aa-7d3e-9dd0-33a060488242/198588117194.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"64a5c9","textColor2":"86c2e3","textColor4":"6ca1c0","textColor1":"7dc7ef","bgColor":"031d34","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/call-for-winter-ii-resonance/1749105116","playParams":{"id":"1749105116","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5eYXjIvmjdFddHFJilo2gB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749105116/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"295675206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/295675206?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727432736971,"RTCI":0}}},"1749115473":{"id":"1749115473","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749115473?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical","Piano"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alexis-ffrench/342515428","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ee/1e/47/ee1e47ea-b07c-888a-4b67-381dd2eeaa08/6c52a4c6-2407-415c-8b2f-e14605cce05b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b3039","textColor2":"251825","textColor4":"44373f","textColor1":"1a0f1e","bgColor":"bdb3a6","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/83/c2/b4/83c2b48b-d06c-cece-772e-9916ff603d3e/4bbaa92e-d238-4f2e-bd06-438a6b105056.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c5ad8f","textColor2":"e7bf7c","textColor4":"c7a46f","textColor1":"e3c9a4","bgColor":"4b3c3c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d7/ad/ff/d7adff93-504f-6770-b7e8-5e2033330c22/89f47003-1d94-4e19-ba3b-bb9b3c9f043b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"42373f","textColor2":"322529","textColor4":"4e4242","textColor1":"231825","bgColor":"bfb5a7","hasP3":false}},"name":"Classical Soul, Vol. 1","artistName":"Alexis Ffrench","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/75/f8/08/75f808a0-f05c-0052-4141-545751d7a632/196871904032.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"b1988c","textColor2":"d58e69","textColor4":"b4765c","textColor1":"d1b8a5","bgColor":"311926","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Two worlds mingle on <i>Classical Soul</i>, where Alexis Ffrench brings his classically trained piano technique to bear on the soul music he grew up listening to. The compilation combines short piano-based pieces by Ffrench with arrangements of soul classics, including Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, and Bill Withers hits.\n\n“I really wanted to go back to my earliest days of coming to know music, or imagining music, and being part of that story when I was about four or five years old,” he says. “I wanted to recreate this ‘inner symphony,’ those feelings that I felt back then, born from the echoes of those soul classics, but reframed through this wellspring of hopefully timeless melody and tethered to my classical story.”\n\nFfrench’s classical story takes in the local church in Surrey, England where he was an organist, as well his studies at the Royal Academy, the Purcell School, and the Guildhall School of Music. Growing up, he moved freely between listening to soul and classical repertoire, appreciating Mozart and Bach on equal terms with Stevie Wonder and Jodi Mathis. On this album, then, you’ll hear him playing the melody of the Roberta Flack hit “Killing Me Softly” with as much feeling and polish as when he takes on the famous motif from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony in “Fate,” featuring beatbox from Kevin Olusola alongside the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra’s strings. \n\nEach track on <i>Classical Soul</i> comes from a different time and creative impulse. “Soar” grew out Ffrench’s desire to write “a story of affirmation and celebration” for the Olympics: the cross-cultural “triple concerto” features Ffrench on piano, vocals from Congolese singer-songwriter Fally Ipupa, and Olusola on cello—plus gospel choir. The simple “Sö” was inspired by the made-up word of the title, which expresses “a kind of fragile beauty.” For the opening track, “The Way It Was,” meanwhile, Ffrench took himself to St. Andrews, “a place of peace and tranquillity,” to record his piano improvisations. “I wanted to capture my true feelings in the moment,” he says. \n\nBrevity is a defining feature of Ffrench’s works. On the one hand, he says, his album is inspired by the idea of a large-scale symphonic experience; on the other, he is embracing the current trend for musical snapshots, audio moments in time. “I suppose those increments are becoming even more truncated by social media: the three minutes is becoming the one minute, is becoming the 30 seconds. And that’s becoming normalized in the way that people are able to listen to music. The reality these days is that music is consumed any which way, so I’d love to think that this album works on many different levels in the totality, but also broken up.”\n\nRecording for the album began at Brad Pitt’s studio at the lavish Miraval estate in Provence. Between times, Ffrench recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and also another north London studio, Master Chord, and remotely with various musicians in LA. The result is a sound that is not only truly international but also highly personal. “We’re influenced by so many things: the things we hear, the things we read. It’s not necessarily conscious; we absorb and we reflect. But for me, this album is all about the music that I love.”","short":"Alexis Ffrench recrafts soul hits: “This album is all about the music I

Album and Interview","standard":"When it came to creating her second album, London producer TSHA wanted to go deeper. “I’ve always been a sad bitch, someone who can feel lonely even when they have people around them,” she tells Apple Music. “I wanted to write an album that honors that part of me and those difficult teenage years of finding myself and the music I loved, while keeping it danceable.”\n\nSince the release of 2022’s debut album <i>Capricorn Sun</i>, TSHA has established herself as one of dance music’s most capable party-starters, producing bright, melody-forward tunes that create cathartic dance-floor release as much as emotive introspection. Following a MOBO and Grammy nomination, as well as a residency at Ibiza’s DC-10 for TSHA, <i>Sad Girl</i> combines her knack for heartfelt songwriting with an increasing focus on big-room energy. The result ranges from the euphoric, synth-fueled empowerment of “Girls” to the ’90s orchestral breakbeats of “Drive” and the ambient soulfulness of “Lonely Girl,” all while keeping the listener moving. “It feels like the perfect encapsulation of who I am and who I was,” she says. Read on for TSHA’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Sad Girl” (with Dan Whitlam)</b>\n“I love concept albums and this intro sets the theme for the concept of the record, which is exploring my journey through sadness, loneliness, and depression. I’ve been following [London spoken-word artist] Dan Whitlam’s work ever since he wrote a verse over one of my tunes and posted it to his Instagram. I knew he would be perfect with this synth soundscape and he delivered something really beautiful to kick off the album.”\n\n<b>“Girls” (with Rose Gray)</b>\n“It was important to me that this album also be about my growing confidence and learning to have fun as a woman while realizing your worth. I’ve worked with Rose before and she’s so talented—she brought this perfect Cyndi Lauper vibe to the track, making it a celebration of female power.”\n\n<b>“In the Night”</b>\n“I live my life at night. I’m either DJing or up late writing; it’s where I find myself. I wanted to write about that mood and I used the synth from another track on the album, ‘Green,’ to produce this uptempo sound, coupled with my own singing, which isn’t something I usually do on my songs but it felt like the best way to convey my personal feelings.”\n\n<b>“Can’t Dance” (with Master Peace)</b>\n“Raleigh Ritchie wrote the lyrics to this a while back and sent it to me and I loved it. It reminded me of the awkward teen phase of being at a school disco and trying to fit in. I wanted it on the album but he didn’t connect with the message as much anymore so Master Peace hopped on and added even more character. Musically, I wanted to reference sounds from earlier in my life, like the Craig David plucked guitars and a grime-influenced flute.”\n\n<b>“Green”</b>\n“‘Green’ references the vibe of Cher’s ‘Believe,’ which was the first tune I recorded on tape and used to play on a ghetto blaster [boom box] as a kid. It began in that mood and then morphed into a Chicago house style. I started writing it after I had an argument with my partner, and I was riffing on the idea that the grass is greener but we never go there.”\n\n<b>“Sweet Devotion” (with Caroline Byrne)</b>\n“House music was my first love and I wanted to make a house tune on the album, something I could DJ. I started writing ‘Sweet Devotion’ as a lighthearted tune full of great drums, something deep and groovy, and then reached out to [New Jersey singer-songwriter] Caroline Byrne who nailed the vocal. It’s gone down really well in my sets and has become one of my favorites to play out.”\n\n<b>“Lonely Girl”</b>\n“I wanted an interlude to reset the record before it progresses into the second half. ‘Lonely Girl’ is meant to be a soundtrack to the experience I would often have as a lonely kid with an active imagination, going off into the garden to try and find the door to the Secret Garden. These noises are meant to be the sounds leading you along that journey.”\n\n<b>“In Bloom” (with Abi Flynn)</b>\n“When I wrote ‘In Bloom,’ I was thinking about 2000s R&B and the kind of teenage angst that Jojo used to put into her music, the feeling of crying because someone wouldn’t hold your hand. This track is meant to be like singing that feeling to yourself in your bedroom. It was my first time working with [UK singer-songwriter/producer] Abi Flynn but she created that vibe perfectly with her noughties voice.”\n\n<b>“Azaleas” (with Ingrid Witt)</b>\n“I sent out a message on Instagram asking for people to send a cappella ideas to me and Ingrid [Witt, Swedish singer-songwriter/producer] came back with this track, which reminded me so much of Kate Bush. It sounds like being lost in a whimsical garden, and I added in these Kanye West drums, to reference another formative sound I used to love as a kid.”\n\n<b>“Take”</b>\n“‘Take’ has the drums from the end of ‘Azaleas,’ which are then sped up and made harder to give the track its backbone. I used a vocal sample and wanted to go into something more ballroom by using synth stabs and the Chicago sounds of the 909 drum machine. It’s a tune to play out for fun moments in the set.”\n\n<b>“Drive” (with Ingrid Witt)</b>\n“This track references Massive Attack’s ‘Unfinished Sympathy’ and piano house, all the music that I loved when I was growing up. It’s a song about feeling like you need to start afresh and choosing to leave your hometown. Ingrid related it to her own experiences of leaving a small town in Sweden, whereas I moved from [Hampshire seaside town] Fareham to London when I was 19, which was a very lonely transition.”\n\n<b>“Fight”</b>\n“I watched Underworld live at Coachella in 2023 and fell in love with their whole punk vibe.

These are songs that the pair have poured their heart and soul into. “I get emotional about some of these songs because they’re highly personal and I realized that Archie is talking about himself,” says Greacen. “He’s not saying, ‘I,’ he’s talking about someone else, but actually he’s talking to himself. That makes me quite emotional. You don’t realize [it but] sometimes the songs you’re writing when you think about other people, you’re actually writing about yourself.” It’s a record that captures an era of confusion and coming of age for Greacen and Blagden, both still in their early twenties, an album that, at its heart, is about trying to find human connection. Let Greacen be your guide for a track-by-track excursion into a surreal, startling debut.\n\n<b>“If You Walk”</b>\n“This is one of the last songs that we wrote. It was January, and I had a broken wrist and we were done in with this album and then this sample came along and it was saying, ‘Walk with me through the long and lonely night.’ It was like this thing had been beamed down from heaven, like the perfect invitation for the listener to come with us. The album is about welcoming the darkness, it’s about embracing the unknown. Life is full of chaos and uncertainty, and it’s certainly absurd, so we wanted the listener to feel like maybe they’re feeling lost when they hear this and it’s kind of us offering a hand to them. Not saying that everything’s going to be fine, but it’s just like, ‘Let’s just go through this.’”\n\n<b>“Godfather” (with Yung Kayo)</b>\n“This is more of a callback to our old selves, but it’s similar in the sense that it’s dark but uplifting. ‘Family is forever’ is kind of the motto of this song and SND has always felt like a bit of a family to us. We are not really ones to be very happy-clappy so we had to do it in an SND-world way. This was us trying to reconnect. We’ve been away for so long writing this album and this was us saying, ‘We’re still here, we’re still around.’ It is obviously a flip on a Mafia saying, and the lyrics are very sort of Mafia-esque, but that was the vibe.”\n\n<b>“Wake Up, Pass Out”</b>\n“We were right in the middle of this album and getting hit from all ends. The world was this big mess, and we were a big fucking mess. This is just a stream of consciousness. It’s about being stuck in a cycle, which I think everyone suffers from sometimes. We’re creatures of habit. It’s really hard to break habits, and that’s what this really is about, but then there’s these fleeting messages of desperation throughout about the world and politics and various human pitfalls. It’s deliberately erratic. I don’t think either of us feel like we’re at the point where we can put together an incredibly deep, thoughtful answer to the questions that we’re really asking in these songs, it’s more a knee-jerk reaction to the world that we see.”\n\n<b>“Onto the Next One” (with Aby Coulibaly)</b>\n“This one is an uplifting song but with darkness threaded into it. It’s about never giving up. I think everyone faces adversity, obviously it’s all relative, and I think we’ve been lucky in our lives to not have that much adversity, but it’s about moving on, being grateful for the experience of life. It’s easy to get down, but when you get down that’s when you’re in real trouble. That’s when you need to keep swimming.”\n\n<b>“Mrs Dior”</b>\n“This is about a toxic relationship, unrequited love, what could have been, believing in a fantasy, believing in someone or something that doesn’t actually exist. We’ve been doing this whole campaign with a sugar mum and she is Mrs Dior, and it’s very meta, it’s not real. People really thought it was real. People don’t like absurdity and they don’t like being misled, and that’s what we’ve been doing a lot of because this whole album is about irony and absurdity and life being those things and people struggle with it. The internet isn’t a place for irony, and that’s what Sad Night is.”\n\n<b>“Who Do You Think You Are?”</b>\n“This is a peek down the rabbit hole of existentialism. It’s a character that’s having really erratic dark thoughts. The hook was written by [Georgia alt-R&B singer-songwriter] Kareen Lomax, and I think her interpretation of lyrics would be completely different, but ‘Who do you think you are? You’re a star’—to us, it was interesting if we could paint that in a dark way, this person thinks that he’s somebody, someone important, but perhaps not in a good way. It’s kind of nihilistic and he wants to make an impact that feels forgotten, this character.”\n\n<b>“Welcome the Night”</b>\n“This was originally going to be the intro, but it felt really good halfway as we needed a reenergizer at that point, especially going into ‘Dying of Thirst.’ This is just a reintroduction of the theme of the album and a reminder of what we are doing. It’s a bit more of a celebration at this point, but obviously it’s still really dark and then you’ve got that big end. It’s not particularly profound, it’s more just things happening in the dark. It’s not particularly profound, but it sums up the album.”\n\n<b>“Dying of Thirst”</b>\n“This was the opposite of ‘Wake Up, Pass Out.’ That was us really trying to shoot for pop, and ‘Dying of Thirst’ came about a year later and we were sick of that whole world. We were metaphorically dying of thirst in terms of our influences and in terms of feeling quite unfulfilled with the world around us musically and possibly us with some of the work that we’d made. I think we say ‘dying of thirst’ about a hundred times in this song and that’s kind of the point. There was no filter, there was no dressing it up, it was just us trying to get this feeling of feeling completely desperate for something with meaning in our world.”\n\n<b>“White Lie” (with BERWYN)</b>\n“This one’s a funny one. It just fell out of us in a day. The whole song was written in a day, and I think we’re still understanding where it came from now and some of the lyrics are making a lot more sense. But I certainly think it’s about male tendencies to bottle things up. It’s about trying to move on from something really painful. This one, for me, is becoming more and more a favorite. At the time, I wasn’t really interested, and now it seems to have more relevance in my life than ever.”\n\n<b>“Sugabby”</b>\n“This is Archie in another desperation. He was like, ‘Well, what do I really want right now? I want someone that can fix all my problems, a fairy godmother to come into my life with a load of money.’ We have a lot of friends who are maybe more inclined to do stuff like that, and this was Archie being like, ‘Well, why can’t I do it?’ And out came this sort of pop number which then spiraled into me having a fake relationship online with this amazing person called Mrs Dior. It was a nice way of giving the album a world.”\n\n<b>“High Road”</b>\n“This is about pretending to be someone that you are not. I think it’s a deeply personal song for Archie. We see it a lot in other people and, when we were writing this, Archie was probably talking about other people, but it feels quite connected to him as well and trying to work out who you are and feeling like a lot of the time we go through life sort of smiling and being polite and not really understanding who’s underneath. It’s about that sort of ticking time bomb. You can only suppress things for so long and this song is kind of encouraging you to embrace the real you, whoever it is.”\n\n<b>“Knife in the Mud”</b>\n“I think it’s quite deeply personal to Archie, and it’s uplifting, but also very melancholy. I mean, the message is so pessimistic—life is a fight for the knife in the mud—but it’s being sung in an uplifting manner of just accepting that and almost accepting that is comforting in this setting, and being OK with that and embracing your flaws and trying to fight for that knife in the mud. There’s a feeling of optimism from it but it’s making no promises, and I think it’s kind of where Sad Night is at the moment. The future is uncertain and this song felt like it had the right tone for what’s next.”","short":"“It’s about being lost”: Josh Greacen opens up on the duo’s

Album","standard":"Maryland-raised singer Gallant blends the artificial with the natural, stirring together concoctions that take elements from electronic and acoustic styles alike. <i>Zinc.</i>, his third full-length album, explores parallels with its namesake element: necessary for survival but difficult to obtain. It’s the element’s elusiveness that he finds himself attracted to throughout the album, mirroring the way relationships build and fall, friends come and go, and pain pulsates and recedes.\n\nOn “Sticks + Stones.” Gallant sings over an acoustic-guitar melody, reaching to his highest register to give the song a nod to classic R&B. “The chemicals will keep me company,” he sings, before a shuffling drum groove kicks in. On “Fly on the Wall. (Osaka Version),” he tries to stay carefree and out of harm’s way. “Please don’t mind me, I’m just a fly on the wall,” he sings, hoping the words ring true. Alas, things are still a work in progress for Gallant: “Then I say I’ve tamed the beast, but every time, I spill my blood on the altar.”","short":"The alt-pop/R&B singer is in his element on his third

The record opens with its title track, a lighthearted but sincere glimpse at the kind of country culture that makes Bryan tick, like “dirt-road daisies” and “old-school Alabama.” Other highlights include the sweet and sentimental single “Love You, Miss You, Mean It” and “But I Got a Beer in My Hand,” a breakup anthem that nods to Bryan’s wilder roots. Bryan closes the album with “Jesus ’Bout My Kids,” a tender and vulnerable snapshot of Christian parenthood.\n\nBryan tells Apple Music that he sees these more emotionally revealing songs as opportunities to connect with his fans on a deeper level. “I think, naturally, those are the ones that rise to the top and the fans believe it's me and that's the ones that they gravitate to and that's what country music fans are,” he says. “That's what it's about right there. Because you're not going to slip nothing by them.” Below, Bryan shares insight into several key tracks. \n\n<b>“Pair of Boots”</b>\n“Buy a boy a pair of boots, he'll wear them until he wears them out. He won't know it yet, but he's a step ahead before they ever hit the ground. I mean, the fact that you train—not train a kid, but you get a kid working outside. Like [my son] Tate went through a sweet corn patch phase where all he did was go throw on muck boots and go pick sweet corn. That's what we wanted them doing. Now, listen, they play <i>Fortnite</i> and they play the video games and Tate's got the Oculus and he's up there doing the virtual stuff, but we want them to be outside wearing boots, hunting, doing the stuff. And I think this song really embodies what the country deal is.”\n\n<b>“For the Kids”</b>\n“I think if you ask a hundred married couples married for 40 years, they're going to go, ‘Oh my god, if we had no children, we wouldn’t have lasted three years in our marriage.’ In my opinion, this might be my best song I've ever written from top to bottom. What's funny is, okay, there's this couple out there that you don't know, but one of your friends goes, ‘Oh, Billy and Susie, they're getting a divorce.’ And what's the first question you ask? ‘Do they have kids?’ And if they're like, ‘No, they don't have any kids,’ you're like, ‘Wow, whatever.’ But if they have four kids, you're like, ‘Oh my god. Oh, what are we going to do for Bobby and Susie?’ Because when you make it through the gamut, when you run the gamut of this crazy life with kids, yeah, those are the ties that bind.”\n\n<b>“Jesus ‘Bout My Kids”</b>\n“We spend [time] as a family talking about Jesus, talking about the meaning. And we don't get to church as much as we should, but we do some cool stuff, like every Easter I bring somebody in to do an Easter sermon at our farm and it's, like, awesome. I mean, that's the only thing that gets us through, in my opinion, is the belief of the next place together. And I feel sorry for people that don't have that deal.

EP and Interview","standard":"System of a Down leader Serj Tankian was very deliberate in choosing the songs for this collection of unreleased material from his past. The five tracks on <i>Foundations</i>—some of which date back nearly 30 years—are meant as companions to his 2024 memoir, <i>Down With the System</i>. “When I was writing the memoir, I was referencing a lot of the music, whether it was System of a Down or my own solo stuff over the years,” Tankian tells Apple Music. “It was part of the way of telling the story, because it fit certain periods of my life, and you can see the influence of the philosophy of the time within the lyrics of the songs.”\n\nAt the same time, Tankian was mixing a bunch of old songs that he hadn’t released. “It made me think, ‘Hey, these songs belong in that period that I was just writing about in that chapter, and I should probably put these out.’ So, it kind of became this thought process of, ‘Now that we’re talking about the past, let’s listen to the past.’” Of course, Tankian’s vaults contain much more material than the five songs here. “I have thousands of tracks. A lot of them are instrumental, but over a hundred are vocal,” he says. “These five were rock in the same type of sense, and they danced well together.”\n\nBeyond a little bit of correcting here and there, Tankian left the archival tracks largely in their original form, for posterity. “I can’t sing the same way I did 30 years ago,” he says. “I have a different voice now, so I wanted to hear that and feel that. I just love the fact that all these songs have a part of me from different times of my career. I can see the progression in them—and maybe a regression.” Below, he comments on each track.\n\n<b>“A.F. Day”</b>\n“I think this is the oldest song here. It’s either that or ‘Justice Will Shine On.’ I can’t remember ever bringing ‘A.F. Day’ to System, which is kind of weird, because you would think that it would work perfectly in that space. It’s very much an anti-establishment song, a punk song. It’s someone going through either a 9-to-5 hell or going to a situation of indoctrination and feeling like there’s no space for colors, there’s no space for creativity, there’s no space for being an iconoclast in any way. Just like some people wake up and say, ‘Another beautiful day today,’ other people go, ‘Another fucking day today,’ right? It’s that. It’s a young person with a lot of vitality, a lot of anger, a lot of frustration.”\n\n<b>“Justice Will Shine On”</b>\n“This is another one that was written at least 25 or 30 years ago, if not longer. It was originally done with just electric guitar and vocals, and then I slowly added instrumentation and kind of finished it in 2015. It’s a song that I wrote about my grandparents and their experience of surviving the Armenian Genocide, and why it’s important for us to recognize genocide as the first step in prevention of genocide. Unfortunately, it hasn’t helped, because we see genocide occurring in our own age. So, it has a very dark side but a hopeful chorus. It’s a beautiful song in that sense.”\n\n<b>“Appropriations”</b>\n“The original version of this is a bunch of delayed guitars that I had played with some beats, and it wasn’t a complete song. Then, I got an offer from a streaming service—I do a lot of film composing and TV composing—to do a title track for a new TV series. So, I repurposed those guitars for a 30-second theme song. The streaming service paid me a kill fee and ended up going with something else, but I liked this so much that I decided to make it into a full song. So, I appropriated my own music. That’s why I call it that. The lyrics are about community and the need to really foster love and lack of judgment and creativity. It’s our only way out of the mess that we’ve created with this so-called civilization.”\n\n<b>“Cartoon Buyer”</b>\n“In some ways, I would say this is a love song. It’s a bit dark, but it’s a love song, and it was written at a time when I felt those longings of lost love. But the breakdown part is very unifying. I’m talking about different countries—they are us and we are them. It’s a universal message, a Buddhist message in a way. I am the guy that I’m honking at who just cut in front of me, because I did the same fucking shit yesterday. So, who the fuck am I to judge? The other side of that is, if you open a door for someone today, they might open a door for someone tomorrow. The other cool thing is that [System of a Down drummer] John Dolmayan played drums on this song back in 2006 or 2007, so I have him in the video as well.”\n\n<b>“Life’s Revengeful Son”</b>\n“This was written before my second solo album, <i>Imperfect Harmonies</i>. It was part of that suite of music, but I ended up not using it on that record because it just didn’t fit for some reason. It’s very post-apocalyptic. It has different messages in it, but I think of it as Jesus in the streets carrying a car axle instead of the cross—very much like an end-times <i>Mad Max</i> kind of thing. It’s surreal but modern at the same time. It’s a scary song in a way, but in the breakdown I mention ‘Sweet Caroline.’ I didn’t steal it, but I must have conjured up Neil Diamond in some way. It’s a very rocking song.”","short":"The System of a Down leader unearths old tracks to pair with his

Album","standard":"Leon Thomas wears seemingly every hat there is: He sings, he writes songs, he acts, and he produces. Despite being spread thin in a million different directions, he manages to excel in all these fields. After years of dedicating his talent to acting and writing songs for other artists, he emerged in 2023 with his solo debut, <i>Electric Dusk</i>, via Ty Dolla $ign’s EZMNY imprint. A year later, he released its follow-up, <i>MUTT</i>, a convincing sign that Thomas is all in on this latest endeavor.\n\n<i>MUTT</i> finds Thomas showcasing his vocal prowess and lyrical talent alike, telling stories of love lost and betrayal, staggering his way through empty relationships as he looks for his soulmate. On “SAFE PLACE,” he sings over screeching guitars and the persistent beat of a ride cymbal bell, admitting, “I see the glass half empty.” On “FAR FETCHED,” which features his label boss, Thomas takes issue with a love interest who is more interested in handouts than a deep relationship. “Paid for my mistakes in Benzes and diamonds,” he fumes, before adding, “250 fronted like you was my artist.” Leon Thomas has conquered everything he’s set his mind to, and yet, on <i>MUTT</i>, love eludes him.","short":"The Ty Dolla $ignee shows off his many talents on his sophomore album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mutt/1765021558","playParams":{"id":"1765021558","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SzoksypeognxYJJOJEYip"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765021558/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"267251475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/267251475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727428208951,"RTCI":0}}},"1765206929":{"id":"1765206929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765206929?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/show-me-the-body/982959371","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/d0/c6/23d0c6f7-4bd3-cf55-2c7a-67393749a487/99cbcd4e-d1f0-4227-a4ca-5ef9fa3c397a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbbbbb","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"e6e6e6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"CORPUS II EP II -

Though he seemed to come from nowhere, the Woodbridge, Virginia, native and trained opera singer released his first EP, <i>Paycheck</i>, in 2022, then signed to kindred spirit Brent Faiyaz’s label in 2023. Still, to launch a song-of-the-summer contender amidst the great Kendrick Lamar/Drake beef of 2024 isn’t just beginner’s luck. Most newcomers would milk that kind of success for all it’s worth, but you won’t find “MILLION DOLLAR BABY” on Richman’s debut album, <i>COYOTE</i>. Bold play.\n\nRichman’s an old soul, drawn to ’80s funk and the kind of R&B that had men doing choreography and wearing their hearts on their silky sleeves. That’s <i>COYOTE</i>’s mood from top to bottom, with each of its 11 tracks flowing seamlessly into the next, giving the feeling of a party with an excellent DJ. There’s pathos in his echoing falsetto, which hits a little harder when he doesn’t quite hit the note, as on “WHITNEY,” a Frank Ocean song run through a shiny ’80s funk filter. “TENNESSEE” channels SoundCloud rap boosted with vintage Bay Area bounce, while “LETTERMAN” has the young nostalgist draping his letterman’s jacket on his girl’s shoulders before taking her out to the speakeasy. It’s a fresh, cohesive introduction to an artist poised to transcend “one-hit wonder” status.","short":"The breakout story of 2024 continues on a debut album of old-soul R&B."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/coyote/1765621525","playParams":{"id":"1765621525","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1yOz33wLZugBVpWdhn2szJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765621525/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1447723583","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1447723583?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727447346267,"RTCI":0}}},"1765677526":{"id":"1765677526","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765677526?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Vocal Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/claire-martin/255271018","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Almost In Your Arms (feat.

Album","standard":"In January 2021, news broke that the pioneering pop producer SOPHIE had died, aged only 34, after a tragic fall when she was attempting to glimpse the moon. The outpouring of grief was instantaneous and the tributes heartfelt, as artists including Rihanna, Flying Lotus, Sam Smith, Christine and the Queens, Rina Sawayama, and Nile Rodgers honored a visionary talent who had touched—and forever changed—pop with her restlessly inventive and, eventually, mainstream-conquering sound. As Jack Antonoff put it on social media at the time, “she’s been at the forefront for a long time and we see her influence in every corner of music…an artist who truly had the ideas first and the guts to put it out there.”\n\nAlmost four years later arrives <i>SOPHIE</i>, the follow-up to SOPHIE’s 2017 debut <i>Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</i> and the album the artist had been working on—and almost finished—before her death. Promised as her only posthumous album, it was completed by SOPHIE’s brother and studio engineer Ben Long, who’d been working closely with her on the record, and who intimately understood her vision for it. \n\nDespite the artist’s undeniable impact on radio-friendly pop, this being SOPHIE, the record isn’t always an accessible, straightforward listen. <i>SOPHIE</i> is split into four sections of four songs, each exploring different moods, and each one arriving like a thrillingly abrupt left turn. The record almost feels like a voyaging DJ set through her musical world. There’s ambient music (“Intro (The Full Horror)”), frenetic, crunchy production and late-night club sounds to raise anxiety levels (there’s a song called “Berlin Nightmare”). But then there’s also ebullient and expertly crafted pop moments that will make you want to turn the volume right up, from the summer-ready “Reason Why” with Kim Petras and BC Kingdom to “Why Lies,” also with BC Kingdom and LIZ. Later come softer, often yearning tracks, the kind of songs that showcase what always made SOPHIE’s music—and the hyperpop sound she helped pioneer—so special: its heart. See “Always and Forever,” which features PC Music talent Hannah Diamond’s wispy vocals against softer, yet still bouncing, production and lyrics about transcending time and moving towards the light. \n\nIndeed, unlike on <i>Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</i>, there are guests on every song on <i>SOPHIE</i>, including Petras and Diamond, as well as Cecile Believe, Jozzy, Bibi Bourelly, and artist, writer, and DJ Juliana Huxtable. And that roster feels poignant for SOPHIE’s final album: This is an artist who has always been synonymous with community, collaboration, and friendship. Her chosen guests here deliver spoken word (on the racing yet strangely addictive “Plunging Asymptote” and the spacey “The Dome’s Protection”), pitched-up vocals (“Live in My Truth”), and lonely, heartbreak-fueled lyricism, as on the gorgeous, ’80s-referencing “My Forever” with Cecile Believe, one of the album’s standout moments. “I want to go back to forever,” she sings. “You’ll always be my forever.” Listening to <i>SOPHIE</i> is often an exhilarating experience, but it’s also a bittersweet one, a reminder of the producer’s extraordinary ambition and boundless experimentation—and of how much she still had to give.","short":"The final word from a pop pioneer—and a bittersweet reminder of her power."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sophie/1766808387","playParams":{"id":"1766808387","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6vkUxF6UZ2w3IIkYCEeQco"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766808387/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"904687727","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/904687727?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727447678368,"RTCI":0}}},"1766861629":{"id":"1766861629","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766861629?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mal-waldron/1199193","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Quest (Remastered 2024) [feat.

Mixtape","standard":"When it comes to addressing controversy, DaBaby has repeatedly shown himself to be more than willing to respond on record. After onstage remarks in front of a music festival crowd back in 2021 led to considerable national backlash, the Charlotte, North Carolina, rapper spoke on the matter and the impact on his own life and livelihood that same year on Kanye West’s “Jail pt 2” as well as on subsequent projects of his own. Coming two years after his last album <i>Baby on Baby 2</i>, this relatively brisk 14-track effort finds him boasting of resilience as he once again draws upon the skill set that brought him fame and success in the first place.\n\nOpening <i>HOW TF IS THIS A MIXTAPE?</i> with the defiant “In a Minute,” an introduction that curiously doubles as one of its longest songs, he essentially shrugs off the past couple years while embracing his family and explicitly promising a return to chart glory. On “Gimme a Reason,” he offers a blunt explanation as to why this <i>isn’t</i> an album despite its runtime similarities with his chart-topping full-lengths <i>BLAME IT ON BABY</i> and <i>KIRK</i>. Still, with returning producers including Sean Da Firzt and Charlie Heat behind the boards, songs like “I’m Outside” and the clubbier “PHAT” nonetheless feel like prime DaBaby material.\n\nAll the while, he thematically maintains a defensively righteous stance, his man-against-the-world mindset wholly evident on “Carry It On.” He directs no small amount of his ire at the media, but reserves some of the tape’s most pointed criticism at those in his circle that didn’t stand by him, via “Ain’t That a Bitch.” Elsewhere, he shifts his focus towards the ladies he desires, making his proclivities known on “Hate a Nice Chick” and “Hollywood Freak.” ","short":"Charlotte’s rap star returns with his weightiest effort in two years."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-tf-is-this-a-mixtape/1768388418","playParams":{"id":"1768388418","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6RabTNt476AKoiEC3sDDAL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768388418/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1175595427","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1175595427?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727436923140,"RTCI":0}}},"1768757362":{"id":"1768757362","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768757362?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alex-warren/1572671688","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dd/92/db/dd92db0f-c89a-b15c-cf71-bbfebd5e4e99/ef07ae63-da82-4f53-a24f-de84c182b51e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b99685","textColor2":"d9a188","textColor4":"b18571","textColor1":"e3b7a2","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/43/9e/77/439e7704-8c32-9f71-3658-0d298e8e8c4d/7a47204b-e14a-47f3-8fb7-81b5c18735df.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c6bb80","textColor2":"ebd1ab","textColor4":"c8b495","textColor1":"e9da91","bgColor":"3c3f3d","hasP3":false}},"name":"You'll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter 1)","artistName":"Alex Warren","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/43/8e/29/438e296e-12f8-2cf3-1b00-d1390e502020/075679632241.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9ad99","textColor2":"cececb","textColor4":"a7a9a6","textColor1":"e4d3bb","bgColor":"0e1714","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The California songwriter throws himself into big, stirring ballads."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/youll-be-alright-kid-chapter-1/1768757362","playParams":{"id":"1768757362","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1cVpXZnVWHTDUuY8kW6x8M"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768757362/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1572671688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1572671688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1727432957712,"RTCI":0}}},"1769374711":{"id":"1769374711","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769374711?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/super-junior-d-e/972910437","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"INEVITABLE -

Fans wondered whether it could be “LG7,” the long-awaited follow-up to 2020’s <i>Chromatica</i>, until September 2024, when billboards popped up with the message “LG6.5.” The surprise between the pop auteur’s sixth and seventh studio albums turns out to be <i>Harlequin</i>, a concept album delivered from the warped perspective of Lee Quinzel, aka Harley Quinn, her character in Todd Phillips’ Joker-fied jukebox musical <i>Joker: Folie à Deux</i>. \n\nAs is often the case for actors who temporarily inhabit Gotham City, Gaga realized shortly after filming wrapped that she hadn’t yet moved on from the character she’d been embodying. She began to conceptualize an album of updated jazz standards sung as the Joker’s main squeeze. <i>Harlequin</i>, recorded at Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu alongside LG7, works as a companion piece to the film, but it’s also distinctly aligned with Gaga’s singular vision. \n\nFirst, though, Gaga developed Lee’s singing ability for the role. “I did a lot of different kinds of work to create her,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “One of the things that I did was change my voice in the film. It’s Lee’s voice, and it’s really raw, and it’s really naked. It’s very untrained. Not proper breathing.” How did the superstar with the powerhouse vocals achieve this? “I think that Joaquin [Phoenix] scared the living shit out of me every day until my voice left my body.”\n\nWho else could pull off a reimagining of the 1932 classic “I’ve Got the World on a String” as a gritty surf-rock slow-burner (“What if The Cramps made a French song?”) or deliver a song from an obscure 1964 musical as an ’80s rock ripper? That song, “The Joker,” originates from <i>The Roar of the Greasepaint - The Smell of the Crowd</i>, though it could have been written exactly for Gaga to sing right now—as could the 1952 standard “That’s Entertainment,” popularized by Judy Garland: “Everything that happens in life can happen in a show/You can make ’em laugh, you can make ’em cry/Anything can go!” But listen closely and you’ll hear Gaga’s subtly twisted tweaks: the cheery lyrics of “Good Morning” by way of <i>Singin’ in the Rain</i> (“Good morning/Rainbows are shining through!”) are replaced with the gleefully sinister “Bang bang, you’re black and blue!”\n\nConsidering her professional and personal relationship with the late Tony Bennett and her own jazz residency in Vegas, Gaga is very intimate with the genre. Yet she realizes that Bennett probably would not have approved of her take on the songs this time around: “We did so much that Tony would never have been cool with.” The Oscar winner also delves into the psychology of the album’s original cut “Happy Mistake.” “When women play these broken characters in music or in films or theater, the audience loves it, and they just cheer us on,” she said. “They cheer on the image of pain. It’s super confusing. That song is in a lot of ways about that.”\n","short":"It’s no joke: a whole album of Gaga-fied show tunes and jazz

hard to overstate SOPHIE’s influence on 21st-century pop. Pioneer, visionary, and an icon in music and beyond, the DJ, producer, and artist was as lauded by pop’s underground as its most mainstream artists—and the Glaswegian’s touch can be felt on almost everything in between. This is music that, somehow, channelled both the avant garde and a kind of blistering directness. Right from the start of the early 2010s, when SOPHIE emerged as a mystery-shrouded affiliate of experimental pop label PC Music, songs resisted musical boundaries. Rushing, hyperkinetic moments of ecstasy (“Immaterial”), glinting, metallic percussion (“Hard”), syncopated soda-bubble trap (“Lemonade”); whether through alien, synthesised effects or distorted snatches of robotic vocal, this former art school student brought a sculptor’s sensibility to candy-painted pop. But that didn’t mean subtlety and traditional musicianship weren’t present. 2018’s debut album <i>Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</i> broadened the scope, hurtling from the whispered torch song theatrics of “It’s Okay To Cry” to the smashed-glass, R&B gear-switches that give “Faceshopping” its urgent, convulsive energy. SOPHIE died January 30, 2021, at age 34.
