second release by The Barr Brothers (formerly of The Slip) is stunning in its restraint. The hypnotic and driving “Half Crazy” grabs hold immediately, partly because it’s the lone uptempo tune. The other 12 songs gather steam gradually but prove mesmerizing once they settle in. Rhythms ebb and flow and textures morph as a variety of instruments overlap. Guitars, banjo, harp, marimba, pedal steel, viola, organ, piano, horns, drums, African ngoni, and found-object percussion are all used. That’s a lot to control, but they do it well by artfully blending Delta blues, Appalachian folk, and West African influences into organic, otherworldly grooves."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sleeping-operator/890650365","playParams":{"id":"890650365","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MuxUjtXYz7K0XwN9VO2a0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/890650365/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"457103843","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/457103843?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728584661992}}},"1723914163":{"id":"1723914163","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1723914163?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Indie

Album","standard":"On their first album since 2021’s <i>Let the Bad Times Roll</i>, Orange County punk icons The Offspring waste little time showing off their sneering wit while adding infectious melodies that rank among some of the group’s best. Opener “Looking Out for #1” cruises along with a chorus of shuffling drums and a wall of guitars as Dexter Holland looks back on how far the band has come: “Well, we used to believe in the hope and the dreams,” before concluding, “Well, they cut you down to size.” Elsewhere, Holland takes a meta approach to songwriting, taking a look at The Offspring’s relationship with fans on the metal-leaning “Come to Brazil.” Over double kick drums and shredding guitars, he sings, “It doesn't matter how many times we came/’Cause they want us back again just the same.”","short":"Four decades in, the OC

The Juno- and CCMA-winning artist pulls together her eclectic set of influences—she once played in a funk band and formally studied opera—for a country sound all her own, one with a reverence for traditional production and instrumentation and a forward-thinking appreciation of pop hooks. Patrick’s masterful voice and narrative sense of songwriting ground the project, and the record really gives a sense of her range, as she moves from a full-bodied belt to a gentle lilt—often on the same track—with preternatural ease. Highlights on the album include opening track “Blood From a Stone,” a Trisha Yearwood-esque ballad about heartbreak and hard-earned wisdom, and “Other Side of 25,” a relatable and compassionate reflection on the messiness of your mid-twenties. Country artist and pen-for-hire Caitlyn Smith (Rascal Flatts, Miley Cyrus) joins Patrick on “Stoned Alone,” a swaggering, sultry ode to the magical act of sparking a j by oneself instead of wasting energy on someone with a “bad attitude.”","short":"The Canadian singer-songwriter goes big and bold on her fourth

She became a household name, armed with accolades and devoted new fans. A lot rides on her shoulders, but on <i>Portrait</i>, she refuses to cave into the pressure. Like its title suggests, the album is a collection of thoughtfully reimagined standards and classics. Each track works as a stand-alone statement of Joy’s talent, but also as part of a greater whole that honors the jazz tradition.\n\nOn opener “You Stepped Out of a Dream,” best-known from the 1941 film <i>Ziegfeld Girl</i>, Joy steals the show with her scale-hopping vocal performance, showcasing her deepest registers and heavens-reaching falsetto alike. It’s a stunning display, but throughout <i>Portrait</i>, Samara Joy is more interested in honoring these compositions with thoughtful, inventive arrangements than showing off her voice—which speaks for itself.","short":"Contemporary jazz’s breakout star lives up to the

Deluxe Album ","standard":"“We weren’t really expecting it at such a rate,” The Last Dinner Party’s guitarist and vocalist Lizzie Mayland tells Apple Music of the band’s rise, the story of which is well known by now. After forming in London in 2021, the five-piece’s effervescent live shows garnered an if-you-know-you-know kind of buzz, which went into overdrive when they released their stomping, euphoric debut single “Nothing Matters” in April 2023. All of which might have put a remarkable amount of pressure on them while making their debut record (not least given the band ended 2024 by winning the BRITs Rising Star Award then topped the BBC’s new-talent poll, Sound of 2024, in January). But The Last Dinner Party had written, recorded and finished <i>Prelude to Ecstasy</i> three months before anyone had even heard “Nothing Matters.” It meant, says lead singer Abigail Morris, that they “just had a really nice time” making it. “It is a painful record in some ways and it explores dark themes,” she adds, “but making it was just really fun, rewarding, and wholesome.”\n\nProduced by James Ford (Arctic Monkeys, Florence + the Machine, Jessie Ware), who Morris calls “the dream producer,” <i>Prelude to Ecstasy</i> is rooted in those hype-inducing live shows, its tracklist a reflection of the band’s frequent set list and its songs shaped and grown by playing them on stage. “We wanted to capture the live feels in the songs,” notes Morris. “That’s the whole point.” Featuring towering vocals, thrilling guitar solos, orchestral instrumentation, and a daring, do-it-all spirit, the album sounds like five band members having an intense amount of fun as they explore an intense set of emotions and experiences with unbridled expression. \n\nOn this deluxe edition, The Last Dinner Party also shares five acoustic versions of the album’s songs, revealing a softer, more delicate side amid all that feeling. Plus, four covers of tracks by Sparks, Catherine Howe, Kate Bush, and Chris Isaak, which are both moving (“Up North”) and exhilarating (“This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us”).\n\nThese songs—which expand and then shrink and then soar—navigate sexuality (“Sinner,” “My Lady of Mercy”), what it must be like to move through the world as a man (“Caesar on a TV Screen,” the standout, celestial “Beautiful Boy”), and craving the gaze of an audience (“Mirror”), as well as loss channeled into art, withering love, and the mother-daughter relationship. And every single one of them feels like a release. “It’s a cathartic, communal kind of freedom,” says Morris. “‘Cathartic’ is definitely the main word that we throw about when we talk about playing live and playing an album.” Read on as Morris and Mayland walk us through their band’s exquisite debut, one song at a time.\n\n<b>“Prelude to Ecstacy”</b>\nAbigail Morris: “I was thinking about it like an overture in a musical. Aurora [Nishevci, keys player and vocalist] composed it—she’s a fantastic composer, and it has themes from all the songs on the record. I don’t believe in shuffle except for playlists and I always liked the idea of [an album] having a start, middle, and end, and there is in this record. It sets the scene.”\n\n<b>“Burn Alive”</b>\nAM: “This was the first song that existed in the band—we’ve been opening the set with it the entire time. Lyrically, it always felt like a mission statement. I wrote it just after my father passed away, and it was the idea of, ‘Let me make my grief a commodity’—this kind of slightly sarcastic ‘I’m going to put my heart on the line and all my pain and everything for a buck.’ The idea of being ecstatic by being burned alive—by your pain and by your art and by your inspiration—in a kind of holy-fire way. What we’re here to do is be fully alive and committed to exorcising any demons, pain or joy.”\n\n<b>“Caesar on a TV Screen”</b>\nAM: “I wrote the beginning of this song over lockdown. I’d stayed over with my boyfriend at the time and then, to go back home, he lent me a suit. When I met him, I didn’t just find him attractive, I wanted to <i>be</i> him—he was also a singer in another band and he had this amazing confidence and charisma in a specifically masculine way. Getting to have his suit, I was like, ‘Now I am a man in a band.’ It’s this very specific sensuality and power you feel when you’re dressing as a man. I sat at the piano and had this character in my head—a Mick Jagger or a Caligula. I thought it would be fun to write a song from the perspective of feeling like a king, but you are only like that because you’re so vulnerable and so desperate to be loved and quite weak and afraid and childlike.”\nLizzie Mayland: “There was an ending on the original version that faded away into this lone guitar, which was really beautiful, but we got used to playing it live with it coming back up again. So we put that back in. The song is very live, the way we recorded it.”\n\n<b>“The Feminine Urge”</b>\nAM: “The beginning of this song was based on an unreleased Lana Del Rey song called ‘Driving in Cars With Boys’—it slaps. I wanted to write about my mother and the mother wound. It’s about the relationship between mothers and daughters and how those go back over generations, and the shared traumas that come down. I think you get to a certain age as a woman where your mother suddenly becomes another woman, rather than being your mum. You turn 23 and you’re having lunch and it’s like, ‘Oh shit, we’re just two women who are living life together,’ and it’s very beautiful and very sweet and also very confronting. It’s the sudden realization of the mortality and fallibility of your mother that you don’t get when you’re a child. It’s also wondering, ‘If I have a daughter, what kind of mother would I be? Is it ethical to bring a child into a world like this? And what wound would I maybe pass on to her or not?’”\n\n<b>“On Your Side”</b>\nLM: “We put this and ‘Beautiful Boy’—the two slow ones—together. Again, that comes from playing live. Taking a slow moment in the set—people are already primed to pay attention rather than dancing.”\nAM: “The song is about a relationship breaking down and it’s nice to have that represented musically. It’s a very traditional structure, song-verse-chorus, and it’s not challenging or weird. It’s nice that the ending feels like this very beautiful decay. It’s sort of rotting, but it sounds very beautiful, but it is this death and gasping. I really like how that illustrates what the song’s about.”\n\n<b>“Beautiful Boy”</b>\nAM: “I come back to this as one that I’m most proud of. I wanted to say something really specific with the lyrics. It’s about a friend of mine, who’s very pretty. He’s a very beautiful boy. He went hitchhiking through Spain on his own and lost his phone and was just relying on the kindness of strangers, going on this beautiful Hemingway-esque trip. I remember being so jealous of him because I was like, ‘Well, I could never do that—as a woman I’d probably get murdered or something horrible.’ He made me think about the very specific doors that open when you are a beautiful man. You have certain privileges that women don’t get. And if you’re a beautiful woman, you have certain privileges that other people don’t get. I don’t resent him—he’s a very dear friend. Also, I think it’s important and interesting to write, as a woman, about your male relationships that aren’t romantic or sexual.”\nLM: “The flute was a turning point in this track. It’s such a lonely instrument, so vulnerable and so expressive. To me, this song is kind of a daydream. Like, ‘I wish life was like that, but it’s not.’ It feels like there’s a deeper sense of acceptance. It’s sweetly sad.” \n\n<b>“Gjuha”</b>\nAM: “We wanted to do an aria as an interlude. At first, we just started writing this thing on piano and guitar and Aurora had a saxophone. At some point, Aurora said it reminded her of an Albanian folk song. We’d been talking about her singing a song in Albanian for the album. She went away and came back with this beautiful, heart-wrenching piece. It’s about her feeling this pain and guilt of coming from a country, and a family who speak Albanian and are from Kosovo, but being raised in London and not speaking that language. She speaks about it so well.”\n\n<b>“Sinner”</b>\nLM: “It’s such a fun live moment because it’s kind of a turning point in the set: ‘OK, it’s party time.’ I was quite freaked out about the idea of being like, ‘This is a song about being queer.’ And I thought, ‘Are people going to get that?’ Because it’s not the most metaphorical or difficult lyrics, but it’s also not just like, ‘I like all gendered people.’ But people get it, which has been quite reassuring. It’s about belonging and about finding a safe space in yourself and your own sense of self. And marrying an older version of yourself with a current version of yourself. Playing it live and people singing it back is such a comforting feeling. I know Emily [Roberts, lead guitarist, who also plays mandolin and flute] was very inspired by St. Vincent and also LCD Soundsystem.”\n\n<b>“My Lady of Mercy”</b>\nAM: “For me, it’s the most overtly sexy song—the most obviously-about-sex song and about sexuality. I feel like it’s a nice companion to ‘Sinner’ because I think they’re about similar things—about queerness in tension with religion and with family and with guilt. I went to Catholic school, which is very informative for a young woman. I’m not a practicing Catholic now, but the imagery is always so pertinent and meaningful to me. I just thought it was really interesting to use religious imagery to talk about liking women and feeling free in your sexuality and reclaiming the guilt. I feel like Nine Inch Nails was a really big inspiration musically. This is testament to how much we trust James [Ford] and feel comfortable with him. We did loads of takes of me just moaning into the mic through a distortion. I could sit there and make fake orgasm sounds next to him.”\nLM: “I remember you saying you wanted to write a song for people to mosh to. Especially the breakdown that was always meant to be played live to a load of people throwing themselves around. It definitely had to be that big.”\n\n<b>“Portrait of a Dead Girl”</b>\nAM: “This song took a long time—it went through a lot of different phases. It was one we really evolved with as a band. The ending was inspired by Florence + the Machine’s ‘Dream Girl Evil.’ And Bowie’s a really big influence in general on us, but I think especially on this one. It feels very ’70s and like the Ziggy Stardust album. The portrait was actually a picture I found on Pinterest, as many songs start. It was an older portrait of a woman in a red dress sitting on a bed and then next to her is a massive wolf. At first, I thought that was the original painting, but then I looked at it again and the wolf has been put in. But I really loved that idea of comparing [it to] a relationship, a toxic one—feeling like you have this big wolf who’s dangerous but it’s going to protect you, and feeling safe. But you can’t be friends with a wolf. It’s going to turn around and bite you the second it gets a chance.”\n\n<b>”Nothing Matters”</b>\nAM: “This wasn’t going to be the first single—we always said it would be ‘Burn Alive.’ We had no idea that it was going to do what it did. We were like, ‘OK, let’s introduce ourselves,’ and then where it went is kind of beyond comprehension.”\nLM: “I was really freaked out—I spent the first couple of days just in my bed—but also so grateful for all the joy it’s been received with. When we played our first show after it came out, I literally had the phrase, ‘This is the best feeling in the world.’ I’ll never forget that.” \nAM: “It was originally just a piano-and-voice song that I wrote in my room, and then it evolved as everyone else added their parts. Songs evolve by us playing them on stage and working things out. That’s definitely what happened with this song—especially Emily’s guitar solo. It’s a very honest love song that we wanted to tell cinematically and unbridled, that expression of love without embarrassment or shame or fear, told through a lens of a very visual language—which is the most honest way that I could have written.”\n\n<b>“Mirror”</b>\nAM: “Alongside ‘Beautiful Boy,’ this is one of the most precious ones to me. When I first moved to London before the band, I was just playing on my own, dragging my piano around to shitty venues and begging people to listen. I wrote it when I was 17 or 18, and it’s the only one I’ve kept from that time. It’s changed meanings so many times. At first, one of them was an imagined relationship, I hadn’t really been in relationships until then and it was the idea of codependency and the feeling of not existing without this relationship. And losing your identity and having it defined by relationship in a sort of unhealthy way. Then—and I’ve never talked about this—but the ‘she’ in the verses I’m referring to is actually an old friend of mine. After my father died, she became obsessed with me and with him, and she’d do very strange, scary things like go to his grave and call me. Very frightening and stalker-y. I wrote the song being like, ‘I’m dealing with the dissolution of this friendship and this kind of horrible psychosis that she seems to be going through.’ Now this song has become similar to ‘Burn Alive.’ It’s my relationship with an audience and the feeling of always being a performer and needing someone looking at you, needing a crowd, needing someone to hear you. I will never forget the day that Emily first did that guitar solo. Then Aurora’s orchestral bit was so important to have on that record. We wanted it to have light motifs from the album. That ending always makes me really emotional. I think it’s a really touching bit of music and it feels so right for the end of this album. It feels cathartic.”","short":"Covers and acoustic takes are served at a second sitting of TLDP’s debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/prelude-to-ecstasy-acoustics-covers/1763033990","playParams":{"id":"1763033990","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3KhQj38K7x3CQ9HGDp9rqu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763033990/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1680519203","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1680519203?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728897441457}}},"1764981189":{"id":"1764981189","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764981189?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Hard Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/53/1d/99/531d9999-361c-7b41-8dd7-77ddb46ee416/Job622d9f77-971a-4800-8e43-e34cf83edc62-176807761-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345430735_1913243851-Time1728071839058.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f15101"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0b0200"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c97427","textColor2":"f15101","textColor4":"c74201","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b0200","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/36/0c/3e/360c3e9f-c1b9-56ae-b762-5ae839bfb575/Jobefc22785-c194-4eed-82f7-66dfdf579588-176807762-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345430734_1913243852-Time1728072789406.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d65302","textColor2":"ed691d","textColor4":"ca5618","textColor1":"fc6603","bgColor":"400702","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/texas-hippie-coalition/275099992","name":"Gunsmoke","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Texas Hippie Coalition","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/31/10/d4/3110d476-ec92-b677-a0d5-9a8970e66ee7/25052.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c48325","textColor2":"e86209","textColor4":"be5008","textColor1":"f0a22d","bgColor":"180606","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gunsmoke/1764981189","playParams":{"id":"1764981189","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/370vXUdXQqxpBBeU47bmkW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764981189/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"275099992","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/275099992?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728619951182}}},"1765019010":{"id":"1765019010","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765019010?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3a/be/11/3abe110c-865f-2319-cbba-5cee1b1dbb7e/10bc6c42-f524-48a1-8d45-09c665f1ce95.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1927b","textColor2":"daa57b","textColor4":"b48a67","textColor1":"d6af94","bgColor":"1d2018","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6f/8f/26/6f8f2660-9094-4121-ff65-84efdb33a443/3b8eced9-9853-4117-91d1-432ab346c024.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cdc5be","textColor2":"d7cbc7","textColor4":"beb0aa","textColor1":"ebe5e0","bgColor":"58453a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/becky-g/550411604","name":"ENCUENTROS","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Becky G","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1e/41/90/1e4190e8-db11-0471-3c59-2758ff8e2d37/196872411256.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"373939","textColor2":"223642","textColor4":"475a63","textColor1":"0e0e0e","bgColor":"dce8e6","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Becky G’s love for música mexicana used to be one she kept to herself. Prior to 2023’s ambitious <i>ESQUINAS</i>, the Mexican American superstar had largely limited her Spanish-language work to the pop and reggaetón spaces. Yet as corridos and other related styles surged into the mainstream as part of a genuine, youth-driven movement, her ultimately perfectly timed album transcended the trends to reveal not merely a devotion to this music but a proficiency within it. Triumphant after the warm reception the project received, she returns roughly one year later with the like-minded <i>ENCUENTROS</i>. Less a follow-up than a companion to its predecessor, the 16-song effort finds her eagerly exploring cultural heritage while making history of her own. \n\nThroughout <i>ENCUENTROS</i>, Becky G expresses herself over themes familiar to música mexicana listeners across generations. The unresolved heartache of “COMO DIABLOS” and the jilted lover’s one-upmanship of “DESIERTO” each contribute to a wider romantic canon full of passion and pathos alike. Hardly limited to one particular format, she demonstrates diversity without losing credibility, as authentically herself over the cumbia throwback “OTRO CAPÍTULO” as on the sad sierreño cut “XLAS NUBES.” Analogous to the corridos tumbados scene, her “VISTO CARO” name-drops luxury brands with the added authenticity of having plenty of firsthand experience with them.

As the group crafted <i>Inhale / Exhale</i> over the next two years, the physical separation required them to carve out time for joint writing sessions, where they reconvened in places such as LA, Austin, and Ibiza. “We really made the most of those two-week stints,” George tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “We were in a really good creative flow. We were reconnecting and particularly reconnecting in the studio more than ever.“ \n\nWhen “Music Is Better,” the album’s lead single, arrived in June 2024, it marked RÜFÜS DU SOL’s triumphant return. Its joyful chorus—“Music is better when we’re together”—seems as much a love song as it is a celebration of the creative magic they find when sharing a physical space. Those feelings of joy, love, and gratitude run throughout <i>Inhale / Exhale</i>, a lighter turn from its predecessor’s darker and more introspective themes. A new relationship sparks promise “burning as bright as the sun” on opening track “Inhale,” while love’s stars align on “In the Moment” and the mood slinks towards carnal on “Levitating.”\n\nMirroring their nomadic creative process, RÜFÜS DU SOL covers more sonic ground outside of soaring melodic house. “The Life” transports them to colder climes through rumbling bass and crisp percussion, followed by the fuzzing rock edge of “Pressure,” and “Edge of the Earth” pulls from driving trance. There are quiet moments, too, on the reflective “New York,” where the sparse drums resemble a heartbeat, and the ambient “Exhale,” where digitized vocal harmonies offer the album’s serene exit. “We’ve been pushing the boundaries of what the expressions of our music looks like, trying different tempos, trying different beat expressions, things that are beatless,” Hunt says. “And so I feel like this album that we’ve created is way more dynamic and it reflects that we’re more liberated.”\n","short":"The trio returns with a lighter tone and a more nomadic creative

Remix Album","standard":"Forget song of the summer—2024’s undisputed album of the summer (northern hemisphere version) arrived in early June with a slime-green album cover and wall-to-wall bangers that would launch Charli xcx’s career to stratospheric new heights. (Cue news anchors worldwide grappling with the sociopolitical ramifications of “being brat.”) For years, the self-directed English artist enjoyed a reputation buzzier than “cult favorite” yet not quite “main pop girl,” but with the release of her sixth studio album, she hadn’t just captured the zeitgeist—she’d become it.\n\nIf you didn’t see it coming, well, neither did Charli. “I really was preparing for this album to be for my fanbase only, and not really break outside the walls of that at all,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe with typical candor. Nevertheless, she presented the concept to her label with a manifesto she’d written—things she’d wanted to say since 2016’s paradigm-shifting <i>Vroom Vroom</i> EP. “‘On this record there’s going to be no traditional radio songs, because we don’t live in that world now,’” she told them. “This fanbase I have built is so hungry for me and my peers and our slightly-left world of pop/dance music—they’re hungry for us to succeed. That doesn’t mean that we have to do any pandering to any other side of the industry. We just have to do it for them because they’ve championed us for so long, and that’s all we need to light a fire.”\n\nNot content to rest while that fire’s still burning, Charli’s also committed to single-handedly keeping the remix industry afloat. You could call the full-length remix album yet another shrewd marketing move, though the project was in the works well before <i>BRAT</i> blew up. Here, a cross-generational who’s who of cool kids mingles in the smoking section of fall’s most exclusive party, where NYC garage-rock legends rub elbows with genuine pop divas and mystical Swedish rappers. And for all <i>BRAT</i>’s messy rawness regarding the complications of being a woman in the industry, the remix album brings together a slick-talking Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande at her glitchiest, Robyn flexing her ’90s bona fides, Tinashe basking in her own long-awaited shine, and naturally, the Lorde remix that broke the internet. Brat summer is dead.

Leading the charge is Tego Calderón, followed by giants like Farruko and Maldy, rising stars like SAIKO and Luar La L, and frequent collaborators like Feid and Myke Towers. “This album reflects where I am as an artist,” says Yandel. “I feel like I'm in my prime, at my peak. I’ve been blessed, and my music has transcended.” Across 19 tracks, he celebrates old-school reggaetón while also opening the door to other sounds, like dembow and trap. Here, he shares his thoughts on some of his favorite tracks from the album.\n\n<b>“PUÑO DE TITO”</b>\n “This track is really special because it captures my present. We managed to express a lot with a powerful beat. I chose it to open the album because it sets the right energy for my fans to enjoy what's to come. For me, creating an album is a huge responsibility. It’s impactful because it revolves around the stage of life I'm in, and I always incorporate the musical trends my audience is supporting at that time.”\n\n<b>“REGGAETON MALANDRO”</b>\n “When I heard the finished track, all I could say was ‘Wow, this is incredible.’ When Nesty La Mente Maestra brought the song to me to work on together, I fell in love with it. It captures the essence of our golden era of reggaetón. At the same time, it shows where I am as an artist. I feel like I'm in my prime, at my peak. I’ve been blessed, but each day I have to work even harder, and experience helps me adapt to the necessary changes.”\n\n<b>“OLD SCHOOL” feat. Farruko</b>\n “I met up with Farruko in Las Vegas, and we spent hours in the studio together until we recorded a couple of songs. This one in particular stood out to us because the lyrics reflect how the genre was growing while we were growing up in Puerto Rico. We've been doing this for a long time, and it takes a lot of discipline. From the first day I performed at a show and got paid to bring my music to fans, I realized I needed to establish a routine. Like in any regular job, I go to the studio every day to create music.”\n\n<b>“HABLAME CLARO”</b>\n “I remember the day we recorded this track—I was in Los Angeles and Tainy showed up at the studio with this amazing song. He worked on it with ICON, and the rest is history. For me, innovation is always a priority. For us artists, it's impossible to completely change our style, because it's part of our DNA. But we can make the right adjustments to connect with new generations.”\n\n<b>“BORRACHO Y LOCO” feat. Myke Towers</b>\n “Myke is more than a colleague; he’s a friend. I admire his talent and have enjoyed watching him constantly grow. ‘BORRACHO Y LOCO’ was the first single we released from this album, more than a year before the full record dropped.

The glow-up is real on <i>GLORIOUS</i>, her official debut album, but let it be known that the reigning queen of crunk is still hanging out the window with her ratchet-ass friends when the opportunity arises. \n\n“It’s 7 pm Friday/It’s 95 degrees/I ain’t got no n***a and no n***a ain’t got me,” she declares in the opening bars of “TGIF,” a worthy “F.N.F.” follow-up made for blasting at max volume. There’s plenty of the rowdy girl-power anthems fans have come to expect from Big Glo, among them the bad-bitch motivational “PROCEDURE” with Latto and “WHATCHU KNO ABOUT ME,” a Sexyy Red collab that riffs on the Trill Entertainment classic “Wipe Me Down.” Less expected is “RAIN DOWN ON ME,” a gospel number with a blessing from Kirk Franklin, though it’s really only fitting for a rapper born

Album","standard":"Anti Up (Chris Lake and Chris Lorenzo) make dance music that pulses with the defiant spirit of rebellion and the allure of hedonism. The British producers wrote their debut album, <i>What Is Life</i>, with dark rooms in mind, drawing inspiration from the underground clubs and sounds that shaped their youth—where the dance floor became the ultimate escape. \n\nPunk energy surges throughout the record, as they gleefully tear down the drudgery of the nine-to-five on the bass-heavy “The Weekend”; rouse a rallying cry to “get down with the movement” over an old-school, funky beat on “Revolution”; and take pride in disrupting the order on “Outlaws,” where guitar riffs and laser synths collide in a frenetic storm. Elsewhere, debauchery takes over in the sex-fueled tech house of “Freaky Feed Me” and the high-speed techno delirium of “Do You Know Where Your Children Are.” From their dark rooms, Anti Up invites existential reflection on the title track, delivering answers to “What is life?” that are as playful as they are profound: “Life is a bed of roses/Life is a party full of posers/Life is a drug, don’t overdose it.”\n","short":"The British producing duo draw inspiration from underground clubs."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-is-life/1769712927","playParams":{"id":"1769712927","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6GOT0vZhU1AAmvtfhqLtKU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769712927/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1403899802","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1403899802?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728897235745}}},"1769804548":{"id":"1769804548","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769804548?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/toydrum/272395651","name":"Timestalker (Original Soundtrack)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Toydrum","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/5d/6e/845d6e2f-2911-e99b-76ef-6634a81bf10a/105045.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"2e2430","textColor2":"441526","textColor4":"543346","textColor1":"15010a","bgColor":"94aec7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/timestalker-original-soundtrack/1769804548","playParams":{"id":"1769804548","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52kr6dayGkuGzA7P8mMhsX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769804548/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"272395651","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/272395651?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728619846330}}},"1770092808":{"id":"1770092808","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770092808?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e4/35/7b/e4357b12-b8e7-58a6-bf3e-302e31f98e83/Jobae641c32-dca1-4e9e-bc59-ddc7e9f6755f-177011629-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345858399_1916517439-Time1728428235906.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","14100d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1b1f1e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"232723","textColor2":"14100d","textColor4":"2c2e28","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1b1f1e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6c/aa/58/6caa58a8-369d-2de6-bc26-a6637ba28f69/fdb60202-42f5-4e74-a48f-53ae52a882b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ddd2cb","textColor2":"fcdec8","textColor4":"dec3ae","textColor1":"fbf2ec","bgColor":"675344","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/44/b0/59/44b05993-7123-d116-50b1-644d5da937e2/Job0b531db3-3890-4b2f-9fc9-07889aa113f8-177011630-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345858400_1916517440-Time1728429290933.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"93ae9b","textColor2":"d8a76b","textColor4":"b18858","textColor1":"b3d6bd","bgColor":"130f10","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/44/0b/d2/440bd257-23d2-e56f-0033-0b01ea758d8d/4e955fde-e6a2-4c4e-a092-a2fa87cbd2b3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d7cbc0","textColor2":"e4dad5","textColor4":"cbbfb8","textColor1":"f3e9df","bgColor":"685344","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carter-faith/1489205896","name":"The Aftermath - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Carter Faith","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/68/f1/48/68f14842-cffa-e164-c7a7-78cf6dbdb45f/24UMGIM98674.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a7b9a7","textColor2":"d7bb86","textColor4":"b49b70","textColor1":"c7e0cc","bgColor":"251c15","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The fallout after a breakup can be worse than the split itself. Carter Faith explores that messy, complicated experience on <i>The Aftermath</i>, a five-pack of sad, sassy country songs about difficult endings and new beginnings. <i>The Aftermath</i> opens with its title track, a gentle and melodic heartbreak ballad that, with Faith’s nimble vocals, recalls Carly Pearce and Lee Ann Womack. “Alright” chronicles the “shot of ecstasy” that is new love, with appropriately dramatic production. “Strong Stuff” gives country’s drinking-song trope a sexy makeover, with a well-placed F-bomb dropped in the chorus for good measure, while the sweet and encouraging “Late Bloomer” gives Faith room to show off her softer side. Bluegrass and roots music legend Alison Krauss joins Faith on “Blue Bird,” a clever and vulnerable heartbreak song that invokes Tom Petty and makes ample use of both singers’ agile and complementary voices. The North Carolina-born singer-songwriter co-wrote each track, with co-writers including Ashley Monroe and Jessie Jo Dillon.

Had he been more prescient about curating a selection of these performances for a project like <i>Keys to the City Volume One</i>, he might have realized the treasure trove of material he was sitting on.\n\n“It’s like five years [of recordings],” he tells Apple Music. “You got to think, it’s two sets each night for a whole month. And when I first started, I only had one day off, so I was doing six days a week the first few years. And so many people come in. I looked up the scheduling of who I had on the bill that the audience knew of—that’s one thing—but there were so many people that just popped up on us. So many of those kinds of moments.” In the end, Glasper chose nine standouts.\n\nThe set list runs the gamut of what audiences might encounter on a given night, with Glasper having selected performances of songs you’re unlikely to hear elsewhere. They include versions of The Roots’ “Step Into the Realm” featuring Black Thought, Outkast’s “Prototype” as sung by Norah Jones, a cover of Chick Corea’s “Paint the World” featuring Thundercat, a particularly dialed-in arrangement of Glasper’s early-career Mulgrew Miller tribute “One for Grew,” and an impossibly groovy revamp of Ready for the World’s “Love You Down” sung by the voice we hear on all three of Glasper’s 2024 Apple Music collaborative projects, Meshell Ndegeocello. “She’s an icon,” Glasper says. “And just one of the greatest artists, in my opinion, ever. I don’t think she gets as much flowers as she should.” \n\n<i>Keys to the City</i>’s sole original composition, “Didn’t Find Nothing in My Blues Song Blues,” features improvised singing from Esperanza Spalding, and plays—with its lighthearted onstage banter and meandering storyline—as something Glasper says is exemplary of the Robtober vibe. “[It] shows the other side of us—the pure, unadulterated—just two personalities with their instruments, jazz cats,” he says. “It felt so cool, so natural. She was just like, ‘Hey, you want to do a blues?’ I was like, ‘Cool,’ and then we just started. We never rehearsed it. She didn’t know what she was going to say.

But <i>Moon Music</i>’s title track upends expectations quickly, dissolving into a simple piano melody that refracts and folds in on itself until lead vocalist Chris Martin breaks the spell.\n\n“Once upon a time I tried to get myself together/Be more like the sky and welcome every kind of weather,” Martin muses in a singsong cadence, picking apart his insecurities and foibles until he finally asks, “Is anyone out there? I just need a friend,” as the instruments backing him melt into a puddle. The show of vulnerability is a startling opening, but being so open felt right for the multi-hyphenate Martin. “With ‘MOON MUSiC,’” Martin tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, “I felt like, ‘Well, what if I just really told how I feel every day?’”\n\nAt this point in their career, closer to the end of their run than not (more on that in a moment), Coldplay has broken up the cycle by touring continuously while making and releasing new music rather than subjecting themselves to predictable album-tour cycles. The band considers <i>Moon Music</i> to be of a piece with 2021’s <i>Music of the Spheres</i> rather than another era. “I quite like this way of working where you don’t have to attach albums to tours and they don’t have to be these things that start and stop,” says bassist Guy Berryman. “It’s quite nice having the fluidity of what we are doing.”\n\n<i>Moon Music</i>, like the satellite it’s named after, dips in and out of different phases while still holding fast to Coldplay’s hooky, thoughtful core—appropriate for an album that’s largely about remaining true to oneself. “JUPiTER” is a tale of self-acceptance that opens with Martin in folkie mode, with more voices and instruments coming in as the titular character begins to feel comfortable in her own skin: “I love who I love,” Martin and a choir sing in call-and-response mode on the chorus, and the music grows more ecstatic as Jupiter’s story grows more jubilant. The gorgeously assembled “🌈,” meanwhile, incorporates the late Maya Angelou singing the spiritual “God Put a Rainbow in the Clouds.” “You have to accept all your colors and all the colors of other people—literally and metaphorically,” says Martin. “Once you accept all those colors, then you can be yourself, and then you can let everyone else be themselves.”\n\nColdplay’s and Martin’s flirtations with the dance floor over the years have resulted in some of their biggest hits, and <i>Moon Music</i> finds salvation in different eras of clubbing. “AETERNA” brings the band back to the rave, its stretched-out guitars and galloping rhythms framing Martin’s exhortations to “feel it flow.” The duet with Nigerian upstart Ayra Starr “GOOD FEELiNGS” drops by the disco, while “feelslikeimfallinginlove” hearkens back to Coldplay’s grandest pop triumphs, its fist-pumping chorus getting energy from the romantic sentiments Martin’s singing about.\n\nMuch has been made of Martin’s insisting that Coldplay is going to call it quits after album 12. (“Having that limit means that the quality control is so high right now that for a song to make it is almost impossible, which is great,” he explains.) But Martin wants Coldplay’s listeners to experience <i>Moon Music</i> as a representation of where he and his bandmates are in this dizzying moment. “It’s our manifesto, or my way of looking at things right now,” says Martin. “In terms of how to continue, how to not give up, how to accept reality, not run away from it, not hate anybody—even in the midst of always being filled with so many difficult emotions. And it’s with Max Martin: He made sure that it’s really good.”","short":"Chris Martin and co. defy expectations on their 10th LP: “This is our manifesto.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moon-music-full-moon-edition/1770789137","playParams":{"id":"1770789137","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1PdMoahMiMnqWfzWZs3xSI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770789137/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"471744","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/471744?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728910148449}}},"1771033103":{"id":"1771033103","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771033103?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Spoken Word","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tank-and-the-bangas/685630243","name":"The Heart, The Mind, The Soul (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tank and the Bangas","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/07/7f/8a/077f8aa3-3d3d-ce69-cf55-746df219f24c/24UMGIM85565.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d19756","textColor2":"dc7480","textColor4":"b7626e","textColor1":"fdb762","bgColor":"221b28","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-heart-the-mind-the-soul-deluxe/1771033103","playParams":{"id":"1771033103","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ySfGjDjc2O6JlllmtDMLu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771033103/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"685630243","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/685630243?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728647919479}}},"1771387450":{"id":"1771387450","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771387450?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marc-copland/147492513","name":"Dreaming (feat.

His first album, 2023’s <i>Amar</i>, established him as a bona fide star, but rapping is no longer his main focus. BigX is a proud father of two, and everything he does (rap included) is to give his children things he was never afforded. On 2024’s <i>TAKE CARE</i>, he makes clear where his priorities lie.\n\n“My kids is what drives me,” he tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “That’s the reason when I’m tired and I get up every day when I don’t want to get up, they’re the reason.” This album, as such, is for the next generation. Yes, he raps his ass off and showcases why he’s one of Texas’ most celebrated stars, but more important than acclaim and fame is making sure the mouths that rely on him are adequately fed. “My little boy, he made me realize, ‘Okay, life is for real. This is a real thing.’” \n\nThat seriousness makes its way onto <i>TAKE CARE</i>, like on “Therapy Session.” X showcases his signature Southern drawl over cheery piano chords, stinging handclaps, and soaring guitar solos. He lays out the stakes for the entire record, paying tribute to his two children: “My family rely/When I be away from ’em I cry/’Cause I love ’em the most, I’d hate for them ever to say that their daddy wasn’t right on they side,” he raps. “I feel like I see the whole world,” he says. “I really understand why we’re here.”\n","short":"One of Texas’ most celebrated stars is doing it for the

Album","standard":"No matter how hard he appears to try, Rod Wave seems unable to escape the sadness. As the veritable king of pain rap, the St. Petersburg, Florida, artist has frequently sworn off the emotional depths that came to define his catalog, only to return to this thematic well again and again to produce masterful works born of hard times and mired in misery. As such, the trap-soul hybrids his fans continue to expect and, perhaps, demand from him persist on his sixth studio album <i>Last Lap</i>. Case in point: The finality implied by its title runs counter to the title track’s closing refrain, his inability to let go less a choice than a calling. \n\nFrom the very beginning, Rod shows that he’s still wrestling with demons. Opener “Turtle Race” mourns the lost while fretting over fresh woes, not the least of which being an ominous interaction with law enforcement. “Federal Nightmares” furthers the narrative as he watches loved ones ensnared by a carceral system while wondering if he too will be harmed or even destroyed by it. \n\nNot surprising given the gravity of its contents, only a few vocal guests get to enter his inner sanctum this time around. Lil Yachty and Lil Baby trade knowing verses with their peer on the unfiltered “Fuck Fame,” while Rylo Rodriguez shares some experiences worth processing on the frank advice session “Jersey Numbers.” Thankfully, a hopeful streak emerges now and then to counter the anxious gloom, evidenced by the heartfelt declarations of “25” and the powerful positive thinking behind the gospel-tinged “The Best.” No passive figure in his own story, he strikes back against hater mentalities on “Apply Pressure” and jet-sets defensively on “Passport Junkie.”\n","short":"On his sixth album, the king of pain-rap bares his soul again."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/last-lap/1772368554","playParams":{"id":"1772368554","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/31d8IQikmNAeFqYr1r3MK2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772368554/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1140623439","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1140623439?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728897048719}}},"1772394609":{"id":"1772394609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772394609?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/d6/4d/ced64d1a-fea3-5464-5b9b-2731c095be08/Job7268db01-279e-4620-b83f-952dfbc40dac-177192243-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346185803_1919444419-Time1728665836943.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fa8e69"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"131a14"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"58c5d1","textColor2":"fa8e69","textColor4":"d4835f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131a14","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/8a/9c/0a8a9cdb-2658-f5b7-c492-6ea7b58b8d36/3f25f69d-6ec1-4910-a1e4-0d833225eaa0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"261711","textColor2":"060201","textColor4":"271811","textColor1":"040101","bgColor":"af6f51","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3a/1a/fe/3a1afe8f-f4ab-7096-1f4c-fa6414e9bc95/Jobe8a27cfd-9465-4893-b493-0d3f08e0e804-177192244-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346185802_1919444420-Time1728667497761.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"16dad5","textColor2":"98e5ff","textColor4":"81c5d5","textColor1":"11ffff","bgColor":"294830","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/f2/fe/52f2fe56-e9e9-ff2d-a2ed-4884ded47f97/434af226-0ccf-4f00-969f-9dd86f9bd712.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c69d77","textColor2":"dcb08d","textColor4":"b39374","textColor1":"f4bb92","bgColor":"0d220d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyla/1552925732","name":"TYLA +","artistName":"Tyla","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2a/cc/48/2acc48c7-e092-6b83-ce65-ff80ac6eb51c/196872520118.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a6dbd8","textColor2":"24cee4","textColor4":"26b6c3","textColor1":"c4fdff","bgColor":"2f563f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"“I've always wanted to be a pop star, but beyond that, I wanted to be an African pop star,” Tyla tells Apple Music. “The roots of my sound are in amapiano music, in South African and African music.” Though the megaviral 2023 single “Water” may have put the South African singer-songwriter on the proverbial map—first as a social media sensation, then as the highest-charting African female soloist ever on Billboard’s Hot 100, earning her the inaugural Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance—she’s been carefully plotting her path to the top for years. “Since I started experimenting with amapiano, I just feel like it's really helped me get to this point where I created something that is fresh and new, but still familiar and comes from home,” she says. “It's a sound of Africa, and it's something that I couldn't be more proud about.” \n\nShe weaves through a blend of pop, R&B, amapiano, and Afrobeats (“pop-piano sounds cute,” she admits) across <i>TYLA</i>, a coming-of-age chronicle through love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. “I’m speaking about the things that I've gone through while creating the album—basically three years in the making,” she explains. “I was becoming a woman. So it was a lot of growing that happened, and me realizing my worth, and realizing how I want to be treated—and how basically, I'm that girl, and people need to know I'm that girl.”\n\nWhile the project was brought to life with the help of global producers including Sammy Soso, Mocha, Believve, Rayo, and Sir Nolan, Tyla made sure they all had a taste of her homeland. “[It was important] to bring some to South Africa,” she explains, “so when we get in the studio, they have context. Some people that try amapiano sound so watered down, it's cringey. So even though I am mixing it with pop and R&B, I didn't want it to sound watered down. Music is our everything in Africa. The way we speak, the way we dance, literally, our dance moves—they come so naturally. It's just in us. It’s our essence.” \n\nReleased in October 2024, the deluxe edition, <i>TYLA +</i>, adds three new tracks, including “PUSH 2 START,” the R&B-heavy “BACK to YOU,” and “SHAKE AH,” a blistering amapiano production brought to life with help from genre stars Tony Duardo, optimist, and Maestro Fresh-Wes. Below, Tyla talks us through key tracks from the album.\n\n<b>“Intro” (Tyla & Kelvin Momo)</b>\n“I wanted to start off my album with something that was truly South African, something that showed people the root of where I started, before ‘Water,’ before all of these mixtures. I secretly recorded a voice note when I was in a session with Kelvin Momo. I loved hearing the people in the session, speaking, hearing the language, the accents. It was so raw and real. Kelvin Momo is my favorite amapiano producer—his music and his sound is my heart.”\n\n<b>“Safer”</b>\n“The message of the song is something that I feel like a lot of people could relate to. And the energy of the song I feel like is a strong intro to open an album.”\n\n<b>“Water”</b>\n“‘Water’ surpassed all expectations. I could've never expected all of these accolades—a Grammy, the Billboard Hot 100, people all over the world dancing and pouring water down their back. From the time I finished recording the song, it was all that I was listening to. It was also like a step away from what I was used to, because I [had been] <i>very</i> PG. And with this one, I was more grown up and I was experimenting more. And even though I don't enjoy vulgar music, I feel like we were able to make the song speak about what it speaks about, but in a way that's friendly.”\n\n<b>“Truth or Dare”</b>\n“This was the song where I was playing more house-y with it. It’s me calling out people, being like, ‘Hey, <i>now</i> you care.’ I'm not that type of person, but these are feelings that I felt around the time where I'm like, ‘Where did this person come from? Out of nowhere, you want to now talk to me?’ and I literally hate it. I'm sure a lot of people have felt that.”\n\n<b>“No.1” (feat. Tems)</b>\n“Tems and I had been wanting to make a song for long now. We ended up making it work, and Tems' voice alone is so amazing, so unique. The song is for everyone, but when I had it in mind, it was really for the girls—me and Tems, girl power, African girls—and we were just really pushing that message of ‘I'm leaving. I don't need anybody. If this is not serving me anymore, I’m gone, and I'm going to be okay.’ Always put yourself before anything.”\n\n<b>“Breathe Me”</b>\n“It's a song that's so emotional and so real. It's just about love, of how strong love is, and how you don't even need anything else. I don't need anything else. You don't need anything else—just me, and you; just breathe me and we'll be fine.”\n\n<b>“Butterflies”</b>\n“With ‘Butterflies,’ I was in a session with [producer and songwriter Ari PenSmith] and he was playing me some stuff that he's worked on, and I was like, 'Cool, cool, cool.' And then he played this, and I fell in love with it. It sat so perfectly with my voice. I connected with the song instantly, and it was too specific to what I was going through to not do anything with it.”\n\n<b>“On and On”</b>\n“This was [an initial] version of my sound, before ‘Water’ and everything. I made this with Corey Marlon Lindsay-Keay in South Africa. We were supposed to go out, and we didn't end up going out, so I was dressed up in a whole outfit in the studio session, and he was producing. I love the song so much because it's so nostalgic but new. I love that it feels like old-school R&B. I love that it has hints of Aaliyah's influence, but it's new, and fresh, and African—all things that are Tyla. The messaging is not so serious—it’s literally about not wanting a party to end.”\n\n<b>“Jump” (Tyla, Gunna & Skillibeng)</b>\n“‘Jump’ is a very different vibe. I really just wanted to tell people who I am, and I had to show my confidence through the song. And the opening line, with Skilli being like, 'Original girl, you want a replica? No.' There's no replica. That intro was already perfect, and it segues to that line of me saying, 'They've never had a pretty girl from Joburg/They see me now and that's what they prefer.' That line is just—it’s too iconic for me, and I'm just so excited to hear all the girls sing it, all the Joburg girls sing it, all the girls from home. And having Gunna on it, I really feel like it took me into that world further, making it even more raw and cool.”\n\n<b>“ART”</b>\n“When I'm with someone that treats me so good, treats me well, treats me like art, treats me like a princess, I will be there for them. I will be their art piece. We also played with that wording where it can be ‘art piece,’ but also your peace and your comfort. As a woman, that's how I want to be treated, and that's how I would treat you if you treat me that way. It’s about being treasured.”\n\n<b>“On My Body” (Tyla & Becky G)</b>\n“This was such a fun one because it’s in my world, but also I played a bit with the Latin vibes. The feature came so organically—I was in studio, and she was in a session next door. She loved it, and she recorded a verse, and I absolutely died. I died. I just love her touch, and how it just broadened the audience, because now it's just bringing everybody into this experience. It's a melting pot with all these genres, and I love that I was able to expand it even further.”\n\n<b>“Priorities”</b>\n“This song was probably the most difficult to share, because it's really letting people into my heart and mind, and how I feel I've been with myself. I feel like people would resonate with it, and it speaks about what a lot of people feel and may not express. [The idea of having spread yourself too thin] is something that's so raw and real, that not even just women, men, everybody feels.”\n\n<b>“To Last”</b>\n“I love this song with all my heart. I was in the Vaal with LuuDadeejay, and I literally finished this song in five minutes. It was based off an experience that my friend was going through at the time. About a year prior, I wrote the lines ‘You never gave us a chance, it's like you never wanted to last.’ And that note just came to mind, and the song just flowed out of me. I ended up going through something that made me feel that way. It was like I told the future, which is not good—but I fell in love with the song again. It’s so South African: It’s amapiano, it's house-y, it's our sound.”\n\n<b>“Water (Remix)” (Tyla & Travis Scott)</b>\n“Travis reached out—he loved ‘Water,’ and around the time, I was like, 'I don't want a remix, I'm cool.' But Travis Scott was so unexpected that I wanted to do it so bad, and he absolutely killed it. He added some South African shout-outs in his verse, and I just knew that people from home were going to love it—he acknowledged us, and he mentioned [the South African telephone country code] +27 and all those things.

It helps me get in touch with my emotions when I feel far away from them.” The North Carolina singer-songwriter has created this DJ mix for World Mental Health Day, digging through her personal memories and the music that’s impacted her mental wellbeing along the way. \n\n“It breaks my heart the way music marks your memory and pulls you back into past spaces and feelings,” she says, hinting at the memories—and vulnerabilities—poured into this mix. “All of these songs have either calmed me, sparked a fire within me, or inspired me,” she says. “They’ve helped me feel more engaged with myself.”\n\nThe result is a tender, carefully curated listen, each track selected and placed with specific intent. It reveals plenty about De Souza’s own mental processes and the music that’s made a difference to her. At the same time, it has a clear goal for the listener: to carry you through. It could make you smile, dance; at the very least, it aims to help you “get in touch with some raw space of emotion,” she says. \n\nFor De Souza, one of the most impactful tracks you’ll hear is Ought’s “Beautiful Blue Sky.” “I remember one time, on tour, I was going through a really bad mental breakdown,” she says, revealing the personal story behind her connection to the Canadian band’s 2015 release. “We were at a venue after a show, and my body became so flooded with this wild rage. I felt so completely out of control and lost in the feeling. It was pouring rain outside. I put on my headphones, started the song, and ran out into the streets. I kept running and running, blasting the song in my ears, getting soaking wet. It was the clearest and most hard-hitting the lyrics had ever been. After that, I kept going back to that song whenever I needed to excise my anger. During the most chaotic, overwhelmingly tragic time I’d ever experienced, ‘Beautiful Blue Sky’ was a beam of hopeful light.”\n","short":"A mental-health-focused mix that aims to connect and uplift."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/world-mental-health-day-dj-mix/1772748408","playParams":{"id":"1772748408","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772748408/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1047781911","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1047781911?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728583240659}}},"1772788406":{"id":"1772788406","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772788406?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=302836005-260144111-919279596","name":"TMZ","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Money Man, Zaytoven & Trauma Tone","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fb/7f/5b/fb7f5bb2-bb51-40b3-b88c-4397549ca36c/197342783149_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca6021","textColor2":"fb5127","textColor4":"cc4422","textColor1":"f87326","bgColor":"12110e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tmz/1772788406","playParams":{"id":"1772788406","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Z8BUrS5QTkofkDvhh4zGN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772788406/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"302836005","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/302836005?l=en-US"},{"id":"260144111","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/260144111?l=en-US"},{"id":"919279596","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/919279596?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1728728877221}}},"1772965592":{"id":"1772965592","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772965592?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/28/c9/58/28c958c1-680d-499e-f863-918168104f88/Job2f3b9639-61aa-46ef-83bc-853c3da0c384-177187385-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346176283_1919369005-Time1728661732245.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","141211"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"191611"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"28251c","textColor2":"141211","textColor4":"342f25","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"191611","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/b5/85/84b58573-2194-9679-2753-657fcf7b0dc0/a96261ae-6548-4e7d-8b85-13ae6624e496.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bec3c4","textColor2":"daefef","textColor4":"b2c3c3","textColor1":"eaeff1","bgColor":"101612","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c3/71/27/c37127a1-c5af-b1ae-9149-adfe4b1354ef/Job5f8b0ecd-761a-4255-a461-aeae8e68da5a-177187386-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346176284_1919369004-Time1728663533956.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"282218","textColor2":"100d09","textColor4":"2f291d","textColor1":"070503","bgColor":"ab986e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e8/72/cb/e872cb58-a8a4-4f61-f2da-4779998adc75/73732498-7ad6-4b85-8533-dd92c81c4dc7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a4c097","textColor2":"efdcaa","textColor4":"bfb088","textColor1":"cdefbc","bgColor":"000200","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jelly-roll/30624911","name":"Beautifully Broken (Pickin’ Up The Pieces)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Jelly Roll","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/e3/e0/a0e3e0d3-f6c8-8a1c-bcf1-17c49154b986/24UM1IM08555.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"282319","textColor2":"070403","textColor4":"292319","textColor1":"060503","bgColor":"b49f73","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jelly Roll’s quick rise from obscure Nashville hip-hop artist to beloved country singer-songwriter is one of the genre’s more exciting success stories in recent memory. In just a couple years’ time, the Antioch, Tennessee-born and -raised artist, whose offstage name is Jason DeFord, has won major awards, including New Artist of the Year at the 2023 CMAs, a category that often serves as an industry coronation. During that period, he collaborated with a laundry list of stars from country music and beyond, including Lainey Wilson, Eminem, Post Malone, and Cody Johnson. It’s appropriate, then, that this follow-up to DeFord’s first proper country album, 2023’s wildly successful <i>Whitsitt Chapel</i>, would take an inspirational tone: A man with a checkered past that includes time in prison, Jelly Roll has never shied away from using his own story to motivate others.\n\n<i>Beautifully Broken</i> opens with “Winning Streak,” a deeply vulnerable song about substance abuse and recovery, with gospel choir vocals backing up DeFord’s hopeful imperatives to “hold on.” He is similarly encouraging on “Everyone Bleeds,” a hip-hop-tinged reminder that money can’t buy immortality, and “Born Again,” a bluesy invocation of resilience that makes great use of his soulful side. Other highlights include single “I Am Not Okay,” a brooding plea for compassion in tough times, and closing track “What’s Wrong with Me,” a comparably bright and buoyant celebration of accepting one’s imperfections.","short":"The country sensation’s inspirational album picks up six extra
