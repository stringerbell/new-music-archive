Headless chickens. Drinking. These are just some of the topics fearless Pixies leader Black Francis sings about on the band’s ninth album (and fifth since re-forming sans Kim Deal). But the overarching theme, if there is one, is right there in the title: zombies. Both the <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> variety (“Jane [The Night the Zombies Came]”) and the <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> shopping mall variety (“You’re So Impatient”) make an appearance, as do zombie movies themselves (“Chicken”). Not that it’s a concept album or anything—the driving punk of “Oyster Beds” references Black Francis’ painting hobby, while “Johnny Good Man,” “Ernest Evans,” and “Kings of the Prairie” offer snapshots of life on the road. Elsewhere, guitarist Joey Santiago takes a lyrical bow with “Hypnotised,” a clever pop tune written in a Middle Ages poetic form called the sestina, and new bassist Emma Richardson (ex-Band of Skulls) lends her instrumental talents and understated backing vocals to tracks like “Motoroller,” which bounces like a <i>Doolittle</i>-era classic.","short":"The reanimated indie stalwarts’ fifth

Album","standard":"The US filmmaker Ken Burns’ 2024 documentary on Leonardo da Vinci ambitiously attempts to make sense of the Italian Renaissance giant’s scientific and artistic genius in a documentary that’s complemented by Caroline Shaw’s inventive and beautifully balanced soundtrack. There’s an underlying frenetic edge to Shaw’s music which she imaginatively scores for percussion, choir, and string quartet, giving the impression of a man always at work, always thinking. “Optics, Light & Shadow,” for instance, is a filigree, restless pizzicato-based groove, while “Flying Machines” flits and scampers as it soars.\n\nAt various points, amid the feverishness, Shaw displays glorious canvasses of sound that provide moments of deep reflection, including “Treatise on Painting” that draws on Shaw’s extensive experience with choral forces. There are moments that inspire pure drama, too, including “Virgin of the Rocks” that seems simply to gaze, awestruck, at Leonardo’s painting. And how to portray the <i>Mona Lisa</i> in sound? Shaw chooses simplicity, bringing choir, quartet, and percussion together for a sweeping hymn to Leonardo’s most celebrated and perhaps most enigmatic artwork.","short":"Shaw’s soundtrack bursts with

Album","standard":"“How long is too long to be stuck in a memory?” That eternally unquantifiable question defines Sophie Allison’s fourth album as Soccer Mommy, a record marked by loss and grief. <i>Evergreen</i> marks a perspective shift from Allison’s 2022 album <i>Sometimes, Forever</i>. “When I started writing songs for this album, I was very clearly in a completely different headspace and wanted to write something that felt more intimate and up front, and not kind of shrouded by having all this fun making it,” Allison tells Apple Music. “The feelings that I was expressing on this album were a lot about loss and grief, because that’s what I was going through at the time—a lot of changes. It was scary and different, and everything felt kind of sudden. So I was just grappling with all of that.”\n\nThe result is a richly melodic work that, with the production touch of Ben H. Allen (Animal Collective, Belle and Sebastian), feels cavernous in its scope while retaining intimacy. There are moments when Allison cranks up the volume and rips into the riffage—witness the chunky chords on “Driver,” or the shape-shifting guitar lines that stretch across “Salt in Wound”—but elsewhere Allison achieves a magic trick of making nuanced, close-to-the-vest songwriting sound one million miles wide. The closing title track is draped in stretches of strings not unlike generational counterpart beabadoobee’s work, while on “M” she laments, “I hear your voice in all my favorite songs.” It’s a raw admission on an album full of them.\n","short":"Sophie Allison grapples with loss and grief on her fourth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evergreen/1757002283","playParams":{"id":"1757002283","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1IN1QBfV9tNR6fFgR7PsUl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757002283/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1137781048","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1137781048?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729863370885}}},"1757926264":{"id":"1757926264","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757926264?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/black-oak-county/1137940619","name":"III","artistName":"Black Oak County","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f4/fd/c4/f4fdc45f-cfd2-f8df-e2e9-44a11a3810b7/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"40b055","textColor2":"4ad060","textColor4":"3da851","textColor1":"4eda66","bgColor":"080b15","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/iii/1757926264","playParams":{"id":"1757926264","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Z4iTaQG0tn6JZTvMEjyrS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757926264/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1137940619","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1137940619?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729810109606}}},"1758813096":{"id":"1758813096","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758813096?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/43/6d/ab436d07-ffdc-5b77-ef8f-132765b09250/e586f33a-3047-4097-96f9-babf7177374a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"251f15","textColor2":"120d06","textColor4":"2d2618","textColor1":"070503","bgColor":"9b8860","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bastille/420203509","name":"“&” (Ampersand)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Bastille","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d7/23/b4/d723b449-7e6f-d228-6d22-a61144581b43/24UMGIM68862.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"794156","textColor2":"492336","textColor4":"6c4d5c","textColor1":"59132e","bgColor":"f9f8f4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Dan Smith has long been a storyteller. The London-based singer-songwriter has spent the years since founding Bastille in 2010, originally as a solo project, writing moving, anthemic songs about a cast of characters traversing everything from the people killed in the volcanic ruins of “Pompeii” to the tragic fall of “Icarus.” On Bastille’s fifth album, <i>&</i>, Smith reaches the apex of his storytelling songwriting, composing 14 tracks entirely about historical figures. “I’ve always used someone else’s story to write about the themes I want to address in my music,” he tells Apple Music. “Now, I’ve collected these story songs to celebrate a group of people who pushed against the times they lived in and who displayed all the complexities of being human.”\n\nFrom softly picked guitar-led folk on “Emily & Her Penthouse in the Sky,” celebrating the poet Emily Dickinson, to the cinematic strings of “Essie & Paul,” honoring the lives of civil rights activists Paul and Essie Robeson, and the anthemic thump of Leonard Cohen tribute “Leonard & Marianne,” <i>&</i> is Bastille at its most imaginative and expansive. “I wanted to show these historical figures as real people and encourage listeners to find out more about them,” Smith says. “It’s been a beautiful world to inhabit.” Read on for his in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Intros & Narrators”</b>\n“I always find it’s helpful to introduce people to the world of a record by writing a song that sets the scene and my intentions at the beginning of it. I felt unworthy writing about a lot of the people I’m singing about on this album, and I wanted to tackle that feeling head-on in this track. It’s about how much trust we put into the people narrating the story we’re hearing, which is me in this case!”\n\n<b>“Eve & Paradise Lost”</b>\n“I was really interested in imagining this epic story of Adam and Eve that’s been echoed through so much culture and forcing it into a normalized domestic situation on this song. I was imagining how crazy it must have been to be the first woman with no one around to help or give you advice. It was challenging to write as a man but I’m really pleased with it. ”\n\n<b>“Emily & Her Penthouse in the Sky”</b>\n“Most of what is written about Emily Dickinson assumes that she’s this tortured, isolated poet but, after researching her life, I realized a lot of it isn’t true. She was hilarious and sociable and wrote fantastic correspondences. This song is written from the perspective of her sister, describing who Emily really is, and it explores people’s perception of someone and how it relates to their real life.” \n\n<b>“Blue Sky & the Painter”</b>\n“The painter Edvard Munch wrote a lot about his relationship with depression and spoke eloquently on how he wouldn’t create his art without the way his mind worked. I became fascinated with that tension between minds that are difficult but that also allow us to create. Musically, this track reflects that feeling by sucking you into thinking it’s quiet and acoustic and then pulling the rug out with blaring distortion.”\n\n<b>“Leonard & Marianne”</b> \n“I watched this amazing documentary on Leonard Cohen by Nick Broomfield and was inspired to write this song about his complex relationship with Marianne Ihlen. I’m imagining Leonard living in New York, being famous and thinking back to being with Marianne on the Greek island of Hydra where they met. It’s about the duality of wanting to be with someone but also betraying them.” \n\n<b>“Marie & Polonium”</b> \n“Marie Curie is another person I wanted to write about because she was constantly pushing against the society that she lived in by finding a way to be educated as a woman and ultimately inventing radiotherapy, which has saved so many lives. It’s easy to see historical characters as caricatures but I wanted to humanize these people through these songs.”\n\n<b>“Red Wine & Wilde”</b> \n“I was reading about Oscar Wilde’s life and his relationship with Bosie Douglas, his on-off partner in his later years, which became quite toxic. Wilde was a leading force for being who he was in a time when it was illegal to be gay, he refused to bow down to regressive societal pressures but he was also complicated because he had a family and children and lived an artist’s life. It’s a big story, and I wanted to zoom in on a night between Wilde and Bosie to capture the complexity of their relationship in a snapshot.”\n\n<b>“Seasons & Narcissus”</b> \n“The Narcissus myth has been retold in so many ways because it’s so relevant to the way we live our lives now, constantly being confronted by our own image on phones or Zoom calls. I wanted to tackle that obsession by writing an earnest love song that we come to realize is between Narcissus and his own reflection, producing a pretty morbid ending. ”\n\n<b>“Drawbridge & the Baroness”</b> \n“This is one of the oddest and most unique songs on the record but I love it. It’s based on a philosophical dilemma called the drawbridge exercise, which is all about power and people’s worldviews. I chased the idea while sitting at my kitchen table, layering up hundreds of tracks of my own voice harmonizing with itself. I’m really proud of it.” \n\n<b>“The Soprano & Midnight Wonderings” (feat. BIM)</b>\n“I thought people could do with a break from my voice for a minute on the record, so this track features BIM, who is a fantastic vocalist that has toured with us for many years. It’s a story from her life that we wrote together on tour and then finished at my house. It felt really important for her to sing it since she’s such a beautiful artist.” \n\n<b>“Essie & Paul”</b> \n“I wanted to write about Paul and Eslanda Robeson, who were husband and wife and civil rights activists. They had a complex relationship and I wanted to capture the compromises of long-term love on this song, as well as giving a musical nod to ‘Eleanor Rigby’ with the track being only strings and vocals. I love Sufjan Stevens and artists that bring in orchestral elements to their songs, so this one is a dream for me.”\n\n<b>“Mademoiselle & the Nunnery Blaze”</b> \n“Halfway through writing the album, I got in touch with the historian Emma Nagouse to put me onto unusual stories I could explore. She told me about this incredible French opera singer from the 17th century, Julie d’Aubigny, who had an amazing life and once broke her girlfriend out of a nunnery by burning it down. I wanted to write about that sweeping love story and the two of them not caring about the constraints of her time. It also features me trying my hand at singing in French!”\n\n<b>“Zheng Yi Sao & Questions for Her”</b> \n“Another figure that Emma directed me towards was Zheng Yi Sao, who ran a piracy empire that was so big it challenged the Chinese empire in the early 19th century. It’s crazy to me that she isn’t more well-known and this song looks back at her with awe from the present day, asking how she managed to achieve it all. It’s definitely the most bombastic song on the album.”\n\n<b>“Telegraph Road 1977 & 2024”</b>\n“When I was 13, my dad gave me a book of poems he wrote when he was traveling across America with my mum, and in it was a verse about homelessness in San Francisco that I decided to turn into a song. It’s always been something I’ve wanted to pick up again and this album felt like the perfect opportunity to do that. I added a verse from my perspective in 2024, addressing my dad’s words and ending the record from my voice, just as I started it. It also features my mum singing backing vocals, which was very special.”","short":"Dan Smith: “These songs celebrate people who pushed against the times.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ampersand/1758813096","playParams":{"id":"1758813096","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6zwfwSKAbtnCfKgzBywL2w"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758813096/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"420203509","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/420203509?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729863264682}}},"1759590493":{"id":"1759590493","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759590493?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/26/b0/04/26b00415-c7ef-fba3-195e-670a6faeb37f/Jobdc958627-15d5-43d7-ab45-eb75fd9c220e-177881120-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347561873_1930173199-Time1729529107376.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","a4dcbf"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"040707"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cdcece","textColor2":"a4dcbf","textColor4":"84b29b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040707","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/fc/1b/d3/fc1bd3e2-0a73-4b3c-31c3-751403e63a08/Jobb676acd0-4205-4f6d-9ee6-6950042b4b13-177881119-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347562354_1930173198-Time1729527187521.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9ec8b6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"040707"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbcac3","textColor2":"9ec8b6","textColor4":"80a394","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040707","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/clannad/509002","name":"Legend

Album","standard":"With 2023’s <i>Rolling Up the Welcome Mat</i>, Kelsea Ballerini signaled the start of a new era. Then four studio albums into her career, the country singer-songwriter had long since proven herself, and took a chance on rawer, more personal material in the wake of her 2022 divorce. As this follow-up attests, that heightened vulnerability unlocked new creative depths for Ballerini. Her most sonically diverse release yet, <i>PATTERNS</i> is also the fullest embodiment of Ballerini’s capabilities. Ballerini co-produced the album alongside previous collaborator Alysa Vanderheym, a songwriter and producer who has worked with a bevy of Nashville artists, including Jelly Roll, Little Big Town, and The Cadillac Three. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a gauzy, pleading midtempo ballad that makes use of more traditional country instruments like mandolin and dobro alongside prominent synthesizers, for production that’s reminiscent of Kacey Musgraves’ <i>Golden Hour</i>. “Sorry Mom” is especially potent, with Ballerini confronting a laundry list of filial indiscretions—a “lack of stickin’ to the Bible,” an abandoned college degree—before acknowledging, “I turned out all right.” “Beg for Your Love” is gentle but confident, as Ballerini takes stock of what she deserves in a relationship, like “a kiss” or “a morning call.” Other highlights include the Noah Kahan collaboration “Cowboys Cry Too” and the moody and melodic “Deep.”\n","short":"The Nashville star’s fifth album

Album and Interview","standard":"When she emerged from obscurity as a 19-year-old vagabond turned overnight SoundCloud star, Halsey was something of a cipher: You knew her voice (one of the 2010s’ prime examples of “cursive singing”), but very little else. “I think there is a little bit of a grand narrative about me that’s like, ‘I don’t know what she looks like. I couldn’t recognize her on the street because she looks different every time I see her,’” the singer tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Some people get into a creative medium and have a very specific style: ‘This is what works for me, this is who I am and what I’m comfortable with.’ And for me, I just don’t know that it’s fun unless I’m reinventing. I think a lot of people see that and get the sense that I don’t have a very secure sense of self.”\n\nIn one sense, the lead single from her fifth studio album shows she’s as hard to pin down as ever: For one, she was beginning with “The End.” An unplugged folk ballad co-produced by Alex G and Michael Uzowuru, the song shed light on recent health scares she’d been keeping under wraps. But <i>The Great Impersonator</i> is vulnerable in a new way, using the concept of homage as a lens through which to write—hence the series of photos Halsey released leading up to the album’s release in which she posed as David Bowie, Aaliyah, Kate Bush, and more. “As I get older, I love to write about myself, but I find it boring to talk about myself,” she says. “So these reinventions give me these little means of escapism—not in the sense of running away, but just telling the story in a different way.”\n\nThemes of identity, mortality, and legacy snake through the album’s 18 tracks, which channel ’70s folk, ’80s power ballads, ’90s alt-rock, and 2000s pop before arriving at the decade in which Halsey herself emerged. At times she reels at her own temporary nature; elsewhere, she craves depersonalization: “I think that I should try to kill my ego/’Cause if I don’t, my ego might kill me,” she yelps on the PJ Harvey-inspired “Ego.” “Hometown” is an ode to Dolly Parton, though it’s Springsteen-esque (“Glory Days” in particular) in its depiction of faded American dreams. And on “Lucky,” she riffs on the Britney Spears hit of the same name, one of the great pop ballads on fame’s diminishing returns.\n\n“I turned 20 as <i>BADLANDS</i> came out, and I’m turning 30 as this record comes out,” Halsey says, tracing the arc of her career. “I had this 10-year plan, but I didn’t really have anything beyond that. I hadn’t really thought about what was going to happen.” And though she may not know where life will take her in the next 10 years, she’s focused on appreciating the journey rather than racing towards the finish line. “I used to look at the way that SZA or Frank [Ocean] make records like, ‘Gosh, I could never spend two or three years on an album. I’m so impulsive and impatient and I just want to get it done,’” she says. “Then I spent a long time writing this record and I understood for the first time—oh, the making is the best part.” \n","short":"Halsey on album five: “I don’t know that it’s fun unless I’m reinventing.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-great-impersonator/1765593049","playParams":{"id":"1765593049","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4C23ofFqNhsaAEkThw2yRB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765593049/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"324916925","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/324916925?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729866623801}}},"1765644402":{"id":"1765644402","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765644402?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f7/46/9e/f7469e63-295b-456b-36c8-8c272e54a55a/Job0b18055a-f1e7-4c43-8ec8-9cadd2d870fb-177493110-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346762697_1924117051-Time1729067243148.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fbdec1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1b1d1a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d5d8b7","textColor2":"fbdec1","textColor4":"dbc4ad","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1b1d1a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/88/8c/53/888c53be-2b33-ebc6-7c83-f57c1dce1982/91afa741-d445-4da6-be17-14db5cb4fb6f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3bcbd","textColor2":"c9b19b","textColor4":"a4917f","textColor1":"efe7e8","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/05/44/a7/0544a7ed-04fb-5dd0-c61d-22bf17376286/Job893837d3-1136-45fe-a722-bcfedec6d18a-177493111-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346762698_1924117052-Time1729068216077.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","efd1bc"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1b1d1a"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d8bba9","textColor2":"efd1bc","textColor4":"d0b9a7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1b1d1a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ae/e9/04/aee9044c-a66d-22e8-b5a4-14f6b35afae4/f546216b-c6aa-4b3a-a791-e07312c6170d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d8bfae","textColor2":"f5ccb0","textColor4":"d4b39c","textColor1":"fbdbc6","bgColor":"4f4f4e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anna-lunoe/432291804","name":"Pearl","artistName":"Anna Lunoe","artwork":{"width":3898,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2a/52/42/2a524236-1a99-458a-f048-ea84287263d4/198846035093.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3898,"textColor3":"d5b8a9","textColor2":"fcceab","textColor4":"dab59a","textColor1":"f6d1bf","bgColor":"545453","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Like its gemstone namesake, Anna Lunoe’s debut album <i>Pearl</i> arrives after years of grit and patience. Over nearly two decades, the Sydney-based artist built a global reputation on the strength of her tastemaking DJ sets and radio shows (including Apple Music’s danceXL and HYPERHOUSE). But as Lunoe’s career expanded, she felt her own music had taken a back seat. In 2023, she redirected her focus to production, challenging herself to create 40 demos in a month. Her goal wasn’t to make an album—it was to see the artist she’d become when creating music for the pure joy of it. “I started creating a lot more,” Lunoe tells Apple Music. “Then after the first month or two, I sent these songs to a friend of mine and listened to them, and it became apparent: This could be a project. If not now, what am I waiting for?”\n\n<i>Pearl</i> is the culmination of Lunoe’s self-discovery, revealing an artist who’s adventurous and effervescent, yet deeply reflective. It channels the unpredictability of her DJ sets, connecting whimsical rave that recalls Madonna’s “Ray of Light” (“The Seed”), alluring tech house (“Body Heat”), sunrise-soundtracking ambient (“Keeping Secrets”), and cathartic drum ’n’ bass (“Going Home”) through its kinetic energy. Other moments highlight Lunoe’s more vulnerable songwriting, like the pensive “Deep Blue Sea” and the glittering title track, an ode to protecting your dreams. “These songs are all tied together by the idea of finding yourself through movement—through all the different places and moods that help you recenter,” she says. “When you go to a club to dance off your frustration, hopes, and fears, you don’t want just one mood. You want to go through a journey of joy, ecstasy, questioning, stress, and anger to come back to that place of resolution. That’s what I’m hoping to do on the album.” Read on as Lunoe breaks <i>Pearl</i> down, track by track.\n\n<b>“Pearl”</b>\n“‘Pearl’ is the spiritual North Star to an idea that encapsulates the journey of this album. It's a determined song that asks us to center the pure hope we have for ourselves, our journey in this world and our community that I don't think we give enough airspace to in our day-to-day lives. It's my little mantra for tuning in to that. It's my hope that this will remind people to care for it, love it, and nurture it, and hopefully it grows into something beautiful for them. I created it with Jack Glass, who is my main collaborator across many of the tracks on the album. I really wanted the chords to give me a physical reaction, to make my stomach pang when the chorus hit.”\n\n<b>“Real Love”</b>\n“‘Real Love’ is about being in your moment. That maybe you have found yourself exactly where you are meant to be. That gathering and moving in unity with a whole group of people has the potential to resonate inner love and acceptance on a scale we don't get enough of in our lives. This song is so euphoric and also gritty, gutsy, and strong. I couldn't be happier with where this ended up. It was the first track finished, and it really became a sonic home base for finishing the rest of the album.”\n\n<b>“Polite” (feat. Shanique Marie)</b>\n“Shanique Marie added such a brilliant energy to the track. I created the instrumental with Jack and we sent it to Shanique with no guidance, just do what feels right. She sent back this incredible interpretation of not being too polite. That really resonated with me as someone who waited to get permission to do so many things in my career before I had the guts to take the reins myself, and who had to learn that no one was going to tap me on the shoulder and give me an opportunity to be whatever it was that I hoped I could be. That message was so pertinent that it needed to be on the album.”\n\n<b>“Right Here” (with Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs)</b>\n“This song has such a sassy little energy. This is a reminder to take up space and be the main character in your life and in your relationships, in your friendships, in your situation, whatever it is—take up space and know your worth. But there's also a kindness, like, we're on the same team here, but don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I'm strong, don't get it twisted. I wrote it at home on one of my early demo days, but at some point I sent the demo to one of my longtime creative partners Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, who had some ideas, and we finished it together.”\n\n<b>“The Seed”</b>\n“‘The Seed’ is one of the first songs that I wrote in those first few demo-writing days. Those days were really fun. I just spent an hour writing a song and then moved on to the next, but I instantly loved this idea. This song is about potential, and it's kinda the same idea as ‘Pearl,’ but in a different way, like we all have this abundance within us. There's this abundance in nature where this tiny little seed actually wants to sprout. You just have to water it and love it and let it grow into what it's meant to be. There's something so inherently early-2000s rave, ethereal, hyperpop, hypnotic, and cute about it. I actually had this big sign on my wall that said 'no cute' because I felt that in the past my work has been too cute, but I didn't care with this. That's how much I liked it. I thought about calling the album <i>The Seed</i> as well.”\n\n<b>“Only Love” (with Y U QT)</b>\n“This song was such a pure collaboration. I literally had this little vocal idea, and [Y U QT and I] had become friends online. I was playing all their songs, and I randomly was like, ‘Hey, I've got this idea. What do you reckon?’ And Darryl sent back almost the exact same version of what you hear on the record straight away—within a day, honestly. He took the spirit and ran with it. He also completed and sang the verse himself. He'd never sung on a song before. It was just completely unexpected and so cool! I love that we really created something that neither of us would've done separately, which is a sign of a great collaboration.”\n\n<b>“Keeping Secrets” (feat. Iglew)</b>\n“This is probably the oldest song on the record. I wrote it, I think, in maybe 2012 or 2013. I remember writing it in my first apartment in LA, and I think I was writing about an imaginary safe place that I created in my head. It ultimately echoes the same place that I talk about in ‘Pearl,’ the place that we go to deep in our hearts where no one can get to us. When I was finalizing the album order, this demo popped into my head. I'd actually sent that song to Iglew back in 2015, and he had written a beautiful intro, which had a similar vibe. So I wrote him out of nowhere, like, ‘Hey, do you still have that intro? I’d love to put it as an interlude on my album.’ He didn’t have the instrumental anymore, but we created this together in a few days.”\n\n<b>“Deep Blue Sea”</b>\n“Dance music is an interesting art form for deeper inquiry, because lyrics can only tell so much of a story. The instrumentation actually gives so much energy that is indefinable. With this, the sentiment is the power of finding yourself back home in nature, and its ability to wipe us clean, center us, hold us in our darkest moments, and tap into our deepest superpowers. ‘Deep Blue Sea’ isn’t sugarcoated. It's not all positive and light. The instrumental is holding us in a place of suspense, a place of tension. Lyrically, I wanted to speak to that tension. I wanted to speak to the need to find resolution. It says all that to me, but it also could say something different to somebody else.”\n\n<b>“Trouble”</b>\n“See, what we're not gonna do is not have fun on this album. This rowdy type of sonic is integral in my sets, and I needed to make sure I had that covered. It's definitely tapping a cheekier inner almost-teenage Anna on the record that I’m really glad is there. This spirit is at the core of what I do—like, we just want to have fun, man. We have no interest in drama, we just need to shake all this off and be together, and release all the shit that gets put on us that we don't want.”\n\n<b>“Body Heat” (with J.O.S.H.U.A)</b>\n“I've been starting my sets with this song. ‘Body Heat’ is what I like to call a great ear-breaker. Often you're playing on a lineup and people have been hearing heavy bass or heavy drums or all kinds of different sounds before you. And I like to have an ear-cleanser when I start to bring people into what I'm about to do. It's like it wiped out what was before. It taps us into our energy together and we're going to move forward from here. This track was created in collaboration with a brilliant creator and DJ from Bristol called J.O.S.H.U.A who brings brilliant raw drum energy to his tunes. I came with the vocals and synth refrains.”\n\n<b>“Look My Way”</b>\n“This is one of the songs that I wrote at home on a demo day, and in hindsight, I think it's really about patience. I mean, these last few years, there've been so many moments where I did not know what was going to happen in so many areas of my life. I wasn't sure if I would be ever living a life that was comparable to what I lived pre-2020. I missed my life, my friends, my career. When I listen to this song, I hear that uncertainty, that questioning.”\n\n<b>“Let’s Go Home”</b>\n“‘Let's Go Home’ is a bittersweet little moment in time from those strange years that melted together between 2020 and 2022. I'd taken my daughter out for ice cream. There were all these birds flying around and I was on a busy road, and I don't know why I decided to record a voice note of that moment. Listening back, it really felt resonant. You realize how important it is to be present in the moment because it’s never coming back. When you listen back, you hear the preciousness that you lived—and live—every day.”\n\n<b>“Going Home”</b>\n“‘Going Home’ started as a demo in probably 2018. I had been loving this track called ‘Kool Aid’ by Diana Gordon, and it was stirring up this idea of going home and what that meant to me. At the time I had been living away from home and my family for over six years, and although I was happy and driven, I still missed my family enormously. This vocal poured out of me, but I had no idea what to do with it. It was so far from the dance space that I was occupying. In 2019 I heard ‘Kerosene!’ by Yves Tumor, which hit me in the same place. The emotion was so raw, I couldn't let it go.

Album","standard":"Fancy Hagood can do it all. The Nashville-based singer-songwriter’s 2021 debut <i>Southern Curiosity</i> was a surprising and inventive mix of rootsy folk pop and queered, left-of-center country that remains delightfully uncategorizable. On this sophomore album, though, Hagood goes all in on ’90s country, channeling genre legends like Brooks & Dunn and Reba McEntire to infectious effect. There’s a stacked roster of co-writers, too, including Nashville mainstays Caitlyn Smith and Mindy Smith as well as actor and musician Mary Steenburgen.\n\n<i>American Spirit</i> opens with “Ever Really Ready,” a Jarrad K (Ruston Kelly, Lucie Silvas) co-write about opening up to love after heartbreak. It’s a sweet, wistful song with ample room for Hagood to show subtler shades of his versatile voice. The title track uses the metaphor of an American Spirit cigarette to explore the darker edges of a secret romance, telling of “white lies in a talking town.” Hagood taps Michelle Branch to join him on “Isn’t That Life,” a laidback, rootsy number well suited to Branch’s rich and agile voice. And on “The Chase,” Hagood gets an assist from all-star folk act Watkins Family Hour, the long-running side project of siblings and Nickel Creek members Sean and Sara Watkins.\n","short":"His sophomore album goes all in on ’90s country."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-spirit/1766805718","playParams":{"id":"1766805718","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5oYnojpHEvWpLCON8GwxDv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766805718/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"859825960","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/859825960?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729852853875}}},"1766811882":{"id":"1766811882","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766811882?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/79/6f/60/796f60c2-377c-9b1d-124e-e7b041630f01/5a339a0e-2320-4a94-9b19-fc405c3bd584.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ad9fa6","textColor2":"b3c0d7","textColor4":"939db3","textColor1":"d3c2c6","bgColor":"121425","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jazzmeia-horn/1014225490","name":"Messages","artistName":"Jazzmeia Horn","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6a/86/6c/6a866ca3-fa68-bab7-4ee0-887dc167ea91/5063549784577_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d9b8de","textColor2":"efafd7","textColor4":"d19bc6","textColor1":"f9d3f5","bgColor":"594e83","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The Texas singer brings a timeless sensibility to everything she touches."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/messages/1766811882","playParams":{"id":"1766811882","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4KVABgFjy5h5u9KcCeTYD7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766811882/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1014225490","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1014225490?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729811648997}}},"1767929390":{"id":"1767929390","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767929390?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chloe-th%C3%A9venin/998755977","name":"Intronics - Single","artistName":"CHLOE (Thévenin)","artwork":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/65/88/98/6588989b-2d52-4a67-29de-a9a4f65e1c01/4062548099478.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2400,"textColor3":"353a3a","textColor2":"282c2c","textColor4":"535656","textColor1":"030909","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/intronics-single/1767929390","playParams":{"id":"1767929390","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767929390/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"998755977","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/998755977?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729829173262}}},"1768030146":{"id":"1768030146","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768030146?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Contemporary Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/paolo-fresu/6557302","name":"It Never Entered My Mind / Time After Time (feat.

Elmiene (for those who are unsure, it’s pronounced “el-mean”) first grabbed attention in 2021, with a pitch-perfect interpretation of D’Angelo’s “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” parlaying that first influx of online interest into real-world gains: a major label deal, coveted live spots supporting stars including SZA, and studio sessions alongside writers that have worked with Beyoncé, Busta Rhymes, and Victoria Monét. <i>Anyway I Can</i>, the British soul singer’s third EP, draws from a rich palette of musical influences with live, organic instrumentation lending an old-school timelessness to contemporary R&B melodies. \n\nElmiene’s voice—an astonishingly versatile instrument—is the showstopping centerpiece of the project; by turns soft and smooth as in album opener “TLC,” dynamic and playful in the outro of “Ode to Win,” rising to an emotionally resonant falsetto on “Crystal Tears.” Gems like “Light Work” showcase an infectious flair for funk that is somewhat underutilized here but when the trade-off is more tracks in the vein of “Anyways,” which builds from mellow minimalism to an evocative crescendo, it’s impossible to feel short-changed.","short":"An

The six-track EP is the girl group’s fifth mini album since their explosive debut on the K-pop scene in 2020, and it continues their reign as the queens of hyperpop hooks. “One look, give ’em whiplash/Beat drop with a big flash,” cool girls Giselle, Karina, Ningning, and Winter express on the title track, an EDM-driven dance track about aespa’s ability to make everyone look twice. \n\nElsewhere on the album, the intentionally abrasive hip-hop dance song “Kill It” is simultaneously a declaration of K-pop dominance and a warning to any haters in the audience (“I’ma shine as I watch the bodies drop”), while the R&B track “Flights, Not Feelings” slows things down to confess a commitment to letting go of negative feelings (“I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself”).\n\n“Pink Hoodie” hopes to tap into some of that NCT U “Baggy Jeans” magic with a midtempo hip-hop track about feeling comfortable in one’s skin—and clothes (“Instead of a suffocating dress/Pink hoodie, ey-oh”), while the pop track “Flowers” hypnotizes with a lulling guitar riff and a dreamy description of intimacy (“Slowly look at me reflected in your eyes/A fantasy that spreads clearly/My only one/My dazzling flower/Keep calling me”). Album closer “Just Another Girl” layers the members’ vocals for a naughts-esque pop-rock song that matter-of-factly decimates a cheating lover (“Just remember/In the end, you are a loser/You'll regret it”). Altogether, <i>Whiplash</i> is simultaneously aespa’s most cohesive project yet and a showcase of just how many different genres the members of this meticulously produced girl group can nail in one EP. As aespa explains on “Whiplash”: “I deliver, I can promise/I’m the coldest.”\n","short":"Over six tracks, K-pop’s queens of hyperpop hooks continue their

No matter how high or how low Hunxho felt, though, he makes it clear that every opportunity is a blessing, a chance to get better as a man and father. On the title track opener, he croons, “Thank God for never giving up, on every time I failed.” On “Rookie of the Year,” he begins with a tribute to the title’s subject, thanking God for “including him in this world” and for “answering his mom’s prayers.” He reflects on his life, celebratory that he’s avoided jail, or fates much worse.","short":"The North Carolina MC’s second album is all about gratitude."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thank-god/1774274063","playParams":{"id":"1774274063","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0EgK3iRxEr2vuokKSE2khi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774274063/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1266800437","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1266800437?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729853035533}}},"1774532000":{"id":"1774532000","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774532000?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":26,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-05","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blond-ish/394776491","name":"Blond:ish at Kappa FuturFestival 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"BLOND:ISH","artwork":{"width":5833,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/90/d8/58/90d85843-6016-302c-1799-f3860f5966df/6e1144d0-feac-47d5-99f2-8a9e97d69ba0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5833,"textColor3":"c5c2c5","textColor2":"e8dfdb","textColor4":"c1b9b6","textColor1":"eeebee","bgColor":"221e22","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blond-ish-at-kappa-futurfestival-2024-dj-mix/1774532000","playParams":{"id":"1774532000","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774532000/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"394776491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/394776491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729821881294}}},"1774798273":{"id":"1774798273","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774798273?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cristobal-tapia-de-veer/359528159","name":"Smile 2 (Music From The Motion Picture)","artistName":"Cristobal Tapia De Veer","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/53/b2/d4/53b2d4bb-101e-69b7-c580-31acd3363c6a/780163664522.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4d3536","textColor2":"3a0a0d","textColor4":"5f383a","textColor1":"240708","bgColor":"f0eded","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/smile-2-music-from-the-motion-picture/1774798273","playParams":{"id":"1774798273","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7k8qhU8jnOpWgGF0CidSY0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774798273/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"359528159","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/359528159?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729809421684}}},"1774798971":{"id":"1774798971","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774798971?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/american-dad-cast/467542318","name":"American Dad!

The 2020s have been especially good to him, with hits like “PTSD” and features opposite Gunna and Nardo Wick and an ambitious yet well-received double album, <i>Survivor’s Remorse</i>. On the comparatively leaner <i>Big Swerv</i>, he quickly calls back to his beginnings on “Strike You,” an anti-nostalgic opener that demonstrates how the past informs his present. \n\nFrequent production partners Oz on the Track and Southside cast long shadows over the project, the former wielding bass frequencies on the soulful “Yup” and the gnarly Sexyy Red team-up “Ten” and the latter present on potent trap variants “Spend That Bag” and “Trim.” With such reliable beatmakers behind the boards, Herbo pops out and shows off for “Drunk AF” and the evocative “Splat.” Reuniting with Chief Keef for “No Pics,” he rejects the downside of his celebrity status while serving his day-one fans alongside the drill pioneer. Elsewhere, he speaks on familiar themes with Skilla Baby on “Shoot” and 21 Savage on the unsettling “In the A.”","short":"The Chicago MC adds Lil Durk, Meek Mill, and more to his 2024

DJ Mix","standard":"Early Hours can mean a few different things: Are you winding down after being up all night, or are you just rising to meet the sun? For OddKidOut, his edition of the Apple Music DJ mix series was a chance to create a “morning moment.” “The entire hour is a long cup of coffee that gets you ready for the day,” he says. “And with each sip, you find both past and future nostalgia.” The Philadelphia native says this is the first chill mix he’s ever made, designed to reflect the feelings of waking up and starting the day. Among his favorite tracks are Pocket’s remix of “i think you're cool” by Zeds Dead featuring Jenna Pemkowski, which reminds him of when he moved to LA (“I’d drive around the city listening to it on repeat”), and “Show Me Up” by Lil Tecca, which he calls the mix’s “sore thumb.” “It still fits the vibe, but it’s the one part that challenges the listener and is a bit of a departure,” he says. “I don’t like playing it safe.” ","short":"The Philadelphia dance music producer delivers his first-ever chill mix."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/early-hours-dj-mix/1775516811","playParams":{"id":"1775516811","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775516811/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1085300846","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1085300846?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729858151791}}},"1775757693":{"id":"1775757693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775757693?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/64/4f/6b/644f6b0c-6fda-42b5-812b-3c7c0a488341/d76b5bda-9c3d-44ad-acea-540db2510604.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0bdc2","textColor2":"c8d9e4","textColor4":"a3b1ba","textColor1":"ece8ee","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/two-shell/1480032608","name":"Two Shell","artistName":"Two Shell","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6d/14/d2/6d14d207-1d6c-7f0c-780f-ac2455cbf7ce/889030035202.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d3d1cf","textColor2":"dff4d2","textColor4":"c0d0b6","textColor1":"f7f5f1","bgColor":"434146","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/two-shell/1775757693","playParams":{"id":"1775757693","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4jZZgPpyDqLuTq0LKgXwK6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775757693/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1480032608","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1480032608?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1729844514032}}},"1775794137":{"id":"1775794137","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775794137?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-23","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/93/48/40/9348407a-96b9-bd0a-7d6c-4cb5e0a5751f/Joba5933334-10e6-4e0c-b6eb-7c3e28b53f7a-178090989-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_348016523_1934000671-Time1729722285067.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e57f4f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c27148","textColor2":"e57f4f","textColor4":"ba6741","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1b/eb/1a/1beb1acf-ee35-a9da-8a8c-6470c89cf981/8940f9bd-bf22-4eea-b685-7732924e1e8c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e4926f","textColor2":"f7ac83","textColor4":"e38e6c","textColor1":"f9b287","bgColor":"931410","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/04/10/2a/04102ab5-af04-c23b-f7ab-1758a2e5c683/Job273c0ab8-3a0e-4f3f-b3c4-096f3ebeb26b-178090990-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_348016666_1934000672-Time1729723430893.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e4894d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c6794e","textColor2":"e4894d","textColor4":"b97040","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/glorilla/1441017729","name":"GLORIOUS (BONUS TRACK EDITION)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"GloRilla","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f4/2c/ea/f42ceaaf-f653-582e-e22f-3f3c269be58e/24UM1IM01471.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca966b","textColor2":"ec9052","textColor4":"bf7643","textColor1":"fab884","bgColor":"0e0e07","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The scrappy Memphis rapper has been on a two-year victory lap since her 2022 breakthrough hit “F.N.F.

But as the silver-tongued Houston native has risen from cult-favorite Instagram freestyler to full-fledged cultural force after breaking through with 2019’s “Hot Girl Summer,” the rapper’s been weighed down by grief and betrayal, all highly public and intensely scrutinized. On 2022’s <i>Traumazine</i>, Megan began to let down her guard and open up about her pain. She teased its follow-up in late 2023 with a statement: “Just as a snake sheds its skin, we must shed our past, over and over again.” On <i>MEGAN</i>, she’s still going through it, but she’s not going down without a fight.\n\nThe motif of the snake, coiled and waiting to strike, winds its way through <i>MEGAN</i>’s 18 tracks with cool, collected menace. “Still going hard with the odds against me,” she spits on “HISS” over an eerie beat from go-to producer LilJuMadeDaBeat. She’s got devastating burns for everybody within earshot on “Rattle,” snapping at an unnamed peer, “Your life must be boring as fuck if you still reminiscing ’bout shit that we did.” (Her claim to be “a motherfuckin’ brat, not a Barbie” on “Figueroa” might clarify its intended target.) There are moments of levity: “Otaku Hot Girl” flexes her arcane anime knowledge, while “Accent” recruits Hot Girl Summer tourmate GloRilla for a country-girl ode to being “thicker than a Popeye’s biscuit.” \n\nBut you get the sense that for Megan, it’s awfully lonely at the top: On “Moody Girl,” she switches her trademark tagline to “real motherfuckin’ sad girl shit.” And over the metalcore guitar chug driving “COBRA,” she tells you how it feels to break down while the world is watching.\n","short":"Meg’s 2024 album gets 13 more songs and feaures from RM and Flo
