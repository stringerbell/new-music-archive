With Broken Social Scene’s Kevin Drew returning to his producer post, the duo’s second album as OMBIIGIZI sees them fuse their individual aesthetics into a lustrous sound that’s both ethereal and energizing.\n\nThe perseverance anthem “Connecting” strikes a blissful balance between Sturgeon’s antic lead vocal and Monkman’s soothing chorus harmonies, while the distorted, heavy-breathing hook and anxious thrust of “Photograph” give way to a symphonic ambient swirl worthy of Drew’s main band. But OMBIIGIZI’s fusion of hardcore-schooled emotional bloodletting and therapeutic post-rock soundscaping is uniquely their own: On the album’s bracing finale, Sturgeon exorcises past traumas by screaming the word “shame” with throat-shredding intensity over a slow-surging hypnotic pulse, as if channeling U2’s <i>Live at Red Rocks</i> in a basement DIY dive.","short":"The Anishinaabe duo translate trauma into therapeutic indie rock."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shame/1762094964","playParams":{"id":"1762094964","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7GtUuBWgxDr9WXoUD0aD2o"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762094964/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1593443499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1593443499?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730445053373,"RTCI":0}}},"1762096150":{"id":"1762096150","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762096150?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/beardfish/254009212","name":"Songs For Beating Hearts","artistName":"Beardfish","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/d3/2c/3ed32c69-81f5-143f-c8c1-ae92a58dd5b6/196872124866.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c2001","textColor2":"2c0000","textColor4":"562001","textColor1":"0b0000","bgColor":"ffa005","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/songs-for-beating-hearts/1762096150","playParams":{"id":"1762096150","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1KHkvF7OeM7lzNrz9MKN0X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762096150/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"254009212","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/254009212?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730456766149,"RTCI":0}}},"1762096316":{"id":"1762096316","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762096316?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/1a/0e/de/1a0ededd-d3c2-f174-0427-081ce0c579b6/58c802b2-65e0-4b3b-b56b-53d2b761a8cb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c25d45","textColor2":"f56e52","textColor4":"c55941","textColor1":"f27356","bgColor":"050200","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tribulation/212623096","name":"Sub Rosa In Æternum","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tribulation","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cd/cf/51/cdcf51a9-a8e5-8a71-af31-152c2720ec4c/196872200775.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dcdcdc","textColor4":"b0b0b0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"On their sixth album, Swedish metal conjurers Tribulation allow the goth side of their personality to overshadow their death-metal roots. <i>Sub Rosa in Aeternum</i> sees vocalist/bassist Johannes Andersson mostly ditching his demonic growl for a clean, stentorian delivery akin to that of Sisters of Mercy’s Andrew Eldritch. “We wanted to do something new,” guitarist Adam Zaars tells Apple Music. “I was looking back at the previous three albums, and they’re each very much their own thing, but still similar enough for me to be craving something else. At first, we didn’t really know what that new thing would be.”\n\nThen Andersson, who hadn’t written a Tribulation song in nearly 20 years, presented his demo for what would become <i>Sub Rosa</i>’s closer, “Poison Pages.” “Obviously, the biggest change is the clean vocals,” Zaars says. “But we didn’t know if it was going to work. We’d been talking about it, but just using it as another instrument, like background harmonies or maybe a cool chorus on some song. When Johannes showed us ‘Poison Pages,’ it felt liberating—and a lot of fun to explore new ground.”\n\n<i>Sub Rosa</i> is also the first album Tribulation wrote without guitarist Jonathan Hultén, who left the band before the release of 2021’s <i>Where the Gloom Becomes Sound</i>. As a result, new guitarist Joseph Tholl contributed quite a bit of material here. “The overall sound on the album absolutely has to do with Joseph being in the band,” Zaars says. “He wrote more songs than I did. With Joseph being another type of songwriter, another type of guitar player, it feels like the beginning of a new era.” Below, Zaars comments on each track.\n\n<b>“The Unrelenting Choir”</b>\n“Johannes wrote this song. He hasn’t written a song since our first demo, so this was something very new for everyone. And he did great, I would say. The original version was actually longer. Where it stops now, it went into this very cool Death SS-sounding part that we might use in the future. But we needed an intro, we felt, and Johannes did this one. It has a very ‘welcome to the show’ kind of feel. He got the idea for the bass at the beginning from some podcast he listens to. He won’t tell us which one.”\n\n<b>“Tainted Skies”</b>\n“That’s a Joseph song sounding very much like Tribulation, but in his own special way. This is one of the things that he brought to the table that really challenged us, daring us to try new things out. The lyrics are about reincarnation, I guess, but more specifically about the in-between stage—the bardo, as the Buddhists call it. Dying and being reborn has been a Tribulation theme since forever.”\n\n<b>“Saturn Coming Down”</b>\n“What made me write this song with that weird intro riff was, I wanted a guitar sound that was something different, where it almost feeds back, where it’s chaotic in a way. I don’t even remember how I did it because I’m far, far from being a sound gear guy. I want to be, but I have no interest. So, it was just sheer luck that I found this strange, almost surf-guitar sound that’s a little bit Dead Kennedys. The song is about Saturn, obviously, but when I write lyrics for Tribulation, it’s like a game of association. It’s Saturn from every possible direction, so people shouldn’t be looking for a coherent theme. Well, not too coherent at least.”\n\n<b>“Hungry Waters”</b>\n“This is another Joseph song. It’s not as Tribulation as ‘Tainted Skies.’ The first time he showed this to me, I loved it, but I didn't think it could be on the album. I think that was before we decided to have a bunch of clean vocals on the album. That really was a catalyst for a few of these songs that would probably never have happened if we hadn't made that decision. It’s something fresh and new for us. The mid-section with the solos is very Tribulation, very Italian horror-soundtrack sounding. I was almost surprised by how well Joseph knew the sound. I’m still amazed by him writing this song.”\n\n<b>“Drink the Love of God”</b>\n“What the fuck is the love of God and how do you drink it? I know the answer, but I don’t want to be transparent. But I can say this: It’s the second song that was written specifically from that guitar sound from ‘Saturn Coming Down.’ It’s very rare for me to write songs quickly, but I did for this. The only other one I can remember like that is ‘The Motherhood of God’ from <i>The Children of the Night</i>. It was our producer Tom Dalgety’s idea to add the key change after the solo. Being European, I think it’s a very schlager way of writing a song. But he was right, and I was wrong, I’m happy to say.”\n\n<b>“Murder in Red”</b>\n“This is probably my baby on the album. Most of it wasn’t very difficult to write, but it was difficult to finish. I made a demo of this that sounded almost industrial, but Johannes took it in a completely different direction with his vocals. That was very cool, almost like a Chris Isaak song to some extent. We were pushing our boundaries in a very satisfying way. Lyrically, I’ve been into gialli and violent Italian cinema since I was 13, when I bought <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i> on VHS. Since then, I’ve been hooked. Early Tribulation lyrics were oriented more towards zombie cannibal flicks, but this is more like earlier Argento and Mario Bava.”\n\n<b>“Time & the Vivid Ore”</b>\n“This is a song by Joseph that’s as much a part of something old as it is of something new. It almost sounds as though it could be from <i>Where the Gloom Becomes Sound</i>, but since it’s written by Joseph, it has its own distinct <i>Sub Rosa</i> flavor to it. It’s got one of the coolest solo sections on the album, displaying both mine and Joseph’s style of guitar playing and how they, in our opinion, complement each other. It’s also the only song with exclusively growling vocals!”\n\n<b>“Reaping Song”</b>\n“It’s one of the songs on the album that’s quite out there in comparison with our old material—somber, melancholic, romantic, haunting, and beautiful. It wasn’t supposed to be a Nick Cave homage to begin with, and I didn’t even think of it before Tom started talking about it. Then, of course, Joseph wanted it to be called ‘Reaping Song,’ which is an obvious reference to Nick Cave. But I know it wasn’t, at first, written to be that—it just happened to sound somewhat like Nick Cave. The ‘Reaping Song’ is a song within a song, as that is what the protagonist of the story sings every year when the harvest season is upon us. Death meta.”\n\n<b>“Poison Pages”</b>\n“This is the song that really settled the new direction with the clean vocals. Johannes wrote it, and in the demo, he was singing. It wasn’t a decision that happened instantaneously, but after listening to it a lot, I think we all realized that this could be something to pursue. It’s a very goth-rock kind of song about <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, specifically the movie. Umberto Eco’s book, Jean-Jacques Annaud’s movie, and the soundtrack by James Horner have all been a huge source of inspiration for the band for a very long time, but this is the first time we’re this explicit about it. There’s so much in there that is just a very good fit for Tribulation. The beast is among us!”","short":"The Swedish black-metal conjurers show their goth side: “It felt

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Let’s say it’s 1994. Kurt Cobain is dead. Grunge is over, if it was ever real to begin with, but “alternative” music is part of the mainstream in ways it never was before. Artists like Beck, Green Day, The Breeders, Nine Inch Nails, and Pavement might not have had much in common in terms of musical genealogy or ambition, but they held similar symbolic places in their fans’ minds—this was music that made you feel like you were part of something smaller, different, more personal, less perfect. This band could be your life.\n\nThen there was Weezer. On the one hand, they were the final boss of relatability—outcasts buried in comic books (“In the Garage”), last picked for dodgeball, forgotten by their parents (“Say It Ain’t So”) and shunned by their peers (“The World Has Turned and Left Me Here”). On the other, their music could be as polished and ruthlessly controlled as anything we call “pop,” every hook and chorus and sweetly harmonious chord change engineered for maximum pleasure—no accidents, no jazz. That they were just another Los Angeles band trying to get a record deal, as opposed to more homegrown, scene-oriented artists like Nirvana or Green Day, made a kind of sense, too. Being “alternative” was just the first step to being mainstream. Listening to the demos and practice sessions from various reissues, including the 2024 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of the album, only reinforces the point. Even the seemingly off-the-cuff guitar break in “Buddy Holly” was planned pretty much to the note months before they went into the studio.\n\nAs polite as they looked, there was something eerie about them, too. “No One Else” (as in “I want a girl who will laugh for…”), “Holiday,” “Buddy Holly”’s fantasy of a more innocent—but also more rigid, retrograde—world. Like The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>, <i>Weezer</i> captured male adolescent yearning so intense it became abstract, detached from the messy complexities that made human relationships so unpredictable. If they couldn’t have the girl of their dreams, they’d build her in a lab.\n\nRivers Cuomo was a Kiss fan, and you could tell by listening, if not by looking: <i>Weezer</i> was, at every turn, hero music, the sound of winners made for people who grew up feeling like losers. That they became one of the most famous and cultishly beloved rock bands of their generation made sense, especially when paired with the rise of the internet: Suddenly, you could embrace your individualistic geekdom and build community at the same time. Huge, romantic, and totally uncynical, <i>Weezer</i> was the soundtrack to once-distinct subcultures melting down and remolding into something shinier and smoother.\n","short":"The sound of winners,

of the first two iterations. The meeting between these two solo artists is one of the most impressive connections in pop and folk music. On <i>brent iii</i>, their chemistry is on full display, again turning in an album of rich instrumental arrangements and harmonies. Take “i miss you,” an acoustic lament that looks back longingly on the good old days of a relationship. The duo worry that they’ve become faces in the crowd, diminished from their once proud place as loving partners to the subject of the song. They sing: “’Cause I miss you/Is this exactly what you thought we'd become?/Do you see me how you see everyone?/’Cause I need you.” Few make heartbreak sound as sweet as Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler.","short":"The folk-pop artists’ chemistry drives their third collaborative project."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/brent-iii/1767056655","playParams":{"id":"1767056655","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1XLv6w9VkI68G1v79DInjt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767056655/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1049356910","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1049356910?l=en-US"},{"id":"398935148","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/398935148?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730446792324,"RTCI":0}}},"1767599022":{"id":"1767599022","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767599022?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ginny-luke/266893034","name":"Devil at My Heels","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ginny Luke","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/83/0c/1a/830c1a33-d418-c157-e250-54390c98a38c/198588807989.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9ced2","textColor2":"f9bfa3","textColor4":"cc9b89","textColor1":"f6ffff","bgColor":"190b22","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/devil-at-my-heels/1767599022","playParams":{"id":"1767599022","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3qqOBTZMNli0cJGLuvNemX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767599022/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"266893034","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/266893034?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730456774966,"RTCI":0}}},"1768308892":{"id":"1768308892","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768308892?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bane/31536206","name":"It All Comes Down To This (25th Anniversary Edition)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Bane","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/5f/78/c95f78bd-2674-2789-fd90-13a7e8da901f/794558052160.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1d1cc","textColor2":"c9b18b","textColor4":"a79371","textColor1":"fffffd","bgColor":"1e1b0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/it-all-comes-down-to-this-25th-anniversary-edition/1768308892","playParams":{"id":"1768308892","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Zk8QOTIT8NNPSGewte9Ty"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768308892/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"31536206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31536206?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730456768520,"RTCI":0}}},"1768679969":{"id":"1768679969","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768679969?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Psychedelic"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-31","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Brown Acid -

There’s no pop hits, no hooks, and—let’s face it—no fun. It’s also some of the band’s most engrossing work, a statement that, like most great Cure songs, can’t be taken lightly.\n\nThe glacially paced opener and lead single, “Alone,” is majestic and mournful, with string swells and apocalyptic lyrics about birds falling out of the sky. But mostly it’s about dying alone, the shattered pieces of a regret-filled life, and the forgone conclusion that is our mutual demise: “This is the end of every song that we sing.” On “A Fragile Thing,” a plinking piano gives way to a thudding bassline as Smith sings of heartbreak, distance, and fait accompli. It might be the closest the album comes to vintage ’80s Cure, but now the 65-year-old Smith’s customarily downbeat lyrics come with the weight of lived wisdom and cruel inevitability. “Warsong” twists the screws with a churning, droning meditation on domestic battles and bitter regret; at a bit over four minutes, it’s also the shortest song on the album.\n\n“Drone:Nodrone” is the catchiest and most upbeat of the bunch—musically speaking, anyway. Smith’s lyrics are no picnic, of course. They’re not a completely hopeless death spiral, but they certainly acknowledge a tumultuous relationship: “The answers that I have are not the answers that you want” and “I can’t anymore/If I ever really could.” The track also features squalling guitar leads from former Tin Machine/David Bowie sideman Reeves Gabrels, who joined The Cure in 2012 but makes his first studio appearance with the band here. “I Can Never Say Goodbye” laments the death of Smith’s brother Richard with the refrain “Something wicked this way comes,” a phrase popularized by the title of Ray Bradbury’s influential 1962 novel. (The Cure debuted the song in concert in 2022 in Poland, where Richard Smith apparently lived for many years.) Like much of <i>Lost World</i>, it’s a tearjerker.\n\nWith all this loss and mortality, <i>Songs of a Lost World</i> recalls Bowie’s 2016 swan song, <i>Blackstar</i>. Finishing an album about death with a sprawling, gorgeous track called “Endsong” isn’t necessarily ominous, but who knows? For what it’s worth, Smith is already promising a follow-up to <i>Songs of a Lost World</i>. Hopefully, it won’t take 16 years.","short":"Regret, apocalypse, the terror of dying alone: Welcome back, Robert Smith!"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/songs-of-a-lost-world/1768728131","playParams":{"id":"1768728131","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wjxmqXnSQvBZWL3IbYngX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768728131/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"566519","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/566519?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730454461365,"RTCI":0}}},"1769023107":{"id":"1769023107","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769023107?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b6/60/1a/b6601ab8-8c07-36cf-1517-5608d6d501d8/Job830df1a2-94af-4a85-94e9-6fa52e67a691-176679596-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345150826_1910903919-Time1727904403742.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ff0907"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"030904"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c1c8a3","textColor2":"ff0907","textColor4":"d00e08","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030904","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/82/1a/84821a27-3aa0-81ef-13c3-4c783599aa77/17f95cd1-9119-41e9-b1f4-5e86a47e31d9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbb7ad","textColor2":"c9b48e","textColor4":"a19172","textColor1":"e9e4d8","bgColor":"010602","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/82/e3/5a/82e35ad0-95cd-ee89-27c7-c5b6c8c923a5/Jobc9433ba4-435e-4626-bc27-afd6cc8a87fc-176677686-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345150827_1910903918-Time1727901775982.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ff0505"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"030904"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c0c4a1","textColor2":"ff0505","textColor4":"ce0706","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030904","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/43/ab/e1/43abe12f-b8d7-3302-0d14-40c44d3c3d71/dbb938bf-c9fa-477d-bf75-e4097bc543c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5afb5","textColor2":"cabc9c","textColor4":"a2977d","textColor1":"cedae2","bgColor":"010602","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cody-johnson/331459657","name":"Leather Deluxe Edition","artistName":"Cody Johnson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/98/88/4b/98884ba1-fe25-76b8-211f-ebfb3d000fd5/093624838982.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8cdb4","textColor2":"eaedce","textColor4":"bfc4a8","textColor1":"f6f9dd","bgColor":"111f11","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Cody Johnson’s 2021 <i>Human: The Double Album</i> was an exercise in maximalism, a sprawling project that showed the true breadth of the Texas country artist’s prodigious talents. With his eighth studio album, Johnson narrows his focus, and in doing so makes his biggest statement yet. That focus feels hard-earned for Johnson, who tells Apple Music that he’s reached a point in his career where he feels like he can finally kick back and enjoy some of the fruits of his nearly two-decade career. “I'm 36—I'm not old, but I'm not young either,” he tells Apple Music. “And I see a trend of ‘I need to get a hit. I need to get a record deal right now so I can get a hit, so I can get the stadium [show], so I can get the money, so I can get a No. 1 video, so I can get the fame.’ And I'm like, ‘I genuinely care about country music. I care about where we've come from and I care about where we're going.’ And that means more to me than dollar signs and fame, because if I do my job good enough, the dollar signs and fame and all that stuff just goes along with it.” \n\nOn this deluxe edition of 2023’s <i>Leather</i>, Johnson is doing his job just fine. <i>Leather</i> opens with “Work Boots,” a sweet and playful tune with clever lyrics—the titular boots pull double duty as dancing shoes—and an easy, laidback groove. “That’s Texas” is a two-stepper’s delight, with Johnson leaning hard into the twangier side of his musical roots, as well as into winkingly controversial opinions like “ain’t no such thing as chili with beans.” Jelly Roll joins Johnson on “Whiskey Bent,” a vulnerable track about making up for alcohol-fueled mistakes. \n\nNew additions to the deluxe edition include more than just a handful of songs from the cutting-room floor: The ever-prolific Johnson more than doubled the original’s tracklist, adding 13 new songs to offer a fuller portrait of his <i>Leather</i>-era vision. Original album closer “Make Me a Mop,” which Johnson considers “a prayer,” is a gentle precursor to “Overdue,” a loose and aching attempt to turn a lover’s “broken heart blue.” “How Do You Sleep at Night?” is a smash in the making, drawing heavily from ’90s pop-country’s more dramatic side with its massive chorus and tension-building production. And there’s the already beloved hit “I’m Gonna Love You,” an emotional collaboration with country vocal powerhouse Carrie Underwood that shows off Johnson’s masterful range, too. Johnson shares insight into several key tracks below.\n\n<b>“That’s Texas”</b>\n“For the first 10 years of my career in this town in Nashville, it was, ‘Oh, you're just Texas country. You're the cowboy from Texas.’ And I got wrote off because I'm just Texas. Well, now I'm at a point where we're doing pretty well for ourselves and I thought, ‘You know what? By God, I'm going to record a Texas song and include George Strait and Robert Earl Keen and The Rockin' CJB.’ That's my band. Let me tell you how goofy this was. I took a snuff can out, an empty snuff can, and held it up in the microphone and did the percussion on it. We were just in there goofing off, and everybody’s so crazy about it.”\n\n<b>“Dirt Cheap”</b>\n“I love that song. I relate to that song so much. Literally on the ranch at home, I have the tree picked out where I want to be buried. I'm not impressed by money and fame and glitter. So whenever I'm old and somebody comes along and says, ‘Hey, we want to pay you to build a subdivision here,’ I don't really care what the check amount is. You're not putting a subdivision on my land. I want to keep it pure. And hopefully we're just going to keep adding more to it. That's what we've discussed, is that we're going to grow this thing as big as we can possibly get it. And who knows: God's got a plan, I don't. But for right now at 36, I had related to ‘Dirt Cheap’ because I would like to stay there. My wife's like, ‘The house is two stories. What about when we get old?’ I was like, ‘We're putting in an elevator.’” \n\n<b>“Whiskey Bent” (feat. Jelly Roll)</b>\n“I sent him ‘Whiskey Bent’ and he said, ‘Hey, man, I'm laying in bed with my wife right now and we are both bawling.’ And I'm like, ‘Well, bro, if you feel that on that song, then that's the one you need to sing with me on.’ So, organically again, that's how it happened.”\n\n<b>“Leather”</b>\n“The day that Ian Munsick played me ‘Leather,’ we were just sitting on the bus getting to know each other, picking guitars and stuff, and he plays me the song and I'm like, ‘Dude, I will cut that in a heartbeat.’ I was like, ‘That would be such a cool album title. Cody Johnson: <i>Leather</i>.’ And he's like, ‘I didn't even know you were cutting an album.’ I was like, ‘I'm not. I don't think. Maybe I am. But if you'll give me the song, I'll cut a record around it.’ And it just happened.”\n\n<b>“Make Me a Mop”</b>\n“I'm sitting here thinking, where are we going with this? And [the songwriters] started playing it and I couldn't control the tears. I just couldn't control the tears. And they just kept pouring. And I felt a quivering in my chest. And it was almost like the first time that somebody goes to church and they really feel the Holy Spirit, when you really feel God touching you. And I felt that in this song. And I was like, ‘This is one of the most incredible songs I've ever heard. And I want to make it as simple as possible.’ So it's literally just me, my gut string guitar, my fiddle player, Jody [Bartula], put a little bit of piano on it, just a little soft pads. It leaves you so much space in the song to just close your eyes and open up your mind as to what this song is really. It's a prayer.”\n","short":"The prolific Texas country star adds an extra 13 songs to his eighth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/leather-deluxe-edition/1769023107","playParams":{"id":"1769023107","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5CWUkGGArOj0vj7z1BogV0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769023107/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"331459657","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/331459657?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730467177956,"RTCI":0}}},"1769091038":{"id":"1769091038","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769091038?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b0/1f/8d/b01f8d32-6310-b421-d892-73581c98c29a/25ccf1f0-f9fe-4ebf-97ec-fc5cf87e4f13.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"37383a","textColor2":"35231a","textColor4":"52453c","textColor1":"141317","bgColor":"c6cac5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/phil-wickham/133485322","name":"Hallelujah!

On her debut full-length album, Alabama artist Ella Langley explores the kinds of emotional aftermaths that leave behind heartache, not headaches. The record opens with its title track, a soulful and somber account of learning lessons in love the hard way. Fan favorite “nicotine” likens a lover she “want[s] but just don’t need” to the irresistible allure of a cigarette fix. Riley Green joins Langley on the hit duet “you look like you love me,” an old-school honky-tonk jam. Another standout is “paint the town blue,” a clever subversion of a country trope: Finding no solace in painting the town red in the wake of a breakup, Langley opts to “fall to pieces” (one of several classic country references on the record) and indulge her broken heart.\n\nThis <i>still hungover</i> deluxe edition adds a handful of new tracks from Langley, which follow acoustic takes on “cowgirl don’t cry” and “broken in.” Moody ballad “girl you’re taking home” contrasts a long-term relationship—“Bet she met your grandma, you took her to church”—with a messy situationship, using clever signifiers like “neon” bar signs and the idea of a “last call” to illustrate the tension. The acoustic track “made it out of mexico” is somber and spare, as Langley sings of a trip to paradise ending in heartache. She closes <i>still hungover</i> with “monologue,” a spoken-word track that seems to close this heartbroken chapter.","short":"The rising star’s morning after gets longer with a serving of extra tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-hungover/1770160322","playParams":{"id":"1770160322","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4HXwURpJfDooeuEt2bZspn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770160322/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1384373733","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1384373733?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730450190283,"RTCI":0}}},"1770283309":{"id":"1770283309","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770283309?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-29","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d4/7d/dd/d47ddd3a-c3d5-1a59-20ad-da5d37d7bb37/ee43266d-a59e-4b1f-98ff-8009d0bad662.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"93aba7","textColor2":"b0c7c7","textColor4":"90a3a3","textColor1":"b4d2cc","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/03/31/88/033188aa-ebb6-6079-b2b5-80d2e2c2a9b8/e32d137e-1db8-4b0b-b7cf-51c93058db9a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ce6b52","textColor2":"f27659","textColor4":"cb674f","textColor1":"f67b5c","bgColor":"2d2c2b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flying-lotus/120737020","name":"Spirit Box","artistName":"Flying Lotus","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b0/87/02/b08702c2-a07d-8991-9d13-3c0163ec1c0f/5056614799804.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cd5e43","textColor2":"f36f50","textColor4":"c85e45","textColor1":"f96f4d","bgColor":"1d1c18","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Steven Ellison, who has performed under the Flying Lotus moniker for nearly 20 years, emerged from a <i>Twin Peaks</i> binge inspired to explore the outer reaches of his imagination, returning to the studio to work as a solo recording artist for the first time in a half decade.

Beyond their ever-enjoyable vocal presences, a considerable part of their successful methodology comes from the instrumentals themselves, be it the springy funk behind their heady “PUT IN WORK” or the velvety grooves draped upon their intimate “BLACKLIGHT.” The roughly hour-long episode features appearances by an eclectic supporting cast including Damon Albarn, Eric Bellinger, and Cochise, alongside extensive contributions from the duo’s broader Spillage Village collective. These guests tend to make the most of their moments here, with Snoop Dogg offering some sensual seduction on the title track and T-Pain nodding to a Minnie Riperton classic on “Love You

Album","standard":"It’s a golden age for troubadours. Following the end of the bro-country era, a new generation of story-driven, acoustic-guitar-slinging singer-songwriters wearing their hearts on their sleeves took firm hold of the genre, birthing stars like Zach Bryan and Charles Wesley Godwin. Sam Barber is another formidable voice in this still-emerging canon, as he shows on this sprawling collection of songs written over the course of the 21-year-old’s five-year foray into music. Like Bryan, Barber worked with producer Eddie Spear, whose light but thoughtful touch keeps the ambitious, 28-song project from sounding repetitive.\n\nAnchored by Barber’s viral song “Straight and Narrow,” <i>Restless Mind</i> is a winding, sometimes surprising journey through dying relationships and dead-end towns, with appropriately spare, rough-hewn production. The record opens with “Man You Raised,” itself beginning with a voicemail from Barber’s mother that sets a homespun tone for the songs that follow. With its aggressively strummed guitar and folksy melody, it’s easy to hear Bryan’s influence on this one, though Barber’s story is all his own as he assures his mother “the moon will never steal your son away.” Other highlights include the title track, one of two collaborations with Avery Anna that cranks up the moodiness, and “Streetlight,” a Lumineers-reminiscent track that ups the record’s tempo.","short":"A bold 28-song journey through dying relationships and dead-end towns."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/restless-mind/1772722432","playParams":{"id":"1772722432","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Dx1IXTwJVIMkEzVMSSSrp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772722432/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1584802114","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1584802114?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730450164596,"RTCI":0}}},"1772784053":{"id":"1772784053","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772784053?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Folk","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a4/41/5f/a4415f93-55c7-dc70-460f-bf67161d0dd4/Job399da092-1f96-4076-b107-df0d67f10298-178647663-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_349075467_1942722133-Time1730332939619.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1c2816"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1d291a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3c473e","textColor2":"1c2816","textColor4":"3e4a3e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1d291a","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6c/34/49/6c34498c-e834-1017-5094-15235a53c748/Job5f7e65a9-d897-4b73-a349-490287586032-178647662-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_349075466_1942722132-Time1730332036281.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3c473e","textColor2":"27331d","textColor4":"465344","textColor1":"1b2416","bgColor":"c4d3de","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amble/1671435415","name":"The Commons -

Her sophomore effort, <i>Grudges</i>, was a raw exploration of trauma, mental health, and relationship struggles. Now, on her third LP, <i>Cut Ties</i>, she reflects on her personal growth and evolution, and embraces her inner strength.\n\nThroughout the album’s 11 tracks, Ledé narrates a story of a past romantic entanglement, grappling with the uncertainties of their connection. She explores the internal battle between embracing a newfound love and her instinct to protect herself (“LTF”) while also realizing the inconsistencies within their partnership (“U Can’t Remember”) and discovering the unreciprocated feelings that are taking place (“Space and Pussy”). On the candid and mellow track “Too Many Strings,” the singer-songwriter uses metaphorical imagery to describe the progression of their relationship, which has gotten a bit too deep after investing a lot of time and energy into it. She continues this motif on the title track, finding the strength to break free of her attachment by choosing loneliness rather than dealing with continuous heartache. She doubles down on her decision of refusing to settle for mediocrity on the reflective and swaggering track “Outta Luck.”","short":"The singer-songwriter embraces growth and inner strength on her

Album","standard":"Aside from a few stray comedy bits involving the devil, there’s nothing terribly frightening about Freddie Gibbs’ Halloween 2024 drop <i>You Only Die 1nce</i>. Still, coming some two years after 2022’s lauded major-label venture <i>$oul $old $eparately</i>, his long-awaited follow-up proves quite the treat for devotees of the Midwest-bred MC’s razor-sharp raps. From its tangent-following opener “Status” on, he feeds the fanbase with reliably reckless and resonant bars. His penchant for going hard over laidback beats persists here, via the pot-scraped narratives of “Brick Fees” and the violent world-building of “Steel Doors.” Even when gunshots ring out on the 454-produced “Walk It Off,” he’s cool, calm, and collected, singing as much as rapping his way through the narco tale. Acknowledging some of the tabloid fodder that makes its way to his social media, “It's Your Anniversary” brushes off baby-mama drama and scoffs at rappers too shook to collab with him. In other words: This is pure Freddie Kane.","short":"Reliably reckless and resonant bars over laidback beats: pure uncut Kane."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-only-die-1nce/1773436738","playParams":{"id":"1773436738","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/67LTX4flSRbvRopq6mja0h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773436738/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"302166615","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/302166615?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730463039577,"RTCI":0}}},"1773707720":{"id":"1773707720","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773707720?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1471140112-281175241","name":"Flow (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Gints Zilbalodis & Rihards Zalupe","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/f0/f1/32f0f110-250f-66db-eac1-e0ea4c1a5ae1/196872401097.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1f3137","textColor2":"1f1e16","textColor4":"2b3f3f","textColor1":"110c0c","bgColor":"59c6e4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/flow-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1773707720","playParams":{"id":"1773707720","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7q9YwO9ldgxUXi1H9M9cuY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773707720/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1471140112","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1471140112?l=en-US"},{"id":"281175241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/281175241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730457649706,"RTCI":0}}},"1773827609":{"id":"1773827609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773827609?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/30/da/25/30da25bf-6de4-722f-dfdd-08b958802604/349e2088-2c67-4837-b3fd-33d3b80ec44b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c38368","textColor2":"f19e81","textColor4":"c4826b","textColor1":"efa07e","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-bacon/1448557325","name":"Heretic (Original Soundtrack)","artistName":"Chris Bacon","artwork":{"width":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b0/47/0a/b0470a18-98b5-bd7c-4a9b-18d87ee4987e/49057.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2160,"textColor3":"d1cfcc","textColor2":"ff08bc","textColor4":"d10a97","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1b1203","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","short":"A menacing score for the suspenseful Hugh Grant thriller."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heretic-original-soundtrack/1773827609","playParams":{"id":"1773827609","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5PyFetxe7GHd1bkedYyoO8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773827609/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1448557325","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1448557325?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730466528127,"RTCI":0}}},"1774025806":{"id":"1774025806","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774025806?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-amsterdam-red-light-district/353698007","name":"Insomnia -

It’s probably more than you think, but however many it is, it’s unlikely anywhere near as many as celebrated producer, DJ, and radio personality Scram Jones. Jones has, of course, collaborated with Em, producing “In Your Head” for <i>Revival</i>, as well as performing the scratches on Em’s “Berzerk” and “Kamikaze,” but he was a fan long before he became a collaborator.\n\n“When I was in college, I stumbled on a random unlabeled cassette with two of his songs on it [‘Just the Two of Us’ and ‘Just Don’t Give a Fuck’],” Jones says. “‘Just the Two of Us’ has to be one of the most clever records ever written; rapping in baby talk to his infant daughter about her mother being in the trunk on the way to dumping her in the ocean—beyond clever. And once I heard ‘Just Don’t Give a Fuck,’ I realized this guy <i>really</i> don’t give a fuck. I was an instant fan.”\n\nJones’ support never wavered, and he’d go on to host a show on Em’s Shade 45 radio, a platform that has allowed him to deliver an untold number of “scramble mixes,” some of the finest thematically curated collections of rap music available today. Jones’ own history as a creator, pedigree as a DJ, and undying passion for Em’s music make him the perfect person to have put together a mix celebrating the Rap God.\n\n“I took my time to find the rarest and rawest Em rhymes I could find and made my own blends and remixes with them,” Jones says. “I’m all about creativity as a DJ, just like Em is as an MC. Not a lot of DJs these days think out the box—it’s more of a hustle to them than an art form. Me and Em are from the same era, where you really had to prove yourself and show out, and that’s what I tried to do here.”","short":"Celebrated DJ and producer Scram Jones shows us the real Slim Shady."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eminem-the-coup-de-grace-mix-dj-mix/1774104831","playParams":{"id":"1774104831","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774104831/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"14507243","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/14507243?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730471457232,"RTCI":0}}},"1774131609":{"id":"1774131609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774131609?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sooyoung/1774369364","name":"Unstoppable - EP","artistName":"SooYoung","artwork":{"width":1920,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/41/8e/27/418e2722-d5db-9c3d-9a8f-70fdc72a2726/dj.jqbsaelj.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1920,"textColor3":"bba088","textColor2":"d1969a","textColor4":"b17a7d","textColor1":"ddc5a8","bgColor":"350909","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/unstoppable-ep/1774131609","playParams":{"id":"1774131609","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774131609/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1774369364","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1774369364?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730232761907,"RTCI":0}}},"1774262379":{"id":"1774262379","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774262379?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-29","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=347126170-1390169311","name":"Rushing 1621 (Hodge & JIALING Remixes) - Single","artistName":"Om Unit & James Bangura","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2e/0b/e6/2e0be60b-8acf-4e56-9f2f-4d96ebaef3c0/3663729345158_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d12c8a","textColor2":"fe2ea3","textColor4":"d22989","textColor1":"fc32a5","bgColor":"241720","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rushing-1621-hodge-jialing-remixes-single/1774262379","playParams":{"id":"1774262379","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774262379/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"347126170","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/347126170?l=en-US"},{"id":"1390169311","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1390169311?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1730456808819,"RTCI":0}}},"1774297586":{"id":"1774297586","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774297586?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":31,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/isabella-summers/317938314","name":"HITPIG!

And “Old Dirt Road” offers snippets of Riegling’s origin story, painting a portrait of the “little patch of heaven” that raised him.

While most celebrities of his caliber and notoriety either curate their public lives to near-plasticized extremes or become defined by tabloid exploits, the erstwhile Odd Futurian chiefly shares what he cares to via his art and the occasional yet ever-quotable interview. As his Tyler, The Creator albums pivoted away from persona-building and toward personal narrative, as on the acclaimed <i>IGOR</i> and <i>CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST</i>, his mystique grew grandiose, with the undesirable side effect of greater speculation.\n\nThe impact of fan fixation plays no small part on <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i>, his seventh studio album and first in more than three years. Reacting to the weirdness, opening track “St. Chroma” finds Tyler literally whispering the details of his upbringing, while lead single “Noid” more directly rages against outsiders who overstep both online and offline. As on his prior efforts, character work plays its part, particularly on “I Killed You” and the two-hander “Hey Jane.” Yet the veil between truth and fiction feels thinner than ever on family-oriented cuts like “Like Him” and “Tomorrow.”\n\nLest things get too damn serious, Tyler provocatively leans into sexual proclivities on “Judge Judy” and “Rah Tah Tah,” both of which should satisfy those who’ve been around since the <i>Goblin</i> days. When monologue no longer suits, he calls upon others in the greater hip-hop pantheon. GloRilla, Lil Wayne, and Sexyy Red all bring their star power to “Sticky,” a bombastic number that evolves into a Young Buck interpolation. A kindred spirit, it seems, Doechii does the most on “Balloon,” amplifying Tyler’s energy with her boisterous and profane bars.\n\nIts title essentially distillable to “an abundance of color,” <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i> showcases several variants of Tyler’s artistry. Generally disinclined to cede the producer’s chair to anyone else, he and longtime studio cohort Vic Wainstein execute a musical vision that encompasses sounds as wide-ranging as jazz fusion and Zamrock. His influences worn on stylishly cuffed sleeves, Neptunes echoes ring loudly on the introspective “Darling, I” while retro R&B vibes swaddle the soapbox on “Take Your Mask Off.”\n","short":"An
