The Dreams","artistName":"King Stingray","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“We made this album in probably the busiest time in our lives,” King Stingray guitarist Roy Kellaway tells Apple Music. Indeed, the relentless touring the band embarked on following the success of their 2022 self-titled debut impacted its follow-up in several ways. Logistically, it meant they were having to seize studio time between gigs, booking local studios in whatever part of Australia they happened to find themselves in. Thematically, its influence was also profound. “A lot of the songs have a philosophical sentiment about life,” says Kellaway. “There are some introspective themes where we’re thinking about what’s passing by and what’s happening around us in this busy time, trying to process that.”\n\nThe rush of the past few years, and appreciation of simple living during such a hectic period, is invoked in “Soon As” and “What’s the Hurry?” while “Southerly” harks nostalgically back to their roots in the Northern Territory, “when we were just a couple of kids, with a couple of big ideas.” As with King Stingray’s debut, the lyrics are split between English and the ancestral Yolŋu language of vocalist Yirrŋa Yunupiŋu and guitarist Dimathaya Burarrwanga, only this time the choruses are sung entirely in English to make them more inclusive, particularly in the live space.\n\nThe band also continues to incorporate the ancient Indigenous tradition of manikay (song/songlines) into their spirited indie rock, lending each track myriad thematic nuances. “A lot of our songs have a sentiment that extends in more than one meaning, and that’s pretty characteristic of Yolŋu culture and the many layers of meaning behind Yolŋu Matha,” says Kellaway, referring to the collection of languages spoken by the Yolŋu people of northeast Arnhem Land. Here, the guitarist, songwriter, and producer unravels some of those layers, track by track.\n\n<b>“Light Up the Path”</b>\n“We were like, ‘Let’s start this new album with a song that feels King Sting-like, but then it has some newer moments that maybe people haven’t heard before.’ The sentiment for ‘Light Up’ is about seizing the moment, so that’s why we wanted to crack in with a bit of a belter to begin with. It felt like a nice one to start with.”\n\n<b>“Best Bits”</b>\n“It’s about all the best bits of life poured into one moment, and it’s inspired by a particular moment in time where we had a day that just had all the right ingredients: friends, family, good weather, sunshine, and you’re with your loved ones and you’re in a beautiful place where Mother Earth is turning it on. I guess it’s about simple living in a complex digital world; sometimes all the best bits are already around us, we just need to recognize them.”\n\n<b>“Southerly”</b>\n“We’ve been musos for years, but it was quite a quick turnaround from putting out our first song to having fans. We just found ourselves thinking about how nothing’s changed—we’re still the same people, we’re still mates having fun playing music. The only thing that’s different is that there’s lots more people listening to us. We come from pretty humble beginnings and we’d never forget our roots and who we are. Integrity is really important for us.”\n\n<b>“Lookin’ Out”</b>\n“It’s easy as humans to put a lot of pressure on making the right decision and navigating things in life. That song’s about being at peace with making the best decision you can. We love big things—the big sky and the big blue ocean—so we’re always marveling at the vastness of the world, and looking out into the big ocean creates a lot of feeling for us. Simple living is something we love.”\n\n<b>“Scoreboard”</b>\n“We hit the ground running with the record and wanted a bit of a breather. There’s some wonderful pedal steel guitar on there. We often play that live as an atmospheric part leading into ‘Lookin’ Out,’ but we decided to put it after ‘Lookin’ Out,’ this time as a breather.”\n\n<b>“Nostalgic”</b>\n“This was inspired by when we were in the US for South by Southwest in 2023. We had this beautiful home and we were staying up late because we were excited, telling stories. It’s that concept of reminiscing, but at the same time you’re making new memories.”\n\n<b>“Day Off”</b>\n“It’s about taking the day off. We’re calling in sick, we’re all going to have some fun and take the day off, and I’ve called your boss and got you one too, so let’s hang out together. Then the chorus opens up—‘picking up the keys to a better life’ is the line, and it’s just about perspective and having your priorities right, because there’s lots of distractions in life and it’s easy to lose sight of what’s important. We always want to be mindful that joy and happiness is really important for us as individuals.”\n\n<b>“Through the Trees”</b>\n“It’s inspired by a particular place in Arnhem Land—you come up this big sand dune and you get to the top and you can see this big canopy of trees, almost like a tunnel, and through the trees the deep blue sea is straight in front of you. It’s about not wasting time and seizing the moment. The traditional songline sung in the bridge is an ancient melody, and that humming sound is the sound of a bee, where an old man’s walking through the bush, and he’s following the sound of a bee and it’s guiding him towards the light, towards people and community. ‘Through the Trees’ has got that multilayered meaning.” \n\n<b>“Soon As”</b>\n“It’s about coming back home. It’s a big relief. This album is explaining our journey over the last few years. We’ve covered lots of places, and this one’s about getting both feet on the ground, back on Country, wherever that may be for you.”\n\n<b>“What’s the Hurry?”</b>\n“It’s about slowing down. We all come from small towns throughout Australia, and you come to the city and everyone’s in a rush, and we find ourselves in a rush as well. It’s also got a sustainability wink. ‘Can we tread light to sustain?’ is one of the lines in the chorus, and it’s talking about, can we tread a bit lighter on Earth to sustain our beautiful Mother Earth? It’s definitely on our mind because Yolŋu people see firsthand a lot of really bad environmental effects on the northeast coast.”\n\n<b>“Come to the Surface”</b>\n“It’s a bit ethereal. It’s about popping out from underneath the water and getting that fresh air hit you in the face. You’ve got that big sort of relieving moment.” \n\n<b>“Cat 5 (Cyclone)”</b>\n“This one’s got a multi meaning. On the surface, it’s a love song—life might feel a bit chaotic sometimes, it can feel a bit like a cyclone, but when you’re with that special person, you look into their eyes and you see a blue sky up ahead. We grew up in the tropics, so we’re used to cyclones, and we used to always get the cyclone warnings show up on the TV. In the chorus where it says, ‘you know I’m trying/To pick up the signs,’ that’s the warning signs of the cyclone coming. We never got frightened of them as kids, we’d surf in the cyclone. It’s part of living in the Top End.”","short":"The band’s storming second album revels in life’s simple pleasures."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b6/81/ba/b681bacf-a3fd-d485-f1e5-232ca2d735bf/198588708958.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d9bcc4","textColor2":"e8c288","textColor4":"d99f73","textColor1":"e7e6ed","bgColor":"a0131e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-the-dreams/1757375504","playParams":{"id":"1757375504","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/408SgNp6BOa0lUetUrnkT1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757375504/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1533004945","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1533004945?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731057466416,"RTCI":0}}},"1757700305":{"id":"1757700305","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757700305?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/make-them-suffer/421186855","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8d/2e/a5/8d2ea56d-b220-7632-07a4-bedcc2eefd0d/a60231c1-dcd6-4be5-aba0-9ddaa956744b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c2f31","textColor2":"222121","textColor4":"3e3f40","textColor1":"0b0c0e","bgColor":"b2b9bb","hasP3":false}},"name":"Make Them Suffer","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Make Them Suffer","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s not by chance that Make Them Suffer’s fifth album is self-titled. After weathering lockdown-related cancellations and a prominent lineup adjustment, the Perth metalcore crew emerge reenergized on their first album in four years. Notably, keyboardist/vocalist Alex Reade (ex-Drown This City) has replaced Booka Nile as the melodic counterpoint to Sean Harmanis’ harsh, aggrieved outbursts. Their powerful contrast is most striking on tracks like “Oscillator,” on which Reade cuts through the tumult with the pointed refrain “You’ve waged a war against yourself.” The 2022 single “Doomswitch”—which marked her recorded debut with the band and sees her break out some dynamic keytar flourishes in the song and video alike—sets the tone for the new entries, thanks to its industrial-level rhythmic pounding and repeated electronic lashings. Foregrounding vocal layering and a sudden swath of open space before one final crushing crescendo, “No Hard Feelings” makes for a cathartic centerpiece. Consolidating their strengths while audibly evolving as an ensemble, Make Them Suffer stake their claim as one of Australia’s most unflinching forces in heavy music.","short":"A forceful reawakening

Gasoline","artistName":"Jamey Johnson","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jamey Johnson’s string of aughts and early-2010s albums remain some of country music’s most beloved releases. On those records, the Alabama-born singer-songwriter captivated fans with his once-in-a-generation voice and masterful storytelling, influencing stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. This first release from Johnson in over a decade finds him still in fighting shape, his voice as rich as ever and his perspective as charmingly cranky, too. Opening track “Bad Guy” is a slinky slow burn that lets Johnson stretch his legs, drawing out notes and taking his time over a loping beat. He lies back and takes it easy on the title track, which sounds influenced by Willie Nelson and Jimmy Buffett in equal measure. Randy Houser joins Johnson on two tracks: the big and brassy “Trudy” and the last-call ballad “I’m Tired of It All.” Johnson recorded <i>Midnight Gasoline</i> at John Carter Cash’s Cash Cabin studio, once owned by Cash’s parents Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Johnson recorded other albums there too, which are slated for a future Cash Cabin series.","short":"On his first album in over a decade, the beloved songwriter is in fighting shape."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9e/88/41/9e884128-a76c-4850-4e0f-f42e26cb348b/093624839750.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b4b0b6","textColor2":"83b7e6","textColor4":"6994b9","textColor1":"dfd9e2","bgColor":"050908","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/midnight-gasoline/1770368003","playParams":{"id":"1770368003","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1HmFOh5zrgQLu6BcyIFlOD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770368003/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"81030634","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/81030634?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731043353061,"RTCI":0}}},"1770626922":{"id":"1770626922","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770626922?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twinnie/202615512","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Something We Used to Say","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Twinnie","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a7/f6/41/a7f641eb-9969-84fc-52b0-e63c26ff3146/659459968593.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1b7ac","textColor2":"d1cc94","textColor4":"ada786","textColor1":"eae0c3","bgColor":"1c1751","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/something-we-used-to-say/1770626922","playParams":{"id":"1770626922","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6pecYXNUDM7V89VKYOI2jm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770626922/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"202615512","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/202615512?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731050299238,"RTCI":0}}},"1770817746":{"id":"1770817746","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770817746?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Vocal Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1013456-876143","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ff/63/d5/ff63d539-6e56-582d-427f-48dbda9950d2/609ca5cb-6079-41dc-984f-20252c762288.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfbfbf","textColor2":"cfcfcf","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"ebebeb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Wildflowers, Vol. 2 -

In <i>SANCTUARY</i>, members Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and Hueningkai call on the “language of the stars” to tell the story of a lofty love. \n\nIn the smooth album opener “Heaven,” the twentysomething members sing of a love that transforms their lives into something euphoric (“Heaven is not far away now/The moment we kissed”), while lead single “Over the Moon” continues the sky-high metaphor to depict a divine connection (“Over the moon/Over the stars/Fly up when you're in my arms”). Groovy “Danger” brings attraction back down to visceral earth with the husky hook “What you doin’ to me?” while “Resist (Not Gonna Run Away)” uses reggaetón and evocative falsettos to explore a push-and-pull attraction.\n\nComing of age is filled with its ups and downs, and TXT has leaned into a fair degree of emo expression in their exploration of the theme. But—in <i>The Star Chapter: SANCTUARY</i>, at least—TXT’s ongoing story of emerging adulthood is more dizzy delight than darkness.\n","short":"The fourth-generation K-pop group launches a new chapter."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4c/3f/b3/4c3fb336-a0bc-740f-d030-2de348b8d1e4/198704166372_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"cfd7d9","textColor2":"b5cdff","textColor4":"9cb2e4","textColor1":"f5faf0","bgColor":"394a7c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-star-chapter-sanctuary-ep/1771934522","playParams":{"id":"1771934522","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771934522/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1454642552","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1454642552?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731056255834,"RTCI":0}}},"1772129848":{"id":"1772129848","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772129848?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lemaitre/411696416","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"BLUE -

A promising young singer-songwriter uploads a handful of covers online, unexpectedly goes viral, amasses a community of fans (among them A-list names) and, eventually, earns a major-label deal. But the fact that Myles Smith’s story has followed a certain trajectory doesn’t make it any less remarkable: In only four short years, the Luton singer-songwriter has gone from hopefully uploading covers to TikTok to becoming a global breakout star thanks, in particular, to his inescapable 2024 track “Stargazing.” “I always believed in the feeling of the track and I always knew there was something special in it, but I think the extent it’s taken off, I definitely couldn’t have predicted,” Smith told Apple Music following its release. “To see the world having a similar, visceral reaction was quite surreal.”\n\nThe deeply romantic “Stargazing” features up top on <i>A Minute…</i>, the follow-up to 2024’s earlier debut EP <i>You Promised a Lifetime</i>. And alongside it, there’s more of the soaring, folk pop the singer-songwriter has built his name on, complete with fiddles, handclaps, sing-along choruses, and open-hearted lyricism—and, of course, Smith’s warm, evocative vocals. See opener “Nice to Meet You,” for example, or the atmospheric “Wait for You,” on which Smith promises to be there for someone until they’re back to their best: “I see you fighting those demons inside/I will wait for you.” Elsewhere, James Bay joins for “Waste,” on which both singer-songwriters hope to cross paths with someone they’ve lost in a touching duet that feels like yet another sign of how far Smith has come. (Bastille’s Dan Smith also has credits on two of the EP’s songs, having joined Myles—a huge Bastille fan—on stage at Glastonbury in summer 2024.) \n\nThe songs here concern getting together and staying together (“Take my heart, don’t break it/Love me to my bones,” pleads Smith on “Stargazing”), with plenty of promises from the singer-songwriter to stick with a loved one through thick and thin. But by the EP’s final moments, Smith also explores the devastation of when things don’t quite work out that way. “We were just kids who fell in love/We didn’t know quite what it was,” he sings softly on “Little by Little,” <i>A Minute…</i>’s delicate closing track. “Sad how we’ve grown so far apart/Everything’s fading out.”","short":"More soaring, sometimes devastating folk pop from the breakout star."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/a5/e5/c1a5e5c4-7a40-ed20-ee53-1cfc97b22c55/196872574104.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"3d3f40","textColor2":"282724","textColor4":"4f4d48","textColor1":"11151b","bgColor":"ede5d7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-minute-ep/1775728445","playParams":{"id":"1775728445","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775728445/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1249499491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249499491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731076033854,"RTCI":0}}},"1775793559":{"id":"1775793559","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775793559?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/babytron/1473692829","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/22/f2/33/22f233c1-98b3-f8b2-8845-98ebb6c1ba2f/d0f2c60c-bd76-4b0e-bf5a-e512842e7e65.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"9faeba","textColor2":"a4b2cd","textColor4":"8a95ae","textColor1":"bfd1dd","bgColor":"212230","hasP3":false}},"name":"Tronicles","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"BabyTron","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"You could use a calendar to mark when spooky season will arrive each year, or you can check BabyTron’s discography to see when a new Halloween-themed project arrives.

In 2024, he emerged with <i>Tronicles</i>, a sprawling opus that features nearly 30 tracks and references to figures like Hawk Tuah, Neymar, and Clark Kent.\n\nOn <i>Tronicles</i>, though, BabyTron saves plenty of time to rap about his favorite holiday, like on “Nightmare on Yo Street,” where he spits over sparse piano notes that allude to the movie theme he riffs on in the title.

On <i>LA ODISEA</i>, he collects some of those previously released tracks alongside a batch of new material for a roughly hour-long set divided into halves. The first side contains songs in line with his biggest moments to date, namely the Peso Pluma team-ups “EN MI MUNDO” and “AMIRI,” the latter with Tito Double P as well. Yet he branches out into Afrobeats territory on “PASAPORTE” and explores hip-hop vibes with Alemán on “BB FIRST CLASS.” On the back half, Nuñez opens with the augmented sad sierreño of “NOCHES FRÍAS” before settling into a string of somber numbers about heartbreak. Eslabon Armado commiserates on “NO VOY A ODIARTE,” while Ramon Vega echoes his own romantic devastations on “TUS INTENCIONES.”","short":"One of Peso Pluma’s key collaborators makes a memorable debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b7/e3/b5/b7e3b514-ea8b-43ca-79d0-f81fc7ea8f31/198846669885.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d8bfec","textColor2":"ebccf5","textColor4":"c8b1e5","textColor1":"ffdefe","bgColor":"3d45a7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/la-odisea/1776284441","playParams":{"id":"1776284441","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0OrStwHqaIFS8JdPSwApqA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1776284441/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1290525715","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1290525715?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731043966238,"RTCI":0}}},"1776331374":{"id":"1776331374","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1776331374?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alexey-dunchyk/1610894992","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"War and Peace -

We made this mix to capture that energy.” Among their favorite moments: Their own remix of “Fergalicious” featuring will.i.am kicks off the mix, setting a playful tone for the session, and their song “Sextacy” appears at the top of the second half. “It’s there to remind you that you are sexy and that working out is only making you sexier,” he says.

<i>3</i> as a gift to fans in celebration of her 30th birthday in November 2024. <i>3</i> serves as a new chapter for the singer-songwriter where she celebrates the intricacies of love. “My sophomore album was still a love album, and so was my debut album, but I think it was just kind of taking you through the tribulations of a relationship, the ups and the downs, where this one, I feel like I kind of just want to celebrate love,” she tells Apple Music.\n\nThe project opens with the flirtatious finger-snapping anthem “Hearts on Deck,” where Mai playfully asserts her power by letting her partner know how irreplaceable she is. On “One of These,” which samples CeeLo Green’s 2004 hit “I’ll Be Around,” she gushes over her lover and how he meets all of her desires. The final track, “Little Things,” showcases Mai’s appreciation and devotion to her partner through small, meaningful gestures. “I feel like R&B, especially right now, is very toxic, and that works; I love it too, because we all have that side to us,” she said. “But I remember growing up and really appreciating the music that really was solely about love and the fact that it does exist and that you can find it.”\n","short":"Ella Mai: “I kind of just want to celebrate love.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/70/aa/5b/70aa5b50-bad0-6e2c-2a7e-f11fccd39b70/24UM1IM12436.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dade15","textColor2":"f1a76d","textColor4":"cf9865","textColor1":"ffff08","bgColor":"475d46","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-ep-single/1777272073","playParams":{"id":"1777272073","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1777272073/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1160482144","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1160482144?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1731077232740,"RTCI":0}}},"1777486722":{"id":"1777486722","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1777486722?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/a%24ap-ferg/582346993","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/83/ea/8483eaa5-c7e1-c67e-e88a-fe94a0ea92f7/b4886c33-d906-4d93-be55-7a261a4c5a57.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"333232","textColor2":"3a312d","textColor4":"605955","textColor1":"020101","bgColor":"f8f8f7","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/27/93/2d/27932df6-07ce-1f14-68d9-676342cdebb2/e74ec38a-6270-40c8-a7ea-d9c01662071b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"45403c","textColor2":"2d2823","textColor4":"514c48","textColor1":"1e1814","bgColor":"e0dfde","hasP3":false}},"name":"DAROLD","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"A$AP Ferg","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Back in the 2010s, the A$AP Mob was a force to be reckoned with in hip-hop. Masterminded by A$AP Yams, the Harlem-based, fashion-centric crew helped redefine what a New York rapper could look and sound like. But in the 2020s, most of the members had spun off into their respective lanes, not the least of whom being A$AP Ferg. Having apparently shed half of his moniker and capitalized the rest, he makes his full-length return four years after the <i>Floor Seats II</i> mixtape, offering some insight into the artist—and the man—he grew into.\n\nAfter pledging his neighborhood allegiance alongside fellow Harlemites DD Osama and Bloody Osiris on the dizzying opener “Light Work,” Ferg gets straight to it over the Lex Luger/Mike WiLL Made-It co-production “Thought I Was Dead.” With proof of life now well established, plus the added benefit of a Dapper Dan introduction, he recounts on “Alive :( ” how he unplugged from online life and took inventory of himself, leading to meditative introspection as well as self-destructive whims. Some might find it surprising to learn the erstwhile Hood Pope came to resent what fame did to him, but these reflective revelations seem to have improved his New York state of mind.\n\nThat said, he hasn’t rejected the rich-rapper lifestyle wholesale, evident on the not-so-humble brags of “Messy.” On “Casting Spells,” he flips the perspective to a more critical lens, offering rare scrutiny in verse of a cultural propensity towards materialism and superficiality. Indeed, he aims to do something good with what he’s got, a message summarized amid the grieving of “Dead Homies.” Elsewhere, Southern rap royals Future and Denzel Curry commune with Ferg in their unique ways on “Allure” and “Demons,” respectively, reaffirming his Trap Lord bona fides. Yet <i>DAROLD</i> finds him just as likely to connect with soulful singers as rappers, with the inimitable Mary J. Blige joining for two songs, including the hopeful “Chosen.” Assured of his own greatness and his accomplishments thus far, he says it with his whole chest on the righteous closing track.","short":"Four years after Floor Seats II, the Hood Pope returns with some wisdom.
