Album","standard":"The musician born Josh Tillman chose the title for his sixth album in a decidedly Father John Misty kind of way: He found the Sanskrit word in a novel by Bruce Wagner, who shares with the musician a certain impish LA mysticism. Mahāśmaśāna translates to “great cremation ground,” so it’s no surprise to find the singer-songwriter in “what’s it all mean?” mode, trawling tragicomic corners of the American Southwest in search of answers about life, death, and humanity.\n\nAfter trying his hand at big-band jazz on 2022’s <i>Chloë and the Next 20th Century</i>, Tillman returns to the big, sweeping ’70s-style pop rock that’s earned him a place among his generation’s most intriguing songwriters. He channels Leonard Cohen’s <i>Death of a Ladies’ Man</i> on the sprawling title track, whose swooning orchestration and ambitious lyrics take stock of, well, everything. “She Cleans Up” tells a rollicking tale involving female aliens, high-dollar kimonos, and rabbits with guns, and on dystopian power ballad “Screamland,” he offers an all-American refrain: “Stay young/Get numb/Keep dreaming.”","short":"Josh Tillman uses big, sweeping ’70s-style pop rock to ask big

Album","standard":"With a career spanning four decades, Kim Deal holds the distinction of being part of two indie-rock giants—Pixies and The Breeders—counting among her fans the likes of Kurt Cobain and Olivia Rodrigo, two era-defining talents who invited her on tour three decades apart. But somehow, Deal had never set out to write a proper solo album outside of a 10-song 7-inch vinyl series in 2013.\n\nHunkering down in the Florida Keys during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic ignited that initial spark, but the island naturally seeped into her creative psyche for years, having routinely retreated there with her parents before they were too old to travel. As a result, the intersection of memory and family comes across vividly throughout <i>Nobody Loves You More</i>. On “Summerland,” written as a loving tribute to the Keys, she reflects on their tradition with a soothing ukulele giving way to grand, whimsical orchestral swells worthy of Harry Nilsson. While on the tender title track, a vintage slow dance leads over majestic horns as she sings with open-hearted grace. It pairs elegantly with the gentle lullaby “Are You Mine?”, a touching ode to her mother, who battled dementia.\n\nThese songs may sound like timeless tunes of the golden oldies era, but Deal also amps up the guitars, grounding them in reality with her usual humor and insouciance. “A Good Time Pushed,” the closest thing here to a Breeders ripper, suggests the end of a relationship before it’s even started: “We’re having a good time/I’ll see you around.” With songs dating back to the early 2000s, <i>Nobody Loves You More</i> varies stylistically, with Deal connecting to her own truth through personal loss, triumph, and failure. The fiercely paced “Disobedience” mirrors her enduring defiance, where she promises to stick around on her own terms: “I know what I want/Till I’m thrown off.”","short":"The alt-rock trailblazer steps out on her own for the first time."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nobody-loves-you-more/1761322322","playParams":{"id":"1761322322","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6MygjJ2a8narXmZnk9ifKp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761322322/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6823645","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6823645?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732289546132,"RTCI":0}}},"1761662129":{"id":"1761662129","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761662129?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ant/1710399898","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Collection of Sounds Vol. 2","artistName":"Ant","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d1/7f/99/d17f99d2-9800-af6e-0cd1-3aa576b9a444/47716.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c88916","textColor2":"db941b","textColor4":"af7716","textColor1":"faab1c","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/collection-of-sounds-vol-2/1761662129","playParams":{"id":"1761662129","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7cH1zfo7NiQW7tLtTRymOA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761662129/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1710399898","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1710399898?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732189101814,"RTCI":0}}},"1763102789":{"id":"1763102789","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763102789?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/local-the-neighbour/1590493520","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"VALLEY pt.2 -

It comes at the beginning of “Lowdown (part i),” its easygoing guitar strums and fluid bass groove stretching into life over what sounds like a spaghetti junction of distant conversations, as if Kiwanuka and his band have set up in the corner of the room and started playing, unprompted. As his warm croon wanders in, the background noise halts and the track gently glides into its soulful sway. It’s a neat summation of <i>Small Changes</i>’ unhurried elegance; this is a record that’s not designed to grab you by the collar but stops you in your tracks nonetheless.\n\nKiwanuka won the Mercury Prize for 2019’s self-titled third album, yet nothing about <i>Small Changes</i> suggests he felt any pressure to repeat the success. Instead, he sounds like an artist free to follow his muse wherever it takes him. Working again with long-running collaborators Inflo (Little Simz, Sault) and Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton (Gnarls Barkley, Gorillaz, The Black Keys) in studios in London, LA, and Connecticut, he strips away from <i>KIWANUKA</i>’s fully-formed psychedelic soul expanse and emerges with another masterpiece.\n\nEarly in his career, Kiwanuka followed the traditional singer-songwriter route of writing songs at home and taking them into the studio to get down on tape. There’s something looser and more free-spirited at work here—the trio starting from nothing and letting ideas blossom in the sessions. It has resulted in a record that inhabits its own sonic world, its mix of airy ’70s soul, orchestral folk, and minimalist ballads gently luring you in to its mesmerizing flow, everything elevated by Kiwanuka’s lightness of touch and melodic ease. There’s a spellbinding restraint to the way “One and Only” guides you to its string-laden outro, or how the mournful piano patterns of “Rebel Soul” lurk on the edge of the song, never stepping into the spotlight. Then there’s the way “Follow Your Dreams” lets its jubilant chorus drift blissfully by. At times, such as the moment when “Lowdown (part ii)” takes flight and unfurls into a Pink Floyd-esque epic with shimmering guitar flourishes, it sounds utterly timeless. \n\nIt’s a record that sees Kiwanuka glancing back to his youth, reflecting on doubt-filled teenage years and considering the advice he could give to his young self. But this is also an album that strides hopefully into the future, the sound of an artist in full control of who he wants to be.","short":"The sound of an artist in full control of who he wants to

There are some familiar local voices—including Mallrat and The Teskey Brothers’ Josh Teskey—that Schmarsel invited to her own Melbourne studio once lockdown had lifted, but after that she jetted off to LA, New York, and London for international sessions that hadn’t been possible during the pandemic. The results are sonically diverse but uniformly pleasing to the ear, starting with Mayer Hawthorne’s stunning first-take vocals on the retro disco romance of opener “Howlin’ at the New Moon” and Låpsley’s impactful presence on the slower and weightier “Popstar,” Schmarsel turns in impressive lead vocals herself on “Wildlife” and “Dandelion,” while, elsewhere, she gets strong work indeed out of her collaborators. Dual vocals from Kah-Lo and BJ the Chicago Kid on “Criminal” radiate with Schmarsel’s fondness for both classic soul and analog recording gear. North Carolina’s chlothegod similarly channels 1990s rap and neo-soul on “Smile” and Amsterdam artist GANGS OF KIN provides dreamy swagger to the closing “Rat Race.” Despite all the genre shifts and multitude of voices heard here, <i>Do What Makes You Happy</i> displays real emotional consistency—thanks to every individual track ringing absolutely true.","short":"The Melbourne producer taps strong guest vocals from around the globe."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/do-what-makes-you-happy/1769425996","playParams":{"id":"1769425996","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7qr7ZwsgWStbaTrYlHIwYy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769425996/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1009106632","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1009106632?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732252296721,"RTCI":0}}},"1769438762":{"id":"1769438762","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769438762?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Pop","Pop/Rock","Adult Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2004-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/u2/78500","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4c/57/9a/4c579a1c-40eb-88b9-fbeb-d8f6cd8bd580/a2ed75c4-f666-4e23-86f9-ce16e17d7d4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcb5aa","textColor2":"ddd4c5","textColor4":"b4ada1","textColor1":"e7dfd1","bgColor":"121111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f3/27/0b/f3270b4c-89aa-5da1-ec2c-e9c750f487b5/641bf4d2-73f6-4db1-b877-ef167ddaa691.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cb999a","textColor2":"e0acad","textColor4":"ba8f90","textColor1":"f6b7b9","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/92/f3/98/92f39810-d7db-6b9e-3de7-9af40f2ca943/66f74617-ef30-4075-a20e-7a51afda657a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c37d7d","textColor2":"f56359","textColor4":"c44f47","textColor1":"f39d9d","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (Re-Assemble Edition)","artistName":"U2","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ec/8e/56/ec8e56b4-2fb8-d753-240f-d1535fbf6c1d/24UM1IM02957.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"f33b31","textColor4":"c22f27","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Edition and Interview","standard":"“[Brian] Eno described me as the ‘Mother Teresa of the rough mix’,” The Edge tells Apple Music Radio’s Zane Lowe. “I would not give up. If I felt there was something in this rough mix, I would hold onto it.” So when the U2 guitarist returned to his CDs of demos and rough mixes for this 20th anniversary edition of 2004’s <i>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</i>, there was some confidence that he might find a few ideas worth pursuing. However, the making of U2’s 11th album had been protracted and, at times, frustrating. A first round of recording had produced a set of songs that left a feeling of “good but maybe not good enough” hanging over the band in late 2003 until Steve Lillywhite, who produced their first three albums, arrived to urge them towards “Vertigo” and several other big-hook, no-BS anthems that helped make <i>…Atomic Bomb</i> a U2 classic.\n\nSo, as The Edge rummaged through his archives, expectations would have been a little tempered. When he put the CDs on in his kitchen though, he discovered more than good ideas. There were good songs, complete songs. “It was amazing to go back and hear some of these tracks that we had played as a band so were always kind of fond of—you know, they’re your friends—and to feel that not much more needed to happen to them,” says bassist Adam Clayton. “It was all there.” In fact, there was the material to add 10 unreleased tracks to this anniversary edition. Some have been heard in other forms, live renditions or leaks. Others are completely new to our ears. And they do sound new. Take the glam-disco stomp of “Happiness,” which ripples with the electro experimentation of ’90s albums <i>Zooropa</i> and <i>Pop</i>. “We didn’t change, really, any of the lyrics, we just filled in a couple of missing lines and it feels like it could have been written last week,” says The Edge. “That was one of the songs that got me excited. It felt so prescient, about the here and now. The references are really being made to the military campaign around Desert Storm and what was happening in Iraq. Today, we can apply them to what is happening in Ukraine and Gaza. It’s just bizarre that things have kind of gone full circle.”\n\nThe strength of these songs is underlined by how little work was needed to be done to them today, but there were always refinements and changes that could be made. “Bono was so complimentary of my singing and so down on his own singing,” The Edge says. “And when we did ‘All Because of You 2’ [a rawer, little more frantic rework of the <i>…Atomic Bomb</i> track], I was like, ‘Bono, this is the absolute best vocal, we’re not having to resing this.’ He’s like, ‘No it’s not going to work, you’ll have to double me.’ So I did and that’s the formula that worked. It’s like the combo of the two voices gave him the cover to be singing at the top of his range without feeling self-conscious.”\n\nNaturally, many things here betray the back-to-basics ethos that revitalized U2 while making the original album—the grungy, bracing “Picture of You (X+W)” and the heart-swelling choruses and chiming guitars of “Country Mile” and “Luckiest Man in the World,” for instance. “I think we were at a moment where we felt we wanted to go back to the primary colors of rock ’n’ roll: guitar, bass, drums, really simple arrangements, riffs more than very layered orchestral sounds,” says The Edge. If it feels retrogressive to exhume a past where the band were already looking back to their roots, it’s very U2 that they’ve found a way to flip it into inspiration for their future. “It reminds me of a time where rock ’n’ roll was much more vital, it could change your life, you lived for it, it was coursing through the veins,” says Clayton. “If all the world’s a loop, I think we’ve got to the point where we pushed things as far as we can in terms of adding extra things into the band and now we we want to take the layers off and get down to what the band does really well—which is to play live in a room. There’s a freshness to that now and I don’t know if there’s many bands that can still make records that way. It won’t be all that we do—we’ve acquired a few other skills along the way—but it’s certainly something we wanna do on the next record.”","short":"“It was amazing to hear”: U2 on adding 10 unreleased tracks to a classic."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb-re-assemble-edition/1769438762","playParams":{"id":"1769438762","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769438762/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"78500","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/78500?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732285402553,"RTCI":0}}},"1769477182":{"id":"1769477182","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769477182?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-miller/385952231","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Roots - Single","artistName":"The Miller","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/17/9e/1f/179e1f31-e16e-b5c4-c5f1-ce6e96a067df/8718723268608.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5d9e8","textColor2":"a0b7f4","textColor4":"89a0e0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2f448e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/roots-single/1769477182","playParams":{"id":"1769477182","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769477182/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"385952231","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/385952231?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732256581066,"RTCI":0}}},"1770585331":{"id":"1770585331","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770585331?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Electronic","Electronica"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sonta/973329675","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6a/d3/0d/6ad30d96-b533-9298-88ad-fc11afe529f5/16c5ba01-e841-4a7a-9cdd-45bf1c0b4c60.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"404043","textColor2":"282220","textColor4":"484444","textColor1":"1e1e1f","bgColor":"cbcbd3","hasP3":false}},"name":"Beautiful Chaos","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sonta","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e2/87/58/e287586e-83d5-d25d-35fe-d44d518dd106/723277857251.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"232227","textColor2":"272428","textColor4":"413e43","textColor1":"020206","bgColor":"a9a5ad","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The Chicago singer jumps into it with both feet."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beautiful-chaos/1770585331","playParams":{"id":"1770585331","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wROz7EA6sNKPi0Nd6uhNR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770585331/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"973329675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/973329675?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732256968426,"RTCI":0}}},"1770716455":{"id":"1770716455","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770716455?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/snazzback/1434908221","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Within and Without - EP","artistName":"Snazzback","artwork":{"width":5964,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/02/b3/b4/02b3b46d-c3d5-e9cb-6c10-3098169208e5/4062548099621.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5964,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"ff0507","textColor4":"cb0305","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/within-and-without-ep/1770716455","playParams":{"id":"1770716455","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770716455/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1434908221","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1434908221?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732256526996,"RTCI":0}}},"1770785199":{"id":"1770785199","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770785199?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gto-trio/1435350516","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Merengue Mediterráneo (feat.

Eventually Erivo caves and offers “I’m Not That Girl” as a representation of her character, Elphaba, while Grande counters with a pick for her character, Glinda: “No One Mourns the Wicked.” Then they agree on a joint pick: “Dancing Through Life.”\n\nOf course, they shouldn’t have to choose, and anyone who loves the musical—whether old fan or new convert—shouldn’t either. The good news for fans of <i>Wicked</i> is that the movie soundtrack doesn’t mess much with its source material. And if the performances feel especially dynamic for such a blockbuster production, it’s because they were mostly taken from the on-set recordings themselves—something Grande says she and Erivo were adamant about. \n\n“It’s funny because I came home and I made an album and I felt the muscles in my throat singing differently,” she says. “I think of course we can take off one hat and put on another anytime we’d like, but when it comes to giving your voice over, the body creates certain habits.” The result is a soundtrack that feels unusually dynamic for such a high-profile production, and less burdened by studio zhuzh, too. \n\nThe story—based on Gregory Maguire’s novel <i>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</i>—remains both clever and contemporary, an underdog narrative that turns a perceived villain into an object of empathy, an allegory of otherness that makes us see in the differently colored Elphaba someone as deserving of love as we imagine ourselves. Witty (“Popular”), dramatic (“Defying Gravity”), and probingly bittersweet (“I’m Not That Girl”), these are some of the most beloved Broadway songs of the early 21st century, delivered with care. \n","short":"A beloved musical goes big-screen with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wicked-the-soundtrack/1772364192","playParams":{"id":"1772364192","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3JUrJP460nFIqwjxM19slT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772364192/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1772364470","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1772364470?l=en-US"},{"id":"306141506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/306141506?l=en-US"},{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732288105138,"RTCI":0}}},"1772379505":{"id":"1772379505","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772379505?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/my-morning-jacket/2322618","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"MMJ Live Vol. 4: Terminal 5 – NYC – The Tennessee Fire 10/18/10","artistName":"My Morning Jacket","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f8/0b/7a/f80b7ae0-9e74-3b46-0d21-ed7303224d0a/24UM1IM07751.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca923d","textColor2":"e39d38","textColor4":"c1822f","textColor1":"efb149","bgColor":"38170e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Live Album","short":"The Louisville band delivers five glorious nights playing its debut record."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mmj-live-vol-4-terminal-5-nyc-the-tennessee-fire-10-18-10/1772379505","playParams":{"id":"1772379505","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3cIvvNrfkxua6gEpgom9Af"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772379505/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2322618","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2322618?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732244772162,"RTCI":0}}},"1772744893":{"id":"1772744893","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772744893?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yuki-kawana/1545935739","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c8/40/c2/c840c23e-e0d9-29fc-a5b2-cc7582a6f069/Job79b9c905-d0eb-49b3-848b-b12ff38dfb99-176929663-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345688637_1915214988-Time1728330891223.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","0f0f0f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ffffff"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f3f3f","textColor2":"0f0f0f","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/82/3c/d7/823cd70c-0803-00fd-fd93-8baf8ba28479/Job5402d0d9-6753-499f-a2a3-c20f732cd066-176929662-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345688636_1915214998-Time1728329999111.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","101010"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ffffff"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3f3f3f","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false}},"name":"Atmospheric Margin","artistName":"Yuki Kawana","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b1/6a/0e/b16a0e4e-aa60-dea4-611c-c0a86c33a340/8721093495963.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"3f3f3f","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"101010","bgColor":"fdfdfd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/atmospheric-margin/1772744893","playParams":{"id":"1772744893","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0I8I7OZWOJks0uToIAN1oS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772744893/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1545935739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1545935739?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732256596345,"RTCI":0}}},"1772881870":{"id":"1772881870","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772881870?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/escape-artist/431014988","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Far Away Places -

Album","standard":"Even after successfully transitioning to movie star stature, Ice Cube never gave up on rap. From his N.W.A days on, the Los Angeles native’s discography stayed on course well into the 2010s. In more recent years, he’s seemed to embrace his status as a hip-hop elder statesman, forming the California supergroup MOUNT WESTMORE with fellow vets Snoop Dogg, E-40, and Too $hort as a vehicle for new music. Apart from that quartet’s 2022 album, <i>Man Down</i> marks Cube’s first full-length outing in some six years. Thankfully, he has lost none of his fury or his tenacity, making his voice heard and opinions known without reservations or apology. \n\nWhile nothing here matches the viciousness of, say, “No Vaseline,” he’s similarly righteous and emboldened on cuts like “It’s My Ego” and “I’mma Burn Rubber.” On the blunt “Ghetto Story,” he reminds listeners that he can still weave a mean narrative like he did back in the day. His choice of beats mirrors both his catalog and, more broadly, his city’s funky legacy, the bounce on “So Sensitive” giving his wordplay additional buoyancy. Self-aware, he calls this phenomenon out directly on “Not Like Them,” its title an unsubtle nod that gives way to a series of knowledge drops. \n\nBuilding with legends, Cube taps Cypress Hill’s B-Real for the 420-friendly scheme session “Let’s Get Money Together” and gathers the MOUNT WESTMORE gents for the lascivious trunk-rattler “She’s Sanctified.” J-Dee of Da Lench Mob fame gets some much deserved post-incarceration props on “Facts,” while Kurupt pulls no punches on “Fighting for My Life in Paradise.” <i>Man Down</i> finishes strong with an “It’s My Ego” remix renamed “Ego Maniacs,” forming a treacherous trio of supremely confident MCs with Busta Rhymes and Killer Mike.\n","short":"The outspoken LA MC remains as righteously furious as

making music, now I’m focused on enjoying it and living it.” Only a year and a few months after <i>2000</i>, one of his most diverse albums, Turizo presents <i>201</i>, which goes even further. The Colombian star draws from rock, vallenato, country, and other genres, and connects with his musical roots while maintaining his mischievous vibe. “I like different types of music, because I have listened to them all my life,” he says. “Where I’m from, we do not listen to just one genre.” Below, Turizo tells the stories behind a few highlights from his fourth studio album.\n\n<b>“Sigueme Besando Así”</b>\n“This is a romantic song. Usually, when I am writing, the theme is not very clear to me. Sometimes, when you set out to define it, you sit down and simply write as you would a letter. It comes out in prose. You talk about a theme, but, in reality, each song is relative and unique. Often, you have no idea what you’re going to talk about. You spend your time thinking about it over and over. On certain occasions, I want to express affection or love and, on others, I want to express anger. Each song conveys very different things.”\n\n<b>“La Ex de mi Amigo”</b>\n“I remember the day when we recorded this song. Truth be told, it was very normal, nothing special. We went to the studio just to make music. One afternoon, we were composing, talking about what to write, and Kevin Cruz said, ‘What would happen if we made a song about you liking a friend’s ex?’ I feel this is the melody that most represents where I am from, Montería, on Colombia’s coast. This is Colombian folklore. Vallenato is from Valledupar, but we are greatly influenced by the sound of the entire coast. I did this track with Elder Dayán Díaz, an incredible person who is also part of one of the most important vallenato legacies nowadays. His father is Diomedes Díaz, the biggest star that has ever existed in the genre.”\n\n<b>“Plata Pa Gastar”</b>\n“This one has a funny story, because it’s actually the song on the album that has been around the longest. It was done even before the pandemic. I liked it from the beginning, and I’ve loved it ever since. Its sound is very humorous and energizes me deeply. When we made it, the production team and those in the studio didn’t see its potential. I showed it to my manager and my people, but they had the same reaction. Nobody saw it, so I let myself be convinced by that. I forgot about it for a while and, after some time, when I was compiling songs for the album, I listened to it, and it gave me the same feeling. We released it because I felt a connection with it. It is a whim of my very own.”\n\n<b>“Yo No Me Vuelvo a Enamorar”</b>\n“The biggest challenge of this track was to find its identity as a country tune, without having it sound like it’s not from here, or that it doesn’t belong to us, because it doesn’t fit in the Latin genre. Since its birth, this was a country melody, but I wondered how we were going to give it a sound that also represented who I am, and that wouldn’t feel like a copy of someone else. When Alok entered the equation later on, he made a huge contribution and managed to make it grow in terms of production and sound.”\n\n<b>“Mirando al Techo”</b>\n“I love rock, alternative music, and the like. For instance, Juanes, Miranda!, and Julieta Venegas, to mention a few. I’ve never been one to listen to a lot of heavy metal or heavy rock. In general, I prefer a style that is a little mixed with pop. This is more my thing. It is also what I feel, what I’ve been consuming all my life—music that comes from Latin America and is very important. Many Latin Americans are influenced by that sound, and this song somehow proves it.”","short":"The Colombian star mixes styles: “Each song conveys very different

Benny the Butcher rolls through on “Rabies,” which features the MCs spitting over soaring guitar solos and epic tom drum fills. “Kitchen cabinet full of 8-ounce bottles like a Gerber baby,” he raps. On the Tee Grizzley-assisted “Cecil Fielder,” Boldy makes sure his name stays pure: “Can’t mention Boldy name for clout without getting my gang involved.”","short":"The MC links up with the Brooklyn

Jones rounds out the project with the swaggering and upbeat track “My Presence Is a Present,” which reminds her partner of her worth, and the heartfelt “String of Lights,” where she asks Santa to guide her to her true love.","short":"Four holiday R&B originals to add to the

Album","standard":"Since 2009, Wizkid has ascended to the forefront of Afropop thanks to an even-keeled mastery of a variety of beguiling grooves. His earliest years in the spotlight were marked by a stream of earnest yet soulful dispatches from the depths of Ojuelegba that stood him out as a generational talent on 2011’s <i>Superstar</i> and 2014’s <i>Ayo</i>. As his career has advanced, he has recalibrated his style to reflect a newfound maturity, introducing a lush blues-influenced style that he first unfurled on his major label debut, <i>Sounds from the Other Side</i> (2017), and perfected on 2020’s <i>Made in Lagos</i>. Wizkid’s sixth album, 2024’s <i>Morayo</i>, represents the richest fusion of all the disparate styles that the Nigerian Starboy has experimented with across his career yet. \n\nBilled as a dedication to the life and legacy of his late mother from which the album takes its name, <i>Morayo</i> finds Wizkid at his clear-eyed best. On it, he reaffirms his link to Lagos and the communes across the city that shaped his worldview, making for a compelling listen that demands rapt attention. From track to track, the mood shifts between delirious celebration to contemplative reflection and unmistakable escapism. Still, it’s all held together by the familiar lull of Wizkid’s voice as he guides listeners through an odyssey of moods and feelings with help from a talented cast of guests. The first voice heard on <i>Morayo</i> is that of fújì legend Kwam 1, a callback to the Yoruba oral icon’s set at the lavish burial party held for Wizkid’s mum. It sets the stage for a record that fuses Wizkid’s neo-R&B aesthetics with the percussive grit of his Afropop roots. \n\nElsewhere, street-pop star Asake joins for a dedication to a love interest on “Bad Girl,” while British Nigerian producer P2J is credited on multiple songs, continuing the long-established connection with Wizkid. French rapper Tiakola dials in for a multilingual thesis on love’s redemptive powers on “Après Minuit,” and on “A Million Blessings,” Wizkid takes account of all his successes. Ultimately, <i>Morayo</i> is an album about the love between Wizkid and his mother and how her belief laid the first stone for his eventual takeover of Afropop—as referenced by the line “Mama call me Ayo Balogun, they can never find another you” on “Pray.”","short":"Starboy heralds the life and legacy of his late mother on album six."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/morayo/1780459822","playParams":{"id":"1780459822","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3dLXfyaG1kYeSQknLs2LP1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780459822/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"309335750","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/309335750?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732278671163,"RTCI":0}}},"1780836705":{"id":"1780836705","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780836705?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2023-11-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/andr%C3%A9-3000/3869739","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Moving Day","artistName":"André 3000","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3d/26/1b/3d261bbb-d8d3-20b4-dabb-1bee11cecb14/196872575026.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1ca0c5","textColor2":"05c1f1","textColor4":"059fc7","textColor1":"21c1ee","bgColor":"081b22","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"3 Stacks continues his unexpected flautist era with three more songs."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moving-day/1780836705","playParams":{"id":"1780836705","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/54vUryKSf0hBgXYhkrjctH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780836705/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3869739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3869739?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1732282172107,"RTCI":0}}},"1781161219":{"id":"1781161219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781161219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nicki-minaj/278464538","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fb/2a/bc/fb2abcb2-f73f-5f84-a9a0-7e80555ecbfd/e0326caa-6169-44ee-8c93-5d1f413ea3eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"363535","textColor2":"1d1c1c","textColor4":"454444","textColor1":"0a0909","bgColor":"e5e5e5","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5f/55/8c/5f558cc0-8429-c7fe-9fb8-3cdbb800f70b/0bb97df5-dfbb-4dff-bc41-8b233ddeefdc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"392430","textColor2":"10090d","textColor4":"392430","textColor1":"10090d","bgColor":"dc92ba","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Pinkprint (Tenth Anniversary Edition)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Nicki Minaj","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/99/4a/e7/994ae7cc-7cb6-a5f3-9346-42ee7317bb0e/24UM1IM31479.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"531f37","textColor2":"2a081a","textColor4":"50233a","textColor1":"2e0316","bgColor":"e78ebc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Anniversary Edition","standard":"Audacious booty-popping bangers and tender confessionals show the best of both Nickis on this sweeping, star-packed third record.
