Album","standard":"Beatles icon Ringo Starr may be known for promoting peace and love, but it turns out he can write the hell out of a country tune too. The legendary drummer has traded in his sticks and cymbals for a horse and lasso on <i>Look Up</i>, his first album in six years and a confident play on the tropes of country standards. Produced and co-written by T Bone Burnett, the album’s 11 originals were recorded between Nashville and Los Angeles, and they find Starr showcasing his ability to adapt his unique talents.\n\nOn songs like “Time on My Hands” and the Billy Strings-assisted “Breathless,” Ringo sings of love and love lost, even recruiting cinematic string swells and a pedal steel solo on the former. It conjures images of cold nights around the campfire, endless stargazes, and storytelling sessions. While Ringo Starr uses <i>Look Up</i> to honor the history of this slice of American music, he never shies from his own vision.","short":"At 84, Ringo trades a yellow submarine for a ranch on 11

Album","standard":"Around the time of her big break with 2022’s <i>Preacher’s Daughter</i>, Ethel Cain was dubbed a pop star, though it was often hard to tell from her songs. Aside from “American Teenager,” a Springsteen-esque anthem that laundered sneakily unpatriotic sentiments through arena-ready melodies, that album’s songs were largely dirges (gorgeous ones, at that) preoccupied by ideas of doomed love, faith, and fate. Written and produced almost entirely by Cain (the stage name and alter ego of Hayden Anhedönia), the project’s lore was nearly as compelling as the music itself, launching Anhedönia into something like stardom.\n\nSince then, Anhedönia’s spoken freely about the pitfalls of popularity; she penned a Tumblr post last year identifying an irony epidemic within online fan culture: an aversion to approaching art with sincerity rather than memes. You could be tempted to view <i>Perverts</i>, Cain’s first release since <i>Preacher’s Daughter</i>, as a provocation—an often-challenging 90-minute work that seems designed to scare off a stan or two. Songs like “Pulldrone” and “Housofpsychoticwomn” are noise experiments that stretch well past the 10-minute mark, full of eerie drone, depersonalized spoken word, and terrifying imagery regarding sex and sin. The moments of hard-earned beauty feel all the more rewarding: the fuzzy, sultry “Vacillator,” or “Etienne” and “Thatorchia,” a pair of elegiac instrumentals that sound like beams of heavenly light piercing through the darkness.","short":"A 90-minute provocation with noise experiments and hard-earned

DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs who deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Elderbrook crafts this spacious edition—a sweeping, powerful mix for the next time you hit the mat. “I was imagining an intense yoga session,” the British producer tells Apple Music. “No one is falling asleep at this one.” He bookended the mix with two of his own favorite compositions and filled the middle with songs by some of his favorite artists (Mind Against, Bonobo, Davi, and others), transitioning from a mellow, reflective vibe into one where you’re meant to break a sweat. Among his favorite tracks: “Beyond Beliefs” by Ben Böhmer (“Calm in audio form,” he says) and Durante’s “Split Wick,” which is equal parts moody and groovy. “I can play it in my DJ sets, but it also works just as well to chill to,” he says.","short":"Who said yoga music has to be chill? “No one is falling asleep at this one.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-yoga-january-2025-dj-mix/1785265705","playParams":{"id":"1785265705","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785265705/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"736829657","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/736829657?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736474796756}}},"1785284353":{"id":"1785284353","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785284353?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tamar-kali/97636418","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Fire Inside (Original Motion Picture Score)","artistName":"Tamar-kali","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/46/43/80/464380cc-e622-a158-99c5-27e02eceb324/780163667424.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bcbcb2","textColor2":"d0d2c7","textColor4":"a8aaa2","textColor1":"e8e8db","bgColor":"0a0b0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-fire-inside-original-motion-picture-score/1785284353","playParams":{"id":"1785284353","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5aIxxlGzceXBffp5JmTKEl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785284353/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"97636418","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/97636418?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736504628426}}},"1785291566":{"id":"1785291566","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785291566?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/river-valley-ages/1584017320","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Prayer Journal II -

To be clear, that streetwise edge never quite left his music as he pivoted to reggaetón and, eventually, global pop, all evident on his 2024 album <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>. Yet this aspect of his artistry—the rugged rapper who helped to define a pivotal wave in Latin music—remains so integral to his approach that he’s essentially begun an entire series devoted to this veritable beast mode. A direct successor to 2021’s <i>LYKE MIKE</i>, the similarly rap-centric <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> (note the extra vowel) leaves no doubt of the Puerto Rican star’s enduring hip-hop bona fides.\n\nTowers’ choice of guests speaks strongly to his roots, tapping generational peers like Dowba Montana and Miky Woodz to spit proudly alongside him. Eladio Carrión helps open the proceedings on “QUÉ QUIERES DE MI?”, a joint show of force from two artists with parallel and noteworthy ascents. From there, Neutro Shorty and Jon Z show a genuine love for the format on “NUNCA ME QUEJÉ” and “TRAP,” respectively. While some of these collabs are, in effect, reunions, exceptions exist, like the Akapellah team-up “MI BRILLO.”\n\nThough the temptation to flood <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> with features must have been tempting, Towers largely spends these 23 tracks on his own, showcasing a skill set he honed in the underground before earning mainstream accolades. He commands the pulpit on the gospel-tinged “REVERENDO” and feeds the streets on the decidedly darker “TÍTERES.” With producers like Murda Beatz and Fly Twilightzone in his proverbial corner, the beats surrounding these exquisite bars never feel staid, as cuts like the drill-adjacent “440” and the Michigan-nodding “YO ESTARÉ” expand his sonic range.","short":"A welcome return to trap roots from the Puerto Rican star."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lyke-miike/1785946400","playParams":{"id":"1785946400","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0G1YnsWxzQoJ2B1QtZLj1e"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785946400/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736500075136}}},"1785953793":{"id":"1785953793","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785953793?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/a-trak/70281883","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/6e/c1/b26ec18e-0d31-fa6c-e273-036ee3e4cd84/1872c9cb-f134-4a0c-b57f-0ec761538c88.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"493d41","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"684656","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f7e3e0","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b4/e4/94/b4e49453-2dc8-0ed5-e762-00682086ac65/fe5a71a1-9eba-4d82-b2f2-afbfa617f8ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"312733","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"322933","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f7ddfa","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/89/bf/17/89bf172b-0b9f-6e2e-03d3-cf792458653f/81cd083c-83e1-415c-adca-99366d2d6ac2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"555150","textColor2":"312d2c","textColor4":"595150","textColor1":"2c2c2c","bgColor":"f9e3e1","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3e/13/da/3e13da51-3803-c62b-58ce-1a72f273bdf5/32201667-ed31-4377-837f-61ef5ed91355.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a3535","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor4":"494445","textColor1":"0b0a0a","bgColor":"f7e0df","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/46/0c/89/460c894d-2d9d-5f32-fea2-0a6b09f73209/ead18e94-70dc-4047-8bdb-6b59d0f68522.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3b363c","textColor2":"120814","textColor4":"403442","textColor1":"0c0b0c","bgColor":"f8e3fb","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5e/50/c8/5e50c83f-ccf2-0dd5-b364-e32ad4d7eb2f/2ed977fc-9bc0-4804-8b5a-0b7cbbcabf3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"4e4a4a","textColor2":"4a2b3a","textColor4":"6d505c","textColor1":"232323","bgColor":"fbe7e4","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fitness: Ride, January 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"A-Trak","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cd/2d/83/cd2d83f3-09a6-e983-2da3-7ba0c391178d/3b17cec4-133a-4693-86a1-9c09d531811f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"312d2c","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"454141","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f7e3e0","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout.

These days, the Canadian turntablist does cardio five times per week (“Hey, we’re not getting any younger,” he says) and “definitely” plans on cycling to this mix. “For years, I’ve been saying, semi-jokingly, that I make gym music, because friends will say they hear my remixes at [fitness studios].

Fitness DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—it brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This set, curated by Swedish house don Alesso, will keep you locked on your next run—or any sort of exercise you might choose.\n\n“My workouts are varied between different methods, so I wanted this mix to work in any scenario,” Alesso tells Apple Music. “I always try and start strong and take you on a journey from start to finish before ending with a bang. On this one, I start off with some festival tracks from me, Max Styler, and others, and then move into some more underground artists before ending on a crescendo with a brand-new one from FISHER and an unreleased edit from rising talent HNTR.” Alesso calls Sebastian Ingrosso’s “Flood” a perfect workout track. “Seb has been a mentor and friend of mine for more than a decade, and I love what he did with the track,” he says. He also loves Kölsch's remix of Blue Boy’s \"Remember Me”: “It's so different from the original pop song, but still super catchy and plays in any room.”","short":"The Swedish house don takes you on “a

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Throughout hip-hop history, New York has produced several of the biggest and most iconic female stars. A genuine breakout talent in her city’s abundant pool of drill artists, Bronx rap phenom Ice Spice earned the blessing of no less than Nicki Minaj after “Munch (Feelin’ U)” went from delightfully viral to utterly ubiquitous. Collabs with the Queen from Queens like “Princess Diana” put the outer-borough upstart in a rarefied space as she amassed other hits including “Gangsta Boo” and the Taylor Swift team-up “Karma.”\n\nRoughly two years after making such a strong first impression, Ice Spice looks to cement her place in the game with <i>Y2K!</i>. Named in honor of her January 1, 2000, birthdate, her debut album may not be materially that much longer than the preceding <i>Like..?</i> EP. Nonetheless, it augments her sonic world in exciting ways while maintaining the brash authenticity that got her to this point. \n\nThough perennial studio partner RIOTUSA remains at the production helm, the beat choices here skew darker and harder than one might expect. The dissonant rhythmic thump of “BB Belt” and menacing synth stabs of “Plenty Sun” soundtrack pointed and pithy verses intended to cut down the competition. Even though a handful of the titles may verge on the scatological, punchlines like “Spent 150 on some carats/That shit cray like them n****s in Paris” keep songs like “Think U the Shit (Fart)” feeling sharp rather than sophomoric. The exclusive guest list here reflects her elite status, wrangling Travis Scott for the victorious “Oh Shhh…” and then Gunna for the badass team-up “Bitch I’m Packin’.”","short":"The NYC MC’s 2024 full-length debut gets fuller with six more tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/y2k-im-just-a-girl-deluxe/1786690272","playParams":{"id":"1786690272","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/347POHYE4kfl2Q9OCF7Sbw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786690272/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552372505","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552372505?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736500018631}}},"1786690393":{"id":"1786690393","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786690393?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kodak-black/953921140","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/15/30/48153039-a901-a675-9c10-0211119f7864/eb3aff62-126a-44ef-9208-114be10ba855.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c8c8","textColor2":"d4d4d4","textColor4":"adadad","textColor1":"f6f6f6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/38/c1/3b/38c13bc8-80ad-22a7-2d34-d45956e05ebc/1c24d1fa-e42e-4a33-b573-a61f6f7c9fb7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c1b397","textColor2":"d2ad8e","textColor4":"b3957c","textColor1":"e4d3b0","bgColor":"353534","hasP3":false}},"name":"Gift For The Streets","artistName":"Kodak Black","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/df/c8/04/dfc80404-bd5e-2755-a865-dd1d1a5303d2/24UM1IM41613.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccc8c3","textColor2":"f1e6db","textColor4":"c5bdb4","textColor1":"f9f4ee","bgColor":"191816","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A Christmas-themed mixtape from the Florida rapper."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gift-for-the-streets/1786690393","playParams":{"id":"1786690393","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2XRIFNw0ODKJ4GO3DwjOBE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786690393/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"953921140","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/953921140?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736500123184}}},"1786955988":{"id":"1786955988","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786955988?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-10","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Volume 010 - EP","artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b4/74/28/b47428b8-a42f-561b-ca3e-b3f6ba55abb3/8718723275583.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2d1d5","textColor2":"e19e3b","textColor4":"bb8439","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"211a32","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/volume-010-ep/1786955988","playParams":{"id":"1786955988","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786955988/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736515394657}}},"1787005702":{"id":"1787005702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787005702?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryce-dessner/220281501","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Perfect Place (feat.

The superstar from Vega Baja is responsible for numerous songs that center his homeland, from unofficial national anthems like “Estamos Bien” and “El Apagón” to powerful posse cuts like “ACHO PR” with veteran reggaetón luminaries Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Ñengo Flow. More recently, he’s been decidedly direct about his passions and concerns, expressed in vivid detail on 2024’s standalone single “Una Velita.” Positioned as his sixth proper studio album, <i>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</i> centers Puerto Rico in his work more so than before, celebrating various musical styles within its legacy. \n\nWhile 2023’s <i>nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana</i> validated his trapero past with a more modern take on the sound he emerged with in the 2010s, this follow-up largely diverges from hip-hop, demonstrating his apparent aversion to repeating himself from album to album. Instead, house music morphs into plena on “EL CLúB,” the latter genre resurfacing later in splendorous fashion on “CAFé CON RON” with Los Pleneros de la Cresta. Befitting its title, “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR” is set to a sleek reggaetón rhythm for prime-time perreo vibes, as is also the case for “KETU TeCRÉ” and the relatively more rugged “EoO.” A bold salsa statement, “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” pays apparent homage to some seminal Fania releases by Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe, with traces of the instrumental interplay of “Juanito Alimaña” and an irresistible coda reminiscent to that of “Periódico de Ayer.” Regardless of style, the political and the personal thematically blur throughout the album, a new year’s gloom hanging over “PIToRRO DE COCO” and a metaphorical wound left open after the poignant “TURISTA.”\n\nAs before, Bad Bunny remains an excellent and inventive collaborator, linking here primarily with other Puerto Ricans as more than a mere symbolic gesture. Sociopolitically minded indie group Chuwi join for the eclectic and vibrant “WELTiTA,” its members providing melodic vocals that both complement and magnify those of their host.

Holding it down for Atlanta in the 2020s, his lengthy run of rap hits over a seven-year stretch inevitably led the hip-hop star back to his beginnings, at least thematically. <i>WHAM</i>, a bespoke acronym for Who Hard As Me, calls back to some of those earlier successes by reclaiming the titular fortitude of breakthrough projects like <i>Harder Than Ever</i> and <i>Too Hard</i>. \n\nStill operating at the fore of trap’s commercial evolution, indeed with some of the same producers he’s been with throughout his journey, he comes through with reliably polished bangers “F U 2x,” “Say Twin,” and the Southside- and Wheezy-helmed “Stiff Gang.” On “I Promise,” he looks back on where he started from his now-vaunted vantage point, with nods to the illicit activities that prepared him for his contemporary money moves. He frequently focuses his attention on personal and romantic matters, evidenced best on the conciliatory yet booming “So Sorry.”\n\nAt this stage in Lil Baby’s career, he could have just about anyone he wants as a feature. <i>WHAM</i> demonstrates his pull from early on, grabbing ATL titans Future and a newly freed Young Thug on the flex-fest “Dum, Dumb, and Dumber.” 21 Savage maintains an ominous vibe on “Outfit,” while Rod Wave and Rylo Rodriguez tap in for the comparatively sleeker “By Myself.” Yet it’s GloRilla who offers the rapper his finest foil here, giving as good as she gets on the standout “Redbone.”","short":"ATL’s hardest expands his 2025 offering with four new
