Album","standard":"Though Jason Singer has been making music under the Michigander moniker since 2014, the Kalamazoo-bred songwriter’s self-titled effort from 2025 marks his first full-length endeavor. Early releases like 2018’s <i>Midland</i> EP and “Misery” from the following year helped establish Singer’s emo-leaning folk compositions. His songs center his passionate, yearning vocal performances against hard-charging drum grooves and shredding guitar melodies. It’s a style he updates on his first full-length, presenting his sound in its most polished state yet. “Breaker Box” is built around a morose piano line that accents Singer’s longing lyrics and drum fills that reverberate against the swelling string runs. Elsewhere, on “Episode,” the band lightens the mood, incorporating playful vibraslaps and hand percussion that neatly juxtapose Singer’s declaration that all might not end well: “I think I know/How this is gonna go,” he sings.","short":"Straight outta Kalamazoo, a debut that shows his sound at its most polished."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fd/70/9c/fd709c4f-ca70-02a4-82cb-534c160337b7/198846316765.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9dbdad","textColor2":"b4dadd","textColor4":"93bcb8","textColor1":"c1dbd0","bgColor":"0f4525","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/michigander/1769452719","playParams":{"id":"1769452719","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/40hEeqidvpcsJrUqYN4jTL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769452719/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1096482927","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1096482927?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738931639505,"RTCI":0}}},"1770826874":{"id":"1770826874","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770826874?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/48/32/97/48329714-8817-fc26-1e54-d9a53a78b904/Job7de83954-83d1-488f-bdc1-84d67b3ec7b7-178083355-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_348001073_1933857718-Time1729715030954.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d98e7b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"121312"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b08b78","textColor2":"d98e7b","textColor4":"b27667","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121312","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ae/4a/0e/ae4a0e0e-448a-e7dc-abc0-c1ade3a911cf/ff75ef64-0dad-4ded-8b26-2211cf4e3403.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ad9087","textColor2":"cca595","textColor4":"a38477","textColor1":"d8b4a8","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/88/eb/08/88eb08f5-abb1-3236-5e74-134dc57b761f/Jobf282f4f6-7984-4cf8-9231-256e73360983-178083356-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_348001164_1933857719-Time1729716697779.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dd9b89"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"121312"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bca2a0","textColor2":"dd9b89","textColor4":"b58071","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121312","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/42/15/48/421548bf-e238-af72-24cc-b6f8015f1929/01995cd7-70c4-4118-adc3-f69c2e37ddd0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c1acb0","textColor2":"d3afae","textColor4":"b39694","textColor1":"e6cbd1","bgColor":"302f2e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d9/ed/8f/d9ed8f88-48ec-9351-4658-a6044d470b5f/5eb450c3-ee5b-4b4d-ae08-9305fc5ced11.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2a7a4","textColor2":"f3aab4","textColor4":"c28890","textColor1":"f3d1cd","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sharon-van-etten/314263775","name":"Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sharon Van Etten","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The idea behind Sharon Van Etten’s seventh album, and her first as part of a band, arrived while gearing up to tour in support of her 2022 LP, <i>We've Been Going About This All Wrong</i>. Van Etten was mesmerized by the live band experience during rehearsals and decided to include her group in the writing process for what eventually became the first album from Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory. Featuring Jorge Balbi, Devra Hoff, and Teeny Lieberson, this 2025 album is a rich and cosmic tapestry of shoegaze, indie rock, and deep-fried country soul. In expanding her POV to include other perspectives, Van Etten has crafted her most sonically diverse effort to date. Though instrumentation bounces between these different styles, the lyrics find the artist in her wheelhouse, interested in life and mortality, modern addiction to screens, and the disconnect that is inherent in the way we communicate with others and ourselves.","short":"The indie vet expands her sound on this anxiously awaited full-band debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/45/3a/95453a58-bbb3-31be-c4fa-97e94b0b4d0d/48684.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bca19f","textColor2":"dc9b88","textColor4":"b48071","textColor1":"e7c4c2","bgColor":"121513","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sharon-van-etten-the-attachment-theory/1770826874","playParams":{"id":"1770826874","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5aGKc7OL3d1aJodCG2747F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770826874/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"314263775","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/314263775?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738918325315,"RTCI":0}}},"1773291048":{"id":"1773291048","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773291048?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/majestica/504924029","name":"Power Train","artistName":"Majestica","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/da/6d/c3/da6dc33f-d32f-bd98-cc1c-2783f2877879/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"56a0b4","textColor2":"6faee5","textColor4":"598fbd","textColor1":"6bc4da","bgColor":"020f1d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/power-train/1773291048","playParams":{"id":"1773291048","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/31cUZAVZ1R6pwgpFXjZ3Vo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773291048/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"504924029","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/504924029?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738924536009,"RTCI":0}}},"1773417241":{"id":"1773417241","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773417241?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=466941-194697-465118","name":"G3: 25th Anniversary Reunion Tour","artistName":"Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson & Steve Vai","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Three axe-wielding masters get wild in a celebratory shredfest."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6c/33/32/6c3332e5-a1c9-c056-f44f-bc186b5b545a/4029759202950.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfaec9","textColor2":"f6c7ee","textColor4":"d0a7cd","textColor1":"f6d0ea","bgColor":"372747","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/g3-25th-anniversary-reunion-tour/1773417241","playParams":{"id":"1773417241","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2fm9AHo7gZ9NBFDM0xVrpr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773417241/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466941","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466941?l=en-US"},{"id":"194697","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/194697?l=en-US"},{"id":"465118","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/465118?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738905203216,"RTCI":0}}},"1775235024":{"id":"1775235024","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775235024?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0d/dd/ae/0dddaef6-0506-e3a3-3240-03fa1b53982d/ce528e58-f895-4308-9d1e-0d7e27d54108.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"483936","textColor2":"372722","textColor4":"564a45","textColor1":"26120f","bgColor":"d3d7d3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/49/dc/f2/49dcf2b6-a5ec-b1d6-d331-2496f0cebd32/2336d795-a483-4bbf-bd18-f7226a311265.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbd5d3","textColor2":"faf5f3","textColor4":"dbd5d3","textColor1":"faf5f3","bgColor":"625651","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/biig-piig/1215793857","name":"11:11","artistName":"Biig Piig","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When Biig Piig, aka Irish pop dynamo Jess Smyth, listens back to her debut album, she hears a record that reflects how much music is a friend to her. These songs are where Smyth has channeled her emotions over the past few years, where she’s tried to make sense of the turmoil. “Within the chaos, the only thing that really keeps me together is music and being able to make it, and expressing through lyrics and melodies and storytelling—just to be able to talk to something and get my feelings out,” she tells Apple Music. “When I listened back to it, I was like, ‘Fucking hell!’ There was so many moments that I really needed a friend and music was that for me.” <i>11:11</i>, the follow-up to her excellent 2023 mixtape <i>Bubblegum</i>, marks the arrival of a striking new voice in modern music. The music deftly shapeshifts from one song to the next, an exhilarating ride through strobing electronic pop, minimalist, melodic techno, downbeat balladry, atmospheric trip-hop, and synth-disco anthems. One thing, says Smyth, unites them. “There’s a lot of sad bangers on this fucking record!” she hoots. “If you can’t celebrate it, what are you going to do, if you can’t get a little dance on whilst you’re crying?” Dab down your tears and head towards the dance floor: Biig Piig is here to take you through <i>11:11</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“4AM”</b>\n“When I started ‘4AM,’ I knew I wanted it to be the first track because the way it starts is, ‘You could’ve hit me with the bad news first.’ And I was like, ‘I want that to be the opening line because I know that where we’re going with every other track, and the way we’re weaving through this relationship and diving into those things.’ I’m like, ‘Fucking hell, I wish I knew that it was going to hurt, diving in.’ It sparked something in me where I was like, ‘Oh fuck, I really want to delve deeper with it.’”\n\n<b>“Ponytail”</b>\n“This was made with Lloyd MacDonald [aka producer/artist Mac Wetha], who I really like because he’s so integral to everything for as an artist. I wouldn’t have released music without him so I really wanted to make sure that he was on this record. Lloyd is the OG, the first producer that I just ever felt comfortable enough to show music to and he was so encouraging with bringing things out. ‘Ponytail’ is a sad banger. It’s basically about a toxic relationship and trying to navigate how hard it is when you’re so attached to something that’s not good for you but you’re like, ‘Fuck, I just can’t really picture my life without it because it’s become such a pattern now that I need you, even if it’s killing me.’”\n\n<b>“Cynical”</b>\n“For this, I thought about walking through a city, flicking my hair, and being like, ‘Do you know what? I’m going to go to the bar, I’m going to have a good time.’ It’s when you’re a bit over it—all the fights and everything else with this partner, or with this person. You’re romanticizing your life, and then you run into him, and you’re a bit like, ‘Oh.’ It feels a bit more play-by-play of how that works, and the romanticization to get yourself out of that headspace. It’s about that and about city girls, and how everyone chats, and how it just gets around, summing up what it’s like to be a girl in the city, heartbroken.” \n\n<b>“Favourite Girl”</b>\n“‘Favourite Girl’ is a little pop banger. We love her. She’s so fun. I made her with Maverick Sabre and Zach Nahome, who are two longtime collaborators of mine that I love working with. We did ‘Kerosene’ before, the three of us. ‘Favourite Girl’ is tongue-in-cheek, it’s a flirty little track.”\n\n<b>“I Keep Losing Sleep”</b>\n“‘I Keep Losing Sleep’ took ages to get done. We had a loop that went on for about six hours, it was this big jam that we did in Paris with me, Zach, and Mav. ‘I Keep Losing Sleep’ was literally a 30-second clip of that jam and we worked off that little part of it and built it out. Lyrically, for me, it’s that point where you’re pretending you’re fine in the record, you’re like, ‘Everything’s good, I’m good, I’m coming back.’ But you’re not taking care of yourself and you’re like, ‘I keep losing sleep over this thing and it’s not helping.’”\n\n<b>“9-5”</b>\n“We wrote this in Montmartre, Paris in the studio. You can’t not want to make music there. It used to be Philippe Zdar’s studio, and it’s super small, everyone that works there has worked there forever. It’s super, it just brings something else out of you. Writing this, I was away from my partner at the time and I was missing him. It’s a love song, that kind of ‘I’ll go anywhere for you. I’ll do anything for you because I love you.’ That’s a part in the relationship where everything feels more romantic because you’re in love.”\n\n<b>“Decimal”</b>\n“This is a track also made in Montmartre with [producer] Andrew Wells. We were just having fun at this point, in a really good writing space. He was like, ‘What do you want this one to feel like?’ and I said, ‘Do you know what? Let me strut.’ He brought in this whole idea of a dance element that we get with the synths and this expanding bit and it just ended up happening. It’s quite a sexy tune. It’s just about finding someone, meeting them across the room, and being drawn to them, and losing inhibitions, and diving into that desire.”\n\n<b>“Silhouette”</b>\n“‘Silhouette’ is the opposite to ‘9-5.’ They’re like day and night. It’s one we also wrote in Paris at a different point in the year when things weren’t going so well. But it’s also an important for the story of the album, we’re exploring all sides of a relationship. This one is getting to a point where it’s ‘You know that it hurts me, why do you do it?’ and coming face to face with the pain of that and the loss of trust and the self-destructive thing comes into that a lot as well. I feel like a casualty in the fucking records that I made. It’s a heartbreak song.”\n\n<b>“Stay Home”</b>\n“This is about falling for someone, that point where everything’s a bit soft and sweet. Then I was like, ‘Do you know what? My family and my friends have been so important to me through everything and they’re really what represents love to me, there’s no chance I’m making my first record and not having them on it.’ I was like, ‘Let’s do it, let’s go to the pub and we’ll get everyone down with some drinks, and we’ll do a recording of the chorus.’ So we did that, which is so cute, so messy but so cute. Through relationships, through everything, through different points in your life, who do you look to as real love? That’s family and friends for me.”\n\n<b>“One Way Ticket”</b>\n“This is a sad one, about someone that I lost in my life. So many things are happening now and, [in] the last couple of years have been happening—and it’s sad that he’s not here to see them. He’s someone that I wish I could share that with and so this is a love letter to him a little bit, just to let him know what’s going on, and to be like, ‘Wow, you always said this would happen and now you’re not here to see it, but you’re here.’”\n\n<b>“Brighter Day”</b>\n“‘Brighter Day’ is the overarching moment where you look back on everything that’s happened, and you go, ‘Fucking hell, it’s mad!’—and watching someone go and accepting that that’s what’s happened and where you are in your life.

It was only when starting work on what would become third album, <i>Open Wide</i>, that singer and guitarist Eli Hewson, bassist Robert Keating, guitarist Josh Jenkinson, and drummer Ryan McMahon cleared the schedules and returned to the Dublin rehearsal space they first began playing together in as teenagers, jamming ideas and writing music together with no external pressures or looming deadlines. “It was the first time we’ve been able to do that in years,” Jenkinson tells Apple Music. “As soon as the second album was finished, we were already writing music,” adds Keating. “From the earliest days, we knew that we were going to try and do something a bit different for this one.”\n\nThe group took their freewheeling rehearsal space demos to Florence + the Machine/Harry Styles producer Tom Hull, aka Kid Harpoon, who helped fashion not only Inhaler’s most sonically ambitious record to date (check the title track’s spacious beatscapes or “X-Ray”’s sci-fi Western chop-ups), but one that also boasts some of the most joyously melodic songs of their career. The unashamedly pop-facing burst of “A Question of You” or “Even Though”’s Springsteenian rush display the confidence of a group who know they can now try their hand at whatever takes their fancy. “I think a lot of the confidence on this album was actually just trusting our gut,” says Hewson. “That has influenced every decision. Maybe in the past we overthought a little bit too much. On this one, it was just like, ‘Does it sound good? Do you need to overthink that lyric? Is that drum part good? Should we just leave it as it is?’” Here, Hewson and the band talk us through <i>Open Wide</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Eddie in the Darkness”</b>\nEli Hewson: “With our last two albums we’ve opened with a big massive guitar chord or a keyboard riff, and so choosing this as the first track was flipping that on its head. Also, this was one of the first songs that we were all super excited about, so it felt really natural to open with it.”\nRyan McMahon: “Someone said to us that it sounds like they’re walking in on us playing in a room together, so it felt like a nice nod to us being back playing together in a room for the first time since we were 17 with no gigs on the horizon or anything like that.”\n\n<b>“Billy (Yeah Yeah Yeah)”</b>\nEH: “It’s weird, we had this first-name thing on this album that kept happening on the demos. It was a complete accident. Billy, Eddie…there was one called ‘James’ that got cut. A lot of these songs are like conversations with people that you’re witnessing, which was a different approach to the lyrics than on the first two albums, which felt more personal and introspective. I guess I learned that from Bruce Springsteen, who’s a writer I really appreciate. He jokes about it, he writes all these songs about working in a steel mill but he’s never worked a day in his life!”\n\n<b>“Your House”</b>\nEH: “We struggled with the instrumentation on ‘Your House’ for a while but, once we got that, it all just clicked. We stripped a bunch of stuff out and put that synth in and we were like, ‘OK, this is a hit!’”\nRM: “We were worried that it sounded a bit too much like ELO for ages but once Tom [Hull, producer] got his hands on it, it just worked.”\n\n<b>“A Question of You”</b>\nRM: “It’s quite in-your-face pop that one, which we were a bit nervous about initially. But as time went on and we played it and we listened to it more and more, we just thought, ‘Fuck all that, it’s a good song!’ We’re not scared to have that ambition. We might have reservations here and there about certain things, but we’re not worried to use joy as a defiant thing in our music.”\n\n<b>“Even Though”</b>\nEH: “There’s quite a broad scope sonically and stylistically on the album. There’s a lot of different things going on, but there’s a certain sound and groove that runs through all the songs, which you can really hear on ‘Even Though.’ I’m really happy about how it all came together. This song is a little bit more personal, it was from direct experience. That was a bit of an outlier for me, lyrically.”\n\n<b>“Again”</b>\nEH: “I really found a new appreciation for writing lyrics on this album. On the first album, it was a bit like, ‘Oh shit, I’ve got to write lyrics now…’ On the second one, I started to get more into it, and on this one, I really felt like I was at a place where I was having fun with it. That allowed me to be a bit more like, ‘Let’s write about a character, let’s set the scene…’ ‘Again’ felt like you were writing it on somebody’s shoulder, kind of peering around.”\n\n<b>“Open Wide”</b>\nRM: “This was a bit of a happy surprise. It was from a demo that we made in like 2021. We all really loved the sound of the demo. It kept grabbing our attention and we kept saying, ‘OK, we’ll come round to that eventually…’”\nEH: “It was like a house track on the demo. Who knows where it came from? I wasn’t feeling that it would go on this album because it felt so sonically different, but now it’s one of my favorite ones. I’m really proud of it.”\n\n<b>“All I Got Is You”</b>\nEH: “This one was the last piece of the puzzle. We wrote it just after the second album, but it was one of the last songs we recorded for this record. It’s our nod to The Smiths and that ’80s world. We don’t often get to represent that in our music, so it’s a nice thing to do. Plus, it’s really fun to play.”\nRobert Keating: “I remember ages ago thinking that it sounded a bit like a Harry Styles song—then we ended up working with Harry Styles’ producer on it!”\n\n<b>“Still Young”</b>\nRobert Keating: “‘Still Young’ feels like the dark horse on the album. Sometimes when you’re writing songs, you can overlook the simple songs. I don’t mean simple in a bad way, but like there’s no bells or whistles on it—it’s just a great song. Once we got a choir on it and did one or two things, it felt so big. It was always doing its job, so we really didn’t have to work too much on it.” \n\n<b>“The Charms”</b>\nRK: “There’s almost a country undertone to that song. I guess in the storytelling element to it, the chorus sounds like you can imagine a guy singing it in a bar. It’s kind of poppy, but it’s also not, if that makes sense.”\n\n<b>“X-Ray”</b>\nRK: “On the demo it sounded quite a lot like The Cure. We kept a lot of the stuff that we loved about the demo in. There’s a keyboard that stayed and the chorus was this really cool middle eight on the early demo. It was kind of like Frankenstein. We had to chop and stitch stuff together and see what worked. It feels quite experimental within the record. With all the recording techniques that we used for the album, this one feels more on experimental side.”\n\n<b>“Concrete”</b>\nEH: “It definitely goes to a darker level, ‘Concrete.’ We’ll always write love songs. I think almost every song is a love song in some kind of weird, obscure way. We were thinking about the idea of something that you walk into willingly knowing that it’s going to hurt you in the end. The idea that, if you love something, you’re putting yourself out there. You’re basically asking to be hurt. You’re opening yourself up to that danger. I think that’s a realistic picture of love. It’s not all daisies and flowery dresses.”\n\n<b>“Little Things”</b>\nJosh Jenkinson: “‘Little Things’ is the sort of song we would have normally opened an album with which is exactly why we put it at the end.”\nEH: “It’s a big strong point to leave it on. We didn’t want to wimp out at the end of the record. It was interesting to do what we would do at the beginning of our old albums at the end of this one. I love how it feels at the end. I really do.”","short":"Inhaler on their bold third album: “We knew we’d try something

decade of left-of-center electronic music, but his long-awaited follow-up harbors zero pretension when it comes to trend-watching. Nine years later, <i>In Waves</i> sets its sights on the dance floor with glorious aplomb, the perfect complement to a string of body-moving singles that the iconic British producer has released in the preceding year and a half. “The collaboration element was helping me push things forward without having to think too much about myself on my own,” Smith tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.\n\nFrom there, the rest of <i>In Waves</i> came together in quick succession—and, suitably, the record’s rowdy and in-a-crowd feel was largely inspired by the solitude of the lockdown era, as well as dreams of how it would feel to play big tunes for huge audiences again. “I was starting to get excited about the idea of playing shows again,” Smith says.\n\nThe guest list for this party is overflowing: Along with a practical reunion of his main outfit The xx on the dreamy “Waited All Night,” house music auteur and recent Beyoncé collaborator Honey Dijon lends her distinctive incantations to the squelch of “Baddy on the Floor,” while experimental-leaning vocalists Kelsey Lu and Panda Bear throw in on the soul-streaked and woozy “Dafodil.” But at the center of <i>In Waves</i> is a truly assured sense of confidence from Smith, who’s returned here with a set of club-ready cuts that’s truly crowd-pleasing—all without losing the distinctive touch that’s brought him so much deserved acclaim to this point. “One of the most inspiring things is to go out clubbing,” he says. “And I think you can have quite profound thoughts even in an altered state on the dance floor.” \n","short":"The producer’s second solo album is a set of club-ready crowd-pleasers."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3d/71/8e/3d718e96-3a34-69bd-8d68-0798d5a8c180/889030041579.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dedede","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-waves-deluxe/1782188661","playParams":{"id":"1782188661","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782188661/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"405563985","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/405563985?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738918434578,"RTCI":0}}},"1782380164":{"id":"1782380164","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782380164?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/death-structure/1468081699","name":"Le Déni","artistName":"Death Structure","artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a9/18/90/a91890bb-9c2d-cc1c-402e-8591bdfe2ea3/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1440,"textColor3":"0db367","textColor2":"02ce97","textColor4":"09a97f","textColor1":"08db79","bgColor":"221821","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/le-d%C3%A9ni/1782380164","playParams":{"id":"1782380164","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2QU8u0XrfkpyrpYUbEDmdl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782380164/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1468081699","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1468081699?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1734704768265,"RTCI":0}}},"1782559640":{"id":"1782559640","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782559640?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e6/12/b0/e612b040-53c0-dc79-4e3b-461e1526722c/056df7de-302c-46bf-a9e0-7a43dbb2606d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7a99d","textColor2":"7dbbcb","textColor4":"679ba8","textColor1":"e1cdbd","bgColor":"0f1b1c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alice-sara-ott/295447371","name":"Field: Complete Nocturnes","artistName":"Alice Sara Ott","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Pianist Alice Sara Ott’s delight in having ‘discovered’ John Field is evident in her bubbling enthusiasm as she recalls the effect of first hearing his music: “It was music that I didn’t know at all, and still there was something familiar and nostalgic about it.”\n\nWhile in isolation during the COVID pandemic, Ott in a “very frustrated mood” had decided to try a composer she didn’t know but had heard of: “I thought Field’s Nocturnes would match this mood,” she tells Apple Music Classical, “but then it turned out to be uplifting—I just couldn't stop smiling when I listened to his music.”\n\nThe early 19th-century Irish pianist and composer, John Field, is already widely known by reputation, at least, for inventing the Nocturne, a now well-established genre of piano piece. But for Field, making his career across Europe and especially in Tsarist Russia, the Nocturne was a perfect vehicle for the poetic yet directly communicative style of his playing.\n\nThe Nocturne was famously taken up by Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, whose own contribution to that genre has been recorded by many pianists. Yet Field’s music was no mere foreshadowing of Chopin’s, as Ott realised when she first heard his music: “I couldn’t even place it in a period. I couldn't tell if it was 18th-century Classical or 19th-century Romantic, because some of Field’s Nocturnes sounded like Mozart or as if by a younger Beethoven.”\n\nNotwithstanding such comparisons, Field’s Nocturnes cast their own spell—one that seems to work no matter the audience, as Ott discovered when she introduced them to Japan. “I was very nervous,” she recalls, “because it almost felt as if I was going to premiere a contemporary piece that nobody had heard before. Probably 99 percent of the audience had never heard of John Field before. I was watching their faces while I was playing some of the nocturnes, and they actually reacted the same way as I did—they just started smiling from the beginning until the end.”\n\nGiven the direct and apparently unassuming style of Field’s Nocturnes, what is the secret of their apparently universal appeal? “Almost every one of them starts in a very simple way,” says Ott, “and you're tricked into thinking, ‘This is rather simple-structured music.’ Then he manages to surprise you with a harmonic or rhythmical twist. And there’s no one who masters the art of ornamentation the way he does—even Chopin doesn’t come close, it seems to me.”\n\nIndeed, much of the fascination of Field’s Nocturnes lies in the almost improvisatory filigree with which he decorated his music—which for Ott presented the greatest challenge. “It was something I had to work at more than if I was playing, for example, Liszt’s (notoriously virtuosic) Sonata, which I find somehow easier for me physically. With all Field’s ornamentation, there are different possibilities, and depending on what choice you make, it has such an impact on the general mood of the piece. I experimented so many different ways of playing these ornaments, and trying to find the right way for myself was not always easy.”\n\nOtt’s love for the music has grown in the process, while she has gained some insight into Field the pianist: “In his time, people everywhere were just talking about what an incredible performer he was,” says Ott, “You can hear from the ornamentation that he really was an improvisational master.”\n\nWhat also makes Field’s music special for Ott is the occasional glimpse of hidden depths of feeling. “Almost every nocturne of his starts very innocently, very naively,” she says. “Then he creates this magic in half a bar of music, where you sense this profound melancholia. It’s almost like you're walking by a window, and then beyond the glass you sense an emotion that can be sadness or melancholy, but you cannot grasp the whole complexity and the depth of it. It lasts just a half bar, and then the sun comes out again.”\n\nSo which Nocturnes does Ott suggest trying to give a flavor of Field’s range? Ott instantly cites as “one of my absolute favourites” No. 10, the song-like and poignant “Nocturne Pastorale” in E major. And she’s grown to love No. 16 in C major: “It’s one of the longer Nocturnes, and in the beginning I was like, ‘Oh, there's so many different sections, and I don't know how to make them work together.’ For me, it's like an opera, because it has so many different moods. You present these different scenes and suddenly there's a singer coming in with a coloratura or Baroque-style aria that Cecilia Bartoli might be singing. And then it becomes, again, very pianistic. It's just full of changes, and that's what I love about it.”","short":"Alice Sara Ott: “Any time you listen to this music, it just makes you happy.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/e1/30/55e13041-fa06-24bb-d987-4239bdae53fb/24UM1IM16065.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9c400","textColor2":"d2bd02","textColor4":"a99b02","textColor1":"faef00","bgColor":"051600","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/field-complete-nocturnes/1782559640","playParams":{"id":"1782559640","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782559640/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"295447371","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/295447371?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738922006490,"RTCI":0}}},"1783204728":{"id":"1783204728","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783204728?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Death Metal/Black Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-04","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/revocation/327995614","name":"Confines of Infinity (feat.

Natasha en Amargue","artistName":"NATTI NATASHA","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“It’s a dream come true,” NATTI NATASHA tells Apple Music about her new album, produced by bachata icon Romeo Santos. “When Aventura came out, I was in Santiago, in the Dominican Republic, going to school when this whole movement happened. It was just daily in my life; it was cultura.” Though <i>Natti Natasha en Amargue</i> benefits greatly from their respective histories with the genre, the two Dominican superstars found success together before, joining forces in 2019 for a “La Mejor Versión De Mi” remix that stormed the charts globally.\n\nWritten by Santos with NATASHA in mind, these 10 original songs expand not only on that hit collaboration, but also upon the handful of bachata tracks found on her earlier albums, namely “Quién Sabe” and “Cuento Breve.” Though much of the album was made during the pandemic years—overlapping her pregnancy and her partner Raphy Pina’s incarceration—it arrives at a time of increased enthusiasm for the genre, with artists both from and beyond the island and its NYC diaspora actively exploring the sound. As such, this sincere and authentic effort from someone with genuine musical and cultural connections to it stands out in the best way.\n\nThose who know NATASHA primarily from her reggaetón smashes may feel compelled to shift preexisting perceptions of her, while dedicated fans of both her and Santos’ work will find much to enjoy and celebrate. “There's so much faith around it,” she says. “I’m doing something for my roots, for my culture, for Dominicans, for Latinos.” Read on to learn about some of NATTI NATASHA’s favorite songs from <i>Natti Natasha en Amargue</i>—in her own words.\n\n<b>“Desde Hoy”</b>\n“It’s the one that started everything. It’s so amazingly powerful. Reinventing yourself, reinventing your universe, reinventing your surroundings—this is what this album means. It cannot get more raw than this. I cannot go more to my roots than this. I feel like everybody, at a certain point in their lives, want to reinvent themselves. It’s not easy to do in a day; it’s a process. And the music, insane. It never stops. It’s very passionate.”\n\n<b>“Tu Loca”</b>\n“We’ve never heard a woman [in bachata] from this perspective. At the end of the day, nobody’s perfect, and we all have our insecurities. It’s coming from a place where you’re like, ‘I love you. Sometimes I feel a little bit iffy when a girl gets in your face.’ I’m not going to talk for everybody, but I feel like we’ve all had that little moment in our lives. It definitely is one of my favorite songs.”\n\n<b>“Quiéreme Menos”</b>\n“It’s so personal to me, on another level. Sometimes I can’t even talk about it that much. When you know you love someone, you accept each other for what you are. Then this person leaves, right? I kept working. My baby was my biggest inspiration ever. It’s about how everything was running so smooth and then, shabam—and then all you have is love to really keep this relationship alive. Two-and-a-half years is hard. And it’s like, I am going to wait for this person. I’m going to love this person regardless, because I know that what God has for us is way bigger than anything else. We actually did the video when [Pina] came out, which was insane too. When I was recording this song, four years ago, I didn’t know that it was going to mean so much now.”\n\n<b>“Escasez de Besos”</b>\n“[Romeo] was there in every single line that I recorded, every single line. There’s no AC in the studio, he stays. He’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to leave?’ I’m like, ‘No, I am staying there.’ You don’t get Romeo twice in your life, with the vibe in the studio. I remember with “Escasez de Besos,” he wanted each word to be said in a certain way. His vocals are to die for, honestly. Who doesn’t love a Romeo vocal on their song? It’s a privilege for me. It is definitely one of the strongest songs.”\n\n<b>“Ya No Comparto” (feat. Ozuna)</b>\n“It’s obvious that we have great chemistry—everybody knows that. We also have a very good relationship. I’m here with my huge belly listening to the demo of the song and the vocals that I had already recorded for it. We just started imagining [Ozuna’s] voice there. He got there the same night, in Miami. I was so grateful being in this room with no AC, eating Chinese food, pregnant, just hanging with the guys. We were able to sit down and enjoy what we were doing and just enjoy the presence of everyone. He sounds so good in bachata—his vocals, the air, the energy, everything.”\n\n<b>“Pinocchio”</b>\n“It’s about all these lies and how we’re attracted to the illusion of the person that we’re dating. You discover the person’s true intention. Sometimes we fall in love, in life, with the illusion of things, and to me, this song represents that. When we were in the studio, we all came to the same conclusion. I think everyone has gone through that in life, not only in love, but in general. But it goes either way. For men, they go through that with women. When I do the songs, I don’t only go for one side of the story. There’s men that are beautiful, that have this great heart that go through these heartbreaks.”\n","short":"A bachata dream come true, with Romeo Santos in tow.\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/65/17/56/65175632-33a3-e3d8-128b-8b2af2e860c2/196871296328.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccac4","textColor2":"dfaa87","textColor4":"b68b6f","textColor1":"fbf8f1","bgColor":"131210","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/natti-natasha-en-amargue/1786010778","playParams":{"id":"1786010778","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JMAAMlcZEg2wOl7b0fRA9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786010778/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1373416931","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1373416931?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738941018860,"RTCI":0}}},"1786046760":{"id":"1786046760","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786046760?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f9/00/ab/f900ab65-a974-eeba-2c8d-7a2a8b651ae5/Joba3bd8275-a655-4adf-bce4-1ca78eff157b-185074299-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362051913_2042122770-Time1738626955201.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","1f1f20"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"fcfcfc"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"404040","textColor2":"1f1f20","textColor4":"4a4a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fcfcfc","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/47/7f/dd/477fddfb-47a6-9d4f-d6d0-45ab3c79e0a5/8beb93e1-7507-4c7b-af72-b306a17993e7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b8aca4","textColor2":"d0baa6","textColor4":"ab998a","textColor1":"e0d2c7","bgColor":"171717","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0e/1f/41/0e1f41b6-35f5-2abc-8311-d5d1f8d78f02/Job45458920-1754-493a-8183-20134ca4fd98-185074298-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362051914_2042122771-Time1738625546158.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","1d1d1f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"fcfcfc"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3d3d3d","textColor2":"1d1d1f","textColor4":"4a4a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fcfcfc","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/98/af/48/98af4892-76f2-6424-0905-548a07db422d/d65d006a-b995-464f-ba7a-2381b3b4d42e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"111112","textColor4":"343434","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"bfbfbf","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nessa-barrett/1525607372","name":"AFTERCARE DELUXE","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Nessa Barrett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Since debuting in 2020, Nessa Barrett has crafted evocative and deeply personal songs about topics like mental illness, trauma, and the struggles of young womanhood, drawing listeners in with her catchy hooks and mesmerizing, fragile timbre. The alt-pop artist wrote her first album, 2022’s <i>young forever</i>, during what she called the worst year of her life. But as Barrett sifted through her recent experiences to inspire her follow-up, she realized she wasn’t sad anymore. This epiphany spurred a new creative approach, one in which she could channel her energy into creating a character instead of resurfacing her own pain.\n\nOn <i>AFTERCARE</i>, Barrett immerses herself in dark, moody soundscapes as she transforms into an empowered woman who owns her sexuality while remaining vulnerable. It opens with the hazy title track, where the question “You love the chase, but will you stay when it ends?” sets the tone for an exploration of love, sex, and the often messy aftermath. Barrett purrs her carnal desires on the provocative “PORNSTAR,” and makes that physicality feel as essential as oxygen on the howling “HEARTBEAT.” On the cinematic ballad “RUSSIAN ROULETTE” she bets it all on love, and on the haunting “EDWARD SCISSORHANDS” she confronts the fallout: “Whenever you touch me/You cut me to pieces.” But as defiant closing tracks “STAY ALIVE” and “DIRTY LITTLE SECRET” show, Barrett emerges stronger and wiser—and ready to dive in all over again.","short":"Six new tracks widen the emotional range of the alt-pop singer’s 2024 LP."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f9/de/8f/f9de8f88-be31-96da-19e9-f559a2c260c1/093624834113.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3d3e","textColor2":"201f22","textColor4":"4c4c4d","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"fdfdfd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aftercare-deluxe/1786046760","playParams":{"id":"1786046760","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786046760/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1525607372","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1525607372?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738927687529,"RTCI":0}}},"1786194233":{"id":"1786194233","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786194233?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/maelf%C3%B8y/1434791824","name":"Breathe - EP","artistName":"Maelføy","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/59/ba/62/59ba62f0-b969-2707-7fa1-1ecd5bc57d0e/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"232225","textColor2":"090805","textColor4":"232226","textColor1":"080704","bgColor":"8c8da9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/breathe-ep/1786194233","playParams":{"id":"1786194233","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786194233/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1434791824","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1434791824?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738924388890,"RTCI":0}}},"1786254303":{"id":"1786254303","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786254303?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/81/82/b68182e9-16a7-789f-2dd8-81bf33d29693/91dc70a9-01d5-4cf6-923d-e9968471232e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3bfc7","textColor2":"f1cbc2","textColor4":"c7a9a2","textColor1":"ebe6f0","bgColor":"202121","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyga/268893121","name":"NSFW","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tyga","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"There are a few recurring themes on Tyga’s <i>NSFW</i>, the MC’s first solo release since 2019’s <i>Legendary</i>, and none of them inherently scream “not safe for work.” In fact, one could be made to believe that this robust collection of tales about balling harder than everyone you know, partying exclusively in the company of beautiful women, and the myriad ways that fast money is best spent is just what a quiet-quitter needs to turn their productivity up. To be fair to Tyga though, that’s not really his concern.\n\nAcross <i>NSFW</i>, the man who gave us pioneering SoCal party-rap anthems like “Rack City” and “Faded” is reaffirming his lifestyle—one that, if you believe tabloid headlines, may currently be funded by the mint he is reported to have made from a now-deactivated OnlyFans account. The point is, this guy parties, and he makes it sound like what he was born to do.

Album","standard":"By sheer force of will, MIKE has become a leading voice in New York’s underground rap renaissance. He drops one or two albums a year, each expanding his lyrical scope, laidback delivery, and excellent ear for beats. His crew runs deep, and 2024’s <i>Pinball</i> with producer Tony Seltzer featured many of his closest collaborators, like Earl Sweatshirt and Tony Shhnow. His 2025 effort, <i>Showbiz!</i>, is similar in the sense that it’s a deeply immersive effort, but the guest list is limited. MIKE’s world is nevertheless unmistakable, filled with weed smoke, knotty lyrics, and beats that continue to help forge a new golden age in New York. “Then we could be free” takes an old soul sample and highlights the bassline, giving MIKE’s unrelenting delivery a funky underbelly. “Lucky” features drums that explode like fireworks and synths that dance around MIKE’s voice, approximating his slippery flow without ever tying it down to a consistent rhythm. It’s loose but never sloppy.","short":"Beats and knotty lyrics that continue to help forge a new golden age in

EMPATHY - EP","artistName":"IVE","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"Since their debut in 2021, K-pop group IVE has been known for their robust choruses, gratifying harmonies, and messages of self-love. <i>IVE EMPATHY</i>, the fourth-generation girl group’s third mini-album after 2023’s <i>I’ve Mine</i> and 2024’s <i>IVE SWITCH</i>, continues the sextet’s pursuit of those qualities. \n\nThe album takes its title as a broad theme, exploring the quality of “empathy” (defined here as emotional connection) across six pop tracks. In “REBEL HEART,” the group offers a sense of comfort and celebratory restlessness. Member Wonyoung contributed to the writing of the album’s second lead single, “ATTITUDE,” which doubles down on <i>IVE EMPATHY</i>’s theme of defiant self-love: “No matter what anyone says/Honestly, I like me.” Suzanne Vega is also credited on the track, as it samples the addictive hook originally from 1981’s “Tom’s Diner.”\n\nMetaphors abound: “FLU” boldly compares a toxic attraction to a virus, while “TKO,” a hip-hop-infused track, leans into boxing (“Float like a butterfly sting like a bee,” “’Cause I’m a TKO”) to boast about the members’ knockout power. “Thank U” (which includes songwriting contributions from member Liz) and “You Wanna Cry” offer album listeners more restrained bops.","short":"Six unrestrained bops from the K-pop girl group."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b5/b1/ca/b5b1cab8-4a78-cd58-eb6d-87945e20d84c/199066115046.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"543d41","textColor2":"5f162c","textColor4":"7c3f51","textColor1":"2c1319","bgColor":"f2e4e3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ive-empathy-ep/1789740675","playParams":{"id":"1789740675","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789740675/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1594159996","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1594159996?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738924448921,"RTCI":0}}},"1789816557":{"id":"1789816557","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789816557?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-donald/953384113","name":"Don Soza - Nobody Knows Me","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lil Donald","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/37/df/3f/37df3f80-d969-fecf-679e-771f52b3fe1e/193436412629_LDDScopy.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2c0c9","textColor2":"d0d1d7","textColor4":"aaacb2","textColor1":"eeebf4","bgColor":"13181c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/don-soza-nobody-knows-me/1789816557","playParams":{"id":"1789816557","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0s6FcprFCtcenCVByOiNKA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789816557/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"953384113","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/953384113?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738880647868,"RTCI":0}}},"1789831514":{"id":"1789831514","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789831514?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/manger-cadavre/1341761125","name":"Como Nascem os Monstros","artistName":"Manger Cadavre?","artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a0/24/1a/a0241a35-027d-f375-29f1-958b1f0b90f6/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1440,"textColor3":"c3c6b5","textColor2":"f5e9d2","textColor4":"c8bfac","textColor1":"eff2de","bgColor":"161614","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/como-nascem-os-monstros/1789831514","playParams":{"id":"1789831514","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27WgHFSU4oUm9fikoTCurt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789831514/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1341761125","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1341761125?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738923168645,"RTCI":0}}},"1789839611":{"id":"1789839611","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789839611?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yungeen-ace/1348100662","name":"I Control My Destiny (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Yungeen Ace","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jacksonville-raised rapper Yungeen Ace has built a career around openness and vulnerability. He sings of trauma and tragedy, escaping the world that has spent so long trying to consume him, and the path towards recovery. On 2024’s <i>I Control My Destiny</i>, he sounds hopeful and inspired, his voice glowing even when recounting all the heartbreaks that have defined his life. On the opener, “Lately,” which features an Afrobeats-inspired beat and a chorus from vocalist RAYBEKAH, Ace sings of the work he’s done on himself, outlining the therapy that has helped heal the traumas he faces on regular occasions. Despite the strides he takes to remove the streets from his story, Yungeen Ace’s old life occasionally creeps back into the fold, like on “Dreams of War,” where he chastises an unnamed opp for not taking care of his soldiers. Even when he revisits these early days, though, there’s an empathy that infuses <i>I Control My Destiny</i>—a desire to see everyone conquer their demons.","short":"A statement of intent to overcome

Kingz II","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Krept & Konan","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When Casyo “Krept” Johnson and Karl “Konan” Wilson released mixtape <i>Young Kingz</i> in 2013, it set a Guinness World Record for the highest-charting album by an unsigned act. By 2015, their full debut <i>The Long Way Home</i> saw them collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Skepta, and Wiz Khalifa. Ten years later, the Croydon rap duo, who met when they were teenagers, evolve further with <i>Young Kingz II</i>, a raw and reflective album full of playful lyrics and emotional moments.\n\n“There’s so much to talk about, so the album’s developed over a few years,” Krept tells Apple Music. “Things have changed and lots has happened and we want to document it all. We just create whatever feels natural at the time and then you have the process of having to narrow it down, thinking, ‘What flows through the album? What makes the most sense?’”\n\nKrept & Konan are keen to uplift those around them, whether it’s new artists or their local community: Shortly before the release of <i>Young Kingz II</i>, they opened their own supermarket, Saveways, to create jobs in Croydon and bring a diverse range of affordable food to people.\n\nIt’s an inspiring attitude and standing up for others is something the duo wanted to continue on <i>Young Kingz II</i>. “Having a voice for people, our friends that are in situations, is important,” says Konan. “We just want people to feel human after they’ve listened to the album and realize we’ve all got different emotions, which we’ve tried to tap into here. We want to take you on a journey. I think this album is like going back to the essence of Krept & Konan, how a lot of people first heard of us. So the origin of the hunger and trying to make it in the scene and breaking out of the doors, but now we’re in a new chapter.”\n\nThe 18 tracks were recorded in London, Hertfordshire, and Jamaica and encompass many different styles, plus collaborations with Ghetts, Chip, and Popcaan, so it’s a journey with plenty of ups, downs, and beats that go off. Read on as the duo talks Apple Music through 10 key tracks.\n\n<b>“100 Mistakes” (Konan Solo)</b>\nKonan: “This song is like a psychotherapy session. I’m talking to myself about everything that’s going on, realizing who I am and being open. Hopefully, it helps other artists coming up to hear that after everything we’ve done, we still feel like this. All we do as artists, and you might get those flowers, but you can’t always rely on other people to give them to you, so you’ve just got to do it for yourself. I feel like it sets the tone for the album—people will know we’re going to be talking about some real stuff and there’s going to be a lot of reflecting.”\n\n<b>“Low Vibrations”</b>\nKrept: “‘Low Vibrations’ is a track that is exactly what it says on the tin. We don’t want anyone to come around here with the low vibrations. You can see that vibe in the video, where we’re with our friends celebrating. Everyone around us was having fun. In this life and in this industry, there are a lot of things that can be negative, so we just wanted to create that song that makes you feel good. It felt like that was needed. We’re coming out of our ring with no bad vibe and no bad energy.”\n\n<b>“How Many Times”</b>\nKrept: “It’s a song for the mandem and it’s got a laid-back, cool vibe. You’ll not really hear me on a song like that, so it was good to try it. It’s simple, there’s not too much going on with the beat in terms of the drum snares and hi-hats. It just feels so relaxing because it’s something that I don’t usually do, and I feel like I’ve done it well on that song. We’re always open to just trying things out on songs and there might be some stuff that will never see the light of day.”\n\n<b>“Bedroom” (feat. Sizzla)</b>\nKonan: “‘Bedroom’ was a wild card, to be fair. And then for the beat, we were just thinking about who we could collaborate with that would make it sound different. And Sizzla came to mind. It was gold from there. When we make songs, it’s not forced—we just make the music and it’s like the album creates itself.”\nKrept: “People are not going to be expecting that from Sizzla when they hear it, which makes the song quite special.”\n\n<b>“Nala’s Song” (Krept Solo)</b>\nKrept: “This song is so important for me because I’d love my daughter, Nala, to have something of me. She can always go back and listen to some words from her dad. Music is something I love and always will love, so being able to give that to my daughter in hard form forever and actually giving her life lessons and some gems is special—I wish someone had done it for me when I was younger. Now when I play it to her, she knows the ‘baby girl’ line, but as she grows older, she’ll understand how deep the song is. I’m also appreciating her mum [health and beauty influencer Sasha Ellese], who’s carried my child into this world on that journey that us men didn’t have to go through.”\n\n<b>“Delroy’s Son” (Konan Solo)</b>\nKonan: “This song’s about my dad [late reggae star Delroy Wilson]. It was a difficult one, so I wrote it in parts. When I listen back, I do get a bit choked up. I had a lot to get off my chest, but being transparent in the music, especially on a song like that, is important. There’s a line in there about when were playing one of our shows at Brixton Academy and, just as we were going on stage my mum said, ‘The last time I was here, your dad was on.’ It’s a sick experience to perform in the same place as my dad. With the hardships of the industry, I feel like he didn’t get his flowers. But now it feels like I’m completing my dad’s work.”\n\n<b>“Kilimanjaro” (feat. Oxlade)</b>\nKonan: “This was the last song we made and it feels like what was missing from the project. We needed that ‘G Love’ or ‘Freak of the Week’ kind of vibe. I shouted a couple of producers saying, ‘Just send me beats,’ then I was like, ‘This is the one.’ Once we’d got the beats, I was thinking about who could deliver what we wanted and I couldn’t come up with anything myself, so I shouted Oxlade. He was on tour at the time, so we messaged on Instagram and exchanged numbers and he filmed himself singing it and, as he was playing it in the background, he was smiling and saying, ‘This is a hit.’ And I was like, ‘Say no more.’”\n\n<b>“Smooth Lovin” (feat. Popcaan)</b>\nKonan: “‘Smooth Lovin’ is one of the first songs that we had for the album. We’d already done a song with Popcaan [‘Freak of the Week (Remix)’], which was a bit more street. As soon as we started the album I said, ‘Yo, I need another one, bro.’ We had the beats for a while, trying to figure out who we wanted to do the song with, and Popcaan helped to make it something more light-hearted and more summery with that Caribbean feel.”\n\n<b>“Rage” (feat. Ghetts)</b>\nKrept: “‘Rage’ was done in stages. We already had the beat and we were working on it at Geejam Studios in Jamaica. It’s one of those beats that just makes you want to go crazy. It was like, ‘Who else could we get on this that is able to come with this much venom?’ Ghetts was the perfect person for it. So we sent him the song, and straightaway he made his verse. He sent the video back to me and you know when you screw up your face like, ‘Yeah’? That’s how the song came about, and everybody just went crazy on the beat.”\n\n<b>“Last Cards” (feat. Michael Ward)</b>\nKonan: “‘Last Cards’ was originally meant to be the title of the album because, when we were making it, we thought it would be the last one on the label. That was the concept behind it. And then we ended up getting out of that situation into a new situation [<i>Young Kingz II</i> is on Krept & Konan’s own label, Play Dirty]. Then we didn’t want to confuse people and make them think, ‘Ah, it’s their last album ever.’ It just happened to be the 10-year anniversary of <i>Young Kingz</i>.

The eight tracks are reimagined through different genres—including Jersey club, house, and trance—by XG executive producer JAKOPS, aka Simon Junho Park. All are imbued with the kind of dance-party energy that would fit right in on a festival field. Here, XG’s low-key trap-beat track “GRL GVNG” becomes an exultant house bop, and the whisper hook of debut single “TIPPY TOES” becomes more abstract and distorted as it builds to a drop beat. It’s all in the pursuit of further defining “X-pop,” the self-described sound for the internationally minded group. All of XG’s members—Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya, and Cocona—are Japanese, but the group is based in Korea, and sings and raps mostly in English. Around the release of XG’s debut EP, <i>NEW DNA</i>, singer Chisa told Apple Music’s Brooke Reese, “I would describe XG's sound as a mixture inspired by R&B and hip-hop, but we also have a lot of original flavors included in there as well.”","short":"Club-ready remixes of the K-pop group’s biggest

MIIKE (DELUXE)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Myke Towers","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"As multifaceted a star as Myke Towers grew to become, his day-ones remember him as a hard-hitting trapero. To be clear, that streetwise edge never quite left his music as he pivoted to reggaetón and, eventually, global pop, all evident on his 2024 album <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>. Yet this aspect of his artistry—the rugged rapper who helped to define a pivotal wave in Latin music—remains so integral to his approach that he’s essentially begun an entire series devoted to this veritable beast mode. A direct successor to 2021’s <i>LYKE MIKE</i>, the similarly rap-centric <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> (note the extra vowel) leaves no doubt of the Puerto Rican star’s enduring hip-hop bona fides.\n\nTowers’ choice of guests speaks strongly to his roots, tapping generational peers like Dowba Montana and Miky Woodz to spit proudly alongside him. Eladio Carrión helps open the proceedings on “QUÉ QUIERES DE MI?”, a joint show of force from two artists with parallel and noteworthy ascents. From there, Neutro Shorty and Jon Z show a genuine love for the format on “NUNCA ME QUEJÉ” and “TRAP,” respectively. While some of these collabs are, in effect, reunions, exceptions exist, like the Akapellah team-up “MI BRILLO.”\n\nThough the temptation to flood <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> with features must have been tempting, Towers largely spends these 23 tracks on his own, showcasing a skill set he honed in the underground before earning mainstream accolades. He commands the pulpit on the gospel-tinged “REVERENDO” and feeds the streets on the decidedly darker “TÍTERES.” With producers like Murda Beatz and Fly Twilightzone in his proverbial corner, the beats surrounding these exquisite bars never feel staid, as cuts like the drill-adjacent “440” and the Michigan-nodding “YO ESTARÉ” expand his sonic range.","short":"A welcome return to trap roots from the Puerto Rican star."},"artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/64/f1/8b/64f18b86-ac5b-69d1-ba76-733358f172e5/5021732625953.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3500,"textColor3":"dddddd","textColor2":"e1e1e1","textColor4":"c6c6c6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"585858","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lyke-miike-deluxe/1792535638","playParams":{"id":"1792535638","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27bcWf41ghwRCrfTS1OjXj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792535638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738930768781,"RTCI":0}}},"1792915408":{"id":"1792915408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792915408?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":51,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African","Amapiano"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/71/17/66711777-751d-c5b3-8d1b-6209745b8a33/bf4d00b0-211c-4c58-af92-15663ffd3549.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"533636","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"514f57","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c8c9f1","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/91/14/e2/9114e245-7916-6281-5a69-9028094250a0/b982dde6-01b7-417e-a693-3ba4749ff132.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1800,"textColor3":"36140c","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"3e1a12","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9592e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f0/7a/41/f07a4136-368a-6882-9af3-bdcefa39247d/56dddf3b-36ba-4d46-a7dc-6c9ee1e8194a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"411d16","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"432016","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe4e1a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0a/07/1a/0a071a97-e035-324b-dbeb-091e2f3061ac/a677b83d-3d72-4dbf-b433-2c21138c4537.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"493539","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3938","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c4c4ec","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/djames/1574614319","name":"Africa Now: February 2025 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"DJames","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"“Each year, there are so many incredible talents emerging in Africa, and it’s such an exciting time to be a part of the scene,” British DJ and producer DJames tells Apple Music. “I can see African music is becoming more global each year, with a lot of cross-genre collaborations providing interesting new sounds.” For February 2025, he’s assembled a set featuring some of his favorite classic and contemporary hits. “I wanted to make a mix that people could enjoy anywhere, any time,” he explains. “It’s a celebration of all the amazing rising and established talent in Afrobeats right now. I’ve chosen a mixture of songs from newer talents like Shoday, Qing Madi, and FOLA alongside legends like Wizkid, Davido, and Burna Boy. I’ve also featured some of my own productions from last year.

Super Bowl LIX is New Orleans, which gives us a chance to celebrate a region with one of the most storied legacies in the history of Black music. New Orleans hip-hop, specifically, is so rich with culture and originality, you’d be doing yourself a severe disservice by trying to get the story from just one person. Which is exactly why we’ve enlisted four(!) of our favorite NOLA-based DJs to deliver sets highlighting New Orleans the way they hear it. We’ve got masterfully seasoned mixes from the engine of Cash Money Records himself, superproducer Mannie Fresh, the man who orchestrated the sound of No Limit’s ’90s dominance, KLC The Drum Major, one of the area’s foremost remixers and bounce experts, Streetz 100.3’s DJ Poppa, and a woman who knows exactly what’s moving in the city right now, Player’s Ball founder Legatron Prime. These are people who know New Orleans hip-hop and who’ll have you wanting to visit the city long after the big game’s final whistle is blown.

Over the past 14 years, Abel Tesfaye has experienced what you might call pop’s glow-up of the century: When he emerged from obscurity as the faceless voice behind 2011’s noir-ish <i>House of Balloons</i> mixtape, nobody could have guessed that he’d be headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show a decade later. But that moment onstage triggered what Tesfaye has since described as a breakdown, inspiring a period of intense reflection on his life and career—and <i>Hurry Up Tomorrow</i>, his sixth studio album.\n\nTesfaye has called <i>Tomorrow</i> the final chapter in the trilogy he began with 2020’s <i>After Hours</i>, the album that launched him into a new stratosphere of pop success, and continued with 2022’s high-concept <i>Dawn FM</i>. Continuing the narrative of its semi-autobiographical narrator’s journey through a dark night of the soul, <i>Tomorrow</i> doubles as an allegory about fame’s power to destroy: The curtain rises, and it’s all downhill from there. He longs for a time “when my blood never tasted like wine,” he wails over the night-drive synth-pop of “Take Me Back to LA,” and diagnoses fame as a disease on the glittering “Drive.” He’s ready to leave it all behind on “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with French duo Justice: “No afterlife, no other side,” he sings, sounding entranced by the thought.\n\nIts 22 tracks play out like the swan song to end all swan songs, joined by a murderer’s row of guests: Future lends a layer of scuzz to the deceptively sweet R&B slow-burner “Enjoy the Show,” Anitta taps in for the nocturnal baile funk of “São Paulo,” and frequent collaborator Lana Del Rey makes an appearance on “The Abyss,” where ominous lyrics like, “What’s the point of staying? It’s going up in flames” hit even harder after LA’s devastating fires in January 2025. Tesfaye has dropped repeated hints that this album won’t just close out the trilogy, but also his existence as The Weeknd. If that’s the case, “Without a Warning” encapsulates the arc of an artist who never let success get in the way of his ambition: “Take me to a time/When I was young/And my heart could take the drugs and heartache without loss/But now my bones are frail/And my voice fails/And my tears fall without a warning/Either way, the crowd will scream my name.”\n","short":"A haunting (maybe?) final statement

Kendrick Lamar the way Mustard does. Have a listen to the gleefully unhinged way Lamar yells the acclaimed LA DJ and producer’s name on their collaborative “tv off,” and you’ll know the two are simply connected in a way the rest of us can only pretend to understand.\n\n“We both just have a deep respect for where we come from, and we carry that with us everywhere we go,” Mustard tells Apple Music. “And it’s not just about repping the West—it’s about honoring the people who paved the way and making sure the next generation has something to look up to.”\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show, then, is the perfect platform for someone like Lamar, an artist whose wholly original, Compton, California-bred artistry is beloved across generations. In preparation for Lamar’s performance, Apple Music asked Mustard—producer of “tv off,” “hey now,” and the world-shaking “Not Like Us”—to put together a mix that speaks to what Lamar accomplishes every time he steps into a recording booth.\n\nMustard prioritizes energy across Kdot bars both new and old, his selections united by their shared mission to leave hip-hop better than they found it. “I think, for both of us, music isn’t just a job—it’s our passion, our purpose,” Mustard says. “We want to elevate the game and make sure the stories we tell and the sounds we create stand the test of time.”","short":"Mustard celebrates the wicked wit of a Pulitzer Prize-winning genius."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/4d/ca/3e4dca79-a917-4f1a-4d68-4a20effa38f0/922747d5-80dc-4c1a-86f4-1d78f16de4e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d2d2c","textColor2":"332d38","textColor4":"565159","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e3e1de","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/2025-super-bowl-lix-megamix-dj-mix/1793843454","playParams":{"id":"1793843454","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793843454/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"304270345","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/304270345?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738942877585,"RTCI":0}}},"1793854016":{"id":"1793854016","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793854016?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/af/f8/84/aff88401-fb56-142f-b5b8-4a13989dfb18/405080fb-105a-4b24-90c2-e7706a7ed856.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"373837","textColor2":"25262a","textColor4":"454648","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebeae2","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c6/cf/85/c6cf854e-6a08-f595-0db7-bdedd7d91224/18b5f7bc-2001-4789-a999-4602ab768b78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"2d2e2e","textColor2":"242525","textColor4":"4a4a49","textColor1":"000202","bgColor":"e1dfdc","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7d/49/8c/7d498c32-65e3-711b-d245-9a536e0083c8/41e4a6af-eaa1-4a4c-b620-356cee52153b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"313332","textColor2":"2a2b2b","textColor4":"515250","textColor1":"020404","bgColor":"efeee8","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/15/ba/73/15ba73d8-0170-a55d-11ad-7ad473836dba/e4bb45d1-eed6-4a76-a59b-f7202ddb27ed.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"303130","textColor2":"161717","textColor4":"3f403f","textColor1":"030404","bgColor":"e4e3df","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/klc-the-drum-major/1556326996","name":"Super Bowl LIX Hip-Hop Dance Party (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"KLC The Drum Major","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"As you’re by now well aware, the host city for Super Bowl LIX is New Orleans, which gives us a chance to celebrate a region with one of the most storied legacies in the history of Black music.

Two West Coast hip-hop mainstays, their 2023 joint album <i>The Great Escape</i> and a few surrounding one-offs clarified just how marvelously the Bay’s healthiest MC could vibe with LA’s infamous beat artisan. While that project’s featured guests were overwhelmingly comprised of ALC familiars, the duo’s 2025 follow-up welcomes a relative newcomer to that particular scene as its third headliner: 2 Chainz. Having established his reputation primarily with trap producers, the Georgia native reached a certain level of ubiquity by working beyond subgenre borders, which contextualizes his presence on <i>Life Is Beautiful</i>. As his biggest fans assuredly know, he and June are in no way strangers, appearing together on the latter’s <i>Spaceships on the Blade</i> and <i>The Night Shift</i>, albeit not over Alchemist beats.\n\nCommonalities and contrasts between the two rappers make <i>Life Is Beautiful</i> a uniquely satisfying listening experience. “Colossal” recalls 2 Chainz’s <i>Most Expensivest</i> exploits, his luxe litany of decidedly un-humble brags pleasantly incongruous with June’s signature lifestyle index involving fresh-squeezed juices, vintage timepieces, and automotive excellence. At times, they suit one another like a well-balanced cocktail, trading unapologetically profane bars for more methodical and measured ones on “I Been” and “Any Day.” Elsewhere, their shared maturity differentiates them from the brand-name-dropping rap pack, their grown-folks motivations informing the flexes of “LLC” and the title track.
