Album","standard":"Since breaking through in 2015 with her sleeper hit “Here,” the Canadian singer-songwriter has wrangled pop smashes out of topics that others avoid, from body image issues to feeling weird at parties. On her fourth album, Alessia Cara’s the first to tell herself to snap out of it: “Lonely in LA, I’m such a cliché,” she sighs on “Go Outside!” while wallowing in bed, nursing a fresh heartbreak. The deceptively upbeat first half of <i>Love & Hyperbole</i> draws from ’90s neo-soul and 2000s R&B: Shades of Alicia Keys and Faith Evans echo through songs like “Dead Man,” a piano-driven throwback about trying to defibrillate a dying relationship.\n\nBut something shifts around “(Isn’t It) Obvious,” which sneaks in an uncredited guitar solo from John Mayer: The sky stops falling—or rather, Cara finds that it wasn’t falling to begin with. Rather than overburden a relationship with expectations, she simply lets love in, and by “Clearly,” she wipes the slate clean with a promise: “Forget about the rest, and start over for the first

Album","standard":"Bartees Strange’s third album finds the Washington, D.C. singer-songwriter stretching his sonic limbs further than ever before—an achievement, to be sure, since Strange’s first two records (2020’s <i>Live Forever</i> and 2022’s critical breakthrough <i>Farm to Table</i>) cemented his ability to effortlessly hop between anthemic rock, dusky blues, and rap cadences within just a few minutes. With a slightly darker sound befitting its namesake, <i>Horror</i> adds a few impressive guises to Strange’s genre menagerie: There’s the explicitly Fleetwood Mac-esque jangle of “Sober,” the melancholic trip-hop skitter of “Doomsday Buttercup,” and the lucious house thump of “Lovers,” which might count as Strange’s starkest left turn to date.\n\nAcross these 12 tracks, Strange also fine-tunes his winning formula of countrified balladry and propulsive riffs, both of which are given a big-ticket pop spit-shine courtesy of contributions from studio wizards Yves and Lawrence Rothman as well as the ever-ubiquitous Jack Antonoff. Don’t mistake big names for unnecessary flashiness, though: <i>Horror</i> retains the down-to-earth POV that’s made Strange an increasingly powerful presence in indie, even as his ambitions grow.","short":"The D.C. indie star gets dark and goes big on his third album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/horror/1767608790","playParams":{"id":"1767608790","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/63PDPkOtqUzHu8qNolREp8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767608790/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1450776625","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1450776625?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739523805505,"RTCI":0}}},"1768110841":{"id":"1768110841","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768110841?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7d/79/12/7d7912c6-cf8d-a0bb-de21-8357e6807c16/15edb14f-2f58-454f-af37-edd0a2e4ae30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5b8b3","textColor2":"cbc8ca","textColor4":"a6a4a5","textColor1":"f1e2db","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lacuna-coil/18030160","name":"Sleepless Empire","artistName":"Lacuna Coil","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b4/93/3b/b4933b4c-84f3-81ce-9244-251a0e82af09/196872093223.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"d0cdce","textColor4":"a7a5a6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"On <i>Sleepless Empire</i>, Italian goth-metal stars Lacuna Coil examine the pervasive difficulty of balancing real life with an increasingly online world. “It can sound like a critique of society, but it’s more of an analysis because we are also doing this,” co-vocalist Andrea Ferro tells Apple Music. “We use social media a lot, and it’s not something we can avoid. But we’re old enough to have the experience of living life before the internet. We kind of have a balance in our life between what we know we can put on the internet and what we just want to enjoy with our friends and family.”\n\n<i>Sleepless Empire</i> is Lacuna Coil’s first album of all-new material since 2019’s <i>Black Anima</i>. During the pandemic, they worked remotely on a new version of their 2002 breakout album, <i>Comalies</i>, which was released in 2022 as <i>Comalies XX</i>. Ferro and his bandmates—co-vocalist Cristina Scabbia, multi-instrumentalist Marco Coti Zelati, and drummer Richard Meiz—view quarantine as one of the accelerants of the always-online lifestyle. “Once we were free to go out again, some people went back to their normal life, and a lot of other people got stuck in this situation, living online and being on Twitch all the time or something,” Ferro says. “So, the album is more of a reflection that we can’t avoid, but we’re also not prisoners. We are stuck in a loop, and it’s so hard to slow down, but it can be done. I just wish we could handle all of it in a more reasonable way.” Below, he discusses each track on <i>Sleepless Empire</i>.\n\n<b>“The Siege”</b>\n“It’s a song that starts quite aggressively, to show the fact that we feel under this siege in our society nowadays. But it’s also about growing your own existence in sort of a figurative battle and walking between all these stages of your life, surviving and trying to make your best way out of it. We need to learn and resist, and even if we fall, we have to get back up. So, it’s basically about all of us. It’s about how we have to face life with all the difficulties that we might encounter, especially in this very weird-shaped society that we are living in.”\n\n<b>“Oxygen”</b>\n“It’s quite an intense song. It’s very aggressive, but also very melodic at the same time. It’s about finding balance, in a way. This can be in a relationship, but also within yourself. The way we write the songs, it usually starts from some real feelings that we experience, but then we try to write it in a way that everybody can sort of find their own interpretation. It doesn’t have to be our reason—it can be your own. So, ‘Oxygen’ can be about a relationship, or it can be about survival in general, fighting your way out of what surrounds you, basically.” \n\n<b>“Scarecrow”</b>\n“This one starts with some intricate layers, but then it also portrays an abstract image that represents how we feel in the middle of a lot of people. Sometimes, even between a lot of people, you can kind of still feel alone. It’s important that you accept yourself even in the weirdness, even in the not feeling all right, even if you have a different condition than other people. Sometimes, coming from an alternative environment, we create our own point of view, our own way of living, and we embrace a lot of different people who feel isolated from what’s considered the norm.”\n\n<b>“Gravity”</b>\n“It’s a song that features a constant switch between, as we way, abrasion and allure—something that is rough but also very delicate at the same time. It’s probably one of the most gothic songs on the album. Many people who have heard it say that it kind of portrays all the eras of Lacuna Coil in one song. It captures some vibes from the past, some vibes from the current sound of the band—and for us, it also opens a new pathway. It’s a dark song with the dark meaning of not being focused anymore, but in the end, there is also a little bit of hope.” \n\n<b>“I Wish You Were Dead”</b>\n“It's a more melodic song, maybe the most accessible song on the record. We wanted to twist it a little bit with the lyrics, although they do have an ironic overtone. We always start from personal feelings, but we don’t wish that anybody was dead. Surely, we all have this person that we wish was not in our life anymore somehow—or even never existed. We’re shooting a video that will have some special features that apply to the title, but also to the release date of Valentine’s Day.” \n\n<b>“Hosting the Shadow” (feat. Randy Blythe)</b>\n“This is the first record where we used a guest vocalist. We had some guests on a previous record, but on lead guitars mostly. This time, we wanted to try and get a couple of songs with guest vocalists, but not too many because we obviously have already two vocalists in the band. It was great to work with Randy because we’ve known him since Ozzfest 2004. He’s a big fan of Lacuna Coil, as much as we are fans of Lamb of God. He’s also a friend, so it was a natural choice to ask him. We sent him the song, and he came back super enthusiastic. He put some of his own arrangement into it, and it was just great to have him. It’s a celebration of our friendship.” \n\n<b>“In Nomine Patris”</b>\n“We had this title ready that we wanted to use, but we weren’t sure how in the beginning. Then we thought about what it means, and that it’s also the beginning of a prayer as well—‘In the name of the father’—so that gave us the connection. We lose ourselves sometimes in the name of something that seems bigger than us, but we don’t have a clear reason why. It’s in our blood, in our culture, in the way we’ve been raised sometimes. We personally are not very religious, but we do respect faith. We know something higher exists because we’re just a tiny bit of this universe.” \n\n<b>“Sleepless Empire”</b>\n“We are living in this generation that is losing the capability of elaborating thoughts because we are bombed with so much information—so many inputs, so many TV shows, music, video games. Everything is in abundance, and we are always connected. But in the end, we become like zombies. We’re always in front of the phone and depending on it, waiting for the next thing to come out. Sometimes we forget to go out into real life and just hang out with our friends or have a drink with dear people and spend time with them. We need to find this balance.” \n\n<b>“Sleep Paralysis”</b>\n“This is coming from a personal experience of real sleep paralysis that Cristina had, but in the song, we play with that idea a little bit. When you have sleep paralysis, you are scared because you’re awake, but you can’t control your body. Sometimes, we feel we need to regain control a little bit of our lives. There’s a lot of pressure from the outside because everybody on social media shows their best life. They never show their weaknesses or their low moments. And so, there is pressure to be as good as this, especially if you are very young and don’t have experience in life. You don’t have to let these things drive your life and decide the speed of how you want to live.”\n\n<b>“In the Mean Time” (feat. Ash Costello)</b>\n“We were looking for more of a rock voice, not a super clean or operatic voice, for this song because it goes into more of a rock dimension. We considered a couple of people, but Ash was the main person who came to mind. We never met her in person, but we’re labelmates, so we kind of know her. We asked her if she would join us for the song, and she got excited and sent her part right away. To our ears, her vocal arrangement is more American sounding, and we are really happy with the result. The chorus transports you from a claustrophobic moment to a feeling of hope, especially in the part that Ash sings.”\n\n<b>“Never Dawn”,/b>\n“We are big nerds, and we always play board games, video games, and read comic books. This is a song that we’ve done for a collaboration with a board game called Zombicide. They had this new edition of the game coming out called White Death, and they asked us to write a song to be used in the trailer on YouTube and in all the promo.

His songs center his passionate, yearning vocal performances against hard-charging drum grooves and shredding guitar melodies. It’s a style he updates on his first full-length, presenting his sound in its most polished state yet. “Breaker Box” is built around a morose piano line that accents Singer’s longing lyrics and drum fills that reverberate against the swelling string runs. Elsewhere, on “Episode,” the band lightens the mood, incorporating playful vibraslaps and hand percussion that neatly juxtapose Singer’s declaration that all might not end well: “I think I know/How

Wrong</i>. Van Etten was mesmerized by the live band experience during rehearsals and decided to include her group in the writing process for what eventually became the first album from Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory. Featuring Jorge Balbi, Devra Hoff, and Teeny Lieberson, this 2025 album is a rich and cosmic tapestry of shoegaze, indie rock, and deep-fried country soul. In expanding her POV to include other perspectives, Van Etten has crafted her most sonically diverse effort to date. Though instrumentation bounces between these different styles, the lyrics find the artist in her wheelhouse, interested in life and mortality, modern addiction to screens, and the disconnect that is inherent in the way we communicate with others and ourselves.","short":"The indie vet expands her sound on this anxiously awaited full-band debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sharon-van-etten-the-attachment-theory/1770826874","playParams":{"id":"1770826874","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5aGKc7OL3d1aJodCG2747F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770826874/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"314263775","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/314263775?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739523764820,"RTCI":0}}},"1771508964":{"id":"1771508964","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771508964?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e5/c5/f9/e5c5f95f-58c9-8268-6ad3-0fa0e233e428/Jobde586cf8-34ee-4ab0-b9bc-03faa63b5179-185295725-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362521370_2045888220-Time1738876247474.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","edd0bb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b6b3b8","textColor2":"edd0bb","textColor4":"c2ad9f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4d/84/5c/4d845cb0-00f3-0b80-5002-6c7b6bfbea21/Jobfd9cb508-cda5-474a-9a37-f2a733e11732-185295726-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362521371_2045888221-Time1738877908076.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d0d6d7"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"b0b2ac","textColor2":"d0d6d7","textColor4":"abb0b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/05/8f/79/058f7938-a2b1-1ce1-4cbc-622373c7d716/a4d5d1d9-382e-4c72-93f8-36bd3591e1ee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bbb9bb","textColor2":"b9c5cf","textColor4":"9eabb4","textColor1":"dcd7d7","bgColor":"35414b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mereba/1211043322","name":"The Breeze Grew a Fire","artistName":"Mereba","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/c6/8f/84c68f5f-c0d3-b146-7ecf-c663fbb4588c/48726.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0b6be","textColor2":"e4b08c","textColor4":"bb957c","textColor1":"d6dadf","bgColor":"18293b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Following Mereba’s 2019 solo debut, <i>The Jungle Is the Only Way Out</i>, and 2020’s <i>Spilligion</i> as part of the Spillage Village supergroup, her perspective was shifted by the birth of her son. <i>The Breeze Grew a Fire</i> honors her role as maternal figure while leaving room for her to examine her own place in the world. On the album, Mereba, who cut her teeth in Atlanta’s underground scene, creates uplifting anthems of triumph and perseverance.

The chorus explodes as she sings, “You’re the original/Don’t let ’em counterfeit you.” She takes this advice to heart, embracing a number of genres and unexpected detours on <i>The Breeze Grew a Fire</i>. “White Doves” hearkens back to the neo-R&B of D’Angelo and The Soulquarians, while “Meteorite” skips and shuffles alongside a lo-fi rap beat.","short":"Rap and neo-R&B anthems of perseverance, inspired by motherhood."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-breeze-grew-a-fire/1771508964","playParams":{"id":"1771508964","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27Wwasz4XZHobOHQaB4R0g"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771508964/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1211043322","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1211043322?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739547106988,"RTCI":0}}},"1772274466":{"id":"1772274466","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772274466?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/90/ff/1e90ffa8-7833-6742-8539-05ad6dacf068/64490e46-f7f2-44cb-b453-b585a6659797.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202022","textColor2":"13110d","textColor4":"2b2a2c","textColor1":"040401","bgColor":"8d91a9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/69/d2/ef/69d2efaa-2a28-ba02-9bf5-f277fad926e5/0a6eb548-8604-4cbd-b92e-875d6a1a74d6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"312c22","textColor2":"17110a","textColor4":"352d20","textColor1":"12100e","bgColor":"ad9e75","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-wombats/162731772","name":"Oh!

As they’ve matured in the ensuing years, though, their sound has evolved beyond the scope of that world. On their sixth studio album, 2025’s <i>Oh! The Ocean</i>, they update the band’s geographic influence, too. After Murphy moved to LA, the band recorded in the city’s Echo Park neighborhood. Though the album title suggests a cheery, awestruck disposition, Murphy’s writing is as biting as ever. He takes aim at “see and be seen culture” on opener “Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come” and wades into the murky anxiety of modern politics on “I Love America and She Hates Me.” The cultural, though, is balanced by plenty of introspective moments, like on “My Head Is Not My Friend,” in which Murphy dives into the ecstatic highs, crippling lows, and run-of-the-mill mundanities that animate

Album and Interview","standard":"Squid entered into sessions for a third album keen to switch things up. The quintet’s second record <i>O Monolith</i>, released in 2023, was a dizzying blur of jerky art rock, prog-tinged folk, and eerie, experimentalist jazz, but things settle down a little on the startling <i>Cowards</i>. “We did want to simplify some aspects of this record,” says drummer and vocalist Ollie Judge. “That was kind of a springboard to focus a bit more on classic-y songwriting.”\n\nIt has resulted in a record that feels like one the band has been building up to since they first emerged in the latter half of the last decade, where the thrilling alchemy of their playing locks into something more mesmeric. In streamlining their sound, Squid sound more powerful than ever with <i>Cowards</i> taking in hypnotic, motorik grooves, choral folk, epic bursts of strings, and propulsive, minor-chord rock. It is the work of a band realizing that less is more. \n\n“Doing something slightly more melodic and expansive was definitely something we had in mind,” adds guitarist Louis Borlase. “[During the songwriting process] we were kind of riding the wave and we didn’t have to stop and look around as much to make active decisions on how to let a certain idea come and go. It did feel like stuff was happening by itself. I think it’s the best record we’ve made.” Let Judge, Borlase, and bassist Laurie Nankivell guide you through <i>Cowards</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Crispy Skin”</b>\nLaurie Nankivell: “The working title for this was ‘Glass’ because we talked about how the opening keyboard lines had this slightly classic minimalist feel of a two-hand counterpoint that I think a lot of us are inspired [by] from the work of Philip Glass.”\nOllie Judge: “I think this track shows the more chamber kind of feel to the record, with piano and acoustic instruments looking to set the stage. Lyrically, it’s just the same old dark stuff. It’s about cannibalism and an alternate reality where evil acts like that are normalized—and whether or not anyone could have such a strong moral compass not to indulge in things that are so widely normalized.”\n\n<b>“Building 650”</b>\nLouis Borlase: “This is one of the only tracks we’ve released which is under four minutes and that’s representative of the fact we wrote it quite quickly. It’d be nice if that happened more regularly. Sadly, it’s not the case.”\nOJ: “I remember we were doing some writing at our friend’s studio in Bristol and Jim Barr, who was Portishead’s touring bassist and is a man of few words, came in and said that ‘Building 650’ sounded like the bastard love child of Sonic Youth and Led Zeppelin. I see where he’s coming from.”\n\n<b>“Blood on the Boulders”</b>\nLN: “We started writing in a really nice cosy studio in really far-out East London called Arcus Sounds, run by two really nice friends. It’s a nice immersive room and you forget about your industrial surroundings and you can be in there for a long time and not get sick of it. It felt like that was quite a turning point in understanding the album in terms of how it was evolving sonically into something that we weren’t particularly worried about, the nakedness of sound. It’s probably the track where the parts are most out in the open on their own, at least for the first half of the song. We were really happy early on with the simplicity of the groove and how the vocals found their way into it. We were feeling good about how it didn’t feel like it needed any complicated or all-encompassing soundworld to take over the scene. Very importantly, it’s our first track where a little ‘E’ for explicit comes up on Apple Music.”\n\n<b>“Fieldworks I”</b>\nOJ: “Anton [Pearson, guitarist] described this as the problem child of the album. The first idea for the track was written in 2021 and I think we finished the final structure for it maybe a week before we went into the studio. It was originally all one track but got separated into two because it has two quite distinct sections. This was the one that set the tone for the record, I think, because it had just been with us for that long.”\n\n<b>“Fieldworks II”</b>\nLN: “We were quite keen early on to try out with [producer] Marta Salogni, seeing what it feels like to do a track or two with a producer we’ve never worked with before. We went up to The Church [Studios] in Crouch End and met Marta and came into this new space and said, ‘We’ve got this track that we know isn’t finished yet and we can’t make a decision on how the second half of it is going to end up but let’s record it anyway.’ The harpsichord that we made for the first half that you hear, that ostinato going through it like a thread, that was originally parts that me and Anton played on guitar that we really liked the harmonic feel of. But something didn’t quite sit with the idea of using guitars to do that. It marks quite a big turning point again to have this moment where we replace something that’s always been so central as a guitar, making it be played by another instrument, letting go of what you assume to be your go-to instrument.”\nOJ: “Yeah, it sounded a bit too like U2 with the guitars. It sounded too much like The Edge, so we had to take The Edge off.”\n\n<b>“Cro - Magnon Man”</b>\nLN: “Halfway through writing the album, it became really noticeable that we were talking about people more than places and caricatures. I’d come across this book in a charity shop, one of those quite dated 1970s picture books from science, and I was really struck by this outdated idea aesthetically of a figurehead of humankind and modernity that is…well you can’t ascribe the word tacky to it because we’re humans and Cro-Magnon people were the first early modern humans in Europe. It’s this idea of exploring a story of a pathetic self, a kind of hopeless case but for something that we’re also genetically based on, exploring the idea of the cave that the Cro-Magnon man lives in. Caves are always referred to and explored by psychologists as being representative of our mind, what we repress and what we can’t deal with.”\n\n<b>“Cowards”</b>\nLB: “This was the first track we wrote. There was a simplicity to it that felt like it struck quite true [to] what we wanted to achieve from the record.”\nOJ: “This is one of my favorite tracks on the record because if you dropped into the middle of the track and showed it to a Squid fan, they might not think it’s Squid. That’s always a really exciting prospect for anyone listening to a band that they’re a fan of.”\n\n<b>“Showtime!”</b>\nOJ: “The middle section of this one, where it gets a bit electronic and glitchy, was quite a task because there was just so much going on and it was hard to pin down what that section really was. We threw everything at it. There’s the string quartet, there’s drum machines, there’s synths, Arthur [Leadbetter] sampled some timpanis, which became quite a laborious process for him. It’s about Andy Warhol and how he was maybe quite an exploitative figure in the art world. I listened to a podcast about him. It was quite a trashy podcast, but it was reevaluating how he’s seen in popular culture.”\n\n<b>“Well Met (Fingers Through the Fence)”</b>\nLB: “There’s a hopeful but also somber feeling to the end of this song, which felt representative and nice to be like, ‘What’s next?’ as an end to the album.”\nOJ: “It’s got [Copenhagen-based singer-songwriter] Clarissa Connelly singing the lead in the first half. It was great to work with her. We hadn’t heard of her before we decided to record with her, it was a recommendation from [Squid’s label] Warp and we thought it was a perfect fit. She’s got a kind of ethereal, incredible range in her voice that goes so deep in the track.”","short":"Squid lets its third album flow out: “It felt like stuff was happening by itself.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cowards/1774397756","playParams":{"id":"1774397756","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PXkyoHGhPBTdumrGSh8Ta"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774397756/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1282030531","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1282030531?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739536551923,"RTCI":0}}},"1774487441":{"id":"1774487441","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774487441?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/corlyx/1073316828","name":"Purple Pain","artistName":"Corlyx","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d6/68/44/d668449e-895a-dddc-91b2-a3310ef13b60/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccbe0","textColor2":"dbeee9","textColor4":"c6ccd9","textColor1":"e2edf1","bgColor":"72429c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/purple-pain/1774487441","playParams":{"id":"1774487441","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5p8ArHFTxDnWWoiaI7DyB8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774487441/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1073316828","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1073316828?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739531159434,"RTCI":0}}},"1774759630":{"id":"1774759630","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774759630?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/drop-nineteens/310783576","name":"1991","artistName":"Drop Nineteens","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/15/da/d1/15dad161-de4d-d0f8-19a3-0a2bc38460b6/49266.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"282828","textColor2":"131313","textColor4":"282828","textColor1":"131313","bgColor":"7d7d7d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/1991/1774759630","playParams":{"id":"1774759630","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48EZT65hRuvn0flycwxmvb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774759630/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"310783576","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/310783576?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739510228916,"RTCI":0}}},"1775235024":{"id":"1775235024","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775235024?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0d/dd/ae/0dddaef6-0506-e3a3-3240-03fa1b53982d/ce528e58-f895-4308-9d1e-0d7e27d54108.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"483936","textColor2":"372722","textColor4":"564a45","textColor1":"26120f","bgColor":"d3d7d3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/49/dc/f2/49dcf2b6-a5ec-b1d6-d331-2496f0cebd32/2336d795-a483-4bbf-bd18-f7226a311265.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbd5d3","textColor2":"faf5f3","textColor4":"dbd5d3","textColor1":"faf5f3","bgColor":"625651","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/biig-piig/1215793857","name":"11:11","artistName":"Biig Piig","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3a/03/66/3a0366b0-51b8-0e4b-b4fa-aaf36a04331a/196872549010.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"372a23","textColor2":"221711","textColor4":"3b2f2b","textColor1":"1c1006","bgColor":"a09094","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When Biig Piig, aka Irish pop dynamo Jess Smyth, listens back to her debut album, she hears a record that reflects how much music is a friend to her. These songs are where Smyth has channeled her emotions over the past few years, where she’s tried to make sense of the turmoil. “Within the chaos, the only thing that really keeps me together is music and being able to make it, and expressing through lyrics and melodies and storytelling—just to be able to talk to something and get my feelings out,” she tells Apple Music. “When I listened back to it, I was like, ‘Fucking hell!’ There was so many moments that I really needed a friend and music was that for me.” <i>11:11</i>, the follow-up to her excellent 2023 mixtape <i>Bubblegum</i>, marks the arrival of a striking new voice in modern music. The music deftly shapeshifts from one song to the next, an exhilarating ride through strobing electronic pop, minimalist, melodic techno, downbeat balladry, atmospheric trip-hop, and synth-disco anthems. One thing, says Smyth, unites them. “There’s a lot of sad bangers on this fucking record!” she hoots. “If you can’t celebrate it, what are you going to do, if you can’t get a little dance on whilst you’re crying?” Dab down your tears and head towards the dance floor: Biig Piig is here to take you through <i>11:11</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“4AM”</b>\n“When I started ‘4AM,’ I knew I wanted it to be the first track because the way it starts is, ‘You could’ve hit me with the bad news first.’ And I was like, ‘I want that to be the opening line because I know that where we’re going with every other track, and the way we’re weaving through this relationship and diving into those things.’ I’m like, ‘Fucking hell, I wish I knew that it was going to hurt, diving in.’ It sparked something in me where I was like, ‘Oh fuck, I really want to delve deeper with it.’”\n\n<b>“Ponytail”</b>\n“This was made with Lloyd MacDonald [aka producer/artist Mac Wetha], who I really like because he’s so integral to everything for as an artist. I wouldn’t have released music without him so I really wanted to make sure that he was on this record. Lloyd is the OG, the first producer that I just ever felt comfortable enough to show music to and he was so encouraging with bringing things out. ‘Ponytail’ is a sad banger. It’s basically about a toxic relationship and trying to navigate how hard it is when you’re so attached to something that’s not good for you but you’re like, ‘Fuck, I just can’t really picture my life without it because it’s become such a pattern now that I need you, even if it’s killing me.’”\n\n<b>“Cynical”</b>\n“For this, I thought about walking through a city, flicking my hair, and being like, ‘Do you know what? I’m going to go to the bar, I’m going to have a good time.’ It’s when you’re a bit over it—all the fights and everything else with this partner, or with this person. You’re romanticizing your life, and then you run into him, and you’re a bit like, ‘Oh.’ It feels a bit more play-by-play of how that works, and the romanticization to get yourself out of that headspace. It’s about that and about city girls, and how everyone chats, and how it just gets around, summing up what it’s like to be a girl in the city, heartbroken.” \n\n<b>“Favourite Girl”</b>\n“‘Favourite Girl’ is a little pop banger. We love her. She’s so fun. I made her with Maverick Sabre and Zach Nahome, who are two longtime collaborators of mine that I love working with. We did ‘Kerosene’ before, the three of us. ‘Favourite Girl’ is tongue-in-cheek, it’s a flirty little track.”\n\n<b>“I Keep Losing Sleep”</b>\n“‘I Keep Losing Sleep’ took ages to get done. We had a loop that went on for about six hours, it was this big jam that we did in Paris with me, Zach, and Mav. ‘I Keep Losing Sleep’ was literally a 30-second clip of that jam and we worked off that little part of it and built it out. Lyrically, for me, it’s that point where you’re pretending you’re fine in the record, you’re like, ‘Everything’s good, I’m good, I’m coming back.’ But you’re not taking care of yourself and you’re like, ‘I keep losing sleep over this thing and it’s not helping.’”\n\n<b>“9-5”</b>\n“We wrote this in Montmartre, Paris in the studio. You can’t not want to make music there. It used to be Philippe Zdar’s studio, and it’s super small, everyone that works there has worked there forever. It’s super, it just brings something else out of you. Writing this, I was away from my partner at the time and I was missing him. It’s a love song, that kind of ‘I’ll go anywhere for you. I’ll do anything for you because I love you.’ That’s a part in the relationship where everything feels more romantic because you’re in love.”\n\n<b>“Decimal”</b>\n“This is a track also made in Montmartre with [producer] Andrew Wells. We were just having fun at this point, in a really good writing space. He was like, ‘What do you want this one to feel like?’ and I said, ‘Do you know what? Let me strut.’ He brought in this whole idea of a dance element that we get with the synths and this expanding bit and it just ended up happening. It’s quite a sexy tune. It’s just about finding someone, meeting them across the room, and being drawn to them, and losing inhibitions, and diving into that desire.”\n\n<b>“Silhouette”</b>\n“‘Silhouette’ is the opposite to ‘9-5.’ They’re like day and night. It’s one we also wrote in Paris at a different point in the year when things weren’t going so well. But it’s also an important for the story of the album, we’re exploring all sides of a relationship. This one is getting to a point where it’s ‘You know that it hurts me, why do you do it?’ and coming face to face with the pain of that and the loss of trust and the self-destructive thing comes into that a lot as well. I feel like a casualty in the fucking records that I made. It’s a heartbreak song.”\n\n<b>“Stay Home”</b>\n“This is about falling for someone, that point where everything’s a bit soft and sweet. Then I was like, ‘Do you know what? My family and my friends have been so important to me through everything and they’re really what represents love to me, there’s no chance I’m making my first record and not having them on it.’ I was like, ‘Let’s do it, let’s go to the pub and we’ll get everyone down with some drinks, and we’ll do a recording of the chorus.’ So we did that, which is so cute, so messy but so cute. Through relationships, through everything, through different points in your life, who do you look to as real love? That’s family and friends for me.”\n\n<b>“One Way Ticket”</b>\n“This is a sad one, about someone that I lost in my life. So many things are happening now and, [in] the last couple of years have been happening—and it’s sad that he’s not here to see them. He’s someone that I wish I could share that with and so this is a love letter to him a little bit, just to let him know what’s going on, and to be like, ‘Wow, you always said this would happen and now you’re not here to see it, but you’re here.’”\n\n<b>“Brighter Day”</b>\n“‘Brighter Day’ is the overarching moment where you look back on everything that’s happened, and you go, ‘Fucking hell, it’s mad!’—and watching someone go and accepting that that’s what’s happened and where you are in your life.

It was only when starting work on what would become third album, <i>Open Wide</i>, that singer and guitarist Eli Hewson, bassist Robert Keating, guitarist Josh Jenkinson, and drummer Ryan McMahon cleared the schedules and returned to the Dublin rehearsal space they first began playing together in as teenagers, jamming ideas and writing music together with no external pressures or looming deadlines. “It was the first time we’ve been able to do that in years,” Jenkinson tells Apple Music. “As soon as the second album was finished, we were already writing music,” adds Keating. “From the earliest days, we knew that we were going to try and do something a bit different for this one.”\n\nThe group took their freewheeling rehearsal space demos to Florence + the Machine/Harry Styles producer Tom Hull, aka Kid Harpoon, who helped fashion not only Inhaler’s most sonically ambitious record to date (check the title track’s spacious beatscapes or “X-Ray”’s sci-fi Western chop-ups), but one that also boasts some of the most joyously melodic songs of their career. The unashamedly pop-facing burst of “A Question of You” or “Even Though”’s Springsteenian rush display the confidence of a group who know they can now try their hand at whatever takes their fancy. “I think a lot of the confidence on this album was actually just trusting our gut,” says Hewson. “That has influenced every decision. Maybe in the past we overthought a little bit too much. On this one, it was just like, ‘Does it sound good? Do you need to overthink that lyric? Is that drum part good? Should we just leave it as it is?’” Here, Hewson and the band talk us through <i>Open Wide</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Eddie in the Darkness”</b>\nEli Hewson: “With our last two albums we’ve opened with a big massive guitar chord or a keyboard riff, and so choosing this as the first track was flipping that on its head. Also, this was one of the first songs that we were all super excited about, so it felt really natural to open with it.”\nRyan McMahon: “Someone said to us that it sounds like they’re walking in on us playing in a room together, so it felt like a nice nod to us being back playing together in a room for the first time since we were 17 with no gigs on the horizon or anything like that.”\n\n<b>“Billy (Yeah Yeah Yeah)”</b>\nEH: “It’s weird, we had this first-name thing on this album that kept happening on the demos. It was a complete accident. Billy, Eddie…there was one called ‘James’ that got cut. A lot of these songs are like conversations with people that you’re witnessing, which was a different approach to the lyrics than on the first two albums, which felt more personal and introspective. I guess I learned that from Bruce Springsteen, who’s a writer I really appreciate. He jokes about it, he writes all these songs about working in a steel mill but he’s never worked a day in his life!”\n\n<b>“Your House”</b>\nEH: “We struggled with the instrumentation on ‘Your House’ for a while but, once we got that, it all just clicked. We stripped a bunch of stuff out and put that synth in and we were like, ‘OK, this is a hit!’”\nRM: “We were worried that it sounded a bit too much like ELO for ages but once Tom [Hull, producer] got his hands on it, it just worked.”\n\n<b>“A Question of You”</b>\nRM: “It’s quite in-your-face pop that one, which we were a bit nervous about initially. But as time went on and we played it and we listened to it more and more, we just thought, ‘Fuck all that, it’s a good song!’ We’re not scared to have that ambition. We might have reservations here and there about certain things, but we’re not worried to use joy as a defiant thing in our music.”\n\n<b>“Even Though”</b>\nEH: “There’s quite a broad scope sonically and stylistically on the album. There’s a lot of different things going on, but there’s a certain sound and groove that runs through all the songs, which you can really hear on ‘Even Though.’ I’m really happy about how it all came together. This song is a little bit more personal, it was from direct experience. That was a bit of an outlier for me, lyrically.”\n\n<b>“Again”</b>\nEH: “I really found a new appreciation for writing lyrics on this album. On the first album, it was a bit like, ‘Oh shit, I’ve got to write lyrics now…’ On the second one, I started to get more into it, and on this one, I really felt like I was at a place where I was having fun with it. That allowed me to be a bit more like, ‘Let’s write about a character, let’s set the scene…’ ‘Again’ felt like you were writing it on somebody’s shoulder, kind of peering around.”\n\n<b>“Open Wide”</b>\nRM: “This was a bit of a happy surprise. It was from a demo that we made in like 2021. We all really loved the sound of the demo. It kept grabbing our attention and we kept saying, ‘OK, we’ll come round to that eventually…’”\nEH: “It was like a house track on the demo. Who knows where it came from? I wasn’t feeling that it would go on this album because it felt so sonically different, but now it’s one of my favorite ones. I’m really proud of it.”\n\n<b>“All I Got Is You”</b>\nEH: “This one was the last piece of the puzzle. We wrote it just after the second album, but it was one of the last songs we recorded for this record. It’s our nod to The Smiths and that ’80s world. We don’t often get to represent that in our music, so it’s a nice thing to do. Plus, it’s really fun to play.”\nRobert Keating: “I remember ages ago thinking that it sounded a bit like a Harry Styles song—then we ended up working with Harry Styles’ producer on it!”\n\n<b>“Still Young”</b>\nRobert Keating: “‘Still Young’ feels like the dark horse on the album. Sometimes when you’re writing songs, you can overlook the simple songs. I don’t mean simple in a bad way, but like there’s no bells or whistles on it—it’s just a great song. Once we got a choir on it and did one or two things, it felt so big. It was always doing its job, so we really didn’t have to work too much on it.” \n\n<b>“The Charms”</b>\nRK: “There’s almost a country undertone to that song. I guess in the storytelling element to it, the chorus sounds like you can imagine a guy singing it in a bar. It’s kind of poppy, but it’s also not, if that makes sense.”\n\n<b>“X-Ray”</b>\nRK: “On the demo it sounded quite a lot like The Cure. We kept a lot of the stuff that we loved about the demo in. There’s a keyboard that stayed and the chorus was this really cool middle eight on the early demo. It was kind of like Frankenstein. We had to chop and stitch stuff together and see what worked. It feels quite experimental within the record. With all the recording techniques that we used for the album, this one feels more on experimental side.”\n\n<b>“Concrete”</b>\nEH: “It definitely goes to a darker level, ‘Concrete.’ We’ll always write love songs. I think almost every song is a love song in some kind of weird, obscure way. We were thinking about the idea of something that you walk into willingly knowing that it’s going to hurt you in the end. The idea that, if you love something, you’re putting yourself out there. You’re basically asking to be hurt. You’re opening yourself up to that danger. I think that’s a realistic picture of love. It’s not all daisies and flowery dresses.”\n\n<b>“Little Things”</b>\nJosh Jenkinson: “‘Little Things’ is the sort of song we would have normally opened an album with which is exactly why we put it at the end.”\nEH: “It’s a big strong point to leave it on. We didn’t want to wimp out at the end of the record. It was interesting to do what we would do at the beginning of our old albums at the end of this one. I love how it feels at the end. I really do.”","short":"Inhaler on their bold third album: “We knew we’d try something

Album","standard":"It’s fitting that The Lumineers would release a new album on Valentine’s Day 2025. The longtime roots-pop favorites have no shortage of heartstring-tugging love and heartbreak songs in their catalog, adding more with this fifth studio album and follow-up to 2022’s <i>Brightside</i>. As they did with that record, The Lumineers tapped David Baron and Simone Felice to co-produce <i>Automatic</i>, with the band notching their first co-production credit while recording the album at Woodstock, New York’s Utopia Studios over the course of a month.\n\nWhere earlier Lumineers records focused more squarely on relationships and heartbreak, <i>Automatic</i> zooms out to take stock of the collateral damage wrought by the ills of the day, like persistent anxiety on the deceptively warm and loping “Ativan” and the “black sedan of depression” referenced on the urgent and bracing opening track, “Same Old Song.” “Better Day” feels like a plainly rendered thesis statement, as singer/guitarist Wesley Schultz offers a laundry list of modern problems, like “senators [making] insider trades” and protests marred by “rubber bullets, pepper spray.” Other highlights on the album include “Plasticine,” on which Schultz subtly channels a grungier side of his vocal while lamenting artistic phoniness, and the aching “Keys on the Table,” which grapples with a loss of faith in oneself. And as for that canon of songs of love and love lost, “Asshole” is a lovely if biting addition, as Schultz squares up against his own foibles while acknowledging we all have our own dark shadows.","short":"The band’s fifth album zooms out to take stock of modern problems."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/automatic/1779371649","playParams":{"id":"1779371649","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5WMQEzS5EBCPU5IYKSY7BM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779371649/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"350720227","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/350720227?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739535919623,"RTCI":0}}},"1779816357":{"id":"1779816357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779816357?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gnonnas-pedro-and-his-dadjes-band/1361053336","name":"Roi De L'Agbadja Moderne (1974-1983) [Analog Africa No.40]","artistName":"Gnonnas Pedro and His Dadjes Band","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/41/00/95/4100953e-98e8-fc1d-32e7-cf0a50ae3c60/108099.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"0c210b","textColor2":"050301","textColor4":"0a220b","textColor1":"080101","bgColor":"1d9f35","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/roi-de-lagbadja-moderne-1974-1983-analog-africa-no-40/1779816357","playParams":{"id":"1779816357","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/28oL8UxM8yL0sIGtHEi7HK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779816357/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1361053336","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1361053336?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1738962354984,"RTCI":0}}},"1780113515":{"id":"1780113515","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780113515?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a7/54/e8/a754e874-fc63-a0c6-08e5-795179a1f8d7/a4ff12a2-a5f2-4139-b235-8fd49ddd366b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f3e4a","textColor2":"182734","textColor4":"3e4a54","textColor1":"051728","bgColor":"d6d7d2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mallrat/1059623730","name":"Light hit my face like a straight right","artistName":"Mallrat","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/49/5b/d6/495bd65b-c29b-de76-8c0f-15c7a99cd74c/067003161459.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"b9c9b9","textColor2":"aed273","textColor4":"8eaf64","textColor1":"e3f3dd","bgColor":"0e2128","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"While searching for a title for her second album, Mallrat kept coming back to a line in the song “Pavement”: “light hit my face like a straight right.” “I chose it because I noticed there were a lot of lyrics about light in the album, or using light as a metaphor or simile,” the Brisbane artist born Grace Shaw tells Apple Music about the project, which was recorded largely between Melbourne and Los Angeles. “So I thought it would make sense to have something related to that as the title. And it was my favorite lyric, because in boxing, a straight right is like a power punch. So,” she laughs, “<i>Light hit my face like a straight right</i> is just honestly really clever.” \n\nGiven the album’s textured, minimalist electronic approach, it’s no surprise she lists Buddy Ross (with whom she worked on “Pavement”) as a production influence. Shaw also singles out SOPHIE and Hudson Mohawke, praising their minimal yet colorful and bold sounds, characteristics that resonate through songs such as “Hocus Pocus” and “Hideaway.” Perhaps less predictable is the influence of British shoegazers my bloody valentine on the doom rock of “The Worst Thing I Would Ever Do”; also surprising is the impact of country artists from the ’60s and ’70s, with Shaw pointing to Glen Campbell’s “Wichita Lineman” as a favorite. “The things about that style of music I try to emulate are the warmth and beautiful lyrics,” she explains. “Especially all the warm textures.” Here, Shaw takes Apple Music through <i>Light hit my face like a straight right</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“My Darling, My Angel”</b>\n“It’s about feeling love, but not necessarily for other people. In the last section of the song, the lyrics are, ‘Felt that I was fleshless/Anchored by my necklace/Now my eyes are sparkling/Thinking ’bout my darling.’ To me, the song is more about feeling alive and like a zest for life.”\n\n<b>“Pavement”</b>\n“I wrote the first seed of the idea when I was walking home in the rain with my friends. The line ‘Oh, the light on the rain, on the pavement’ was sitting in my phone for a little bit. I wrote the verses and the hum melody with Buddy Ross, and then I left certain sections blank because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I kept hearing this Cub Sport lyric [from the song ‘Beg U’] in that pre-chorus section. They’re my best friends, so I got the a cappella and I arranged it. Then I also brought in this DJ Zirk sample [‘Born 2 Lose’] as the other hook, and it worked so perfectly.”\n\n<b>“Something for Somebody”</b>\n“This is my one of my proudest songs, from a lyrical perspective especially. I wrote most of the song on the first day in the studio, and I kept rewriting it because I had this idea and I wanted to execute it as well as possible. The song is about pretending to have moved on, in quite a not nice and almost creepy way. I was really excited to disguise that in such pretty melodies. If you didn’t listen to the words you’d be like, ‘Oh, this is a lovely song.’ Listening to the lyrics you’re like, ‘She needs to seek fucking help.’”\n\n<b>“Virtue”</b>\n“Casey MQ works on this song, and also the interludes ‘Love Songs / Heart Strings’ and ‘The Light Streams in and Hits My Face.’ He showed me this Finnish a cappella group, Rajaton, and I was like, ‘Oh my God. I would love to sample this.’ And he goes, ‘I already kind of did, let’s rework it.’ The lines ‘Sweet is the touch of your newborn wings/We fly in circles and play with the sun,’ that’s from the Rajaton song ‘Butterfly.’ It’s from the perspective of a butterfly. And butterflies only live a day or two. So all of the lyrics of that song follow a butterfly being born, or emerging from a chrysalis throughout the day, then what happens as night begins.”\n\n<b>“Defibrillator”</b>\n“‘Defibrillator’ is my favorite word, and I have been wanting to use it in a song for the longest time. I started this one with Lonelyspeck, a producer from Adelaide. The first bit that really made sense was, ‘Oh defibrillator/Had to try to hate ya,’ and I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll build [on that].’ It all started because I wanted to use the word ‘defibrillator.’”\n\n<b>“The Light Streams in and Hits My Face”</b>\n“Casey and I composed this song so that it would perfectly flow in to ‘Hocus Pocus.’ It’s exactly half the BPM of ‘Hocus Pocus,’ and it’s in the same key. Then the last lyric of this song sets up the first lyric of ‘Hocus Pocus.’ It’s designed to introduce it.”\n\n<b>“Hocus Pocus” (with Kito)</b>\n“This song changed a lot from the day I started it. It was originally this really bouncy thing, like bouncy piano chords. I remember writing the lyric ‘I can’t help but notice/You’ve been falling for hocus pocus’ and laughing out loud, and then saying to Leroy [Clampitt, co-producer], ‘I’ve just written this lyric and it’s so silly, I wonder if I should change it.’ He laughed and said, ‘No, it’s good, because karaoke songs have silly lyrics.’ So maybe this will be a karaoke song one day. I kept working on it with Kito, and then brought it back to Australia and worked on it more with Styalz [Fuego]. It was just a case of slowly chipping away at it.”\n\n<b>“Hideaway”</b>\n“I started this with Japanese Wallpaper, who is one of my best friends. I love Two Shell, they make really fast, bright dance music. I wanted to make something that was in a similar world and at a similar pace. It’s about having a massive crush on someone.”\n\n<b>“Love Songs / Heart Strings”</b>\n“This samples ‘The Light Streams in and Hits My Face.’ And also, this ties together ‘Hideaway’ and ‘Ray of Light.’ So it starts at the same BPM as ‘Hideaway,’ then, when the kind of siren sounds happen at the end, the BPM slows down to be the same BPM as ‘Ray of Light.’ It’s another case of wanting to make an interlude and tie in some ideas that I think are interesting.”\n\n<b>“Ray of Light”</b>\n“My favorite lyric in this song is in the second verse: ‘Look outside, the day begins/A golden orb above me spins/A pair of wings catch in the silk/Invisible threads hold her still.’ I really like it, because a golden orb sounds like the sun, and it is about the sun, but I was thinking about a golden orb spider, which is a really common spider in Queensland. I was imagining a butterfly or a moth getting stuck in the web, and really feeling like that butterfly or moth. [With the line] ‘I’m a moth and there’s a glow around you, babe,’ it’s just feeling so stuck or enchanted by a situation and not sure how to possibly unstick yourself.”\n\n<b>“The Worst Thing I Would Ever Do”</b>\n“Part of the reason this song exists is because I’d never properly listened to my bloody valentine. But then when Buddy Ross and I were working on ‘Pavement,’ he showed me the <i>Loveless</i> album and I was like, ‘Oh, this is so cool.’ So that’s one of the things that kind of made this song happen. To me, this song feels like the end of the world. Like in a movie or something. It’s like the world is about to end, and they’re either gonna save it or they’re not, but they’re just accepting that it’s out of their hands.”\n\n<b>“Horses”</b>\n“The main reason I wanted it to be the end of the album is because at the end you hear Annika [Schmarsel], who I made the song with, take her foot off the pedal of the piano. And because you can hear that pedal sound, that’s what made it feel like the end.”","short":"The Brisbane artist looks to the light on her buoyant second

Album","standard":"BLOND:ISH’s <i>Never Walk Alone</i> is Vivie-ann Bakos’ first full-length as a solo artist since her former partner, Anstascia D’Elene Corniere, left the project in 2019. More than a change in personnel, it’s a shift in sound and perspective from their 2015 debut album, <i>Welcome to the Present</i>. Whereas BLOND:ISH’s early music embodied the pulsating darkness of after-hours parties, Bakos now finds inspiration in the golden hour to craft house music that shines among sunsets, open spaces, and moments of connection. Guided by BLOND:ISH’s belief that everything is energy, <i>Never Walk Alone</i> is built on warmth and a kind of quiet intention.\n\nIts title track, meant to serve as a friend in times of anxiety and loneliness, is as much a rallying cry as it is a hand on the shoulder, with a chorus that loops like a mantra: “Can’t do without you/We will never walk alone.” Pep talks continue with “Self Love,” an invitation to rediscover one’s own worth, and “Different Way,” which finds optimism in life’s unique journeys. “Higher” is physically and emotionally stirring, pairing its lone refrain (“You take me higher, baby”) with sky-scraping strings and perforating drums. Elsewhere, Afro-house rhythms set the stage for deeper, more intimate moments like “Kimbe” and “How Does It Feel,” which foster connection through romance. “We Watch” is the LP’s heaviest moment, a gritty synthline underscoring its need for introspection: “You watch everything/You watch idly/Do you want it to change?” It’s the kind of tough love that reminds you that in hard times, sometimes the best friend you can have is yourself.","short":"The first full-length as a solo project features house music built on warmth."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-walk-alone/1781991709","playParams":{"id":"1781991709","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5B6cE705BTRvviiO1p4m0o"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781991709/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"394776491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/394776491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739548258569,"RTCI":0}}},"1782183231":{"id":"1782183231","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782183231?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fa/33/87/fa338741-86cb-3629-552f-b472447a055f/Job5ab89973-8106-4693-aff1-3ab57a6efece-182016991-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356008535_1995966645-Time1734563734752.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fcc0ac"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5b150f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"edb7b7","textColor2":"fcc0ac","textColor4":"f09a8a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5b150f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6a/de/f5/6adef50e-1f38-8e0f-cdbd-a5ff3228ad2c/Job6991e2bf-e8c6-4a3c-a338-d4937bfa2e6c-182016992-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356008536_1995966646-Time1734566111166.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"e6b79a","textColor2":"fbe294","textColor4":"ecb577","textColor1":"f4e5c0","bgColor":"af0000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/12/a8/88/12a888ab-051b-6411-a176-423db227b85f/aa2b435b-aee4-494b-aa6c-679f4dc8771f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e3cecc","textColor2":"f3eaea","textColor4":"dec6c4","textColor1":"f9f4f4","bgColor":"8b352e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/ca/cb/48cacbc7-01f4-0537-b91d-0bdf5ef0c274/83d22cce-05ed-4cc8-a481-d1807fecc83f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cc493a","textColor2":"f73120","textColor4":"cd2b1d","textColor1":"f65744","bgColor":"271111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-war-and-treaty/951165936","name":"Plus One","artistName":"The War And Treaty","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9c/3c/17/9c3c17ad-c8ee-ac77-213b-0e5bf3dd8983/24UM1IM15654.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e9bebc","textColor2":"fbe8af","textColor4":"ecbe8f","textColor1":"f7e7e7","bgColor":"b21711","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A War and Treaty record is more than just an assortment of songs—it’s a celebration of the human voice, with husband-and-wife duo Michael and Tanya Trotter serving up a master class in vocal pyrotechnics on each track. This fourth studio album from the pair is no different, spanning 18 tracks full of meticulously crafted harmonies and playful dynamism. It’s all anchored by Michael Trotter Jr.’s larger-than-life production direction (Jesse Frasure, John Shanks, and Jonathan Singleton lend hands here, too), which blends elements of country, gospel, rock, and blues to encompass the duo’s diverse range of influences.\n\n<i>Plus One</i>, which The War and Treaty recorded at beloved Muscle Shoals institution FAME Studios, opens with the positively buoyant “Love Like Whiskey,” a co-write with Jesse Frasure and Miranda Lambert that makes ample use of a horn section, no doubt inspired by the historic studio setting. “Can I Get an Amen” is modern Southern gothic gospel at its finest, not to mention a playful showcase for the pair’s sonic quirks, as banjo rolls brush up against soulful synth. “Teardrops in the Rain” is a sweeping ballad that sounds timeless on first listen, while “Mr. Fun,” splits the difference between the funky showmanship of James Brown and the empowered pop rock of Tina Turner. Bluegrass guitar virtuoso Billy Strings is the record’s lone guest, as he joins the Trotters on “Drink from Me,” a minor-chord barn burner with some structural surprises up its sleeve.","short":"Michael and Tanya Trotter expertly craft modern Southern gothic

Album and Interview","standard":"“It’s a dream come true,” NATTI NATASHA tells Apple Music about her new album, produced by bachata icon Romeo Santos. “When Aventura came out, I was in Santiago, in the Dominican Republic, going to school when this whole movement happened. It was just daily in my life; it was cultura.” Though <i>Natti Natasha en Amargue</i> benefits greatly from their respective histories with the genre, the two Dominican superstars found success together before, joining forces in 2019 for a “La Mejor Versión De Mi” remix that stormed the charts globally.\n\nWritten by Santos with NATASHA in mind, these 10 original songs expand not only on that hit collaboration, but also upon the handful of bachata tracks found on her earlier albums, namely “Quién Sabe” and “Cuento Breve.” Though much of the album was made during the pandemic years—overlapping her pregnancy and her partner Raphy Pina’s incarceration—it arrives at a time of increased enthusiasm for the genre, with artists both from and beyond the island and its NYC diaspora actively exploring the sound. As such, this sincere and authentic effort from someone with genuine musical and cultural connections to it stands out in the best way.\n\nThose who know NATASHA primarily from her reggaetón smashes may feel compelled to shift preexisting perceptions of her, while dedicated fans of both her and Santos’ work will find much to enjoy and celebrate. “There's so much faith around it,” she says. “I’m doing something for my roots, for my culture, for Dominicans, for Latinos.” Read on to learn about some of NATTI NATASHA’s favorite songs from <i>Natti Natasha en Amargue</i>—in her own words.\n\n<b>“Desde Hoy”</b>\n“It’s the one that started everything. It’s so amazingly powerful. Reinventing yourself, reinventing your universe, reinventing your surroundings—this is what this album means. It cannot get more raw than this. I cannot go more to my roots than this. I feel like everybody, at a certain point in their lives, want to reinvent themselves. It’s not easy to do in a day; it’s a process. And the music, insane. It never stops. It’s very passionate.”\n\n<b>“Tu Loca”</b>\n“We’ve never heard a woman [in bachata] from this perspective. At the end of the day, nobody’s perfect, and we all have our insecurities. It’s coming from a place where you’re like, ‘I love you. Sometimes I feel a little bit iffy when a girl gets in your face.’ I’m not going to talk for everybody, but I feel like we’ve all had that little moment in our lives. It definitely is one of my favorite songs.”\n\n<b>“Quiéreme Menos”</b>\n“It’s so personal to me, on another level. Sometimes I can’t even talk about it that much. When you know you love someone, you accept each other for what you are. Then this person leaves, right? I kept working. My baby was my biggest inspiration ever. It’s about how everything was running so smooth and then, shabam—and then all you have is love to really keep this relationship alive. Two-and-a-half years is hard. And it’s like, I am going to wait for this person. I’m going to love this person regardless, because I know that what God has for us is way bigger than anything else. We actually did the video when [Pina] came out, which was insane too. When I was recording this song, four years ago, I didn’t know that it was going to mean so much now.”\n\n<b>“Escasez de Besos”</b>\n“[Romeo] was there in every single line that I recorded, every single line. There’s no AC in the studio, he stays. He’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to leave?’ I’m like, ‘No, I am staying there.’ You don’t get Romeo twice in your life, with the vibe in the studio. I remember with “Escasez de Besos,” he wanted each word to be said in a certain way. His vocals are to die for, honestly. Who doesn’t love a Romeo vocal on their song? It’s a privilege for me. It is definitely one of the strongest songs.”\n\n<b>“Ya No Comparto” (feat. Ozuna)</b>\n“It’s obvious that we have great chemistry—everybody knows that. We also have a very good relationship. I’m here with my huge belly listening to the demo of the song and the vocals that I had already recorded for it. We just started imagining [Ozuna’s] voice there. He got there the same night, in Miami. I was so grateful being in this room with no AC, eating Chinese food, pregnant, just hanging with the guys. We were able to sit down and enjoy what we were doing and just enjoy the presence of everyone. He sounds so good in bachata—his vocals, the air, the energy, everything.”\n\n<b>“Pinocchio”</b>\n“It’s about all these lies and how we’re attracted to the illusion of the person that we’re dating. You discover the person’s true intention. Sometimes we fall in love, in life, with the illusion of things, and to me, this song represents that. When we were in the studio, we all came to the same conclusion. I think everyone has gone through that in life, not only in love, but in general. But it goes either way. For men, they go through that with women. When I do the songs, I don’t only go for one side of the story. There’s men that are beautiful, that have this great heart that go through these heartbreaks.”\n","short":"A bachata dream come true, with Romeo Santos in tow."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/natti-natasha-en-amargue/1786010778","playParams":{"id":"1786010778","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JMAAMlcZEg2wOl7b0fRA9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786010778/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1373416931","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1373416931?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739510219046,"RTCI":0}}},"1786046760":{"id":"1786046760","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786046760?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f9/00/ab/f900ab65-a974-eeba-2c8d-7a2a8b651ae5/Joba3bd8275-a655-4adf-bce4-1ca78eff157b-185074299-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362051913_2042122770-Time1738626955201.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","1f1f20"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"fcfcfc"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"404040","textColor2":"1f1f20","textColor4":"4a4a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fcfcfc","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8a/76/58/8a7658e8-4126-4fcf-2424-557b39972c2c/6e142c49-c7c5-4128-99e2-8f41faed9abc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5a89d","textColor2":"d9ad96","textColor4":"b28f7d","textColor1":"ddccbf","bgColor":"171717","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0e/1f/41/0e1f41b6-35f5-2abc-8311-d5d1f8d78f02/Job45458920-1754-493a-8183-20134ca4fd98-185074298-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362051914_2042122771-Time1738625546158.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","1d1d1f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"fcfcfc"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3d3d3d","textColor2":"1d1d1f","textColor4":"4a4a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fcfcfc","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/98/af/48/98af4892-76f2-6424-0905-548a07db422d/d65d006a-b995-464f-ba7a-2381b3b4d42e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"111112","textColor4":"343434","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"bfbfbf","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nessa-barrett/1525607372","name":"AFTERCARE DELUXE","artistName":"Nessa Barrett","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f9/de/8f/f9de8f88-be31-96da-19e9-f559a2c260c1/093624834113.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3d3e","textColor2":"201f22","textColor4":"4c4c4d","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"fdfdfd","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Since debuting in 2020, Nessa Barrett has crafted evocative and deeply personal songs about topics like mental illness, trauma, and the struggles of young womanhood, drawing listeners in with her catchy hooks and mesmerizing, fragile timbre. The alt-pop artist wrote her first album, 2022’s <i>young forever</i>, during what she called the worst year of her life. But as Barrett sifted through her recent experiences to inspire her follow-up, she realized she wasn’t sad anymore. This epiphany spurred a new creative approach, one in which she could channel her energy into creating a character instead of resurfacing her own pain.\n\nOn <i>AFTERCARE</i>, Barrett immerses herself in dark, moody soundscapes as she transforms into an empowered woman who owns her sexuality while remaining vulnerable. It opens with the hazy title track, where the question “You love the chase, but will you stay when it ends?” sets the tone for an exploration of love, sex, and the often messy aftermath. Barrett purrs her carnal desires on the provocative “PORNSTAR,” and makes that physicality feel as essential as oxygen on the howling “HEARTBEAT.” On the cinematic ballad “RUSSIAN ROULETTE” she bets it all on love, and on the haunting “EDWARD SCISSORHANDS” she confronts the fallout: “Whenever you touch me/You cut me to pieces.” But as defiant closing tracks “STAY ALIVE” and “DIRTY LITTLE SECRET” show, Barrett emerges stronger and wiser—and ready to dive in all over again.","short":"Six new tracks widen the emotional range of the alt-pop singer’s 2024 LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aftercare-deluxe/1786046760","playParams":{"id":"1786046760","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786046760/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1525607372","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1525607372?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739529517810,"RTCI":0}}},"1786106740":{"id":"1786106740","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786106740?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kate-hudson/211294243","name":"Glorious (Deluxe)","artistName":"Kate Hudson","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6c/f9/08/6cf90855-3abc-a40f-3b4f-b586f988b30c/00198704295690_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"9babbd","textColor2":"92c4e1","textColor4":"82a7be","textColor1":"b0c9e0","bgColor":"463432","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/glorious-deluxe/1786106740","playParams":{"id":"1786106740","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1pFxKOMZIbmW8azHGKTd4D"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786106740/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"211294243","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/211294243?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739529172070,"RTCI":0}}},"1786254303":{"id":"1786254303","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786254303?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/81/82/b68182e9-16a7-789f-2dd8-81bf33d29693/91dc70a9-01d5-4cf6-923d-e9968471232e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3bfc7","textColor2":"f1cbc2","textColor4":"c7a9a2","textColor1":"ebe6f0","bgColor":"202121","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyga/268893121","name":"NSFW","artistName":"Tyga","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/de/10/13/de1013e8-36d0-fc2d-8ea3-0564fae99611/197342893725_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8fa2b1","textColor2":"bdc1cb","textColor4":"989da5","textColor1":"b1c7d9","bgColor":"070c0f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"There are a few recurring themes on Tyga’s <i>NSFW</i>, the MC’s first solo release since 2019’s <i>Legendary</i>, and none of them inherently scream “not safe for work.” In fact, one could be made to believe that this robust collection of tales about balling harder than everyone you know, partying exclusively in the company of beautiful women, and the myriad ways that fast money is best spent is just what a quiet-quitter needs to turn their productivity up.

He’s got great guests here (Big Sean and Flo Milli on “Dumb,” Lil Wayne on “Pop It Off,” and a scene-stealing Shenseea on “Magnetic”), and even a really cool Cher sample on “Found Someone.” But it’s the Tyga show through and through, and if you’re as plugged in as he hopes you are, you ain’t making it to work in the morning.","short":"This is actually perfectly safe for work, if your job is being rich and partying."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nsfw/1786254303","playParams":{"id":"1786254303","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0HFmXICO7WgVoqLAXc7Rhw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786254303/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"268893121","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/268893121?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739510282943,"RTCI":0}}},"1786391116":{"id":"1786391116","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786391116?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Contemporary Singer/Songwriter","Music","Singer/Songwriter","African"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/95/a9/be95a95f-fd0e-522d-9e4c-e573cafcec0e/793f51f7-2dad-49fe-b836-ce11ecc50243.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a6adaf","textColor2":"cab6a3","textColor4":"a39484","textColor1":"cfd5d8","bgColor":"050b0a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=468292117-7420831","name":"Our Calling","artistName":"Piers Faccini & Ballaké Sissoko","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c6/4a/bd/c64abde9-42c3-26db-f7be-f86c39b37a4f/3663729358837_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"353f55","textColor2":"141c35","textColor4":"43495d","textColor1":"020f2b","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Twenty years of slow-burn collaboration results in a hauntingly beautiful listen."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/our-calling/1786391116","playParams":{"id":"1786391116","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ymXM0CpKbSs7vQCpp5ATB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786391116/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"468292117","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/468292117?l=en-US"},{"id":"7420831","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/7420831?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739528663334,"RTCI":0}}},"1786427369":{"id":"1786427369","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786427369?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-11","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/53/a8/70/53a870c0-f2f5-c28a-22a0-a811f4c0efbe/6fbe54e5-206e-4194-97a4-c0e3c2830186.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfbfbf","textColor2":"eeeeee","textColor4":"bfbfbf","textColor1":"eeeeee","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kelela/549186342","name":"In The Blue Light","artistName":"Kelela","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/53/a5/1f/53a51fc0-5165-9e34-d4f2-5280a52d0ba3/5056818801525.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b1a9a6","textColor2":"cbc4c0","textColor4":"a6a09d","textColor1":"d9cfcb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Live Album","standard":"As a college student in the early 2000s, Kelela Mizanekristos used to rent a car and make the four-hour drive from D.C. to see Amel Larrieux sing at the Blue Note Jazz Club in NYC’s West Village. She’d tape the set on her recorder, then study it on the drive home. Two decades later, in May 2024, she told the story from the iconic venue’s stage, where she and her band performed unplugged selections from her catalog. Since her debut mixtape, 2013’s <i>Cut 4 Me</i>, Kelela has stood at the vanguard of the intersection between R&B and forward-thinking electronic music. But on <i>In the Blue Light</i>, captured during her Blue Note showcase, she translates futuristic cuts like “Bankhead” and “Take Me Apart” into timeless-sounding jazz and neo-soul numbers. Alongside tracks from <i>Cut 4 Me</i>, 2015’s <i>Hallucinogen</i> EP, and her two studio albums (2017’s <i>Take Me Apart</i> and 2022’s <i>Raven</i>), she throws a curveball—an ethereal cover of Joni Mitchell’s “Furry Sings the Blues.”","short":"The avant-garde R&B artist pares back her work in an intimate live

Mini Album","standard":"Since their debut in 2021, K-pop group IVE has been known for their robust choruses, gratifying harmonies, and messages of self-love. <i>IVE EMPATHY</i>, the fourth-generation girl group’s third mini-album after 2023’s <i>I’ve Mine</i> and 2024’s <i>IVE SWITCH</i>, continues the sextet’s pursuit of those qualities. \n\nThe album takes its title as a broad theme, exploring the quality of “empathy” (defined here as emotional connection) across six pop tracks. In “REBEL HEART,” the group offers a sense of comfort and celebratory restlessness. Member Wonyoung contributed to the writing of the album’s second lead single, “ATTITUDE,” which doubles down on <i>IVE EMPATHY</i>’s theme of defiant self-love: “No matter what anyone says/Honestly, I like me.” Suzanne Vega is also credited on the track, as it samples the addictive hook originally from 1981’s “Tom’s Diner.”\n\nMetaphors abound: “FLU” boldly compares a toxic attraction to a virus, while “TKO,” a hip-hop-infused track, leans into boxing (“Float like a butterfly sting like a bee,” “’Cause I’m a TKO”) to boast about the members’ knockout power. “Thank U” (which includes

Album","standard":"As multifaceted a star as Myke Towers grew to become, his day-ones remember him as a hard-hitting trapero. To be clear, that streetwise edge never quite left his music as he pivoted to reggaetón and, eventually, global pop, all evident on his 2024 album <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>. Yet this aspect of his artistry—the rugged rapper who helped to define a pivotal wave in Latin music—remains so integral to his approach that he’s essentially begun an entire series devoted to this veritable beast mode. A direct successor to 2021’s <i>LYKE MIKE</i>, the similarly rap-centric <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> (note the extra vowel) leaves no doubt of the Puerto Rican star’s enduring hip-hop bona fides.\n\nTowers’ choice of guests speaks strongly to his roots, tapping generational peers like Dowba Montana and Miky Woodz to spit proudly alongside him. Eladio Carrión helps open the proceedings on “QUÉ QUIERES DE MI?”, a joint show of force from two artists with parallel and noteworthy ascents. From there, Neutro Shorty and Jon Z show a genuine love for the format on “NUNCA ME QUEJÉ” and “TRAP,” respectively. While some of these collabs are, in effect, reunions, exceptions exist, like the Akapellah team-up “MI BRILLO.”\n\nThough the temptation to flood <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> with features must have been tempting, Towers largely spends these 23 tracks on his own, showcasing a skill set he honed in the underground before earning mainstream accolades. He commands the pulpit on the gospel-tinged “REVERENDO” and feeds the streets on the decidedly darker “TÍTERES.” With producers like Murda Beatz and Fly Twilightzone in his proverbial corner, the beats surrounding these exquisite bars never feel staid, as cuts like the drill-adjacent “440” and the Michigan-nodding “YO ESTARÉ” expand his sonic range.","short":"A welcome return to trap roots

Album","standard":"Even in the throes of heartbreak, ROLE MODEL’s Tucker Pillsbury can’t help but write golden, luminous hooks. On his sophomore full-length, <i>Kansas Anymore</i>, he sings of love, sometimes, but mostly of love lost. He’s a broken spirit, looking for a way forward, and this angst is perfectly opposed by the sugary sweet deliveries he sprinkles throughout the project.\n\nTake opener “Writing’s on the Wall,” which finds Pillsbury nursing his wounds, unable to explain to his father that his feelings are different from the way his old man felt. “Dad’s on the phone and he’s lecturing me/’Bout a girl that he met when he was 19,” he sings a cappella, before pulsing drums and crunching acoustic guitar chords transport the singer to the rolling hills of Laurel Canyon circa 1970.\n\nOn “Superglue,” Pillsbury finds himself in the middle of a fling turned serious, employing stripped-back instrumentation that allows him plenty of room to outline the narrative stakes. “I can make it complicated,” he threatens, before knowing emotions will only cause harm: “You just want a little TLC.” Throughout <i>Kansas Anymore</i>, Tucker Pillsbury is loving the wrong person at the wrong time, wanting dinner when they want coffee, or thwarting off a desperate partner he thought to be a friend.","short":"Tucker Pillsbury is nursing some wounds on his second

Album","standard":"When Larry June and The Alchemist get together, the results are invariably magical. Two West Coast hip-hop mainstays, their 2023 joint album <i>The Great Escape</i> and a few surrounding one-offs clarified just how marvelously the Bay’s healthiest MC could vibe with LA’s infamous beat artisan. While that project’s featured guests were overwhelmingly comprised of ALC familiars, the duo’s 2025 follow-up welcomes a relative newcomer to that particular scene as its third headliner: 2 Chainz. Having established his reputation primarily with trap producers, the Georgia native reached a certain level of ubiquity by working beyond subgenre borders, which contextualizes his presence on <i>Life Is Beautiful</i>. As his biggest fans assuredly know, he and June are in no way strangers, appearing together on the latter’s <i>Spaceships on the Blade</i> and <i>The Night Shift</i>, albeit not over Alchemist beats.\n\nCommonalities and contrasts between the two rappers make <i>Life Is Beautiful</i> a uniquely satisfying listening experience. “Colossal” recalls 2 Chainz’s <i>Most Expensivest</i> exploits, his luxe litany of decidedly un-humble brags pleasantly incongruous with June’s signature lifestyle index involving fresh-squeezed juices, vintage timepieces, and automotive excellence. At times, they suit one another like a well-balanced cocktail, trading unapologetically profane bars for more methodical and measured ones on “I Been” and “Any Day.” Elsewhere, their shared maturity differentiates them from the brand-name-dropping rap pack, their grown-folks motivations informing the flexes of “LLC” and the title track. Devoid of distractions from outside guests, both artists’ skills and quirks come to the fore over Alchemist’s breathtaking, often sublimely soulful, instrumentals.","short":"Three hip-hop greats find common ground amid contrast."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-is-beautiful/1793866201","playParams":{"id":"1793866201","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7KldyyeQxbaR4oXtMprIJD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793866201/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"675391681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/675391681?l=en-US"},{"id":"435300447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/435300447?l=en-US"},{"id":"28446224","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/28446224?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739541334983,"RTCI":0}}},"1793946413":{"id":"1793946413","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793946413?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/68/4f/b6/684fb681-87fa-cc1d-aaad-4acd7f797bc4/0b0c3428-c000-47e0-b04c-a9250a80accb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d5b8a5","textColor2":"ebc468","textColor4":"cdac5f","textColor1":"f5d3bf","bgColor":"574f3b","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/bc/37/d7/bc37d7de-6887-c0d1-3c05-86866a019fb4/36efa8a9-16d1-494a-bf96-40c6a242593a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3938","textColor2":"281c18","textColor4":"4f4542","textColor1":"140d0c","bgColor":"e9e9eb","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/neton-vega/1686896695","name":"Mi Vida Mi Muerte","artistName":"Neton Vega","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bf/b8/7b/bfb87bdf-9da6-880f-0fca-f74f22135f5b/1963622918315_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5bfc2","textColor2":"b0c7d9","textColor4":"90a3b4","textColor1":"deeaeb","bgColor":"121622","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mi-vida-mi-muerte/1793946413","playParams":{"id":"1793946413","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/338NDGMHtB4t5mp8RhMnh3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793946413/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1686896695","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1686896695?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739528784532,"RTCI":0}}},"1794049581":{"id":"1794049581","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794049581?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/06/dd/5d/06dd5d38-151a-ea95-944d-808a4c3b53d7/Job3958ac0e-79ca-4911-a9aa-e541ed899f19-185529142-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363019375_2049462010-Time1739221452117.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201f39"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0e0f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3a2d30","textColor2":"201f39","textColor4":"41415b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0e0f","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6b/40/35/6b403524-a6a8-5de8-e68c-9a318b9e24ad/3e60b7cb-9dca-4551-9ab5-da13b946d146.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d7d8da","textColor2":"eeeeef","textColor4":"d1d2d3","textColor1":"f6f6f7","bgColor":"5c5f65","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b7/bf/fd/b7bffda5-1192-7694-4616-234cd4a7ace2/Job49262cc7-0e0c-42c5-a80b-7be99ccfd229-185529141-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363019374_2049462011-Time1739220563502.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201f39"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0e0f"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"302933","textColor2":"201f39","textColor4":"3f3f59","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0e0f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/65/44/cc/6544cc7b-a84c-8e3d-da2f-2a7a44b156c4/4031184f-3c9c-4ec5-98ce-c86c7512aafe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bebcde","textColor2":"d2d1f8","textColor4":"b7b6dd","textColor1":"dad8fa","bgColor":"4d4c6e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c5/85/95/c5859509-0d8f-2d50-d302-fd57e2487afd/dbd463de-c278-4415-a7f9-3b2a2ff54627.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"352e34","textColor2":"201d20","textColor4":"3c3941","textColor1":"180f11","bgColor":"aaaac4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jisoo/1548008317","name":"AMORTAGE -

Spearheaded by laid-back trap-pop track “Flower,” 2023’s <i>ME</i> saw the Korean vocalist and K-drama actress become the final member to release solo music—to massive success. But the two-track single album was slight, leaving fans wanting more. JISOO’s four-track follow-up, and her first since departing from YG Entertainment and Interscope Records as a soloist in 2023, is <i>AMORTAGE</i>—a portmanteau of “amor” and “montage.” This definition is borne out across the dance-pop album, which explores the reality-rocking attraction at the beginning of love (“earthquake”), the immersive capacity of being in love (“Your Love”), the sting of heartbreak (“TEARS”), and the power of moving on (“Hugs & Kisses”).\n\nAll four tracks on <i>AMORTAGE</i> were produced by Blissoo, the K-pop agency JISOO formed in 2024, and music production duo The Wavys.

Live Album","standard":"Wyatt Flores’ 2024 album <i>Welcome to the Plains</i> gives a great sense of the young artist’s vitality. Whether singing about the complex relationship he has with his home state of Oklahoma or confronting his own mortality, Flores performs his original songs with his whole chest, revealing a bone-deep commitment to his craft that’s evident both in his impassioned vocals and his willingness to dig into tough topics. This live outing from Flores gives a greater sense of the 23-year-old Americana singer-songwriter’s dynamism, as he commands the stage of one of his home state’s most famous venues with an easy, joyful confidence. It also captures the skill and chemistry of his band, who Flores says really come to life in a live setting. “Our entire band, just from what you hear on the record to what we do live, it’s so different,” he tells Apple Music. “And the little things that we add into [our live shows], it’s magic.”\n\nThe 18-song set opens with <i>Welcome to the Plains</i>’ title track, a dark and rollicking journey into Oklahoma’s bloody history made all the more urgent by Flores’ aching vocal and his band’s knack for letting tension build. The energy continues to swell with “Life Lessons,” the title track of a 2023 EP from Flores that is clearly a fan favorite—the crowd’s spirited sing-along almost drowns him out at the chorus. Other highlights include the groovy tearjerker “I Believe in God,” on which Flores sings so hard, you have to wonder if it hurts, and “Please Don’t Go,” a 2022 song that helped Flores find his audience.","short":"An 18-track live set that captures the rising star’s joy and confidence."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-at-cains-ballroom/1794218407","playParams":{"id":"1794218407","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2IIRAGPSOJnwqCnJQk9Iy4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794218407/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1563146833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1563146833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739546250655,"RTCI":0}}},"1794427265":{"id":"1794427265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794427265?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-12","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/70/05/d1/7005d1db-77df-ec38-146d-ede9fa8e4776/76cfd702-8bf3-4d00-a4b6-f233a8196085.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"47423e","textColor2":"3d2d21","textColor4":"5d4f42","textColor1":"211e1b","bgColor":"ded6c7","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1a/27/37/1a273710-74ee-0c42-ed12-16c7b4975c6a/b24e1cd6-c942-4bae-bcf1-d622dd1d4208.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"4a3c3a","textColor2":"2c2625","textColor4":"4a4545","textColor1":"2c1a18","bgColor":"c2c2c2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coi-leray/1358539712","name":"What Happened To Forever? - EP","artistName":"Coi Leray","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/26/9a/c1/269ac1d8-1f27-4cb1-63d5-a405d1e1841c/196872854824.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e3b36","textColor2":"252120","textColor4":"504e4c","textColor1":"0e0a04","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The New Jersey rapper/singer is famous for flipping classic hip-hop samples into take-no-prisoners girl power anthems, but bad bitches have feelings too.

The LP became an instant classic, even landing on Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums list. Two years after its release, SZA adds even more tracks to her critically acclaimed album for the deluxe edition.\n\n<i>SOS Deluxe: LANA</i> finds the singer-songwriter even more candid than its predecessor. Across the collection’s now-42 tracks, SZA is vulnerable as she confesses her weaknesses and acknowledges her flaws, all while on her journey to find peace. On the atmospheric opener, “No More Hiding,” the artist embraces a new side to herself, letting go of things that no longer serve her and evolving into a better person: “Everything I love, I gotta let go/Gotta break it if you want it to grow/Had to build everything twice over/Don’t tell me ’cause I know,” she lilts over an acoustic guitar. She continues to display her vulnerabilities on her road to emotional reawakening and attempting to break old patterns, whether she’s dealing with heartache from a toxic partner (“What Do I Do”), prioritizing her self-worth (“My Turn,” “Conceited,” “Forgiveless”), or struggling to let go of her fears (“Chill Baby”).\n\nOn the soulful and gritty title track, SZA says precisely what’s on her mind after a night of crying over a lost relationship: “I talk bullshit a lot/No more fuck shit, I’m done,” she swaggers. This isn’t the only song that shows her weariness towards relationships that no longer serve her; see also “Smoking on My Ex Pack” and “Far.” However, not every song on the project is about moving on and leaving her past relationships behind her: SZA still has a penchant for making wrong decisions against her better judgment (“Kitchen,” “Too Late,” “F2F”). She revels in the toxicity of her relationships (“Scorsese Baby Daddy”) and questions her worth in some instances (“Love Me 4 Me,” “Special”). She becomes introspective on “Crybaby” as she addresses the labels that are often placed on her by critics and fans alike. However, instead of rejecting these notions, she embraces her traits and owns her imperfections. The album sketches the ebbs and flows of emotions, with strength in one moment but deep regret and sadness the next.\n\nSZA continues to showcase her growth, not just lyrically, but sonically as well, blending a mix of her beloved lo-fi beats and sharing space with pop, grunge, punk-inspired, and even bossa nova without any of it sounding out of place. On the lighthearted and vibrant track “BMF,” she interpolates the Stan Getz & Astrud Gilberto rendition of “The Girl from Ipanema” while showing her admiration for a guy she’s infatuated with. On the Phoebe Bridgers-assisted duet “Ghost in the Machine,” the duo takes a deeper look at the realities of stardom, seeking a bit of humanity within their day-to-day interactions. The track is progressive in its use of strings and acoustic guitars and haunting in its vocal performance.\n\nThroughout the journey of <i>SOS Deluxe: LANA</i>, there are moments of clarity and tenderness where SZA feels the discomfort of healing while trying to find the deeper meaning within the trials and tribulations she endures.

Apple Music Session","standard":"Indie duo Good Neighbours put their heart and soul into their songs, so when it came to choosing which one to perform for their Apple Music Session, “Ripple” jumped out at Oli Fox and Scott Verrill. “It’s our new song, our new baby,” they tell Apple Music. “We’re very proud of it and it’s nice to finally have it in the world. It was one of the first songs we wrote for the band. And we just wanted to frame it in a new way, so we stripped it down, gave it a mellow vibe and it feels like it’s taken on a new life.” “Ripple” is a song that means a lot to Good Neighbours, so the duo felt it was even more special to give it a new treatment. “The song itself was always quite a deep one for us. It was written about my friend going through grief, and we sort of hid behind the production of this song for quite a while,” say Fox and Verrill. “So it’s nice to let it take on a bit of a new form where the words are at the forefront, and people can hear the message we’re trying to tell them about.” \n\nFor their cover, the boys went for a dreamy version of Gracie Abrams’ “That’s so True” because they think the original is “an absolute belter.” “This song has been everywhere and we can’t escape it,” they say. “But, for once, it’s a song that we actually love and we don’t want to escape. We’re big fans of Gracie Abrams and the album so it’s cool just to put our spin on this tune.” They came up with the new versions while touring across North America with Foster the People during early 2025: “Both of these were made on our bus. And it’s our first time ever doing that. It’s a lot of sleep deprivation that has sparked some creativity within us to do these songs. But it’s been really fun and it’s kind of taken us back to where it all started, doing iPhone recordings of guitars and vocals and doing it that way from scratch. So it’s been super fun and we’re proud of them.”","short":"A mellow take on the duo’s “Ripple,” plus a Gracie Abrams cover."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-sessions-good-neighbours-single/1795058164","playParams":{"id":"1795058164","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795058164/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1726004707","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1726004707?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739546814016,"RTCI":0}}},"1795063368":{"id":"1795063368","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795063368?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/60/97/d5/6097d5de-29da-534d-be94-71ba5ddafe62/Job95f2afce-e459-45cd-87de-243fcce0bac5-185701908-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363378821_2052070071-Time1739401687638.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dd7e3c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cb6c48","textColor2":"dd7e3c","textColor4":"be6531","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8b/a2/62/8ba262d7-ab02-d565-60ff-7a3e915ad912/f20d4831-b278-42d2-a260-b640df867161.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f342c","textColor2":"181e16","textColor4":"333831","textColor1":"131a10","bgColor":"a2a09e","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/33/0b/a1/330ba121-7ecb-0b86-cc23-dd39b8b25341/Job1f657958-f238-4512-a373-461612ce9698-185701909-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363378822_2052070070-Time1739402897428.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f17032"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c27241","textColor2":"f17032","textColor4":"ce5b2a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/westside-gunn/829760702","name":"12","artistName":"Westside Gunn","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/6e/66/be6e664c-d0ce-ad50-3c22-a2a59f0ac048/8721253690696.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ba8144","textColor2":"f70000","textColor4":"d00304","textColor1":"dc9d50","bgColor":"341014","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Much like his unending devotion for wrestling and sartorial sense of streetwear, Westside Gunn perpetually seeks to put other rappers on. For this spiritual sequel to 2022’s <i>Peace “Fly” God</i> that also technically serves as the 12th installment in his <i>Hermes</i> series, the Griselda impresario once again centers Estee Nack and Stove God Cooks, who collectively and respectively appear on seven of these 11 tracks. Their joint presence on trio cuts “BOSWELL” and the Daringer-produced “VEERT” pushes the fashionably flamboyant FLYGOD back towards coke-rap braggadocio and surrounding themes of luxury amid violence. (Even as his cohorts talk street business, he still fires off a big brag about parallel parking a Bugatti.) The duo moments shine as well, with Stove reminiscing about the recipe with Gunn on “055” and Nack mixing ugly business with filthy pleasure on “BURY ME WITH A STOVE.”\n\nA standout presence on 2024’s <i>Still Praying</i>, Brother Tom Sos returns here for two songs in a move that furthers Gunn’s artistic patronage. On “HEALTH SCIENCE,” he moves the proceedings towards something resembling what used to be dubbed conscious rap, while on “GUMBO YAYA” he transforms murderous metaphors into a more principled path. Though better known for his production placements on Mach-Hommy’s <i>#RICHAXXHAITIAN</i> and Conway The Machine’s <i>Slant Face Killah</i>, Elijah Hooks makes an unexpected if rewarding appearance over Conductor Williams’ “DUMP WORLD.” The album’s sole solo joint, “OUTLANDER” allows Gunn to synthesize all of <i>12</i>’s ideas with his signature WWE nods and the mournful reflections that came to the fore on his preceding <i>11</i> EP.","short":"FLYGOD returns with Estee Nack and Stove God Cooks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/12/1795063368","playParams":{"id":"1795063368","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3LtZUOfccDjNs18684twS8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795063368/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829760702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829760702?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739529524224,"RTCI":0}}},"1795512297":{"id":"1795512297","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795512297?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/19/48/95194837-0668-1a8e-d128-24603ceff19c/80af6082-c89f-4978-8597-5cd9e71284a6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1aca5","textColor2":"c2bfbb","textColor4":"9f9d9c","textColor1":"d8d1c7","bgColor":"15171d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c0/61/61/c0616115-7b56-faea-8d0d-3fc248965bb0/d4e09273-0e35-4a9b-b278-13a54cf3a5be.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7d0d4","textColor2":"b8d6f5","textColor4":"9bbeda","textColor1":"eeecec","bgColor":"2b5f72","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sabrina-carpenter/390647681","name":"Short n' Sweet (Deluxe)","artistName":"Sabrina Carpenter","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/a3/e9/c9a3e987-3952-a6ac-7975-680f2033e660/25UMGIM10586.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"20292a","textColor2":"3c170d","textColor4":"463631","textColor1":"0d0704","bgColor":"6cb0c3","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Some people kill their nemeses with kindness; Sabrina Carpenter, the breakout pop star of summer 2024, takes the opposite tack, shooting withering one-liners at loser exes via featherlight melodies, a wink and a smile. The former Disney Channel star began her music career at age 15 with her 2014 debut single “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying.” Now 25, the singer-songwriter is making the catchiest, funniest, and most honest music of her career at a moment when all the world’s watching. But on songs like “Please Please Please,” on which she begs her boyfriend not to embarrass her (again), she’s poking fun at herself, too. “A lot of what I really love about this album is the accountability,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I will call myself out just as much as I will call out someone else.”\n\nIt’s not because Carpenter’s “vertically challenged,” as she puts it, that she named her sixth album <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>. “I thought about some of these relationships, how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most,” she tells Lowe. “And I thought about the way that I respond to situations: Sometimes it is very nice, and sometimes it’s not very nice.” Hence songs like “Dumb & Poetic,” a gentle acoustic ballad that’s also a blistering takedown of a guy who masks his sleazy tendencies with therapy buzzwords and a highbrow record collection, or the twangy, hilarious “Slim Pickins,” on which she croons: “Jesus, what’s a girl to do?/This boy doesn’t even know the difference between there, their, and they are/Yet he’s naked in my room.”\n\nWith good humor and good taste (channeling Rilo Kiley here, Kacey Musgraves there, and on “Sharpest Tool,” a bit of The Postal Service), Carpenter reframes heartbreak through the lens of life’s absurdity. “When you’re at this point in your life where you’re almost at your wits’ end, everything is funny,” Carpenter tells Lowe. “So much of this album was made in the moments where there was something that I just couldn’t stop laughing about. And I was like, well, that might as well just be a whole song.” \n\nCarpenter wrote a good deal of the album on an 11-day trip to a tiny town in rural France, where the isolation unlocked her brutally honest side, resulting in unprecedentedly vulnerable music and one song she readily admits shouldn’t work on paper but hits anyway: “Espresso,” the song that catapulted her career with four delightfully strange-sounding words: “That’s that me espresso.” “There really are no rules to the things you say,” she tells Lowe on the songwriting process. “You’re just like, what sounds awesome? What feels awesome? And what gets the story across, whatever story that is?” Still, she’s painted herself in a bit of a corner when it comes to placing an order at coffee shops worldwide: “They’re just waiting for me to say it,” she laughs. “And I’m like, ‘Tea.’”","short":"Still sweet but less short: four new tracks including a Dolly duet."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/short-n-sweet-deluxe/1795512297","playParams":{"id":"1795512297","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3WzBIQmn2hrulLeTY9smkk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795512297/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"390647681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/390647681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739548445073,"RTCI":0}}},"1795521819":{"id":"1795521819","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795521819?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marca-mp/1493050737","name":"ONLY ENAMORADOS","artistName":"Marca MP","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7f/33/44/7f3344fb-16fd-192a-cc71-194927a49bf2/196872862553.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"590807","textColor4":"7a3a38","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In the five years since 2020’s <i>Flores</i> EP, which brought Marca MP such signatures as “Recuerda” and “Tú,” their capacity to produce songs of love and heartache has grown substantially.

Previously released singles “CADA DÍA TE QUIERO MÁS” and their popular rendition of La Edicion De Culiacan’s “QUÉ BONITA” meet newly recorded versions of apparent favorites like “COSAS RARAS” and “SI YO FUERA LADRÓN.” Some of the other recognizable cover songs arguably hit just as hard as Chato’s early singles, his arrangements and vocals on Tania Dominguez’s “AMOR NO CORRESPONDIDO” and Julio Chaidez’s “EL AMOR EN CARRO” matching the deeply felt sentiments of the existing originals.","short":"A Valentine’s Day 2025 covers set straight from Chato’s heart."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/only-enamorados/1795521819","playParams":{"id":"1795521819","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2mEvV18XEfAwIT73TiO8dU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795521819/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1493050737","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1493050737?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739528862024,"RTCI":0}}},"1795565826":{"id":"1795565826","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795565826?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/9f/f8/a59ff857-1228-d74e-009f-d534ee5cae9b/348f67c5-df94-4629-928b-fcb2a81ff61c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"373935","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"474e46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6fbe0","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/41/46/b6/4146b66f-f115-f6dd-84ab-03ac727c0bca/43667e14-dc56-496c-bc98-fe4466fae439.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"252f2a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"26302c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebf3f2","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/3c/10/0f/3c100fdc-6a14-0ea4-46df-bf16dc3f7afd/d3a6bfa9-1dc0-41b5-adbc-f107c7533929.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"30332f","textColor2":"111111","textColor4":"3b403b","textColor1":"030103","bgColor":"e5fce0","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/41/e7/8441e747-959d-a11a-1f84-7ab628bd4451/3b8fccde-be8e-46f5-a17a-d1086d3bd85f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"393c38","textColor2":"1b1b1b","textColor4":"434842","textColor1":"0f0c0e","bgColor":"e3fbde","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0f/6b/51/0f6b51da-3daa-1bb6-5263-70fc709e1149/d72cbe0f-d0fe-47f7-9248-4a6d60106200.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"030f09","textColor4":"323d38","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"eff5f5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ca/e4/37/cae43713-d0fb-39f7-4728-274cbac3c9ff/e866642d-160d-4fe6-80b7-ef4ecdd31693.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2f322e","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"3f433e","textColor1":"010001","bgColor":"e7fde2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kevin-saunderson/79544039","name":"Fitness: Run, February 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Kevin Saunderson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/24/5c/e5/245ce5ef-0b0e-9136-67b3-9bd1fa1f71be/98b76029-572a-4561-988e-d7670c4052da.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e322c","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"474b46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6fbe0","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout.

Also, don’t miss Kid Massive’s “House Music (Move Your Body),” featuring Jim C, which he calls an “outstanding remix full of energy that takes you to another level.”","short":"Put in work with a Detroit techno founding father. “The theme is: elevate.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-february-2025-dj-mix/1795565826","playParams":{"id":"1795565826","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795565826/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"79544039","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/79544039?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739534312983,"RTCI":0}}},"1796127242":{"id":"1796127242","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796127242?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b6/a2/10/b6a21065-a9a9-07ae-bb0f-34e74dbd5d10/Job9e848ab4-c5d9-49b3-9ed9-57c7e2973d04-185799449-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363574726_2053606128-Time1739495199870.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e1f3f1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c9c5c3","textColor2":"e1f3f1","textColor4":"b7c3c5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/1f/aa/951faa3e-c49e-afce-e79f-4b06be817e2b/98c38785-9acb-4cf9-80da-5a789a22d189.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"abada7","textColor2":"c8cdc1","textColor4":"a1a59c","textColor1":"d6d7cf","bgColor":"020705","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/83/dd/d4/83ddd447-35fd-a62f-b79f-11094e73364c/Job89f7efe4-b017-4fe6-9e57-84ebfc8623f1-185799450-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363574725_2053606129-Time1739496881142.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c7c8c2","textColor2":"e1f5f1","textColor4":"b5c6c1","textColor1":"f8f8f2","bgColor":"050802","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/64/d8/13/64d81323-0f16-ff35-2471-1acfadf4e560/72f79c06-f844-42c7-9151-d4a57ce39b60.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bfcfd0","textColor2":"dcdece","textColor4":"b7bbae","textColor1":"e6f7f9","bgColor":"252d2e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/89/f9/f7/89f9f75d-9206-1b00-2c8c-1d2eda423576/7a3f42ef-5bf8-4741-b74a-91f96b84f32b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0bcbc","textColor2":"bdc4b2","textColor4":"989e90","textColor1":"dce9e9","bgColor":"020705","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=666648192-271256","name":"$ome $exy $ongs 4 U","artistName":"PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/34/10/1e/34101e1f-f4b9-907a-ce47-3fba5b3ee5e8/50222.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbccc8","textColor2":"dbf5f9","textColor4":"b3c8cc","textColor1":"faf9f3","bgColor":"13181b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On the cover of <i>$ome $exy $ongs 4 U</i>, we see PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake tricked out in furry winter gear, posing in front of a pair of buildings that’ll be familiar to anyone who’s ever driven past PND’s hometown of Mississauga, on the western fringe of Toronto. Now, the Absolute World high-rise condos may not be an internationally recognized landmark on par with the CN Tower (which famously graced Drake’s 2016 blockbuster <i>Views</i>), but it’s a fitting visual emblem of the more low-stakes, bringing-it-all-back-home ethos that defines their first full-length collaboration. Even your grandma knows that 2024 was a rough year for Drake, so in that sense, Mississauga represents a proverbial safe space where he can recalibrate and experiment outside the limelight alongside a loyal protégé who’s stood by his side through thick and thin.\n\n<i>$ome $exy $ongs 4 U</i> was originally advertised as an EP to be released on Valentine’s Day 2025, but at 21 tracks and 75 minutes, it’s more like getting a gift box of chocolates and discovering there are three more layers underneath. At the outset, the duo’s approach is to pretend 2024 never happened and lean into the singular combination of sensitivity, swagger, and hyper-local referentialism that turned OVO into a rap&B empire in the 2010s. Atmospheric trap tracks like “CN TOWER” and “SOMETHING ABOUT YOU” unfurl like late-night DM threads, taking us inside the fragile psyches of celebrity rappers who pick up their dates in private jets and get them to sign NDAs, yet (as PND testifies on “LASERS”) still get easily triggered when they see an ex-boyfriend’s name tattooed on the back of their neck when they’re doing it doggystyle.\n\nThe question of whether Drake will use this platform to air out his grievances is settled partway through the album on the pugilistic “GIMME A HUG,” where he comes out swinging at his fair-weather followers, but stops short of getting back in the ring when he declares, “Fuck a rap beef/I’m trying to get the party lit.” And from that point on, he stays true to his word, displaying the charm, humor, and trendspotting savvy that’s made him a star far beyond the rap realm.\n\n<i>$ome $exy $ongs 4 U</i> starts to really live up to its title with the playful Spanglish seduction of “MEET YOUR PADRE,” a collaboration with urban sierreño star Chino Pacas that sounds like a regional-Mexican spin on “One Dance,” while the delirious “NOKIA” sees Drake and PND dropping rhymes over shapeshifting ’80s-electro beats like an OVO Outkast. But perhaps the biggest surprise arrives in the form of “DIE TRYING,” an irresistibly melodic, countrified confessional that’s of a piece with acoustic alt-pop anthems like Post Malone’s “Circles” and Clairo’s “Bags”—and which suggests the most effective way to move beyond a rap beef is to move beyond rap entirely.","short":"The OVO power duo’s epic “EP” is as surprising as it is
