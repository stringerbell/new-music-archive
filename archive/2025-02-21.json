Gray","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On the three fearlessly freaky EPs Saya Gray released between 2022 and 2024, no style was off-limits: Hyperpop, folk, jazz, industrial alt-rock, glitchy electronica, even metal were all fair game, sometimes within the span of a single song. You got the sense the Toronto-based artist was coming up with ideas faster than she could commit them to tape. But for her first proper full-length album, the former musical director for Daniel Caesar and Willow Smith grounds her manic, collagist aesthetic in a more old-school approach. <i>SAYA</i> was written primarily on an autumn 2023 retreat to Japan, where she cozied up with an acoustic guitar and reconnected with the music of classic-rock icons like The Beatles and Joni Mitchell.\n\nYou can feel the difference within the opening seconds of “..THUS IS WHY ( I DON’T SPRING 4 LOVE ),” where a sunrise-summoning melody, gritty guitar groove, and a soothingly slack drumbeat meld into a ’90-style alt-pop anthem. But even when working in more conventional singer-songwriter mode, Gray’s idiosyncratic, genre-mashing spirit cuts through loud and clear: The breezy country lullaby “SHELL ( OF A MAN )” is teed up with a brain-bending acoustic arpeggio worthy of a prog-rock record; “H.B.W” is a harmonious fusion of dreamy psych-folk melodies and dark trip-hop textures; while the exquisitely chill closer “LIE DOWN” sounds like a Fleetwood Mac classic given a dub remix.","short":"The Toronto artist grounds her collagist aesthetic in an old-school

singer-songwriter has wrangled pop smashes out of topics that others avoid, from body image issues to feeling weird at parties. On her fourth album, Alessia Cara’s the first to tell herself to snap out of it: “Lonely in LA, I’m such a cliché,” she sighs on “Go Outside!” while wallowing in bed, nursing a fresh heartbreak. The deceptively upbeat first half of <i>Love & Hyperbole</i> draws from ’90s neo-soul and 2000s R&B: Shades of Alicia Keys and Faith Evans echo through songs like “Dead Man,” a piano-driven throwback about trying to defibrillate a dying relationship.\n\nBut something shifts around “(Isn’t It) Obvious,” which sneaks in an uncredited guitar solo from John Mayer: The sky stops falling—or rather, Cara finds that it wasn’t falling to begin with. Rather than overburden a relationship with expectations, she simply lets love in, and by “Clearly,” she wipes the slate clean with a promise: “Forget about the rest, and start over for the first time.”","short":"More vulnerable pop songs drawing from ’90s neo-soul and 2000s R&B."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e3/41/60/e3416037-daab-ec7f-0222-446a6d74073b/24UMGIM72459.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c99481","textColor2":"f5a487","textColor4":"c68771","textColor1":"f8b39b","bgColor":"0d1619","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-hyperbole/1764394377","playParams":{"id":"1764394377","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1xyO6rgO44G5BYpljc11l4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764394377/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"991444375","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/991444375?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740133742658,"RTCI":0}}},"1765592868":{"id":"1765592868","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765592868?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/profiler/1564758938","name":"A Digital Nowhere (Deluxe Edition)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Profiler","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a2/aa/78/a2aa78cf-36d4-4503-cee0-d2cb91027ed5/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a6b0b2","textColor2":"c2cfd1","textColor4":"9da7a9","textColor1":"cddadc","bgColor":"09090b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-digital-nowhere-deluxe-edition/1765592868","playParams":{"id":"1765592868","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4DREcbo2ahGgX9tNZn5IXH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765592868/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1564758938","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1564758938?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740132880770,"RTCI":0}}},"1767608790":{"id":"1767608790","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767608790?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9b/ce/9e/9bce9e84-1fe1-6e58-3e2e-5d83a268f128/Jobee62b8f1-061c-45e1-8c1b-b375dbde59f5-176657791-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345103506_1910520816-Time1727879478842.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"ff0101","textColor4":"cc0202","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/da/66/34/da6634ec-a72f-10f3-0265-09e81348dbc0/423cf03c-bec0-41fb-9262-94e1398f0330.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcb4a5","textColor2":"dbc3aa","textColor4":"b09d8a","textColor1":"e9dfcd","bgColor":"070607","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f8/5c/e5/f85ce55a-54b9-533b-5019-371ccc036802/Job5d35e445-9620-4089-ad8a-d4adf464b46d-176530609-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_344815631_1908302431-Time1727712487861.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ff0000"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"ff0000","textColor4":"cc0000","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/21/19/62/211962e9-a495-8a6b-8fdb-d3cb991063cf/975957bd-f0f2-4668-864d-5f812e36ab6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c9d5cc","textColor2":"c8dbd0","textColor4":"a9bbb1","textColor1":"f0fbf2","bgColor":"2e3b33","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bartees-strange/1450776625","name":"Horror","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Bartees Strange","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Bartees Strange’s third album finds the Washington, D.C. singer-songwriter stretching his sonic limbs further than ever before—an achievement, to be sure, since Strange’s first two records (2020’s <i>Live Forever</i> and 2022’s critical breakthrough <i>Farm to Table</i>) cemented his ability to effortlessly hop between anthemic rock, dusky blues, and rap cadences within just a few minutes. With a slightly darker sound befitting its namesake, <i>Horror</i> adds a few impressive guises to Strange’s genre menagerie: There’s the explicitly Fleetwood Mac-esque jangle of “Sober,” the melancholic trip-hop skitter of “Doomsday Buttercup,” and the lucious house thump of “Lovers,” which might count as Strange’s starkest left turn to date.\n\nAcross these 12 tracks, Strange also fine-tunes his winning formula of countrified balladry and propulsive riffs, both of which are given a big-ticket pop spit-shine courtesy of contributions from studio wizards Yves and Lawrence Rothman as well as the ever-ubiquitous Jack Antonoff. Don’t mistake big names for unnecessary flashiness, though: <i>Horror</i> retains the down-to-earth POV that’s made Strange an increasingly powerful presence in indie, even as his ambitions

Opener “Counterfeit” has her rapping over a sugary synth melody and shuffling drums. The chorus explodes as she sings, “You’re the original/Don’t let ’em counterfeit you.” She takes this advice to heart, embracing a number of genres and unexpected detours on <i>The Breeze Grew a Fire</i>. “White Doves” hearkens back to the neo-R&B of D’Angelo and The Soulquarians, while “Meteorite” skips and shuffles alongside a lo-fi rap beat.","short":"Rap and neo-R&B anthems of perseverance, inspired by motherhood."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/c6/8f/84c68f5f-c0d3-b146-7ecf-c663fbb4588c/48726.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0b6be","textColor2":"e4b08c","textColor4":"bb957c","textColor1":"d6dadf","bgColor":"18293b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-breeze-grew-a-fire/1771508964","playParams":{"id":"1771508964","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27Wwasz4XZHobOHQaB4R0g"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771508964/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1211043322","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1211043322?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740117795456,"RTCI":0}}},"1772274466":{"id":"1772274466","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772274466?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/90/ff/1e90ffa8-7833-6742-8539-05ad6dacf068/64490e46-f7f2-44cb-b453-b585a6659797.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202022","textColor2":"13110d","textColor4":"2b2a2c","textColor1":"040401","bgColor":"8d91a9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/69/d2/ef/69d2efaa-2a28-ba02-9bf5-f277fad926e5/0a6eb548-8604-4cbd-b92e-875d6a1a74d6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"312c22","textColor2":"17110a","textColor4":"352d20","textColor1":"12100e","bgColor":"ad9e75","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-wombats/162731772","name":"Oh!

As they’ve matured in the ensuing years, though, their sound has evolved beyond the scope of that world. On their sixth studio album, 2025’s <i>Oh! The Ocean</i>, they update the band’s geographic influence, too. After Murphy moved to LA, the band recorded in the city’s Echo Park neighborhood. Though the album title suggests a cheery, awestruck disposition, Murphy’s writing is as biting as ever. He takes aim at “see and be seen culture” on opener “Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come” and wades into the murky anxiety of modern politics on “I Love America and She Hates Me.” The cultural, though, is balanced by plenty of introspective moments, like on “My Head Is Not My Friend,” in which Murphy dives into the ecstatic highs, crippling lows, and run-of-the-mill mundanities that animate the band’s best work.","short":"The long-running UK indie act moves to LA and sharpens its

Watching","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sam Fender","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It was during a time-out after the whirlwind success of his 2019 debut <i>Hypersonic Missiles</i> and its 2021 follow-up <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> that Sam Fender realized what his third album needed to be. Those two records had made the singer-songwriter from Northeast England one of the breakthrough artists of the past decade, a homegrown superstar who’d gone from playing local venues to stadiums and now had a pair of BRIT Awards sitting on his mantelpiece. But Fender had felt a little rushed making <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> and he was determined that it wouldn’t happen again, no matter how long it took. Allied to that, he also wanted to hold to a simple and concise aim. “When writing the past two albums I started with a clear goal and concept, but towards the end of recording it always morphed into something else—at least for me it did,” Fender told Apple Music when announcing <i>People Watching</i> in November 2024. “I wanted to go in there and write good songs; not think about some grandiose overblown message, just 10/11 good songs about ordinary people.”\n\nHis patience paid off. <i>People Watching</i> is Fender’s most perfectly realized release to date. Its title neatly sums up the emotional connection at the heart of the 30-year-old’s music and his supernatural gift for wrapping everyday tales in an exhilarating, euphoric release. It’s still his beloved hometown that remains the primary focus but in Fender’s dexterous hands, the place has become a prism through which he sings about grief, family, mental health, poverty, homelessness, the government, and more.\n\nSonically, <i>People Watching</i> is the most sumptuous work of his career, one that builds on the bounding, Springsteen-style expanse and emerges with a technicolor indie-rock masterpiece stacked with another raft of killer choruses for the masses to sing along to. Fender nodded to his love of The War on Drugs on <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> and here he goes one step further, enlisting the band’s mercurial leader Adam Granduciel as co-producer alongside Markus Dravs (Coldplay, Arcade Fire, Florence + the Machine).\n\nNothing here is overloaded. Even at its most epic, there’s an intricacy and airiness about these songs, Granduciel’s synth flourishes adding a dynamic counterpoint to Fender’s rousing hooks. It’s a record of many shapes and textures, taking in the urgent classic rock of the title track, yearning anthems (“Little Bit Closer”), contemplative Americana with a bit of a swagger about it (“Wild Long Lie”), and wistful ’80s pop (“Crumbling Empire”). At its best, it pairs his love of US heartland rock with an Oasis-style jubilance. In its minor chord acoustic strums, “Chin Up” even has echoes of “Wonderwall” about it.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine Noel and Liam attempting a song like “Remember My Name,” the stirring, stark closer made up of nothing but Fender’s vocals and the moving horns of the Easington Colliery Band, an emotive salute to his northeast roots and a song that places Sam Fender out there on his own. <i>People Watching</i> may well be the sound of an artist entering his imperial phase.","short":"The indie-rock star’s exhilarating set of “good songs about ordinary people.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bd/8c/24/bd8c2468-7978-cace-67b1-e0b3e5a643b8/24UM1IM05583.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"272727","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3a3a3a","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"b3b3b3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/people-watching/1778713616","playParams":{"id":"1778713616","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Abecbed8BYAdHy9RaVoY7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1778713616/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1213989970","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1213989970?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740131856410,"RTCI":0}}},"1779140192":{"id":"1779140192","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779140192?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/84/ba/6b/84ba6b6a-2e85-f9a7-7b74-2eb994570d38/b47e18c0-b20f-4399-b89b-c0bedb274e8b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292421","textColor2":"1d1916","textColor4":"37302b","textColor1":"0d0a08","bgColor":"9d8f82","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/68/02/43/680243b1-0d72-d3de-0c61-8b62ab7233e9/f11e1e9e-e92f-46da-a397-78b734349f0c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"272528","textColor2":"250f07","textColor4":"382925","textColor1":"0f0b0a","bgColor":"868f9d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/they/1048812123","name":"LOVE.JONES","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"THEY.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"A deeply expressive, decidedly modern take on neo-soul from the LA duo."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6b/58/a7/6b58a73b-7995-f525-b7b3-067edcdc41ff/50453.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"abbac2","textColor2":"e16a2c","textColor4":"b45523","textColor1":"d6e8f3","bgColor":"010100","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-jones/1779140192","playParams":{"id":"1779140192","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1xcouduCLDsvfyp3pltKqO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779140192/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1048812123","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1048812123?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740134198837,"RTCI":0}}},"1779319620":{"id":"1779319620","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779319620?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a7/40/03/a7400362-c4a2-b819-1dad-00bace4a5dc6/f03be942-a1d4-4b0f-aa92-4ba0c1be8739.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cabdb9","textColor2":"f5b695","textColor4":"cb997f","textColor1":"f3e3de","bgColor":"252629","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/56/b6/7d56b6c4-0c15-6db2-8612-40c2a52f4f03/69a9d019-6276-4776-a4a7-25bfec3bdf28.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ceb6a4","textColor2":"f4b68e","textColor4":"cf9d7d","textColor1":"f3d5bf","bgColor":"3c3a39","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/8f/1f/308f1f14-9e96-eb07-401d-0d9700505955/fb402423-6ad6-47d3-b482-4fd7bb1e669b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5a9ad","textColor2":"f3bb9d","textColor4":"c99d85","textColor1":"c6cace","bgColor":"232426","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tate-mcrae/1446365464","name":"So Close To What","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tate McRae","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The 21-year-old Canadian multi-hyphenate has barely stopped to take a breath since kindergarten: She began intensive dance training at age six, scored a record deal at 16, and tied for top nominee for the 2025 JUNO Awards. Her third studio album arrives just a few months after the end of her 2024 world tour in support of her sophomore album, 2023’s <i>THINK LATER</i>. “Being on tour for a year feels like a million years—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I have been gone for a lifetime,’” McRae tells Apple Music, though naturally she used the time as a learning opportunity. “Being onstage every night and analyzing yourself that much, you become uber-aware of yourself and what’s going on.” She began paying closer attention to exactly what kind of songs inspired her to move, what beats triggered her dancers to get—in a word—“nasty.”\n\n<i>So Close to What</i> is not exactly a club record—more like a pop record you can viscerally feel, conducive to the kind of choreo that makes a killer stage show. Prominent on McRae’s mood board were Timbaland and The Neptunes, whose kinetic productions made the aughts feel like the future. Echoes of sparkly, club-friendly 2000s R&B abound: “bloodonmyhands” recruits Flo Milli for a Miami bass throwback, while “Purple lace bra” lands somewhere between The-Dream’s <i>Love vs. Money</i> and Lana Del Rey’s <i>Born to Die</i> (which checks out, given the latter album’s producer, Emile Haynie, among the credits). And on “Sports car,” McRae and co-writer Julia Michaels found unlikely inspiration in a 2005 crunk classic. “[Michaels] had been dying to reference the Ying Yang Twins’ ‘The Whisper Song,’ and I was like, ‘That’s crazy,’” she says. Sure enough, the concept worked.\n\nThe secret to writing her most grown-up album to date, as McRae explains, was a writer’s room that skewed heavily towards women (including Michaels and songwriter Amy Allen). “With music and finding perspective on situations, no one quite understands like another girl,” McRae explains. “You need another girl to know exactly what we’ve gone through and to know what it actually feels like in order to write a song. When you’re in a writing session, you have to be one brain together, and if it’s not that, that’s when chaos happens,” she went on. “It is so liberating to be with other girls and talk about things that are so frustrating and then feel so satisfied and accomplished after.”","short":"Echoes of 2000s R&B and visceral pop abound on her third album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/57/69/51/576951b7-121d-68fb-3210-06beaf5ec117/196872648911.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2aa8e","textColor2":"e1b69a","textColor4":"ba977f","textColor1":"d7cead","bgColor":"1c1815","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/so-close-to-what/1779319620","playParams":{"id":"1779319620","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3w32SV56JvtJXsrYtThwzP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779319620/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1446365464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1446365464?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740140090808,"RTCI":0}}},"1779334922":{"id":"1779334922","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779334922?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/15/1a/1d/151a1da8-f19f-9a8a-36dc-30787d381c1b/e9eb287a-db84-4ac0-80dd-5ddf4fcb16a7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1a5a6","textColor2":"e9898f","textColor4":"ce7379","textColor1":"dac7c8","bgColor":"611c1f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/16/7d/72/167d727b-4c22-cbab-b5c0-c54a7403a812/bac298bd-9260-44c2-9cda-a1f97338e571.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e3d3d0","textColor2":"f0e7e3","textColor4":"dbc6c2","textColor1":"faf7f4","bgColor":"884441","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nao/935698752","name":"Jupiter","artistName":"Nao","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Nao released her debut album, 2016’s <i>For All We Know</i>, to universal acclaim, but it was her 2018 follow-up effort, <i>Saturn</i>, that saw the stars truly align for the Nottingham-born, East London-raised singer-songwriter. Drawing inspiration from the tumult of her first Saturn return—a concept astrologers explain as a transitional life stage that recurs every 27 years or so—the record was a Mercury Prize- and Grammy Award-nominated triumph. <i>Jupiter</i>, the de facto sequel to <i>Saturn</i>, picks up with Nao seven years, two children, and one life-changing diagnosis later. Much has changed. “When I wrote <i>Saturn</i> I was in my Saturn return and going through a difficult time because I had gone through a breakup, and then I got an autoimmune condition called chronic fatigue syndrome,” she tells Apple Music. “I became a mother in that time, so that seven- or eight-year period was really difficult because I was ill for most of it. I went on a big healing journey and mostly recovered. And I felt like when I came to make this album and I saw that Jupiter was the planet of joy, growth, and good fortune, I was like, ‘You know what? I feel like after everything I’ve been through and come out the other end, I feel like Jupiter is the perfect way to symbolize that.’ So it is the sister album to <i>Saturn</i>, I would say.”\n\nNao first felt the “itch” to get back in the studio two years after the release of her third album, <i>And Then Life Was Beautiful</i> (2021). By her own admission, “the tunes were basically not very good,” and it took another year for her to find her rhythm again. “I was just out of practice,” she says. “I didn’t know what the theme was when I started writing, but I knew I was ready to start trying. That’s a really important part of creativity—you don’t need to have the full plan, you just follow your ideas through and see what happens, and usually it all falls into place. Once the engine got going, all these records were written in quite a short space of time.”\n\n<i>Jupiter</i> may owe its thematic identity to the cosmos, but the radiant, sun-drenched energy infused in every beat and harmony comes from a purely terrestrial source. “I was recovering from my autoimmune condition when this record finally started coming together, and being in the sun was a really important part of that,” Nao says. “I moved to LA with my partner and my kids for six months, and I ended up doing a lot of the work there. I created the vibe with LOXE and Stint, who I’ve worked with before on all my previous records, and I would just invite musicians and songwriters to come in throughout the days.”\n\nWeaving those cohesive threads into contributions from a host of new collaborators—among them Toby Gad, the songwriter behind hits for superstars including Beyoncé and John Legend—has resulted in Nao’s most self-assured body of work to date. Effervescent pop songs like “Happy People” and the cool, sparkling groove of “Poolside” blend seamlessly with the open-hearted lyricism of “30 Something” or the exquisitely minimal balladry of “Light Years.” Even “Elevate,” which leans more towards the neo-soul/R&B soundscape of previous records, has been spiked with something fresh—an electrifying guitar solo that marks the track as a highlight in an album packed full of them. The unifying factor tying this “eclectic, but consistent” package together, of course, is Jupiter itself. As Nao explains: “[I want] this album to find anybody that wants hope at the end of struggle. Something really cool about Jupiter is that it’s usually the planet you can see when you look up to the moon—it’s visible, so it’s always kind of hovering around us. I like the idea that we can just look up and know that good things are quite close by—we just have to keep going.”\n\n<b>“Wildflowers”</b>\n“I sort of imagined the program <i>Euphoria</i> when I was creating ‘Wildflowers.’ It’s this ode to time running out and fuck it, let’s just live. Let’s fall in love 100% and if it doesn’t work out, it doesn’t, but we lived life fully and we loved deeply. There’s this idea that we’re always getting older and older and it’s so important to be present and to live 100% of every day. We touched briefly on anxiety as well—I feel like it’s come on in the last few years, I’ve never had it before. Definitely something I need to spend time working through, but I don’t believe I’ll have it forever. And I think that idea is also a way of helping me get out of my head a little bit and stop overthinking things, which I’m sure a lot of people can relate to.”\n\n<b>“Elevate”</b>\n“This was written from a place similar to ‘Wildflowers.’ That moment where you do find someone and you fall in love and the rush of that early stage of a relationship when everything’s just amazing and even basic tasks, just like walking to the shop, feel so much fun. It does feel like a bit of a drug or whatever, and I know that that stage wears off for a lot of us, but it’s just trying to capture that moment in a song.”\n\n<b>“Happy People”</b>\n“‘Happy People’ is about finding your tribe, no matter how small it is. I think that when you get older you kind of shed a lot of things: friends or community or family that you don’t necessarily connect with anymore. The kind of people that are in my tribe are quite eccentric personalities. I feel like if I was to put them all together in the room, it would be like, ‘What is going on here?’ But they are friends that feel like family to me. My social world is quite small, and just finding contentment in that—it might be small, but it’s meaningful.”\n\n<b>“Light Years”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Light Years’ and I was like, ‘Oh, it feels like a really beautiful song. It feels really reminiscent of another lifetime or like an orbit.’ That was the moment where I was like, ‘I love this song. I think it’s fantastic.’ It’s this big song about love and meeting someone and knowing that you would wait for them in any realm, in any time and place. And obviously it’s got this nod to space within the song—that led me to Jupiter, which is where I found the concept and the theme. That was the real beginning of the album.”\n\n<b>“We All Win”</b>\n“If ‘Happy People’ is about finding your tribe, ‘We All Win’ is also about trying to bring each other up as well. How can we help and do things for each other that mean something? It’s this idea that if I win, you win too, so it’s about bringing each other up, leaving no one behind. A lot of my friends are musicians, so I feel like when someone’s making it, you feel a sense of guilt. I felt almost uncomfortable with making it, and I felt like a way of combatting that is to include people.”\n\n<b>“Poolside”</b>\n“This is supposed to be pure joy. Just pure fun. It’s probably the most pop-sounding record I’ve ever done. I studied jazz for four years and the culture of that was anti anything commercial, so I think I carried that with me for quite a long time. But I love commercial music. When I started ‘Poolside,’ it wasn’t my intention for it to come out that way, but it did, and I made peace with it and I was like, ‘This is kind of fire, actually.’ So in the spirit of Jupiter and joy, ‘Poolside’ made it on the record because that’s what I feel it brings.”\n\n<b>“30 Something”</b>\n“Coming into my thirties and not being well for a lot of it was an interesting transition. I love this song because I feel like it’s telling the story really clearly. And obviously before I was 30, I was healthy and well and living life in a way that I could absolutely do, so there was this nostalgia of holding on to being in my twenties or younger. This song is about acceptance of where I am at the moment and making peace with that… and I think I’ve definitely got there.”\n\n<b>“Just Dive”</b>\n“I’m in a place where I’m working on trying to find as much joy in everything that I’m doing, so ‘Just Dive’ is about taking a risk, taking the plunge, doing things in life that scare you, but doing it anyway. It’s a promise to myself in the future. I’d like to take a year out to travel with my kids. I know that might not sound risky, but I do rely a lot on [my] community to help me, especially with my health condition, so going at it, just my kids and my partner for a year, with no community, that’s risky for me. It sounds so small, but I'm hoping just to do it anyway.”\n\n<b>“Jupiter”</b>\n“Perhaps ‘Jupiter’ has a similar message to ‘Elevate’: Finding someone that you love and who loves you and feeling like it’s taking you to another ether, and you want to stay there and not come down from it… but we always do.”\n\n<b>“All Of Me”</b>\n“Every album needs a sexy number. A late-night number. ‘All Of Me’ is that song. Once you hear the chorus and the bassline come together and it invokes that particular mood, you can’t help but go with it. It could be this deeply sad, heartbreaking song, it doesn’t matter who’s in the room, if the song calls for that, I’m happy to explore it. So it’s the same for a sexy number as well—if the song calls for it, I’m happy to go there.”\n\n<b>“Better Days”</b>\n“For me, ‘Better Days’ is a song about someone that I was close to or that I have a fractured relationship with. The chorus says it all—that I’m just waiting for a better day when it’s not so fractious and things settle themselves. I’m sure a lot of listeners can relate to that. I rarely imagine that people don’t have a fractious relationship with a sibling or a father or a cousin or a friend, but at least want it to be better. So it’s a hopeful song that this relationship can finally heal at some point.”","short":"Nao talks Jupiter: “Good things are close by—we just have to keep going.”"},"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/27/9e/3e/279e3e69-867d-5296-8166-c094c20591be/196872583670.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"371c20","textColor2":"03202d","textColor4":"31303c","textColor1":"0b060a","bgColor":"ea7077","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jupiter/1779334922","playParams":{"id":"1779334922","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/66HcLnKvY2NUrUta3OduYH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779334922/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"935698752","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/935698752?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740153801590,"RTCI":0}}},"1779371649":{"id":"1779371649","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779371649?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/82/41/9b/82419b9c-39a6-f00e-1b04-9d3b8542e397/7d97fcdc-2d6c-456f-9281-1d36c0298b4e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202020","textColor2":"121212","textColor4":"2b2b2b","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"929292","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e8/f4/cd/e8f4cdad-7ff0-7b93-abef-bc2989b3ea05/39416b23-1851-47d2-81a2-a1db1708daa7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"39393a","textColor2":"202020","textColor4":"4a4a4a","textColor1":"0a0a0b","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-lumineers/350720227","name":"Automatic","artistName":"The Lumineers","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s fitting that The Lumineers would release a new album on Valentine’s Day 2025. The longtime roots-pop favorites have no shortage of heartstring-tugging love and heartbreak songs in their catalog, adding more with this fifth studio album and follow-up to 2022’s <i>Brightside</i>. As they did with that record, The Lumineers tapped David Baron and Simone Felice to co-produce <i>Automatic</i>, with the band notching their first co-production credit while recording the album at Woodstock, New York’s Utopia Studios over the course of a month.\n\nWhere earlier Lumineers records focused more squarely on relationships and heartbreak, <i>Automatic</i> zooms out to take stock of the collateral damage wrought by the ills of the day, like persistent anxiety on the deceptively warm and loping “Ativan” and the “black sedan of depression” referenced on the urgent and bracing opening track, “Same Old Song.” “Better Day” feels like a plainly rendered thesis statement, as singer/guitarist Wesley Schultz offers a laundry list of modern problems, like “senators [making] insider trades” and protests marred by “rubber bullets, pepper spray.” Other highlights on the album include “Plasticine,” on which Schultz subtly channels a grungier side of his vocal while lamenting artistic phoniness, and the aching “Keys on the Table,” which grapples with a loss of faith in oneself. And as for that canon of songs of love and love lost, “Asshole” is a lovely if biting addition, as Schultz squares up against his own foibles while acknowledging we all have our own dark shadows.","short":"The band’s fifth album zooms out to take stock of modern

Walk Alone","artistName":"BLOND:ISH","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"BLOND:ISH’s <i>Never Walk Alone</i> is Vivie-ann Bakos’ first full-length as a solo artist since her former partner, Anstascia D’Elene Corniere, left the project in 2019. More than a change in personnel, it’s a shift in sound and perspective from their 2015 debut album, <i>Welcome to the Present</i>. Whereas BLOND:ISH’s early music embodied the pulsating darkness of after-hours parties, Bakos now finds inspiration in the golden hour to craft house music that shines among sunsets, open spaces, and moments of connection. Guided by BLOND:ISH’s belief that everything is energy, <i>Never Walk Alone</i> is built on warmth and a kind of quiet intention.\n\nIts title track, meant to serve as a friend in times of anxiety and loneliness, is as much a rallying cry as it is a hand on the shoulder, with a chorus that loops like a mantra: “Can’t do without you/We will never walk alone.” Pep talks continue with “Self Love,” an invitation to rediscover one’s own worth, and “Different Way,” which finds optimism in life’s unique journeys. “Higher” is physically and emotionally stirring, pairing its lone refrain (“You take me higher, baby”) with sky-scraping strings and perforating drums. Elsewhere, Afro-house rhythms set the stage for deeper, more intimate moments like “Kimbe” and “How Does It Feel,” which foster connection through romance. “We Watch” is the LP’s heaviest moment, a gritty synthline underscoring its need for introspection: “You watch everything/You watch idly/Do you want it to change?” It’s the kind of tough love that reminds you that in hard times, sometimes the best friend you can have is yourself.","short":"The first full-length as a solo project features house music built on warmth."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/34/45/fd/3445fd5b-7a82-4d0a-6004-c6569b6ce54e/8721253253808.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"88c45e","textColor2":"81cce9","textColor4":"6ba8c1","textColor1":"a5ef6d","bgColor":"131a20","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-walk-alone/1781991709","playParams":{"id":"1781991709","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5B6cE705BTRvviiO1p4m0o"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781991709/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"394776491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/394776491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740139718840,"RTCI":0}}},"1782183231":{"id":"1782183231","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782183231?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fa/33/87/fa338741-86cb-3629-552f-b472447a055f/Job5ab89973-8106-4693-aff1-3ab57a6efece-182016991-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356008535_1995966645-Time1734563734752.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fcc0ac"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5b150f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"edb7b7","textColor2":"fcc0ac","textColor4":"f09a8a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5b150f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6a/de/f5/6adef50e-1f38-8e0f-cdbd-a5ff3228ad2c/Job6991e2bf-e8c6-4a3c-a338-d4937bfa2e6c-182016992-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356008536_1995966646-Time1734566111166.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"e6b79a","textColor2":"fbe294","textColor4":"ecb577","textColor1":"f4e5c0","bgColor":"af0000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/12/a8/88/12a888ab-051b-6411-a176-423db227b85f/aa2b435b-aee4-494b-aa6c-679f4dc8771f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e3cecc","textColor2":"f3eaea","textColor4":"dec6c4","textColor1":"f9f4f4","bgColor":"8b352e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/ca/cb/48cacbc7-01f4-0537-b91d-0bdf5ef0c274/83d22cce-05ed-4cc8-a481-d1807fecc83f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cc493a","textColor2":"f73120","textColor4":"cd2b1d","textColor1":"f65744","bgColor":"271111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-war-and-treaty/951165936","name":"Plus One","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"The War And Treaty","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A War and Treaty record is more than just an assortment of songs—it’s a celebration of the human voice, with husband-and-wife duo Michael and Tanya Trotter serving up a master class in vocal pyrotechnics on each track. This fourth studio album from the pair is no different, spanning 18 tracks full of meticulously crafted harmonies and playful dynamism. It’s all anchored by Michael Trotter Jr.’s larger-than-life production direction (Jesse Frasure, John Shanks, and Jonathan Singleton lend hands here, too), which blends elements of country, gospel, rock, and blues to encompass the duo’s diverse range of influences.\n\n<i>Plus One</i>, which The War and Treaty recorded at beloved Muscle Shoals institution FAME Studios, opens with the positively buoyant “Love Like Whiskey,” a co-write with Jesse Frasure and Miranda Lambert that makes ample use of a horn section, no doubt inspired by the historic studio setting. “Can I Get an Amen” is modern Southern gothic gospel at its finest, not to mention a playful showcase for the pair’s sonic quirks, as banjo rolls brush up against soulful synth. “Teardrops in the Rain” is a sweeping ballad that sounds timeless on first listen, while “Mr. Fun,” splits the difference between the funky showmanship of James Brown and the empowered pop rock of Tina Turner. Bluegrass guitar virtuoso Billy Strings is the record’s lone guest, as he joins the Trotters on “Drink from Me,” a minor-chord barn burner with some structural surprises up its sleeve.","short":"Michael and Tanya Trotter expertly craft modern Southern gothic

Songs for the Soul","artistName":"Kameron Marlowe","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Forget chicken soup. Kameron Marlowe has a foolproof remedy for a heavy heart: sad music. On this third studio album from the rising country singer-songwriter, Marlowe goes for broke on 10 tracks chronicling heartache and regret, showing more of the softer side fans glimpsed on earlier cuts like 2022 favorite “Giving You Up.” The record opens with the loose and raw “Burning House,” a cover of the 2015 Cam hit that makes evocative use of the spare, stripped-down production that characterizes the project. “Hello Whiskey” takes that sound and fleshes it out with organ and piano for a twangy, tearful song befitting of last call at a dive bar. “The Basement” dips into swampy blues à la Eric Church, and “Highway Song” adds flourishes of gospel to one of the album’s harder-edged moments. “How’s the Leaving Going,” which he wrote alongside living legend Vince Gill, is a real standout here, as Marlowe addresses an ex-flame with a weary, winking admission of romantic regret.","short":"Ten tracks that lean into heartache and

Memory</i>, come in the form of a message: “You are, you are a special gift/And you have taken the gift that God has given you.” Over the course of the album’s 13 tracks, the Pennsylvania-born rapper aims to spell out all the ways in which said gift has impacted his life. He’s both in awe of the blessings he’s received through rap and confident that he’s earned the life he’s built. Once most widely known as a producer for frequent collaborator $NOT, Triplin has taken his first crack at solo success on <i>Melody</i>, turning in a confident and infectious ode to the world and people who have shaped him. Despite the wins, Triplin is well aware throughout the project that there’s something left to be desired in his life. On “Feyoncé,” he sums it up when he raps, “I need a Beyoncé fiancé/To come and keep my mind straight, my vibe throwed off.”","short":"The rapper’s solo debut is a confident, infectious ode to his influences."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b5/de/1e/b5de1e9a-1349-cfb2-479b-8b1e0fe6be43/196872802931.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d4ded5","textColor2":"f6f7fb","textColor4":"cedbe5","textColor1":"fefbe8","bgColor":"2e6a8c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/melody-of-a-memory/1790310480","playParams":{"id":"1790310480","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5HHk3WZje18OMnqE6VzVKB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790310480/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1348832122","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1348832122?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740150830308,"RTCI":0}}},"1790446304":{"id":"1790446304","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790446304?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-20","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/beyond-frequencies/1496594522","name":"Everything I Am","artistName":"Beyond Frequencies","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1d/c8/9d/1dc89d5b-56be-581f-e04a-20d2bf98dac1/cover_4062851105224.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5c0cb","textColor2":"a6bada","textColor4":"859cb7","textColor1":"e2e7f2","bgColor":"00252c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything-i-am/1790446304","playParams":{"id":"1790446304","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Vp0INdj2dewVlGXXCLOsz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790446304/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1496594522","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1496594522?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740143691926,"RTCI":0}}},"1790453760":{"id":"1790453760","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790453760?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e3/5c/39/e35c39fa-9105-8ccd-41c0-2b2a8be2da56/e66516c9-ca46-49b9-a9b0-174d60921f29.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"303130","textColor2":"2a2e2a","textColor4":"484c4a","textColor1":"0c0c0a","bgColor":"c1c6c9","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/debians/1563487525","name":"4Play -

A former ATV mechanic, Matthew brings that everyman ease to his take on country music, which leans on rock and R&B-tinged pop, and should court fans of other rougher-edged artists like HARDY and Cody Jinks.\n\nThis third album from Matthew opens with “DRIVES MY TRUCK,” a catchy Southern rocker that doesn’t reinvent the truck song, but does reinvigorate the form with some soulful muscle. “NO NAME ROADS” turns small-town musings into a power ballad, and fan favorite “YOU TURN” makes use of another driving metaphor for a slow-burn love song that name-checks Nashville’s famed Broadway strip. Matthew is a rare Nashville native, which adds a sense of immediacy to “DRIVING THROUGH MY HOMETOWN,” a nostalgic celebration of the good old days that toes the line between heartfelt and humorous, with production reminiscent of early Sam Hunt. And Lauren Alaina joins Matthew on “HEART HALF EMPTY,” a melodic duet with shades of Lady A and Little Big Town.","short":"The Nashville native brings soulful muscle and everyman ease."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/59/53/cf5953d7-b68d-32ec-c23e-fd28ffd8044e/093624837206.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1d1d1","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"b3b3b3","textColor1":"f8f8f8","bgColor":"383838","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chase/1790681697","playParams":{"id":"1790681697","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3WEYGQDPPAMYBCZHXh5vTH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790681697/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1454254169","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1454254169?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740127264973,"RTCI":0}}},"1791206022":{"id":"1791206022","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791206022?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7d/3a/dc/7d3adce6-fc87-2a24-31b2-df3002224b1d/3fe10789-801e-4081-96f7-468518029f55.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1a1a18","textColor2":"040302","textColor4":"1d1b19","textColor1":"010102","bgColor":"7f7c72","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1d/bf/f0/1dbff03b-6f85-15df-5b98-62eba1f64676/753f1f18-a877-4615-aad0-b10ddc9d7531.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"84bed1","textColor2":"99cdde","textColor4":"82b0be","textColor1":"9adff6","bgColor":"29393e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ohgeesy/1329579414","name":"Paid N Full","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"OhGeesy","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/51/d5/28/51d52887-7c8b-1ac1-3580-47283246f3cb/075679618993.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"8aaec3","textColor2":"76d1e0","textColor4":"5ea7b3","textColor1":"add9f4","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paid-n-full/1791206022","playParams":{"id":"1791206022","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/33xTOJ4e7JhkOvmdJ57dT4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791206022/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1329579414","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1329579414?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740122636968,"RTCI":0}}},"1791731782":{"id":"1791731782","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791731782?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/82/d0/38/82d038db-1ade-fac6-1043-4ce025180f41/71977d52-3c0d-406b-b007-d173c94b68f7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b4b5a3","textColor2":"c9c2a8","textColor4":"a49e8a","textColor1":"dddec8","bgColor":"121211","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/spy/1584189389","name":"Seen Enough -

It seemed that Imagine Dragons had skipped the “humble upstart” phase and proceeded straight to full-blown arena-rock spectacle with their blend of Coldplay-esque schmaltz and Obama-era Americana of the “stomp-clap-hey!” variety, with a pinch of EDM thrown in for maximum festival appeal.\n\n<i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> became the Dragons’ first album to debut atop the Billboard 200, buoyed by a lead single, “I Bet My Life,” that still feels omnipresent on rock radio, and in Truck Month commercials. Ten years later, <i>Reflections</i> celebrates their sophomore album’s anniversary with 13 unreleased tracks from the original recording sessions, plus a folksy demo version of “I Bet My Life.” The band wrote a good deal of <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> on the road during their massive, 170-date 2013-2014 world tour, which might explain the “Imagine Dragons on island time” riddims of “Woke” or the French touch of “Monica,” a disco number about letting a date down easy. Needless to say, the Dragons let it all hang out here, from the “Kraftwerk meets filthy dubstep drops” of “The Ghost Intervention” to the experimental noise-rap of “I Get Carried Away.”","short":"The

On his sophomore full-length, <i>Kansas Anymore</i>, he sings of love, sometimes, but mostly of love lost. He’s a broken spirit, looking for a way forward, and this angst is perfectly opposed by the sugary sweet deliveries he sprinkles throughout the project.\n\nTake opener “Writing’s on the Wall,” which finds Pillsbury nursing his wounds, unable to explain to his father that his feelings are different from the way his old man felt. “Dad’s on the phone and he’s lecturing me/’Bout a girl that he met when he was 19,” he sings a cappella, before pulsing drums and crunching acoustic guitar chords transport the singer to the rolling hills of Laurel Canyon circa 1970.\n\nOn “Superglue,” Pillsbury finds himself in the middle of a fling turned serious, employing stripped-back instrumentation that allows him plenty of room to outline the narrative stakes. “I can make it complicated,” he threatens, before knowing emotions will only cause harm: “You just want a little TLC.” Throughout <i>Kansas Anymore</i>, Tucker Pillsbury is loving the wrong person at the wrong time, wanting dinner when they want coffee, or thwarting off a desperate partner he thought to be a friend.","short":"Tucker Pillsbury is nursing some wounds on his second album."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/72/85/d9/7285d9b7-2ac1-f560-6a1c-379f79a87e4e/25UMGIM07949.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"a7a7a7","textColor1":"efefef","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kansas-anymore-the-longest-goodbye/1793693749","playParams":{"id":"1793693749","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5gZFprukMkMJiEKEgf3q1f"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793693749/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"199215762","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/199215762?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740134695529,"RTCI":0}}},"1793844019":{"id":"1793844019","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793844019?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/74/8a/0c748ad4-c0da-2f29-124a-2969dc83c17b/c09c20e2-667e-43e0-8796-bb971a631128.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b09b88","textColor2":"cbb19e","textColor4":"a69181","textColor1":"d8bea6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/passion/79608287","name":"Call On Heaven (Come, Lord Jesus) -

The Baja California singer effectively stormed the genre in 2024, both via singles and his notable placements on two of the year’s biggest albums—Peso Pluma’s <i>ÉXODO</i> and Tito Double P’s <i>INCÓMODO</i>. Benefitting from those wins, his full-length debut, <i>Mi Vida Mi Muerte</i>, aims to plant his proverbial flag as a soloist while bringing prior collaborators and newer ones along for the proverbial ride. Indeed, those aforementioned acts come through with strong appearances on salacious corridos in the tumbado tradition, the former on “Morena” and the latter on “Chiquita.” The stacked guest list also includes Gabito Ballesteros, Óscar Maydon, and Chino Pacas, not to mention two features from Luis R Conriquez. Those names suggest a certain genre purity, something Vega excels at on solo moments such as “Chrome Corazón” and “M&M.” Still, he branches out into hip-hop, reggaetón, and pop stylings as well via “Me Ha Costado,” “Loco,” and the title track.","short":"Baja California’s rising star makes his full-length debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bf/b8/7b/bfb87bdf-9da6-880f-0fca-f74f22135f5b/1963622918315_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5bfc2","textColor2":"b0c7d9","textColor4":"90a3b4","textColor1":"deeaeb","bgColor":"121622","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mi-vida-mi-muerte/1793946413","playParams":{"id":"1793946413","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/338NDGMHtB4t5mp8RhMnh3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793946413/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1686896695","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1686896695?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740135190242,"RTCI":0}}},"1794049581":{"id":"1794049581","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794049581?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/06/dd/5d/06dd5d38-151a-ea95-944d-808a4c3b53d7/Job3958ac0e-79ca-4911-a9aa-e541ed899f19-185529142-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363019375_2049462010-Time1739221452117.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201f39"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0e0f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3a2d30","textColor2":"201f39","textColor4":"41415b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0e0f","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6b/40/35/6b403524-a6a8-5de8-e68c-9a318b9e24ad/3e60b7cb-9dca-4551-9ab5-da13b946d146.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d7d8da","textColor2":"eeeeef","textColor4":"d1d2d3","textColor1":"f6f6f7","bgColor":"5c5f65","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b7/bf/fd/b7bffda5-1192-7694-4616-234cd4a7ace2/Job49262cc7-0e0c-42c5-a80b-7be99ccfd229-185529141-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363019374_2049462011-Time1739220563502.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201f39"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0e0f"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"302933","textColor2":"201f39","textColor4":"3f3f59","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0e0f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/65/44/cc/6544cc7b-a84c-8e3d-da2f-2a7a44b156c4/4031184f-3c9c-4ec5-98ce-c86c7512aafe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bebcde","textColor2":"d2d1f8","textColor4":"b7b6dd","textColor1":"dad8fa","bgColor":"4d4c6e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c5/85/95/c5859509-0d8f-2d50-d302-fd57e2487afd/dbd463de-c278-4415-a7f9-3b2a2ff54627.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"352e34","textColor2":"201d20","textColor4":"3c3941","textColor1":"180f11","bgColor":"aaaac4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jisoo/1548008317","name":"AMORTAGE - EP","artistName":"JISOO","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","short":"Of the four BLACKPINK members, JISOO has been the most measured in stepping into her solo era. Spearheaded by laid-back trap-pop track “Flower,” 2023’s <i>ME</i> saw the Korean vocalist and K-drama actress become the final member to release solo music—to massive success. But the two-track single album was slight, leaving fans wanting more. JISOO’s four-track follow-up, and her first since departing from YG Entertainment and Interscope Records as a soloist in 2023, is <i>AMORTAGE</i>—a portmanteau of “amor” and “montage.” This definition is borne out across the dance-pop album, which explores the reality-rocking attraction at the beginning of love (“earthquake”), the immersive capacity of being in love (“Your Love”), the sting of heartbreak (“TEARS”), and the power of moving on (“Hugs & Kisses”).\n\nAll four tracks on <i>AMORTAGE</i> were produced by Blissoo, the K-pop agency JISOO formed in 2024, and music production duo The Wavys. Unlike her previous solo tracks, JISOO co-wrote the songs on <i>AMORTAGE</i> alongside Jordan Roman and others. The Wavys and Roman were also part of the team that crafted K-pop girl group IVE’s “Rebel Heart,” another early 2025 release."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/5e/4a/1c5e4a1b-96bf-9df9-d468-aeccc45e2e3e/093624833550.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"322c39","textColor2":"201f39","textColor4":"413f5b","textColor1":"0d0810","bgColor":"c4c0e1","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/amortage-ep/1794049581","playParams":{"id":"1794049581","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794049581/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1548008317","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1548008317?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740133212531,"RTCI":0}}},"1794242883":{"id":"1794242883","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794242883?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hannah-mcfarland/1177106649","name":"Broken Hearts -

The five-track EP is a speed-run through the stages of grief, in this case regarding a messy breakup—only replace “bargaining” with “eviscerating your sorry excuse for a friend group,” and swap “depression” for “cheating on you right back.” No surprise that by the snarling closer, “Lick Back,” Coi’s fully got her groove back.","short":"A barbed five-track speed-run through the stages of grief."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/26/9a/c1/269ac1d8-1f27-4cb1-63d5-a405d1e1841c/196872854824.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e3b36","textColor2":"252120","textColor4":"504e4c","textColor1":"0e0a04","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-happened-to-forever-ep/1794427265","playParams":{"id":"1794427265","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794427265/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1358539712","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1358539712?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740132646707,"RTCI":0}}},"1794428189":{"id":"1794428189","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794428189?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-20","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jeff-russo/61738994","name":"Zero Day (Soundtrack from the Netflix Series)","artistName":"Jeff Russo","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a7/3a/90/a73a9065-cc1b-810e-b1f9-933d5ceec94f/810123165803.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3c5c4","textColor2":"f2d0c4","textColor4":"c2a69d","textColor1":"f4f6f5","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/zero-day-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-series/1794428189","playParams":{"id":"1794428189","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3mouyDxYfuso2u7L7DMXZs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794428189/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"61738994","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/61738994?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740132506912,"RTCI":0}}},"1794538731":{"id":"1794538731","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794538731?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kidd-g/1493048248","name":"F-150 -

Whether setting the plays for an undeniable club hit on “Giza” or pondering the redemptive power of his mother’s love on the Ami Faku-featuring “LOML,” the Ikorodu singer is as enigmatic as he is unclassifiable. In 2024, with the exception of a collaborative label album, <i>Vibez Incorporation Mixtape, Vol. 1/<i>, and the birthday-celebrating release of <i>Loseyi Professor</i>, the street-pop star did not put out any solo work, a stark contrast to the prolific streak he had maintained since 2022’s <i>Billion Dollar Baby</i> announced him as a star.\n\nOn 2025’s <i>Children of Africa</i>, Seyi Vibez makes a swaggering return to the Afropop arena while delivering a reminder of his nimble mastery of melodies. Across four songs, the street-pop star makes his best attempt to convince us that he is living his best life. There are numerous references to his material success, his jet-set lifestyle, and the pieces of jewelry he has accumulated, as well as chest-thumping warnings for his opps. Constant creative partners TBM and Dibs miss out on this set, with production handled here by larrylanes and Semzi. American rapper NLE Choppa joins for a braggadocious celebration on “MACHO,” and Seyi Vibez delivers a fiery anthem for his street supporters on “SHAOLIN.” Things come to a head on “HAPPY SONG,” a delicate reminder to embrace joy in defiance of the struggles that may occur in our day-to-day lives.</i></i>","short":"A luxuriant status update to kickstart the street-pop star’s new era.

It was one of the first songs we wrote for the band. And we just wanted to frame it in a new way, so we stripped it down, gave it a mellow vibe and it feels like it’s taken on a new life.” “Ripple” is a song that means a lot to Good Neighbours, so the duo felt it was even more special to give it a new treatment. “The song itself was always quite a deep one for us. It was written about my friend going through grief, and we sort of hid behind the production of this song for quite a while,” say Fox and Verrill. “So it’s nice to let it take on a bit of a new form where the words are at the forefront, and people can hear the message we’re trying to tell them about.” \n\nFor their cover, the boys went for a dreamy version of Gracie Abrams’ “That’s so True” because they think the original is “an absolute belter.” “This song has been everywhere and we can’t escape it,” they say. “But, for once, it’s a song that we actually love and we don’t want to escape. We’re big fans of Gracie Abrams and the album so it’s cool just to put our spin on this tune.” They came up with the new versions while touring across North America with Foster the People during early 2025: “Both of these were made on our bus.

For this spiritual sequel to 2022’s <i>Peace “Fly” God</i> that also technically serves as the 12th installment in his <i>Hermes</i> series, the Griselda impresario once again centers Estee Nack and Stove God Cooks, who collectively and respectively appear on seven of these 11 tracks. Their joint presence on trio cuts “BOSWELL” and the Daringer-produced “VEERT” pushes the fashionably flamboyant FLYGOD back towards coke-rap braggadocio and surrounding themes of luxury amid violence. (Even as his cohorts talk street business, he still fires off a big brag about parallel parking a Bugatti.) The duo moments shine as well, with Stove reminiscing about the recipe with Gunn on “055” and Nack mixing ugly business with filthy pleasure on “BURY ME WITH A STOVE.”\n\nA standout presence on 2024’s <i>Still Praying</i>, Brother Tom Sos returns here for two songs in a move that furthers Gunn’s artistic patronage. On “HEALTH SCIENCE,” he moves the proceedings towards something resembling what used to be dubbed conscious rap, while on “GUMBO YAYA” he transforms murderous metaphors into a more principled path. Though better known for his production placements on Mach-Hommy’s <i>#RICHAXXHAITIAN</i> and Conway The Machine’s <i>Slant Face Killah</i>, Elijah Hooks makes an unexpected if rewarding appearance over Conductor Williams’ “DUMP WORLD.” The album’s sole solo joint, “OUTLANDER” allows Gunn to synthesize all of <i>12</i>’s ideas with his signature WWE nods and the mournful reflections that came to the fore on his preceding <i>11</i> EP.","short":"FLYGOD returns with Estee Nack and Stove God Cooks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/6e/66/be6e664c-d0ce-ad50-3c22-a2a59f0ac048/8721253690696.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ba8144","textColor2":"f70000","textColor4":"d00304","textColor1":"dc9d50","bgColor":"341014","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/12/1795063368","playParams":{"id":"1795063368","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3LtZUOfccDjNs18684twS8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795063368/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829760702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829760702?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740117967553,"RTCI":0}}},"1795123986":{"id":"1795123986","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795123986?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jay-wadley/570527932","name":"Heart Eyes (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Jay Wadley","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/5f/30/ca5f3060-0b61-eb4d-1be1-d3db5939a54b/780163669220.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdaa3a","textColor2":"fe0100","textColor4":"cd0304","textColor1":"fed144","bgColor":"0a0d16","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heart-eyes-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1795123986","playParams":{"id":"1795123986","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0MqDrO5ZDlBiW6eJFMVeY9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795123986/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"570527932","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/570527932?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740115259276,"RTCI":0}}},"1795512297":{"id":"1795512297","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795512297?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-14","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/1a/83/bc/1a83bc60-c8ee-6ccb-abec-19037eb15d26/Jobb279636d-1052-4da2-a948-62751e800106-185791979-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363559992_2053470135-Time1739489140252.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","460d0f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"242b2b","textColor2":"460d0f","textColor4":"512f33","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/19/48/95194837-0668-1a8e-d128-24603ceff19c/80af6082-c89f-4978-8597-5cd9e71284a6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1aca5","textColor2":"c2bfbb","textColor4":"9f9d9c","textColor1":"d8d1c7","bgColor":"15171d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f1/db/21/f1db215c-bcb2-61f2-0590-81588114ce1d/Job676e01c9-30ec-4721-92de-011152373a9a-185791980-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363559991_2053470134-Time1739491341361.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"1f292b","textColor2":"270e08","textColor4":"342f2d","textColor1":"0d0705","bgColor":"69b2c4","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c0/61/61/c0616115-7b56-faea-8d0d-3fc248965bb0/d4e09273-0e35-4a9b-b278-13a54cf3a5be.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7d0d4","textColor2":"b8d6f5","textColor4":"9bbeda","textColor1":"eeecec","bgColor":"2b5f72","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sabrina-carpenter/390647681","name":"Short n' Sweet (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sabrina Carpenter","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Some people kill their nemeses with kindness; Sabrina Carpenter, the breakout pop star of summer 2024, takes the opposite tack, shooting withering one-liners at loser exes via featherlight melodies, a wink and a smile. The former Disney Channel star began her music career at age 15 with her 2014 debut single “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying.” Now 25, the singer-songwriter is making the catchiest, funniest, and most honest music of her career at a moment when all the world’s watching. But on songs like “Please Please Please,” on which she begs her boyfriend not to embarrass her (again), she’s poking fun at herself, too. “A lot of what I really love about this album is the accountability,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I will call myself out just as much as I will call out someone else.”\n\nIt’s not because Carpenter’s “vertically challenged,” as she puts it, that she named her sixth album <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>. “I thought about some of these relationships, how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most,” she tells Lowe. “And I thought about the way that I respond to situations: Sometimes it is very nice, and sometimes it’s not very nice.” Hence songs like “Dumb & Poetic,” a gentle acoustic ballad that’s also a blistering takedown of a guy who masks his sleazy tendencies with therapy buzzwords and a highbrow record collection, or the twangy, hilarious “Slim Pickins,” on which she croons: “Jesus, what’s a girl to do?/This boy doesn’t even know the difference between there, their, and they are/Yet he’s naked in my room.”\n\nWith good humor and good taste (channeling Rilo Kiley here, Kacey Musgraves there, and on “Sharpest Tool,” a bit of The Postal Service), Carpenter reframes heartbreak through the lens of life’s absurdity. “When you’re at this point in your life where you’re almost at your wits’ end, everything is funny,” Carpenter tells Lowe. “So much of this album was made in the moments where there was something that I just couldn’t stop laughing about. And I was like, well, that might as well just be a whole song.” \n\nCarpenter wrote a good deal of the album on an 11-day trip to a tiny town in rural France, where the isolation unlocked her brutally honest side, resulting in unprecedentedly vulnerable music and one song she readily admits shouldn’t work on paper but hits anyway: “Espresso,” the song that catapulted her career with four delightfully strange-sounding words: “That’s that me espresso.” “There really are no rules to the things you say,” she tells Lowe on the songwriting process. “You’re just like, what sounds awesome? What feels awesome? And what gets the story across, whatever story that is?” Still, she’s painted herself in a bit of a corner when it comes to placing an order at coffee shops worldwide: “They’re just waiting for me to say it,” she laughs. “And I’m like, ‘Tea.’”","short":"Still sweet but less short: four new tracks including a Dolly

Also, don’t miss Kid Massive’s “House Music (Move Your Body),” featuring Jim C, which he calls an “outstanding remix full of energy that takes you to another level.”","short":"Put in work with a

Wick","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Florida rapper Nardo Wick was still at the tail end of his teens when <i>Who Is Nardo Wick?</i> dropped in 2021. Its songs shared his stark vision of the streets in such a way that artists older than him could’ve learned a thing or two from his pen. A little over three years later, his sophomore full-length, <i>WICK</i>, goes deeper into the darkness, with booming beats that recall drill and trap at their most austere ends.\n\nThe chilling monologue of “Gangsta” sets the mood early on, his bars veering between direct threats and tweaked references. In his signature snarl, even the Hamburger Helper punchline on “Ain’t No Lettin’ Up” feels intimidating. No small feat, he transforms menace into macabre turn-up tracks with “I Don’t Think” and “Get on My Nerves.” Though the production dwells largely on the dour side, he switches things up on occasion, revealing a sense of humor for “Beatbox” and flirting in the glow of ATL Jacob’s subtle throwback funk on “A Lil Different.”\n\nWhile the vast majority of <i>WICK</i>’s tracks solely center him, the handful with guests tend toward those who were there for his debut. A clear influence on his forbidding style, 21 Savage flexes amid sexual conquests on “HBK,” a lifestyle the younger artist has evidently grown accustomed to as well. Future and Southside raise the tempo and the stakes alike for the disorienting “Back to Back,” while Lil Baby helps Wick relive an era of Southern rap that neither was previously old enough to fully appreciate on “Hot Boy.”","short":"The Florida phenom dwells in the darkness on his second album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a4/aa/a6/a4aaa6d1-deaf-6ea4-32c2-5a43cf353bd5/196872485721.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"93a694","textColor2":"d2b495","textColor4":"ae967a","textColor1":"b1c9b5","bgColor":"1d1e0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wick/1796462494","playParams":{"id":"1796462494","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796462494/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1509337198","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1509337198?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740153645497,"RTCI":0}}},"1796482917":{"id":"1796482917","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796482917?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":40,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/ac/69/0cac6960-db7e-bf4c-d42c-4a0e764d72fb/2fb3dcab-45b1-40e4-95ea-22507af7e0e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d8c5b5","textColor2":"fad9ba","textColor4":"d9bea4","textColor1":"f9e2cf","bgColor":"56514d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=555348065-200779145","name":"Dom Dolla b2b Solomun at The Wool Store Melbourne, 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Dom Dolla & Solomun","editorialNotes":{"short":"In late 2024, the cavernous Melbourne venue reopened with this massive B2B."},"artwork":{"width":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/92/6c/be926c8b-aaaa-d326-df41-54be39b86bce/4827d25e-3b79-44ae-9b0f-7d31f619d5b8.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2160,"textColor3":"d7b624","textColor2":"efca38","textColor4":"cfaf39","textColor1":"f8d31f","bgColor":"53423b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dom-dolla-b2b-solomun-at-the-wool-store-melbourne-2024-dj-mix/1796482917","playParams":{"id":"1796482917","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796482917/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"555348065","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/555348065?l=en-US"},{"id":"200779145","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/200779145?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740112344162,"RTCI":0}}},"1796483843":{"id":"1796483843","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796483843?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joey-bada%24%24/577261450","name":"Pardon Me -

The album collects some of their previously released material with an ample amount of new recordings that keeps the same energy. Business and pleasure blur together on “Caravana” and “Tú Tú Tú,” coming together in a strange balance for “Happy.” When that attitude tips towards a purer romantic longing on “Ay Mija,” it offers greater insight into their inherent talents.\n\nNaturally, their music industry benefactor JOP comes through for a couple of Fuerza Regida collabs, including the characteristically solid “Como Capo.” Luis R Conriquez makes two appearances here as well, first on the opener “Ni Modo Que No” and later on their prior hit “No Son Doritos.” Similarly, the defiantly debauched “Pasaportes” finds them re-teamed with “Tu Coquette” cohorts Los Dareyes De La Sierra.","short":"The rising Californian act delivers streetwise corrido
