Grift","artistName":"Panda Bear","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Noah Lennox used to feel as though his solo work as Panda Bear was, in his words, “disparate and separate” from the music he’d make with Animal Collective. But now, over two decades on, it seems more like one continuous project. “Playing drums in AC, singing in AC, writing songs for AC, doing features, doing remixes, doing this record where I’m collaborating with all these different people or getting these different flavors from different people,” Lennox tells Apple Music, “it all kind of feels like part of the same creative wave.”\n\n“This record” is <i>Sinister Grift</i>, the first Panda Bear album to feature contributions from all three of his Animal Collective bandmates—David “Avey Tare” Portner, Brian “Geologist” Weitz, and Josh “Deakin” Dibb—not to mention collaborations with Patrick Flegel (aka Cindy Lee) and SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE’s Rivka Ravede. Recorded at his home studio in Lisbon and in his hometown of Baltimore, it’s meant to feel like a contemporary take on an early rock ’n’ roll record, with Lennox opting to illuminate the natural qualities of the music, rather than distort or deliberately obfuscate them, as he did on 2019’s <i>Buoys</i>. “It still feels very contemporary, very plug-in, very digital audio workstation to me,” he says. “There’s echoes of older music that I love in there, but there’s no retro-ness to it, I hope. I’m not a big fan of that kind of thing.”\n\nFront to back, the album is meant to mirror what Lennox calls the “playful menace” at the heart of its title—an idea he’d had before he’d written a single lyric. Before falling into the abyss of its second half, the music feels effervescent even when the songs themselves are anything but. “‘Sinister grift’ is this lie that we tell ourselves, that if we’re just careful enough or if we’re ‘good people,’ we can somehow avoid suffering or regrets, mistakes, hurting ourselves or people—this very inevitable part of living,” he says. “I like contrast. I feel like the light is lighter when it’s put against darkness, or things are funnier when they’re addressing something really dark. But it really started just because I liked the title. I like how it sounded, I like how it looked on paper. It sounds kind of dumb, but sometimes things start really simply like that.” Here, Lennox takes us inside a few songs from the album.\n\n<b>“Praise”</b>\n“It kind of started as a song thinking about my son—the anecdote about him not picking up his phone is very real. But then it became a song more about fatherhood and then a song about parenthood. There’s this fire driving the relationship, where it feels like no matter what the kid does, he’s not calling you back. If he’s maybe being a little difficult or acting up, there’s this sense that there’s an underlying force, that unbreakable thing that drives the relationship.”\n\n<b>“Anywhere but Here”</b>\n“I stole pretty wholesale the idea from a [The] Louvin Brothers song called ‘Satan Is Real,’ where there’s a vocal refrain, and then he preaches or tells the story for a second. I’m a huge fan of that record, but that song specifically. I thought it would be cool to try to do my own version of that. I think my original idea was to ask my daughter Nadja to do the spoken-word part, which she wrote. But then I asked Dean Blunt to do it, and he was down, but he couldn’t. Ultimately, I was so excited about getting my daughter onto the thing and, lucky for me, she was down to do it eventually—as long as I paid her.”\n\n<b>“Ends Meet”</b>\n“This song always reminds me of ‘Monster Mash.’ It’s a song about appreciating life, including the more difficult things. The ‘Monster Mash’-iness comes from the sense that there’s something coming to get you—these difficult things in life are going to happen to you, no matter what you do. But it’s said in this very playful way, which I hoped was fun. I find that telling a joke is a way to enter into a difficult conversation. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.”\n\n<b>“Just as Well”</b>\n“I’m a huge reggae fan, huge dub fan, and I’m always looking for a way to do something that feels reggae without explicitly being reggae, and there’s a couple attempts on this record. I’d say ‘Just as Well’ is one and the other ‘50mg,’ which feels a bit like a cross between a reggae track and a country track to me. I feel like this song is maybe the best attempt I’ve made at doing something that feels like an impression of reggae. It’s something that I feel like is always in me, but doing a version of it that feels genuine is difficult.” \n\n<b>“Ferry Lady”</b>\n“There’s a lot of percussion in it, but it’s not actually a drum kit playing, unlike most of the other songs. It feels kind of like the gateway to the second half of the record to me. It’s in between the lightness and the dark, the ferry from one side of the record to the other. It’s about any type of relationship that has ended and hasn’t ended like you thought it would, about people growing apart.”\n\n<b>“Venom’s In”</b>\n“‘Venom’s In’ is about having a reality thrust upon you in life and not wanting it. It feels like the character in the song can tell that change is coming and wants to stop it, but knows it’s impossible. So the venom is already in the body, the change is going to happen. It’s a pretty desperate song to me—it feels very low.”\n\n<b>“Elegy for Noah Lou”</b>\n“That one represents the original vision for the record, insofar as I thought we were going to do these straight-ahead recordings: guitar, bass, drums, singing, and I would play everything. The original idea was to spend months following the recordings, abstracting those forms or blurring them. But as we worked with the arrangements, we got the structures and the tone of the stuff really right, so a lot of the stuff felt like it was done, like it didn’t need to grow into anything else. So that idea of blurring everything we left behind, except you hear it a little bit in this wasteland section of the record. ‘Elegy for Noah Lou’ is where it kind of feels like the song is sort of there, but it’s muted and more like an impression of the song than a song.”\n\n<b>“Defense”</b> \n“I was a huge fan of Patrick [Flegel]’s, from Women forward. He had played some shows with the rest of the AC guys at some point, had stayed at Josh’s place coming through Baltimore once or twice. We actually recorded right before <i>Diamond Jubilee</i> came out, so I kind of feel like I snuck it in a little bit. It was just one of those things where Patrick was the first person I thought of to do it. I knew Patrick could handle the guitar work and, thankfully and very luckily for me, Patrick was down to do it.”","short":"“I like contrast”: Noah Lennox dives into the details of his seventh solo

Suddenly, I could see this world for us to head into. There was this prophecy in our heads about what we could achieve.”\n\nWith kinetic singles that take on tribalism (“Whiplash”), mortality (“Blackhole”), and disgruntled fans (“Seeing Red”), Searle realized early on that the record didn’t have a unifying lyrical theme. “I spent five months trying to think of an album title that would put a nice little bow on it, that was memorable and poetic, so I ended up using a lyrical reference,” he says. “I just felt like it suited the mood and aesthetic of the album.” Below, he discusses each song.\n\n<b>“Elegy”</b>\n“I don’t think we’ve ever had a song like this before. Thematically, it’s about defiance. It’s about overcoming obstacles, overcoming doubt—other people’s doubt. I think this might not even have existed in reality, but we had created this mindset where people doubted us. So, it just felt like the right thing to open the album with a statement of defiance: ‘Fuck you if you doubted us. We’re still here.’ It’s complete bravado—a bit of a chest-out, standing-tall statement of belief and intent.”\n\n<b>“Whiplash”</b>\n“This song is about tribalism, the world we live in today. I don’t really gravitate towards writing songs that are political statements these days. Looking back at our previous work, we’ve become different people. So, I try not to do that anymore because I just don’t know how I’m going to feel next year. This song is a bit broader: It’s such a divided world right now, and there’s so many forces contributing towards that. So, it’s a bit of a cynical commentary on how we’re incapable of treating each other with respect when we have a difference of opinion and see the world a different way.”\n\n<b>“Blackhole”</b>\n“This one revisits some themes from our older stuff a little bit. It’s pondering mortality and the battles that we face day to day—and how those battles look when they’re silhouetted by the backdrop of dying, by how insignificant so much of our suffering is in the face of inevitability. Obviously, all of us see friends or family get sick, and this stirs up all sorts of thoughts and feelings within us. When we wrote that song, that had come up in our lives. I was asking myself, ‘What’s this all about? And why am I wasting my time suffering over nothing?’”\n\n<b>“Everything Ends”</b>\n“This is about acknowledging that no matter how much I’m suffering in a particular moment, that suffering will end. That could be dying, but it could also be when you’re in a bad space and it feels like it’s forever. And then you wake up one day, like, ‘Oh, I feel kind of better. And I don’t know when that started happening.’ A lot of it is conversational in the sense that I’m almost communicating with my partner in the song. There’s a little bit of excuse-making and apology. I’m aware that when I’m suffering, the person that has to bear the brunt of that is my wife. And that’s probably the same for everyone—their partner gets the worst of it. So, the song is a reminder that no matter how bad things get, the sun will rise again.”\n\n<b>“Brain Dead”</b>\n“This is a collaboration with House of Protection, and I feel like this is probably the most fun song on the record. It was definitely written in that spirit. I had this idea for a song called ‘Brain Dead’ for a while, and it suited this hardcore punk aesthetic that we delved into on this song. I was thinking about modern life and the way we anaesthetize ourselves, whether it’s through phone addiction or alcohol or weed or brainwashing ourselves with news media or whatever. So many of us are unconsciously just giving up our lives, and we kind of yearn to be numbed and not have to feel too much. Would we rather just be dumb and ignorant? There’s a part of me that would. So, it’s a tongue-in-cheek hardcore anthem for stupidity.”\n\n<b>“Evil Eyes”</b>\n“On this song, I’m anthropomorphizing my own inner dialogue of anxiety as something that’s outside of me. It’s sort of like me saying, ‘I’m going to overcome this; I’m overcoming this.’ But the verses are about me just being furious at the anxiety and trying to attack it and venting my frustration at dealing with these feelings all the time. But ultimately, the song is quite a positive one. There is some defiance, but it’s more about me overcoming myself and overcoming the self-destructive qualities that I have, so I can live another day.”\n\n<b>“Landmines”</b>\n“This is about me knowing that I need to do things to be a better person, a better husband, a better dad, a better human being—but ignoring those things, setting them aside, making excuses, and carrying on living in a less-than-desirable way. It’s about being self-destructive, and it’s about knowing you’re doing it and carrying on anyway. I feel as though I see that everywhere. It’s like when we know we’ve got to do something, but we don’t do it. And we all experience that. We know what’s good for us, but we so often don’t do it. And we make excuses all the time. We justify our apathy. It’s part of being human.”\n\n<b>“Judgement Day” (feat. Amira Elfeky)</b>\n“I think this is a bit of an old-man song in a way. It’s about digitally induced dread, this experience of living under the cloud of what the internet shows me and the way that it distills all the terrible things that are happening in the world into a neat little package for me every day. So, I’m asking, ‘How natural is that? Are we really wired to deal with that?’ I really feel for young people, and I can’t imagine what it’s like to grow up under that cloud. I’ve got young kids, and I wonder what it’s doing to them. I’m not sure it’s a good thing.”\n\n<b>“Broken Mirror”</b>\n“I suppose this is a little bit like ‘Everything Ends’ in the sense that I think the song is me getting mad at myself about being a bad partner. I’m probably a little bit hard on myself at times, and when I feel that I’ve gone too far lyrically and I’m being too brutal on myself, Sam usually reads the lyrics and says, ‘No, that’s exactly what it should be like.’ So, I guess Sam probably experiences this maybe even more than me. But I was just trying to examine who I am and how I operate within the framework of a human relationship and how much I ask another person to tolerate.”\n\n<b>“Curse”</b>\n“Our producer told me, ‘You can only have one old-man song on this album,’ but I was freaking out about getting old. I’m going gray. I’m reaching that point in my life where the signs of aging are very clear. We can laugh about it, and we ought to just accept it, of course. But it’s weird because my brother died when he was 28, and for a long time, that fueled this total acceptance of aging. I had about eight years of not caring that I’m another year older because Tom died when he was 28. So, every year beyond that is a gift. And then, suddenly, that fuel just ran out. I was like, ‘Oh, fuck. I’m going to be 40, 50, 60…’ But I know I should just make the best of it and enjoy the ride.”\n\n<b>“Seeing Red”</b>\n“Before this record, we did a couple of albums that were less heavy. The internet gave us a bit of a hard time about it, and we took it personally. So, I had this idea that we should write a heavy song about fans wanting us to be heavy, but we should make it fun and a bit of a joke. I think it’s probably one of the first songs we’ve ever written where I had lyrics before anything else. One of the first lines is, ‘I felt it when they said, “We only ever love you when you’re seeing red.”’ That very much set the tone. For all the heavy themes on this record, a lot of it was made in the spirit of fun—especially this song.”\n\n<b>“Chandelier”</b>\n“It’s hard to know how to end an album, but this was very much a purpose-built album-closer. It’s got a little bit of the same DNA as ‘Elegy,’ so it felt like a good way to bookend the album. At first, it felt like quite a bleak song lyrically, but after we finished it, I just had this complete 180 where, suddenly, the lyrics were speaking more of how beautiful life is and how it’ll still be beautiful without us. The world continues to evolve after our light goes out, so we’re just here to enjoy it as best we can and witness it and try to understand it. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. And that’s OK.”","short":"“It takes a lot more to get attention on your 11th album.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2d/4a/fa/2d4afae7-9309-63db-4434-1959d2eda5c4/0045778806461.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacecd","textColor2":"9bc6cd","textColor4":"7da1a6","textColor1":"fbfffe","bgColor":"090e0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sky-the-earth-all-between/1774393621","playParams":{"id":"1774393621","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2W82VyyIFAXigJEiLm5TT1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774393621/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"182821355","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/182821355?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740743310913,"RTCI":0}}},"1775725236":{"id":"1775725236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775725236?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/oversize/1487326037","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Vital Signs","artistName":"OVERSIZE","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/eb/e8/12/ebe812d0-a575-5e43-20dd-687aa0b267c1/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"fb4635","textColor4":"d03e30","textColor1":"eff2f2","bgColor":"261f1e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vital-signs/1775725236","playParams":{"id":"1775725236","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6o4g14eoR5pb5ogKfAdBCB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775725236/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1487326037","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1487326037?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740719842913,"RTCI":0}}},"1775966071":{"id":"1775966071","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775966071?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/everything-is-recorded/1229251135","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/11/05/48110517-74e9-836c-d39f-a152847687c4/291087d9-317c-4bc9-ab65-fc63f3bea46a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5b5b6","textColor2":"c6c0c6","textColor4":"a29da2","textColor1":"dedee0","bgColor":"121211","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/0e/62/060e622c-2d78-34bd-f5d7-e05e3b0c2a05/929c12ff-84e3-4ffc-bcce-18dd9307f691.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0937f","textColor2":"cbab95","textColor4":"a88e7d","textColor1":"d5b098","bgColor":"1c1c1e","hasP3":false}},"name":"Richard Russell Is Temporary","artistName":"Everything Is Recorded","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"For his third album under the banner of Everything Is Recorded, producer and XL Recordings founder Richard Russell had nothing smaller than the very existence of humanity on his mind. On <i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i> he taps a lengthy, wide-ranging list of collaborators—including Florence Welch, Bill Callahan, Sampha, Oscar-nominated actor Samantha Morton, and Kamasi Washington—to strip down their sounds and face life’s fragility head-on.\n\nWhile that existential uncertainty hangs over much of the sparse landscape of <i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i>, unifying its many voices, so does the prospect of life beyond Earth. “‘Spirit,’ I think, is probably the simplest way of [saying] it,” said Russell. “So, when David Bowie passes away, everyone’s distraught because it turns out he’s temporary—but we shouldn’t be too surprised by that. We know that what he’s done is permanent. The influence of it, the love, the inspiration is there forever.”\n\nThat ideal comes to the fore on the Callahan collaboration “Norm,” which pays tribute to the late cult-hero comic Norm MacDonald, and samples him riffing on mortality during a 2011 performance: “When the fuckin’ sickle of death is over my goddamn neck, I’m gonna be so cowardly. I’m afraid of going on Ferris wheels,” MacDonald cracks in irascible fashion, before Callahan swoops back in to note that his “voice and face live on” even after his 2021 death. Sampling his honesty about life’s last chapters was a reminder, Russell says, that “the humor is so important to everything—the humor is the sanity, just in life generally.”\n\n<i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i> is a rare feat, an all-star album that feels born from a collective spirit of creativity and curiosity. “I don’t want to speak for any of my collaborators,” Russell says. “I got the feeling they were really enjoying participating in this project. Maybe that’s because they’ve all got their own careers, and your career comes with pressure—you’ve got to think about everything. In a situation like this, you don’t have to, because I’ve got to think about it. So, you get to come in the room and do it.”","short":"An all-star album born from a collective spirit of creativity and

Watching","artistName":"Sam Fender","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It was during a time-out after the whirlwind success of his 2019 debut <i>Hypersonic Missiles</i> and its 2021 follow-up <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> that Sam Fender realized what his third album needed to be. Those two records had made the singer-songwriter from Northeast England one of the breakthrough artists of the past decade, a homegrown superstar who’d gone from playing local venues to stadiums and now had a pair of BRIT Awards sitting on his mantelpiece. But Fender had felt a little rushed making <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> and he was determined that it wouldn’t happen again, no matter how long it took. Allied to that, he also wanted to hold to a simple and concise aim. “When writing the past two albums I started with a clear goal and concept, but towards the end of recording it always morphed into something else—at least for me it did,” Fender told Apple Music when announcing <i>People Watching</i> in November 2024. “I wanted to go in there and write good songs; not think about some grandiose overblown message, just 10/11 good songs about ordinary people.”\n\nHis patience paid off. <i>People Watching</i> is Fender’s most perfectly realized release to date. Its title neatly sums up the emotional connection at the heart of the 30-year-old’s music and his supernatural gift for wrapping everyday tales in an exhilarating, euphoric release. It’s still his beloved hometown that remains the primary focus but in Fender’s dexterous hands, the place has become a prism through which he sings about grief, family, mental health, poverty, homelessness, the government, and more.\n\nSonically, <i>People Watching</i> is the most sumptuous work of his career, one that builds on the bounding, Springsteen-style expanse and emerges with a technicolor indie-rock masterpiece stacked with another raft of killer choruses for the masses to sing along to. Fender nodded to his love of The War on Drugs on <i>Seventeen Going Under</i> and here he goes one step further, enlisting the band’s mercurial leader Adam Granduciel as co-producer alongside Markus Dravs (Coldplay, Arcade Fire, Florence + the Machine).\n\nNothing here is overloaded. Even at its most epic, there’s an intricacy and airiness about these songs, Granduciel’s synth flourishes adding a dynamic counterpoint to Fender’s rousing hooks. It’s a record of many shapes and textures, taking in the urgent classic rock of the title track, yearning anthems (“Little Bit Closer”), contemplative Americana with a bit of a swagger about it (“Wild Long Lie”), and wistful ’80s pop (“Crumbling Empire”). At its best, it pairs his love of US heartland rock with an Oasis-style jubilance. In its minor chord acoustic strums, “Chin Up” even has echoes of “Wonderwall” about it.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine Noel and Liam attempting a song like “Remember My Name,” the stirring, stark closer made up of nothing but Fender’s vocals and the moving horns of the Easington Colliery Band, an emotive salute to his northeast roots and a song that places Sam Fender out there on his own. <i>People Watching</i> may well be the sound of an artist entering his imperial phase.","short":"The indie-rock star’s exhilarating set of “good songs about ordinary

Close To What","artistName":"Tate McRae","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The 21-year-old Canadian multi-hyphenate has barely stopped to take a breath since kindergarten: She began intensive dance training at age six, scored a record deal at 16, and tied for top nominee for the 2025 JUNO Awards. Her third studio album arrives just a few months after the end of her 2024 world tour in support of her sophomore album, 2023’s <i>THINK LATER</i>. “Being on tour for a year feels like a million years—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I have been gone for a lifetime,’” McRae tells Apple Music, though naturally she used the time as a learning opportunity. “Being onstage every night and analyzing yourself that much, you become uber-aware of yourself and what’s going on.” She began paying closer attention to exactly what kind of songs inspired her to move, what beats triggered her dancers to get—in a word—“nasty.”\n\n<i>So Close to What</i> is not exactly a club record—more like a pop record you can viscerally feel, conducive to the kind of choreo that makes a killer stage show. Prominent on McRae’s mood board were Timbaland and The Neptunes, whose kinetic productions made the aughts feel like the future. Echoes of sparkly, club-friendly 2000s R&B abound: “bloodonmyhands” recruits Flo Milli for a Miami bass throwback, while “Purple lace bra” lands somewhere between The-Dream’s <i>Love vs. Money</i> and Lana Del Rey’s <i>Born to Die</i> (which checks out, given the latter album’s producer, Emile Haynie, among the credits). And on “Sports car,” McRae and co-writer Julia Michaels found unlikely inspiration in a 2005 crunk classic. “[Michaels] had been dying to reference the Ying Yang Twins’ ‘The Whisper Song,’ and I was like, ‘That’s crazy,’” she says. Sure enough, the concept worked.\n\nThe secret to writing her most grown-up album to date, as McRae explains, was a writer’s room that skewed heavily towards women (including Michaels and songwriter Amy Allen). “With music and finding perspective on situations, no one quite understands like another girl,” McRae explains. “You need another girl to know exactly what we’ve gone through and to know what it actually feels like in order to write a song. When you’re in a writing session, you have to be one brain together, and if it’s not that, that’s when chaos happens,” she went on. “It is so liberating to be with other girls and talk about things that are so frustrating and then feel so satisfied and accomplished after.”","short":"Echoes of 2000s R&B and visceral pop abound on her third album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/51/8a/29/518a29f3-5915-662a-d861-663e6d0fbfe4/196872648911.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2aa8e","textColor2":"e1b69a","textColor4":"ba977f","textColor1":"d7cead","bgColor":"1c1815","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/so-close-to-what/1779319620","playParams":{"id":"1779319620","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3w32SV56JvtJXsrYtThwzP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779319620/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1446365464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1446365464?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740748843796,"RTCI":0}}},"1779909636":{"id":"1779909636","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779909636?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aasar/1512125571","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I, The Hell - EP","artistName":"AASAR","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/7b/8e/ae7b8ed1-8002-6a23-9486-8442f0499826/198846904283.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cac8c9","textColor2":"cdcbcc","textColor4":"aba9aa","textColor1":"f4f2f3","bgColor":"222222","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-the-hell-ep/1779909636","playParams":{"id":"1779909636","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779909636/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1512125571","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1512125571?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752669849,"RTCI":0}}},"1780000935":{"id":"1780000935","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780000935?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/enemy-inside/1416766637","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Venom","artistName":"Enemy Inside","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d9/33/71/d9337164-ccd1-1f27-e15e-c2c035dd9263/4262464732491.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"0492cf","textColor2":"0091ec","textColor4":"0074c6","textColor1":"05b6f8","bgColor":"00002c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/venom/1780000935","playParams":{"id":"1780000935","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4DhutNBHQqWZiy8QR2g6g8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780000935/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1416766637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1416766637?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752712099,"RTCI":0}}},"1780518314":{"id":"1780518314","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780518314?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/banks/2775067","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/09/0a/59/090a5973-6903-8f74-5779-1aaffffe7321/1d445461-e60a-4ecd-acac-8393cf4863d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ddccc5","textColor2":"f9e7d4","textColor4":"dbcbb9","textColor1":"fce9e2","bgColor":"615a4e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/9d/27/b29d27d0-8663-d573-50c6-bec546182e22/70380d62-a337-49dc-8f26-9e795a00ff9c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5a0a0","textColor2":"d2c1b8","textColor4":"a89b94","textColor1":"cdc7c6","bgColor":"040407","hasP3":false}},"name":"Off With Her Head","artistName":"BANKS","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Even when she’s rejecting therapists’ advice and flipping the bird to exes’ exes, BANKS sounds positively revitalized on her fifth studio album <i>Off With Her Head</i>.

The callback is more than skin-deep, as BANKS brings back several key collaborators from her early days—including UK dance impresarios like Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Lil Silva, as well as moody alt-R&B auteur SOHN—to pitch in when it comes to <i>Off With Her Head</i>’s sonically multifarious production. A few new friends join in, too: Sampha’s unmistakable vocals mark the pulsing pop of “Make It Up,” while the ascendant rap superstar Doechii brings her fiery personality on “I Hate Your Ex-Girlfriend” with unmistakable lyrical bon mots like “Wrap a bow around your coffin like it’s Christmas.”","short":"Sharp electro-pop that recalls her star-making 2014

Black","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP and Interview","standard":"Rebecca Black continues to rewrite her myth in real time. Since becoming famous overnight as a teenager with her 2011 viral smash “Friday,” the Los Angeles singer has spent nearly a decade proving she’s more than a novelty. If her 2023 debut album, <i>Let Her Burn</i>, was an untamed exploration of sound, <i>SALVATION</i> is where she sharpens her vision. The EP’s title came to Black on a subway ride in London, sparking a fascination with salvation—not just as a religious concept, but as a personal reckoning. “<i>SALVATION</i> is based around this idea of letting some of the less-safe, less-poised, less-sweet versions of myself into my world,” she tells Apple Music. She amplifies, and sometimes even embraces, those once-buried versions of herself with newfound fearlessness, declaring on the title track, “I love being disgusting,” before a defiant retort: “I don’t need you to save me/I already saved myself.”\n\nLeaning into Black’s self-described “unhinged” instincts also unlocked bolder production choices, from layering a perky chorus over walloping techno on “Sugar Water Cyanide” to the whip-cracking, laser-strobing rave of “TRUST!” Yet, for all its bravado, <i>SALVATION</i> also demands a deeper vulnerability. “Tears in My Pocket” finds intimacy in fragility, while “Do You Even Think About Me?” digs into unresolved heartbreak. Where the latter lingers in longing, “Twist the Knife” bites back, its sweeping orchestration fueling Black at her most vengeful and dramatic. “As I was letting these more dangerous parts of myself be shown, it almost felt like a protective mechanism,” she says. “Because if I make it larger than it is, it feels less naked.” Read on as Black breaks down <i>SALVATION</i>’s core tracks.\n\n<b>“Salvation”</b>\n“It felt really energizing to explore this really sexy, really unafraid, very direct version of myself that I hadn’t before. The song is all about taking ownership of the version of yourself you are, regardless of whether anybody else understands. I like juxtaposition. There’s a bit of rapping happening—that, against a super melodic, ultra-harmonized chorus that feels to-the-bones of the pop that I grew up with in the mid-2010s, was really nostalgic for me. It felt right, given it’s basically a song about being gay as fuck.”\n\n<b>“TRUST!”</b>\n“‘TRUST!’ felt daring. It felt like the least seriously I had ever taken myself. Genuinely, if I had known three years ago that I would have a song where the chorus is, ‘Ooh, la la, get me going like ga ga ga,’ I would’ve been so afraid that people would’ve gone, ‘Is this bitch fucking stupid? She thinks she can do “Friday” and then do this, and we’re going to treat it seriously?’ That felt like a moment of freedom where there was something really exciting and invigorating. It felt like a banger instantly.”\n\n<b>“Sugar Water Cyanide”</b>\n“I forget what [co-writers Jesse Saint John, Nightfeelings] and I were listening to or how we landed on the idea, but it was the first time in a while that I had started writing a song without a lot of prior thought around it. I wanted to make something that felt really visceral, and really sexy, and really fun. I knew that I wanted to take a big risk sonically that day. We landed on this juxtaposition of this very sugary-sweet verse with this truly deathly chorus. It felt like the most emblematic version of me I could put in a song. Lyrically, it felt so fun to create an energy that wasn’t the story of meeting someone or an experience. It was just about a feeling and trying to put words to that in the most Rebecca way possible.”\n\n<b>“Tears in My Pocket”</b>\n“‘Tears’ felt like such an informative first song for the rest of the project. Something else I wanted to explore was minimalism and space and silence in songs. It was the first time I felt like I had successfully done that without losing energy, because I didn’t want [this project] to be soft. I wanted to create something bright and in your face, and that has the same level of impact—maybe even more—as a song that has a thousand elements of production. This was probably the first time I left a session on the day with an almost-finished song. That was also a big practice for me, learning not to touch whatever we first landed on.”","short":"The onetime viral star continues to rewrite her myth in real

Music Sessions: Lindsay Ell - Single","artistName":"Lindsay Ell","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Apple Music Session","standard":"Lindsay Ell’s voice can break your heart and make it soar on this Apple Music Session, which she opens with a new take on her own track, “pain tolerance,” a tale of resilience in the face of toxic relationships. “I spent so much time thinking that having a high pain tolerance was something I should be proud of, a badge of honor even,” she tells Apple Music. “This song was a turning point for me. Writing it made me realize that tolerating pain doesn’t make you strong. I hope that when people hear it they are reminded that it’s not their responsibility to carry the weight of anyone else’s emotional baggage, but instead to listen to themselves and make decisions from there.”\n\nThe Calgary-born singer-songwriter is no stranger to stadium gigs, having toured in Shania Twain’s band, but she lets her voice take center stage in a reimagining of Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood (Taylor’s Version).” “When this song came out, it was so refreshing to me because it felt like Taylor was publicly standing up for herself,” she says. “She funneled all of her anger and hurt into a song and it became an anthem for anyone who has been crossed by someone they thought was a friend. I give you ‘Bad Blood (Lindsay’s Version).’ My reimagined version pays homage to how I think I would have initially felt in the same situation—sad that someone I loved turned out to be different from who I thought they were.” Press play to hear Ell’s raw but soothing session now.","short":"A new take on “pain tolerance,” plus a Taylor Swift cover (Lindsay’s Version)."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/28/e4/3b/28e43b03-fca2-639c-563c-c7b230eb2964/24UM1IM41729.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d3d3","textColor2":"9cc4c5","textColor4":"84a4a5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-sessions-lindsay-ell-single/1786193895","playParams":{"id":"1786193895","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786193895/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"309273947","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/309273947?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740720656353,"RTCI":0}}},"1786199251":{"id":"1786199251","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786199251?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/serpentwithfeet/992302389","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/03/e4/26/03e42601-1c38-e9cd-1e07-ea1c13f2a846/ee952cc6-d002-4761-a42c-763541a7fa33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ced2cb","textColor2":"eaf0f7","textColor4":"c5cdd5","textColor1":"f5f6ea","bgColor":"33444d","hasP3":false}},"name":"GRIP SEQUEL","artistName":"serpentwithfeet","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Baltimore native spent his teenage years training to become an opera singer; later, he spent time in Philadelphia’s neo-soul scene and released his debut EP, 2016’s <i>blisters</i>, on the experimental electronic label Tri Angle. Since then, serpentwithfeet’s sacred/profane music has had the scope to take in his big ideas and sweeping influences, though his third album, 2024’s <i>GRIP</i>, nudged his “pagan gospel” music into much freakier territory. That album embraced turn-of-the-century R&B à la Timbaland and Darkchild to tell a strobe-lit love story that unfolded in the shadows of the club. A year later, the nine new tracks of <i>GRIP SEQUEL</i> showcase serpent at his most vulnerable (literally, in the case of “SEAGULL,” where he romps naked on the beach). “My heart, the ocean, mostly unexplored/My body, cold metal, longing to be forged,” he sings on the hushed, impressionistic “WANDERER.” That classical training shines through on “WRITHING IN THE WIND” over understated piano and a faint Jersey club beat, as he exhales, “A mangled heart writhing in the wind/Let me mend it.”","short":"Nine tracks that show a more vulnerable side of the 2024 “pagan gospel”

Memory</i>, come in the form of a message: “You are, you are a special gift/And you have taken the gift that God has given you.” Over the course of the album’s 13 tracks, the Pennsylvania-born rapper aims to spell out all the ways in which said gift has impacted his life. He’s both in awe of the blessings he’s received through rap and confident that he’s earned the life he’s built. Once most widely known as a producer for frequent collaborator $NOT, Triplin has taken his first crack at solo success on <i>Melody</i>, turning in a confident and infectious ode to the world and people who have shaped him. Despite the wins, Triplin is well aware throughout the project that there’s something left to be desired in his life. On “Feyoncé,” he sums it up when he raps, “I need a Beyoncé fiancé/To come and keep my mind straight, my vibe throwed off.”","short":"The rapper’s solo debut is a confident, infectious ode to his influences."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b5/de/1e/b5de1e9a-1349-cfb2-479b-8b1e0fe6be43/196872802931.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d4ded5","textColor2":"f6f7fb","textColor4":"cedbe5","textColor1":"fefbe8","bgColor":"2e6a8c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/melody-of-a-memory/1790310480","playParams":{"id":"1790310480","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5HHk3WZje18OMnqE6VzVKB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790310480/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1348832122","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1348832122?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740743397908,"RTCI":0}}},"1790433888":{"id":"1790433888","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790433888?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shygirl/456494592","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6a/cb/00/6acb0041-da98-c7d8-3812-fc8eecceffe6/56134bbf-165c-4992-95ce-dce20fdbfabc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"181919","textColor2":"040202","textColor4":"1a1a1a","textColor1":"010101","bgColor":"757b79","hasP3":false}},"name":"Club Shy Room 2 - EP","artistName":"Shygirl","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The vocalist/DJ Blane Muise came of age in the South London club scene before debuting as Shygirl in 2016. In the years to follow, her bawdy blend of pop, rap, and forward-thinking electronics became beloved by club kids worldwide, though as her profile had risen, she’d admittedly grown disengaged from the scene herself. Her first <i>Club Shy</i> EP, released in February 2024, was a conscious return to the dance floor, with 15 euphoric minutes of pure serotonin release. A year later, <i>Club Shy Room 2</i> plays out like an after-party that finds Shygirl leaning further into her hip-hop and grime influences alongside a formidable girl gang. That includes reggaetón maverick Isabella Lovestory, R&B luminary Jorja Smith, and the California rapper Saweetie, who makes herself at home on the raunchy “Immaculate,” which the pair debuted last year on Charli xcx and Troye Sivan’s Sweat Tour. Indeed, in a post-<i>Brat</i> landscape, the intersection of pop and club music feels as vital as ever, but Shygirl’s been about this life.","short":"An after-party that leans into hip-hop and grime influences."},"artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e2/1e/61/e21e6189-466d-723e-5d2c-4b6ad3c759f9/5056556156116_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3500,"textColor3":"483a45","textColor2":"1c1d1f","textColor4":"493c49","textColor1":"1b1b1b","bgColor":"ffb6ed","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/club-shy-room-2-ep/1790433888","playParams":{"id":"1790433888","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790433888/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"456494592","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/456494592?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752604361,"RTCI":0}}},"1791782864":{"id":"1791782864","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791782864?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mike-posner/333687585","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2d/c6/e4/2dc6e45d-320b-7778-ef1c-0b0422f864d0/Jobbe088d2c-01bf-4f96-990d-6e9997f8d9cc-184218801-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_360257147_2028491031-Time1737486363322.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dbdbdb","textColor4":"afafaf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/02/23/d3/0223d364-05b2-c257-4a3e-046ed7a6c77c/Job4389d492-5a4f-44a8-adf0-e05c0406245a-184218802-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_360257146_2028491032-Time1737487928118.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"cbcbcb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/48/70/3b/48703b4e-5004-1afd-50f4-f060202b0d85/7a59382f-0691-45ab-b6ba-88351053b909.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c9c9c9","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"c0c0c0","textColor1":"f3f3f3","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/77/fb/d7/77fbd75d-8a28-e96b-52ea-6ad8793c66a6/1461ac40-f529-467f-b521-9d0f1801f6ee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c5","textColor2":"eeeeee","textColor4":"c2c2c2","textColor1":"f3f3f3","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Beginning","artistName":"Mike Posner","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Detroit-bred singer and producer Mike Posner is a music industry veteran, but on his fifth studio album, he starts over.

It seemed that Imagine Dragons had skipped the “humble upstart” phase and proceeded straight to full-blown arena-rock spectacle with their blend of Coldplay-esque schmaltz and Obama-era Americana of the “stomp-clap-hey!” variety, with a pinch of EDM thrown in for maximum festival appeal.\n\n<i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> became the Dragons’ first album to debut atop the Billboard 200, buoyed by a lead single, “I Bet My Life,” that still feels omnipresent on rock radio, and in Truck Month commercials. Ten years later, <i>Reflections</i> celebrates their sophomore album’s anniversary with 13 unreleased tracks from the original recording sessions, plus a folksy demo version of “I Bet My Life.” The band wrote a good deal of <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> on the road during their massive, 170-date 2013-2014 world tour, which might explain the “Imagine Dragons on island time” riddims of “Woke” or the French touch of “Monica,” a disco number about letting a date down easy. Needless to say, the Dragons let it all hang out here, from the “Kraftwerk meets filthy dubstep drops” of “The Ghost Intervention” to the experimental noise-rap of “I Get Carried Away.”","short":"The band’s huge second album gets a 10th-anniversary companion piece."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/af/1c/24/af1c24a0-7143-0ae3-164d-49a21e5168ff/25UMGIM03303.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0b0a7","textColor2":"dec8b0","textColor4":"bbaa95","textColor1":"d1d1c6","bgColor":"2f302b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reflections-from-the-vault-of-smoke-mirrors/1791818110","playParams":{"id":"1791818110","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IBigZKJt8uffeMjKw5uEl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791818110/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"358714030","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/358714030?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740720014555,"RTCI":0}}},"1791950639":{"id":"1791950639","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791950639?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/misanthrope/89748079","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Death Ascent","artistName":"Misanthrope","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/98/7e/0e/987e0ead-095e-06df-a945-c76902208c9f/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5c4aa","textColor2":"eae0ce","textColor4":"d5c4aa","textColor1":"eae0ce","bgColor":"805019","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/death-ascent/1791950639","playParams":{"id":"1791950639","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4tOlWVDNf2jvpz9G0wjzSr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791950639/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"89748079","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/89748079?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752722274,"RTCI":0}}},"1792030280":{"id":"1792030280","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792030280?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sepulchral-curse/1193302325","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Crimson Moon Evocations","artistName":"Sepulchral Curse","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a4/d9/d1/a4d9d1b7-b7bb-8169-cbbf-3ed4dc2d7093/657628450825.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c03c53","textColor2":"fc201e","textColor4":"cd1d1b","textColor1":"eb4764","bgColor":"131210","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crimson-moon-evocations/1792030280","playParams":{"id":"1792030280","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0vqHeTUpFpEYOGvXL5wFDp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792030280/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1193302325","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1193302325?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752573186,"RTCI":0}}},"1792085076":{"id":"1792085076","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792085076?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/saint-jhn/1133442919","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/af/6a/27/af6a2726-874f-6203-8e33-aaa4923cef6a/Joba056171f-cf40-4f42-aad1-c9b66f9193e9-186359949-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364642637_2061775872-Time1740096072459.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","181818"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"403f20","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"414023","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7f/98/d1/7f98d162-178e-519e-005b-7d20bbb0e5e1/Jobaebeec59-2d26-47ed-94ec-a3eb63cf672f-186359950-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364642636_2061775871-Time1740097220410.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cfcd4d","textColor2":"f8a666","textColor4":"d1905c","textColor1":"f5f253","bgColor":"383836","hasP3":false}},"name":"FESTIVAL SEASON","artistName":"SAINt JHN","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"If anyone knows something about <i>FESTIVAL SEASON</i>, it’s SAINt JHN, the Brooklyn-hailing singer and MC whose “Roses (Imanbek Remix)” has been tearing down electro festivals since its release back in 2018.

Invigorated by touring life, Godwin dreamt up a handful of new tunes to follow his acclaimed 2023 record <i>Family Ties</i>, writing while on the road and recording what would become this EP with bandmate Al Torrence. The tracks serve as a snapshot of Godwin’s evolving artistry, retaining the vivid and thoughtful perspective of earlier material while exploring more narrative forms of storytelling.\n\nThe EP opens with its title track, a sketch of rural romantic longing with an understated, dynamic vocal. Godwin gets an assist from Ernest on “Dead To Rights,” a yearning love song about unexpected romance, with gently dizzying guitars mimicking the disorientation that comes with falling hard and fast. Closing out the EP is the Scott Avett (The Avett Brothers) collaboration “Hammer Down,” a touching cover of the 2005 <i>What Comes After the Blues</i> cut by Magnolia Electric Co., a project of the late, beloved songwriter Jason Molina, whose influence is felt across this understated collection. Godwin and Avett hew closely to the raw spirit of the original on their tribute, fleshing out the arrangement with piano and a rhythm section without sacrificing the song’s vital intimacy.","short":"Seven songs from the road that explore vivid, narrative storytelling."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c1/60/ff/c160ff00-fd5e-281e-8e22-3f4f10ee8620/25UMGIM05385.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3a79a","textColor2":"cdc0b9","textColor4":"a99f99","textColor1":"d9cabb","bgColor":"1c1b17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonely-mountain-town-ep/1792333248","playParams":{"id":"1792333248","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792333248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1441994025","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1441994025?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740746703724,"RTCI":0}}},"1792484212":{"id":"1792484212","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792484212?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/craig-morgan/709770","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/23/84/c8/2384c833-9e69-6b43-9b37-dc08d2fa749d/Job5126a5d7-7c0f-4cd9-8ade-7437b0aa4c91-186091213-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364100903_2057766999-Time1739847245544.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201810"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"202124","textColor2":"201810","textColor4":"362f28","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/25/6d/b2/256db238-a51c-ff3e-8055-511f2dff83fa/Job886c81a4-9578-4f88-9cd6-ba44b4de25aa-186091214-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364100902_2057766998-Time1739848783070.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cd9f8a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"a1a5a6","textColor2":"cd9f8a","textColor4":"a48374","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"American Soundtrack -

Yet “GOD DID” is what the general public knows him for. It’s a powerful song with equally powerful collaborators (Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, JAY-Z, John Legend), but with <i>Some Days I’m Good, Some Days I’m Not</i>, one of hip-hop’s favorite chorus artists is out to prove there’s plenty more to love.\n\nLike the voice of Fridayy himself, <i>Some Days I’m Good, Some Days I’m Not</i> is both inherently gospel and R&B, the singer splitting his time between devotions to significant other and to higher power. You can hear how enamored he is with a particular woman’s body on “Baddest in the Room,” but then also about how grateful he is for his gifts on “Look to You.” He yearns to inspire on songs like “Sun Comes Down,” “Desert,” and “Better Days,” while tracks like “Shotgun,” “Saving My Love,” and “One Call Away” exist very clearly to make hearts flutter. The project’s 21 tracks present a surprisingly harmonious dichotomy, one that Fridayy distills on “February ’23,” when he raps, “We at the club, they shaking ass while we give God the glory.”","short":"Get to know the “GOD DID” singer for what else he can

Whether setting the plays for an undeniable club hit on “Giza” or pondering the redemptive power of his mother’s love on the Ami Faku-featuring “LOML,” the Ikorodu singer is as enigmatic as he is unclassifiable. In 2024, with the exception of a collaborative label album, <i>Vibez Incorporation Mixtape, Vol. 1</i>, and the birthday-celebrating release of <i>Loseyi Professor</i>, the street-pop star did not put out any solo work, a stark contrast to the prolific streak he had maintained since 2022’s <i>Billion Dollar Baby</i> announced him as a star.\n\nOn 2025’s <i>Children of Africa</i>, Seyi Vibez makes a swaggering return to the Afropop arena while delivering a reminder of his nimble mastery of melodies. Across four songs, the street-pop star makes his best attempt to convince us that he is living his best life. There are numerous references to his material success, his jet-set lifestyle, and the pieces of jewelry he has accumulated, as well as chest-thumping warnings for his opps. Constant creative partners TBM and Dibs miss out on this set, with production handled here by larrylanes and Semzi. American rapper NLE Choppa joins for a braggadocious celebration on “MACHO,” and Seyi Vibez delivers a fiery anthem for his street supporters on “SHAOLIN.” Things come to a head on “HAPPY SONG,” a delicate reminder to embrace joy in defiance of the struggles that may occur in our day-to-day lives.","short":"A luxuriant status update to kickstart the street-pop star’s new era.

Debuting as a member of one of K-pop’s most successful groups of all time in 2006, G-DRAGON would go on to become a celebrated songwriter and performer, a fashion icon, and a global symbol of Korea’s music industry. When G-DRAGON made his solo debut in 2009 with <i>Heartbreaker</i>, it became the best-selling album by a Korean soloist at the time.\n\n<i>Übermensch</i> is G-DRAGON’s third solo studio album, coming more than a decade after his last full-length album, 2013’s <i>Coup d’Etat</i>. While <i>Übermensch</i> may be G-DRAGON’s solo outing, it begins with “HOME SWEET HOME,” a raucous pop-rock track featuring BIGBANG co-members TAEYANG and DAESUNG and dedicated to the group’s fans. Elsewhere on the album, G-DRAGON taps Anderson .Paak (“TOO BAD”), Nile Rodgers (“TAKE ME”), and LunchMoney Lewis (“GYRO-DROP”) as musical collaborators.\n\nDrawing inspiration and its name from the 1883 work <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, <i>Übermensch</i> is G-DRAGON’s attempt to transcend his previous efforts as a musical artist. It’s a tall order, given G-DRAGON's expansive, pioneering musical work leading up to the release of the 2025 album, though one the Korean artist seems up for in <i>Übermensch</i>. “A limited edition of the second generation, a masterpiece of the century,” G-DRAGON raps in self-assured “POWER.” “Do not waste your time, yeah, it’s gotta be me/Prove ’em all wrong, I’ve got all the receipts.”","short":"The BIGBANG member and “King of K-Pop” aims for a masterpiece."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/99/9b/ef/999bef4b-91ba-8724-ee22-251396b48cd6/197342954327_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b1a11","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"362a23","textColor1":"1c0300","bgColor":"b67756","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/%C3%BCbermensch/1794882375","playParams":{"id":"1794882375","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4FviRd7FubuuGNVt2qME1G"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794882375/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"320373708","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/320373708?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752724555,"RTCI":0}}},"1794888449":{"id":"1794888449","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794888449?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brett-kissel/198540474","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6d/22/76/6d227638-89c3-a42c-fec6-3e6f2297d679/befdf465-54cf-419c-9ac5-ad8514a61b76.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cac8b0","textColor2":"eaeadb","textColor4":"c6c6ba","textColor1":"efeccf","bgColor":"373635","hasP3":false}},"name":"Let Your Horses Run","artistName":"Brett Kissel","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Brett Kissel is only in his mid-thirties, but the Alberta-born singer-songwriter has been in the country music game since debuting in 2003 at the age of 12. It’s fitting, then, that this album from Kissel is lived-in and comfortable, as the award-winning artist stretches out a bit and serves up his take on contemporary country rock. Highlights include opener “Cowboys & Dreamers,” a loose and moody road song with a rambling beat, and the title track, which urges listeners to live with abandon.\n\nKissel also brings along some of the friends he’s made over the years, tapping collaborators for four tracks. Emerging Texas singer-songwriter Don Louis joins Kissel on “Get the Hell Out of This Town,” a midtempo ballad with an unexpected narrative, as a down-and-out man buys the town preacher a beer and the two commiserate as “burned-out believers.” “Two of Us” features up-and-comer Cooper Alan, who also co-wrote the tune, for a Kenny Chesney-esque celebration of knocking back a couple cold ones after a long week of work. Country veteran Phil Vassar lends an assist on “Rich Is,” a tender, ’90s-influenced portrait of spiritual wealth. And Kissel closes out the project with the Morgan Klaiber collaboration “All This Cowboy Needs,” an emotional duet with a classic country sound.","short":"A lived-in and comfortable set from the

The collection opens with “Twister,” a riff-laden rocker worthy of Wetzel’s winking lyrical admission of being “half-cocked insane.” The energy stays at a 10 from there and doesn’t let up, with the driving and melodic “9 Lives (Black Cat)” leading into the grungy “April Showers.” Other highlights of the set include a spirited take on 2016 <i>Noise Complaint</i> favorite “February 28, 2016,” which serves as a reminder of Wetzel’s near-decade journey to his current stardom, and a raw rendition of “Austin,” appropriately performed at UT Austin’s famed Moody Center.","short":"A career-spanning taste of the Texas star’s raucous live shows."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2a/30/2f/2a302f2b-45c5-8f47-7f45-7630da485e3f/196872866087.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3b3b","textColor2":"2f2f2f","textColor4":"505050","textColor1":"151515","bgColor":"d5d5d5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-the-damn-near-normal-tour/1796056431","playParams":{"id":"1796056431","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2oa6sd6X59IMadOEMqQTUp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796056431/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1139953953","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1139953953?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740719606179,"RTCI":0}}},"1796156641":{"id":"1796156641","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796156641?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/autumn-tree/1629551644","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Highnoon Madness","artistName":"Autumn Tree","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/e1/52/55e152eb-35a9-574b-c91f-e0f5bee751ce/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b1a58d","textColor2":"cec5a7","textColor4":"a9a38a","textColor1":"d7c7ab","bgColor":"181a17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/highnoon-madness/1796156641","playParams":{"id":"1796156641","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4jAbX7caujkVJftQGORtjG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796156641/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1629551644","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1629551644?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740720274355,"RTCI":0}}},"1796265388":{"id":"1796265388","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796265388?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":37,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/paolo-buonvino/15978688","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Il Gattopardo (Colonna Sonora Della Serie Netflix)","artistName":"Paolo Buonvino","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/75/1b/39751bd1-b5fb-3dfd-6e0e-247e89ce297a/810123165865.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2d0cf","textColor2":"f4ba8e","textColor4":"c99a75","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"211a12","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/il-gattopardo-colonna-sonora-della-serie-netflix/1796265388","playParams":{"id":"1796265388","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6lKdnYMsdEjj0voYJ0kQ6E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796265388/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15978688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15978688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1739489263084,"RTCI":0}}},"1796403491":{"id":"1796403491","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796403491?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ella-henderson/567487911","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"City Sessions – Live -

Its songs shared his stark vision of the streets in such a way that artists older than him could’ve learned a thing or two from his pen. A little over three years later, his sophomore full-length, <i>WICK</i>, goes deeper into the darkness, with booming beats that recall drill and trap at their most austere ends.\n\nThe chilling monologue of “Gangsta” sets the mood early on, his bars veering between direct threats and tweaked references. In his signature snarl, even the Hamburger Helper punchline on “Ain’t No Lettin’ Up” feels intimidating. No small feat, he transforms menace into macabre turn-up tracks with “I Don’t Think” and “Get on My Nerves.” Though the production dwells largely on the dour side, he switches things up on occasion, revealing a sense of humor for “Beatbox” and flirting in the glow of ATL Jacob’s subtle throwback funk on “A Lil Different.”\n\nWhile the vast majority of <i>WICK</i>’s tracks solely center him, the handful with guests tend toward those who were there for his debut. A clear influence on his forbidding style, 21 Savage flexes amid sexual conquests on “HBK,” a lifestyle the younger artist has evidently grown accustomed to as well. Future and Southside raise the tempo and the stakes alike for the disorienting “Back to Back,” while Lil Baby helps Wick relive an era of Southern rap that neither was previously old enough to fully appreciate on “Hot Boy.”","short":"The Florida phenom dwells in the darkness on his second album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/75/a5/fa/75a5fa3b-be15-0661-51ac-9b2d5b597085/196872485721.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"95a07c","textColor2":"d2b991","textColor4":"ab9677","textColor1":"b7c598","bgColor":"0c0d0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wick/1796462494","playParams":{"id":"1796462494","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796462494/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1509337198","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1509337198?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740720706432,"RTCI":0}}},"1796600530":{"id":"1796600530","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796600530?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=824331126-63424339","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Like Father Like Son","artistName":"Tre Savage & Webbie","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0b/1b/a7/0b1ba729-7c0e-60b5-b481-352d25f08077/50311.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor4":"a0a0a0","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/like-father-like-son/1796600530","playParams":{"id":"1796600530","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4S88YckkfmEXpFhh4PT27a"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796600530/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"824331126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/824331126?l=en-US"},{"id":"63424339","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/63424339?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740106960482,"RTCI":0}}},"1797151015":{"id":"1797151015","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797151015?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/federico-jusid/366294649","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"A Thousand Blows (Original Soundtrack)","artistName":"Federico Jusid","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cd/89/9d/cd899d2e-23ee-ae62-5d8e-3f4913b527d8/25UMGIM14758.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdc8c7","textColor2":"c0c8bd","textColor4":"a0a4a0","textColor1":"f8f5ee","bgColor":"1f162b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-thousand-blows-original-soundtrack/1797151015","playParams":{"id":"1797151015","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7cSLRLorpTjBbGIMWGtUzz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797151015/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"366294649","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/366294649?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740703848915,"RTCI":0}}},"1797185949":{"id":"1797185949","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797185949?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/clave-especial/1569749622","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a4/6f/52/a46f529a-796e-8cd4-6c8d-43a0b637febd/6883a6b3-510d-4dbc-9282-5b38b2bc3efa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b08987","textColor2":"d79693","textColor4":"b17c7a","textColor1":"d5a7a3","bgColor":"1c1317","hasP3":false}},"name":"MIJA NO TE ASUSTES","artistName":"Clave Especial","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Signed to Fuerza Regida lead singer Jesús Ortíz Paz’s Street Mob Records, Clave Especial swiftly began making their name with singles like “Kalashnikov.” Befitting their label’s name, the rising California act’s brand of corridos adheres to a certain sensibility, evident throughout <i>Mija, No Te Asustes</i>. The album collects some of their previously released material with an ample amount of new recordings that keeps the same energy. Business and pleasure blur together on “Caravana” and “Tú Tú Tú,” coming together in a strange balance for “Happy.” When that attitude tips towards a purer romantic longing on “Ay Mija,” it offers greater insight into their inherent talents.\n\nNaturally, their music industry benefactor JOP comes through for a couple of Fuerza Regida collabs, including the characteristically solid “Como Capo.” Luis R Conriquez makes two appearances here as well, first on the opener “Ni Modo Que No” and later on their prior hit “No Son Doritos.” Similarly, the defiantly debauched “Pasaportes” finds them

up all night or just rising to meet the sun? New York City’s Kush Jones curated this month’s mix and chose to reflect his own morning process. “I take things slowly until I muster up the energy to start the day,” he tells Apple Music. “I [wanted] to give people a nice selection of music to wake up to.” The textures here—elastic synths, sticky drums, playful vocoder vocals—build gradually from groovier instrumentations (Kerri Chandler’s “In Search of Mr Ford”) to denser, heavier cuts from Skee Mask and Orlando Voorn. Among Jones’ favorites: “Werq Me” by DJ Delish, which he says has the energy to “keep the dance alive,” and the Detroit in Effect remix to Emerson’s “Sending All My Love Out,” which is “perfect for jams in Crotona Park,” a reference to the park in the Bronx. But it also works if you’re just cleaning after a long weekend, he says: “Tough drums, lush melodies, and a beautifully worded message.”","short":"“I wanted to give people a nice selection of music to wake up to.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a8/ce/9d/a8ce9d5b-963f-ce04-a978-d5ceae7f7e0d/2bfcefb0-a98e-425c-a77d-4c40ff691711.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"5d4044","textColor2":"412015","textColor4":"674141","textColor1":"341f1a","bgColor":"ffc5f0","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/early-hours-dj-mix/1797455028","playParams":{"id":"1797455028","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797455028/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1083000090","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1083000090?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1740752682321,"RTCI":0}}},"1797534139":{"id":"1797534139","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797534139?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Musicals"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1597463102-1552137052","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Real Women Have Curves The Musical: Makin' It Work with Joy (from Jesse & Joy) -

In 2021, she made her solo debut with the two-track release <i>LALISA</i>, finding particular success with swagger-driven “MONEY.” The song boasts of LISA’s exorbitant, idol-built wealth, a theme that continues on follow-up album <i>Alter Ego</i>. The 2025 collection marks a new chapter in LISA’s career, as it was the first released after she left YG Entertainment as a solo artist and launched management company Lloud.\n\nAs is the case with many K-pop releases, <i>Alter Ego</i> is not just an album—it’s an entire concept. For her solo album debut, LISA slips into five different comic booklike personalities (Roxi, Kiki, Vixi, Sunni, and Speedi), each with their own backstory, look, and dedicated album track. On “Rockstar” (Roxi) and “Lifestyle” (Speedi), LISA boasts about life as a global pop star, while “FXCK UP THE WORLD” (Vixi) allows the superstar a chance to play the villain: “Walked in causing havoc/Yes, that is a habit.” The romantic, France-set “Moonlit Floor” (Sunni) samples Sixpence None the Richer’s 1998 hit “Kiss Me,” swapping “beneath the milky twilight” for “under the Paris twilight.”\n\nThe high-concept framework doesn’t keep LISA from collaborating. The Kiki-inspired “New Woman” sees her teaming up with Spanish superstar ROSALÍA for airy electropop empowerment, while British singer-songwriter RAYE and American rapper Doja Cat are on board for the disco-infused, ’80s-inspired breakup track “Born Again.” LISA taps South African singer Tyla for “When I’m with You,” American rapper Megan Thee Stallion for one of two album versions of “Rapunzel,” and American rapper Future for one of two album versions of “FXCK UP THE WORLD.” The result makes for an album that, while grounded in the K-pop industry and crafted by a Thai artist, feels even more culturally expansive.","short":"The BLACKPINK star’s solo debut is culturally and conceptually
