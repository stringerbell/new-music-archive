Album","standard":"“It won’t get any easier as I start to get old,” Coheed and Cambria godhead Claudio Sanchez sings on “Yesterday’s Lost,” the nearly hymnal opening track to <i>The Father of Make Believe</i>. Indeed, the long-running emo-prog band’s 10th studio album has a personal and reflective quality that comes with watching the world change around you as the years go by. The fists-in-the-air anthem “Meri of Mercy” is a tribute to his late grandparents, while the tender acoustic ballad “Corner My Confidence” is a highly romantic zoom-in that Sanchez composed during the band’s second S.S. Neverender cruise in 2023.\n\nBut don’t mistake these sentimental moments as a sign that Coheed and Cambria’s ambition has slowed, as <i>The Father of Make Believe</i> is as forceful of a rock record as anything else in their discography. As evidenced on the pedal-to-the-metal “Goodbye, Sunshine” and the pounding “Someone Who Can,” they’re making rock music for the cosmos here, taking their listeners into uncharted territory as always, while delivering the melodic gifts that they’ve been blessed with since the very beginning.","short":"The emo-prog vets get reflective on their 10th

Album","standard":"The cover art for the sixth album from indie-pop dynamo George Lewis Jr.—aka Twin Shadow—features the handwritten signature of his father Georgie, who passed away from cancer in 2024. It’s a poignant visual cue for what is undoubtedly the most nakedly personal and reflective album of Twin Shadow’s career. Where so much of his discography exists in a never-ending summer of ’84 where Prince and Springsteen are jostling for the top of the charts, <i>Georgie</i> strips Lewis’ songcraft down to the core. The glistening guitars and neon-tinted synth textures remain, but the tracks are almost entirely devoid of drums or beats and left to freely float in a sea of melancholy and simmering resentment—the bittersweet serenade “Good Times” is really a chronicle of the bad ones and an indictment of fair-weather friends who never seem to be around when you need them the most. But on tracks like “You Already Know” and “Permanent Feeling,” Lewis’ intimately soulful voice displays a Bon Iver-esque ability to transform even the most skeletal songs into full-blooded, heart-pumping hymns.","short":"The indie-pop dynamo strips down and levels

Album","standard":"The indie-pop band fronted by Michelle Zauner released their third album, 2021’s <i>Jubilee</i>, to massive critical acclaim and their first Grammy nomination. After spending five years writing <i>Crying in H Mart</i>, her best-selling memoir about grief, Zauner devoted the record to joy and catharsis, all triumphant horns and swooning synths. But for its follow-up, the ambitious polymath found herself drawn to darker, knottier themes—loneliness, desire, contemporary masculinity. She also gravitated to the indie-rock sounds of her past, recruiting producer and guitarist Blake Mills, known for his work with artists like Fiona Apple, Feist, and Weyes Blood. “[For <i>Jubilee</i>] we wanted to have bombastic, big instrumentation with lots of strings and horns; I wanted this to come back to a more guitar-oriented record,” Zauner tells Apple Music. “I think I’m going back to my roots a little bit more.”\n\nWhen she began to write the band’s fourth record in 2022, Zauner found inspiration in an unlikely literary juxtaposition: Greek mythology, gothic romance classics, and works that she wryly deemed as part of the “incel canon” à la Bret Easton Ellis’ <i>American Psycho</i>. From such seemingly disparate sources emerged the gorgeously bleak songs of <i>For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women)</i>, whose title is presented with an implied wink, acknowledging the many women songwriters whose work is reduced to “sad girl music.”\n\nIndeed, the atmosphere on <i>For Melancholy Brunettes</i> is less straightforwardly sad, and more…well, it’s complicated. On “Leda,” the story of a strained relationship unfolds by way of Greek myths in which Zeus takes the form of a swan to seduce a Spartan queen. “Little Girl,” a deceptively sweet-sounding ballad about a father estranged from his daughter, opens with a spectacularly abject image: “Pissing in the corner of a hotel suite.” And on the fascinatingly eerie “Mega Circuit,” on which legendary drummer Jim Keltner lays down a mean shuffle, Zauner paints a twisted tableau of modern manhood—muddy ATVs, back-alley blowjobs, “incel eunuchs”—somehow managing to make it all sound achingly poetic with lines like, “Deep in the soft hearts of young boys so pissed off and jaded/Carrying dull prayers of old men cutting holier truths.”\n\nThe universe Zauner conveys on <i>For Melancholy Brunettes</i> is sordid and strange, though not without beauty in the form of sublime guitar sounds or striking turns of phrase. (“I never knew I’d find my way into the arms/Of men in bars,” she sings on the wistful “Men in Bars,” which includes the album’s only feature from…Jeff Bridges?!) As for the title’s bone-dry humor—sardonically zesty castanet and tambourine add extra irony to “Winter in LA,” on which Zauner imagines herself as a happier woman, writing sweet love songs instead of…these.","short":"“I’m going back to my roots.” Michelle Zauner finds beauty in the

He uses these new tunes both to deepen <i>Relapse</i>’s themes of heartache and substance abuse as well as to shake up its original sequence, which is rearranged somewhat here and makes space for a fuller portrait of Zeiders’ style of country music.\n\nHighlights of the new material include “Everything Comes to Go Away,” a soulful cut co-written by teenage wunderkind Ben Goldsmith, and “Love in Letting Go,” a tender duet with Lanie Gardner. Of course, <i>Relapse</i> favorites like “Intoxicated” and “Betrayal” are on the record, too, cast in a more potent light when flanked by songs like “Can a Heart Take,” a brooding and melodic power ballad that puts Zeiders’ narrator on the receiving end of heartbreak, and “Take It to the Grave,” a hell-raising anthem with a sticky chorus hook that recalls the sneakily melodic smash hits from early-aughts rock bands like Nickelback and Saliva.","short":"An expansion of his 2024 LP deepens its themes of addiction and

Album","standard":"My Morning Jacket leader Jim James will be the first to tell you that the band’s 10th album is, on some fundamental level, more of the same: the same rootsy eclecticism, the same soft-but-chunky ’70s rock (“Squid Ink,” “Die for It”), the same lightly psychedelic insights into the human condition (“Everyday Magic,” “Time Waited”). “Love or hate the band, I think you could agree we try a lot of different things,” he says. “We’re open to any kind of music, any style of music, this or that. And I think this album is kind of the same.”\n\nThe difference this time was in the approach—namely, the hiring of an outside producer, Brendan O’Brien (Pearl Jam, Bruce Springsteen), for the first time in their 25-plus-year career. The result was a collective shift in which the band was able to free themselves from the minutiae of record-making and relax into being a band—an experience James likened to an athlete connecting with the right coach (and this from a guy who insists he was “never good at sports”).\n\nTake “Everyday Magic” and “Time Waited,” highlights that come early in the album but that James wrote deep into the recording process. “It was hilarious because when I started working with Brendan, all these songs kept coming out,” James says. “I email him one song. I’m like, ‘Oh, my God. Check this out.’ No response.” Then another, and another. “‘I wonder if he just missed the email.’” Just when it seemed like he’d reached the end of his efforts, the right ones materialized. “I realized for the first time that I don’t have to take it personally,” he says. “Even when I was trying so hard to micromanage and force everything, at the end of the day, the record makes itself,” he says. <i>is</i> is.","short":"An indie-Americana institution’s long, strange trip

After indulging in and honoring Houston’s hometown history of double-cup diatribes on prior efforts like <i>Junkie Mode</i>, he carries on with his most complete and consistent album to date with <i>Ms. Salazar</i>, its title a respectful and reverent tribute to the woman who raised him.\n\nAccented by the evident sound of swirling ice and dirty soda slurps, his drawl adds to the Southern authenticity behind his lyrics on singles “Half a Ticket” and “Private Planes.” Launching off a novel premise between lovers, “Don’t Go Back” opens up a dialogue about the lure of the streets and its surrounding vices. The catchiness of his hooks and half-sung bars is countered by the gravity of his emotional subject matter on cuts like “Feel Like Givin Up” and “Make Me Feel Better.”","short":"Double-cup-driven trap

Album","standard":"Four years after releasing his full-length debut album <i>Pelago</i>, Ryan Hurd has returned with <i>Midwest Rock & Roll</i>, which also marks his first release as a signee to Big Machine Records. The Chicago-born singer-songwriter co-wrote each of the LP’s dozen tracks, many of which draw influence from his Illinois upbringing. <i>Midwest Rock & Roll</i> opens with its title track, a gritty celebration of youthful love and blossoming adulthood in a place that’s “so damn freezing all year” you have to “make out in cars.” Sonically, that tune recalls the “dirt emo” leanings of Hurd’s contemporary Ruston Kelly, and many other tracks on the record dip into the same kind of rough-hewn melancholy, like the antisocial-but-romantic “This Party Sucks” and “All Night Long Days,” a slick, poppy rock song à la Kip Moore or Eric Church. Other standouts include “Funerals,” an especially raw moment in which Hurd admits that some losses make him angry while some make him sad, and closing track “The Last Song I’ll Ever Write,” a cautiously optimistic wish for lasting love. Co-writers on <i>Midwest Rock & Roll</i> include Randy Montana and Joey Hyde.

Its dreamy outlaw ballads and honky-tonk numbers tell a story about hustling in America (“That old-time feeling just up and walked away/Left me with these interest rates,” he sings on “Game I Can’t Win”), and meanwhile, a story of his years spent on the road. “My age is showing in a motel mirror,” he confesses over organ chords on “Under Neon Lights.” And the wistful “Life of a Country Singer” is a ballad of a liminal existence that unfolds in-between spaces, somewhere between dusk and dawn, and between right and wrong. “There’s a long, long line of country singers, singing songs about livin’ late at night,” he drawls, admitting “I ain’t the first one, or the best—but I’m different.”","short":"The Texan’s 16th album in nine years tells a story about hustling in America."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonesome-drifter/1792234260","playParams":{"id":"1792234260","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64lDGn2XUSnXAncXh9Zzow"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792234260/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"987849844","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/987849844?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742532153080}}},"1792313899":{"id":"1792313899","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792313899?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/diamond-construct/1107829736","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Angel Killer Zero (Deluxe)","artistName":"Diamond Construct","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/8f/b7/4a8fb73d-be87-f382-c39d-158e6e2a27fb/4099964145939.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c7c0ca","textColor2":"d7bec9","textColor4":"b39da7","textColor1":"f1e9f4","bgColor":"211c20","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/angel-killer-zero-deluxe/1792313899","playParams":{"id":"1792313899","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2uZHOZBR8ROLAwjPZNSNXc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792313899/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1107829736","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1107829736?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742522483405}}},"1792518396":{"id":"1792518396","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792518396?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jesus-culture/319089613","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0b/4a/25/0b4a25a0-1afe-4eb4-9395-eb85ab3d6ee3/3b76fb57-776a-458a-9c30-0dc9cb2fdcd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"251d16","textColor2":"161514","textColor4":"322a22","textColor1":"060504","bgColor":"a5815d","hasP3":false}},"name":"Worthy Of Hallelujah (Live)","artistName":"Jesus Culture","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/59/cf/49/59cf4954-86e9-1788-3d77-316a15a61b91/25UMGIM06047.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6c6c0","textColor2":"d6b260","textColor4":"ab9452","textColor1":"e4f0e9","bgColor":"011e1b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Live Album","short":"Gracious songs of resilience from the California worship group."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/worthy-of-hallelujah-live/1792518396","playParams":{"id":"1792518396","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3wtjYn5O0FawhiX7M5XodK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792518396/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"319089613","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/319089613?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742530377587}}},"1792850056":{"id":"1792850056","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792850056?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Gospel","Music","Christian"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/moses-bliss/1205461661","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ea/ed/05/eaed0566-9f61-44dd-50b4-a734905933d2/be710cfb-48c0-446a-bbe0-1edfc73820ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c6c3","textColor2":"d39b86","textColor4":"ab7d6d","textColor1":"f7f7f2","bgColor":"080408","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Expression","artistName":"Moses Bliss","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dd/90/35/dd903538-91fd-2d26-a48d-6ac0fa77757f/704260941430.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d2619","textColor2":"101519","textColor4":"353129","textColor1":"060704","bgColor":"caa16b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Hear “By Your Mercy (Live)” and pre-add the album now.

With his pure intentions made clear, he proceeds through a number of songs driven by romance and woe, from the impassioned pleas of “Me Aleje Con Ella” to the devastations of “Funeral.” His admiration for his predecessors comes through on “Si A Todo” and the more energetically paced “El Miron.” One of the project’s handful of collaborations, “Cala En El Alma” pairs him with Texan norteño act Duelo for heartbreak in a distinct música mexicana style.","short":"The Puerto Rican artist lends his charms and talents to cumbia."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cumbia-y-amor/1793862268","playParams":{"id":"1793862268","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5DGuCQcoaVK1Vems5uswJ0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793862268/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1416913037","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1416913037?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742531246518}}},"1794576956":{"id":"1794576956","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794576956?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gabrielle-aplin/434657397","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Northern Star -

(It’s blanco’s third album, following 2018’s feature-happy <i>Friends Keep Secrets</i> and its 2021 sequel.) The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\n\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”","short":"“An idea that started in our bedroom”: Pop’s power couple makes it official."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-said-i-love-you-first/1795151519","playParams":{"id":"1795151519","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5v7xYJyke25Nmt3l2R7YkR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795151519/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280215834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280215834?l=en-US"},{"id":"1410841257","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1410841257?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742566667736}}},"1795734658":{"id":"1795734658","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795734658?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/corpus-offal/1736702039","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Corpus Offal","artistName":"Corpus Offal","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0e/cf/2d/0ecf2dac-cd42-0338-469d-7743116a30b6/810079501977.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2918b","textColor2":"d49494","textColor4":"ab7879","textColor1":"dcb4ab","bgColor":"08070c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/corpus-offal/1795734658","playParams":{"id":"1795734658","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/24Xth7FobOn0qlG9BJcRXD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795734658/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1736702039","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1736702039?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742519192991}}},"1795961490":{"id":"1795961490","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795961490?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Electronica","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/si-begg/19501282","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Everyone’s Going to Die Original Soundtrack (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Si Begg","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/29/0b/f2/290bf226-1eae-e424-4cff-5404faa94868/5056688840006.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"332c28","textColor2":"402827","textColor4":"624c47","textColor1":"060000","bgColor":"e8dbcb","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everyones-going-to-die-original-soundtrack-original/1795961490","playParams":{"id":"1795961490","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3LktBl6g1OFAA0HpCW4BhX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795961490/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"19501282","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/19501282?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742516077842}}},"1796224990":{"id":"1796224990","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796224990?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Christian Rap","Music","Christian"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kijan-boone/1423980725","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/43/74/18/43741836-c48e-3c3f-81e2-08653b2d94c4/45bb293a-b0eb-4936-815d-95da5b0a4079.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"554b46","textColor2":"342825","textColor4":"5a504d","textColor1":"2e221d","bgColor":"f2f1ed","hasP3":false}},"name":"Just 4 Fun 2 -

Of course, it’s those very moments that Pearce so deftly documents, establishing herself as a major songwriting force in the genre with her evocative, often gut-wrenching accounts of hard times and heartache. On <i>hummingbird</i>, there is no shortage of such moments, though this follow-up to 2021’s <i>29: Written in Stone</i> feels sonically lighter and more spacious than its predecessors, a vibe hinted at by the record’s delicate title.\n\nPearce co-produced the LP alongside Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, marking her first time in a producing role. Standouts include “things I don’t chase,” a slow-burn torch song for “the stubborn kind” of man Pearce just “don’t chase,” as well as the head-over-heels infatuation of “trust issues.” Chris Stapleton joins Pearce on the aching duet “we don’t fight anymore,” a ballad about a love whose spark is long burnt out. \n\nThis deluxe edition adds five new tracks, including two raw, acoustic live performances: “oklahoma” and “things i don’t chase,” both of which Pearce recorded as part of a live series for Vevo. New song “no rain” nods to the deluxe edition’s subtitle, the oft-quoted mantra “No rain, no flowers,” which reminds that life’s more beautiful experiences are often born from hardship. Pearce rounds out the project with two more previously unheard songs, the searching and tender “if looks could kill” and the clear-eyed exploration of new love, “heart first.”","short":"Five rare

Album","standard":"To survive like Atlanta’s K CAMP has, you have to be Teflon-tough. Enter his 2025 album, <i>Built Different</i>, a collection of cuts equal parts introspective and club-ready that find the middle ground between his melodic tendencies and ATL roots. On “Consequences,” he spits over a rubbery bass groove and a soul sample that gives a jolt to the song’s minimalist edge. He laments the times he’s succumbed to weakness, knowing that he’ll do better next time he’s faced with similar challenges. It’s all part of being built differently. He raps, “Give it all to God, please forgive me for my sins/I lost family, I lost friends.” There’s a duality on the album that helps illustrate K CAMP’s humanity, like how he can go from sadly recalling love lost on “It’s Gone” to dropping ones for his favorite club dancers on “Watch It Fall.”","short":"Equal parts introspective and club-ready."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/built-different/1797154582","playParams":{"id":"1797154582","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6LtV4LhvhiGwGzVVuXehaB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797154582/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280021267","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280021267?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742532697319}}},"1797616137":{"id":"1797616137","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797616137?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sofia-camara/1506432156","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ef/44/ba/ef44ba79-a1de-ffd8-428a-4c4b8aa88f0a/Jobc77ddd47-b15f-49fa-988e-bc749cf0fa26-187840805-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367783578_2084655557-Time1741817978320.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","7aafe1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"111a24"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"7a9fc2","textColor2":"7aafe1","textColor4":"6491bb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"111a24","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/9d/4a/529d4a5c-e2b9-1953-20a1-c6b67ea7cb57/4ad8f974-ca4e-4d1b-aa64-3e3cdd4ad93c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cec6be","textColor2":"e1dad0","textColor4":"c5bcb1","textColor1":"ece6df","bgColor":"574637","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c4/7d/72/c47d72a5-245b-1bee-f136-833cc44a47b1/Jobb0af2782-b1fc-4a5e-be04-0e89c7d5c847-187840806-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367783579_2084655558-Time1741818906839.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"75a1c1","textColor2":"78a5dd","textColor4":"6289b8","textColor1":"8fc3e8","bgColor":"0d1922","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/1b/69/6b/1b696b59-e013-9e1a-fcf1-6e7bfca1bb24/eb76eba5-c488-4365-b187-95760ba21eaf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"94add0","textColor2":"94c0f7","textColor4":"7fa4d1","textColor1":"afcbf6","bgColor":"2b3339","hasP3":false}},"name":"Was I(t) Worth It? -

With a couple of threatening exceptions (the Conway-featuring “Money Magnet,” the 03 Greedo and Styles P guest spots on “True Lies”), the mood is low-key and light, the rap equivalent of easy listening or lounge music. These guys don’t want anything to do with the mainstream; they just want to keep their cottage industry humming, preferably from the beach.

Album","standard":"“It’s like a thank-you note,” Jay Wheeler tells Apple Music about <i>GIRASOLES</i>. “It’s like a letter saying I’m here for these people.” By “these people,” the Puerto Rican singer is referring specifically to his family, paying tribute to both his wife Zhamira Zambrano and their young daughter throughout this, his most personal project yet. Making the transition from R&B singing reggaetonero to full-fledged Latin pop star all but official here, he largely eschews the genre styles prevalent on his prior albums to push forward a more mature sound to match his grown-up lyricism.\n\nIndeed, apart from “Nota” with Omar Courtz and “Verte Por Ahí,” Wheeler prefers a more balladic approach across these 15 tracks. Though hip-hop has long been part of his formula, the way he repurposes its rhythms and flows for “Dañao Pa Siempre” and “Roma” feels noticeably different from, say, 2023’s <i>TRAPPii</i>. Inspired by a car accident he survived, “Abrázame Fuerte” gets boosted by a spiritual element that corresponds with its melancholy, off-kilter synths. “In that moment, I only wanted a hug from God,” he says. “I only wanted to know that He come down and be like, ‘Everything is good, you are going to be fine.’”\n\nWhile several of the themes here tend towards the universal, Wheeler’s familial dedications give <i>GIRASOLES</i> some of its most powerful peaks. Written prior to his daughter’s birth, “Aiunii” bursts with paternal hope towards what fatherhood could entail. “What I sang in the song, there are things missing, things I haven’t experienced in that song, but I know I’m going to experience them with her,” he says. “Now that I have her in my arms, it’s everything I sang, and even better, and there’s still more to come.”","short":"The Puerto Rican star says his album is a “thank-you note.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/girasoles/1799337256","playParams":{"id":"1799337256","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2mk78J70fArsjx0EG7Xi6R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799337256/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"164376380","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/164376380?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742553908159}}},"1799674112":{"id":"1799674112","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799674112?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-17","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nmixx/1600411676","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e7/17/e4/e717e493-fc7b-a535-a13b-6fc852d54800/783dfd9f-8970-4f76-9e98-a2a86e2fd493.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d4daec","textColor2":"dde9fc","textColor4":"c0cdea","textColor1":"f6fafe","bgColor":"4b5ca2","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fe3O4: FORWARD - EP","artistName":"NMIXX","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b3/ac/c3/b3acc372-089f-e254-ce76-298ec6f2a2f0/8809928953823_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"3c3e42","textColor2":"34343a","textColor4":"5c5c61","textColor1":"0c0e13","bgColor":"fefefe","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"As the final release in K-pop girl group NMIXX’s <i>Fe304</i> trilogy, <i>Fe304: FORWARD</i> takes its subtitle seriously.

The project shares a name with the group’s third world tour: Dominate. Like <i>HOP</i>, <i>Mixtape : dominATE</i> is predominantly composed of tracks that don’t feature all of the members, with Stray Kids’ eight members breaking up into subunits to write and perform four of the album’s five tracks. In restless, electric guitar-led “Burnin’ Tires,” Changbin and I.N. are “running until the end,” while Han and Felix rap about riding Benzes and saluting fans in swagger song “Truman.” Bang Chan and Hyunjin beckon listeners to follow in head-banging pop-rock track “ESCAPE,” while Lee Know and Seungmin promise to keep singing in lyrical ballad “CINEMA.”\n\nThe octet is all together for a Korean-language version of “GIANT,” a stadium-stomper that was first released in its Japanese-language version as the title track of the group’s second full-length Japanese album in 2024. It’s fitting to have at least one group track on the mixtape, as the release of <i>Mixtape : dominATE</i> came days before Stray Kids’ seventh anniversary as a K-pop team.","short":"The group’s eight members split into subunits on four of the EP’s five tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mixtape-dominate-ep/1799804278","playParams":{"id":"1799804278","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799804278/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1304823362","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1304823362?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742532355319}}},"1799810836":{"id":"1799810836","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799810836?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kevin-gates/298383551","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/15/b9/aa/15b9aa70-279b-5454-5cfb-cbbd4f097367/2c9de8da-ea36-48c2-9374-7801c9d0aaff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"322f2c","textColor2":"422616","textColor4":"5d463a","textColor1":"0c0805","bgColor":"cac9c9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7f/6b/a5/7f6ba524-002e-0a6e-ba68-7bf0c9ba0542/292fe0c5-2e32-4bdb-b623-f24c63da1f2a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5b0b0","textColor2":"e0b591","textColor4":"be9a7d","textColor1":"d4d0d1","bgColor":"38322d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5d/c2/a9/5dc2a9fc-cb48-f28c-b316-57d7ca7c4059/6e4bfeba-2969-4531-a233-51698bfd1a75.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6b199","textColor2":"c5c1bf","textColor4":"a19d9c","textColor1":"f3d9bb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"I'm Him 2","artistName":"Kevin Gates","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b6/d9/02/b6d90295-055a-141a-1a48-03f239a032f0/840471801443.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"cccccd","textColor2":"e39c72","textColor4":"b77e5d","textColor1":"fefeff","bgColor":"090909","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Kevin Gates dropped <i>I’m Him</i> some five years after “I Don’t Get Tired,” the breakout hit that transformed him from mixtape upstart to mainstream rap rule-breaker. Beyond the controversies and improprieties that added a tabloid-ready gloss to his career, the Baton Rouge artist stood out on that second proper album for his inventive, oft-energetic takes on the trap era’s street-hustle mindset. Now, another half-decade later, freshly independent and pushing 40, he reveals both the rewards and the toll of that lifestyle on this concise sequel. \n\nIn line with hip-hop’s ongoing mental health journey in rhyme, opener “Therapy Sessions” dives deep into a psyche so fraught with trauma that it would send most so-called pain rappers into hiding. “Same Way” finds him operating as a master of that particular subgenre, calculating loss amid the wins as a form of cautionary tale for the listener. Via the duality of “Big Bruddah (Don’t Be Mad),” he recounts betrayals and slights endured in the trenches while also flaunting his wealth and the intricate means through which he’s acquired it. Still, he can’t help but come off as triumphant on “Brasi the Eagle,” evoking his infamous mobster moniker to emphasize that his successes surpass his suffering.\n\nGates’ characteristically unfiltered approach serves him well here. Whether truth-telling on the grimy motivational “Manifest” or casually pulling the baddest of baddies on the explicit “No Pressure,” that outlandish streak resurfaces enough times that it rewards his day-one listenership. Those long-term fans know that he’s remained true to form all these years, though anyone needing a reminder can reference “Block Away” and “Kiss the Ring” for clarity.","short":"The Baton Rouge rap

DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. This month’s edition was assembled by Jessica Skye, a DJ/producer and Apple Fitness+ Yoga and Meditation Trainer based in Los Angeles. “Creating mixes for yoga is one of my favorite ways to hold a space for others,” she tells Apple Music. “This mix opens and closes with sound-bath-inspired sounds for meditative moments, and has a progressive build to the peak of the practice. I’ve even added a walk-out song, so if you’re a yoga teacher, you don’t have to worry about hitting the next track as your class comes out of Savasana. You can just let it flow.”\n\nAmong her favorite tracks: “Virgo Rising (Reimagined),” which she created after taking a hiatus from music during the pandemic (“It felt like I was finding my sound again”), and Rising Galaxy’s “Forgiveness Moves in Waves,” which she has been playing in her own yoga classes for years. “It has layer upon layer of dreamy synths and ethereal keys. I find it so calming and almost hypnotic.”\n","short":"The British producer, now based in LA, crafts a free-spirited mix for the mat."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-yoga-march-2025-dj-mix/1799859779","playParams":{"id":"1799859779","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799859779/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1452573737","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1452573737?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742345482055}}},"1799886125":{"id":"1799886125","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799886125?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":32,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gwen-stefani/108717","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/81/c3/66/81c36610-366d-4da7-e111-1e359dc0f7ca/Job312f4933-4fcf-4038-a61d-3fc0cb9d6335-187926932-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367966703_2086042742-Time1741918120805.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ed852e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"6c1f12"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c29760","textColor2":"ed852e","textColor4":"bf6c26","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"6c1f12","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2b/53/fa/2b53faa8-8333-e5e6-8a28-b0bdbd96e098/Jobfd5c5d28-1cc3-43e3-ae79-405d2a38a960-187926933-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367966704_2086042741-Time1741919059368.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ba7326","textColor2":"ec7e30","textColor4":"c16728","textColor1":"e38d2d","bgColor":"150a09","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fe/e6/3e/fee63edd-973c-6ca1-8eb4-d4991a1006bb/61d7c77d-9427-44a9-8ff4-323210d441fc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d1b18a","textColor2":"edaa7e","textColor4":"ca916e","textColor1":"f5d2a2","bgColor":"402d2b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Bouquet (Deluxe)","artistName":"Gwen Stefani","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/85/ef/5d/85ef5d8f-364c-ccff-9e7f-c2fd56d4c398/25UMGIM10671.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2ac84","textColor2":"ec812c","textColor4":"c86b26","textColor1":"f9d2a1","bgColor":"37160f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"During the long and idle months of the pandemic, Gwen Stefani spent more time than usual at her now-husband Blake Shelton’s ranch. “During COVID, we were there so much that we actually got to see the seasons,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “We started seeing the wildflowers, seeing what was in Oklahoma that we never saw before.” Transplanting hundreds of irises they found on the ranch that year was a project she would normally be too busy for, but now they were doing it as a family. The pop-rock queen had felt the itch to write new music for years, but had struggled to find a sound that reflected where she was now. Then came “Purple Irises,” a sweet pop-country duet with Shelton that lets go of insecurities and goes all in on love. The seed was planted for <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani’s fifth solo album.\n\nWhile making the warm and unabashedly enamored <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani found herself echoing the music she grew up on in the ’70s. “I always picture myself in the back of the station wagon and my parents driving to church, and all the great soft rock that was on,” she says. “Anything from Hall & Oates to Chicago to Fleetwood Mac.” Garden symbolism abounds: Tears of past heartbreaks water the soil, yielding fields of late-blooming flowers. Despite the cowboy hat she dons on the cover, it’s not quite a country album, but some nods to ranch life sneak in. “I drive you crazy, you drive the truck,” she sings on the title track, and on “Marigolds,” she recalls dressing like a cowgirl to catch Shelton’s eye upon first meeting.\n\nIt’s been nearly three decades since her band, No Doubt, became a household name with their third album, <i>Tragic Kingdom</i>, but the process of writing <i>Bouquet</i> brought Stefani back to the feeling of taking a leap of faith to find her voice. Naturally, she’s got a flower metaphor for that. “Every time you plant that seed, you have this hope, but you don’t know if it’s going to bloom,” she said. “You don’t really have control. All you can do is everything you can to help.”","short":"Gwen adds a full set of acoustic versions and videos to her 2024 album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bouquet-deluxe/1799886125","playParams":{"id":"1799886125","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0rTqvDgJ5Ec2zuuQrxVP1W"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799886125/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"108717","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/108717?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742551129550}}},"1799916084":{"id":"1799916084","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799916084?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/boog/1793534476","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Loco Motion","artistName":"BOOG","artwork":{"width":4480,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/30/92/ad/3092adeb-2189-7072-79c5-59abb75eaee9/8718723282123.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4480,"textColor3":"414e3c","textColor2":"283315","textColor4":"525b42","textColor1":"14230d","bgColor":"f7f8fa","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loco-motion/1799916084","playParams":{"id":"1799916084","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2kcX04MEaho1ziv1OouCAm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799916084/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1793534476","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1793534476?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742530749163}}},"1800335006":{"id":"1800335006","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800335006?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eslabon-armado/1482429034","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/91/a7/dc/91a7dc20-dff9-8af0-97d6-c8037492ddbd/699fa02f-6597-45c8-a389-8c214c30db30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c1cb","textColor2":"d7cac9","textColor4":"bab1b5","textColor1":"e2dee4","bgColor":"484c67","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7f/a7/86/7fa7863e-a44b-6644-c080-567ef4e72b65/c999543f-bed6-468e-9085-9681ef3029bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7bdc7","textColor2":"ced4dc","textColor4":"a8aeb8","textColor1":"e1e7ef","bgColor":"11142a","hasP3":false}},"name":"Vibras De Noche II","artistName":"Eslabon Armado","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/18/0e/84/180e8415-df45-5b93-67cb-dd4f79e29b9f/198704396137_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"a6b5c7","textColor2":"d8d1da","textColor4":"aeacb7","textColor1":"cedcee","bgColor":"0a192c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Released back when Eslabon Armado were still emerging música mexicana talents, the original <i>Vibras de Noche</i> from 2020 embodied the essence of after-dark lonesome listening experienced by teenagers such as themselves. The abundance of love songs contained within, including “Dame Tu Calor” and “Te Quiero A Ti,” contrasted with the modernized corridos of their prior work, endearing themselves further to what soon became a massive fanbase. Revisiting that aesthetic with another five years’ worth of experience under their belts, both musically and presumably in matters of the heart, Pedro Tovar’s group makes this sequel truly worthy of its predecessor’s imprimatur.\n\nTo call <i>Vibras de Noche II</i> a return to form would undermine just how far Eslabon Armado has come creatively. There’s evident nuance in the instrumental arrangements on songs like “Eres Arte <3” and “NO VOY A JUGAR,” showcasing not only artistic growth but greater aspirations. Tovar’s voice feels somewhat more lived-in as well, his delivery on “OTRAS 24 HORAS” and the deliberately messy “TE ODIO!” both particularly arresting. Bearing a world-weariness that’s fundamentally relatable, “KE DIABLOS HICE II” calls back to 2022’s <i>NOSTALGIA</i>.\n\nA rare guest on this explicitly intimate outing, freshly viral sensation Macario Martínez brings a genuinely devastating energy to the dour “Esa noche.” At times, things reach a point where listeners may feel like they’re eavesdropping, particularly during interludes and non-musical segues like the ones at the tail end of “M & D.” On the other hand, the album isn’t entirely fixated on romantic themes, with the vibrant corrido “El Alegre” extolling the virtues of quality time with the boys.","short":"A worthy sequel to the group’s groundbreaking 2020

The nine-track album combines the brighter, upbeat pop sounds from earlier in THE BOYZ’s career with the smoother, more hip-hop-driven style that came later for the fourth-generation group. Lead single “VVV” falls closer to the first category. A breathless synth-pop race to the end, the urgent pop track promises “Even if I fall, I won’t cool down,” as the members are “burning without fear.” THE BOYZ tapped into Korea’s rich roster of independent musician-producers as songwriters for the album. Korean R&B artist SUMIN, who has previously produced music for BTS, EXO, and Red Velvet, co-wrote “VVV.” Korean rapper Colde has credits on raspy rap tracks “Feel the Bass” and “Rock and Roll.”\n\nOn the self-production side, THE BOYZ’s Jacob co-wrote R&B love song “Starry Night,” while Sangyeon contributed to the writing of the dark, orchestral “Ain’t Salty.” Maknae Eric led writing on the upbeat “Miss Demeanor,” which is driven by a plucky acoustic-guitar loop.

the Places You'll Go</i> mixtape and 2022’s <i>she / her / black bitch</i> EP. Lead cut “STANKA POOH” finds the Top Dawg Entertainment artist wrestling with her artistic mortality and role as a Black woman in music. She raps: “Let’s start the story backwards/I’m dead, she’s dead, just another Black Lives Mattered/And if I die today I die a bastard/TikTok rapper, part-time YouTube actor.”\n\nObviously, Doechii aims to be bigger than viral clips and TV shows so small they can fit on your computer screen. On <i>Alligator Bites Never Heal</i>, Doechii asserts herself as one of rap’s most impressive bar-for-bar MCs. “DENIAL IS A RIVER” is a classic narrative cut in the style of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” while “NISSAN ALTIMA” is an electro-rap thriller designed to keep the dance floor hot and heart rates up.

On “Gorgeous Night,” synthesized, sustained drones rise up and tangle into one another, creating the aural equivalent of a shimmering, imperceptibly shifting aurora borealis. “Material World” pairs harsh tones that recall an alert tone’s implicit warning with an insistent beat and metallic scrapes, evoking the pulse of a city before it melts into its darkest hours. “Friendly Reactor Near Menacing Forest” echoes the standoff-level tension of its title, its rumbling low end and insistent upper register seemingly at odds as oscillations and shooting-star synth-strings veer into the mix. \n\n<i>AURUM</i> is available in Spatial Audio, and, as Eno tells Lowe, he’s been working with the idea of making music immersive for years. In the past, he would set up boomboxes around a space and make them play at once. “They weren’t synchronized together—that was the whole point,” Eno says. “But not being synchronized allowed new clusters of sound to appear.” Now listeners can replicate that ideal at home, giving new breadth and depth to songs like the fog-shrouded opener “Fragmented Film” and the windswept “Cascade.” With <i>AURUM</i>, he continues to explore his sense of play while creating ambient music, a genre that he’s been instrumental in defining and refining.\n","short":"Hear the ambient pioneer’s latest album, only on Apple Music."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aurum/1802013049","playParams":{"id":"1802013049","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802013049/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"38124","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/38124?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742531944201}}},"1802175271":{"id":"1802175271","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802175271?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":30,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/playboi-carti/982372505","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c5/42/a0/c542a0d1-2021-96a6-3d97-96dda18f7bd1/6fe8f8ae-38c2-42f6-b792-9a2b37163385.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a3a3a","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"4a4a4a","textColor1":"0b0b0b","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false}},"name":"MUSIC","artistName":"Playboi Carti","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/03/24/10/03241047-f22d-7e64-3932-6df7550acc42/25UMGIM46212.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"333333","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Playboi Carti has hardly been absent in the roughly four years since <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, appearing alongside the likes of Future, Latto, and Trippie Redd in the interim. Still, that didn’t keep his enormous fanbase from persistently clamoring over the prospect of <i>I AM MUSIC</i>, ultimately released with the truncated title of, simply, <i>MUSIC</i>. Its substantial length seems to acknowledge the wait, opening with a flurry of rage-rap tracks like “POP OUT” and “CRUSH” that herald the raconteur’s welcome arrival. Over its 30-track, 77-minute runtime, his sonics shift between the aggressively blown-out, synth-heavy post-trap he became infamous for and something markedly poppier, yet all of it undeniably within his stylistic range. \n\nCarti initially kept his choice of guests close to the vest, as has become custom for high-profile album drops. Yet it would be impossible not to recognize Kendrick Lamar spitting on “GOOD CREDIT,” Future emoting over “TRIM,” or collaborative career mainstay Lil Uzi Vert gliding triumphantly through “TWIN TRIM.” The Weeknd’s prominent feature on “RATHER LIE” makes for perhaps the most overt example of his envelope-pushing here, though appearances by Travis Scott on “PHILLY” and the tag team of Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign on “WE NEED ALL DA VIBES” make the pivot even more plausible.\n\nEven with friends like these, Carti shines brighter on his own, his breathy near-falsetto vocal booming through the escalating video game arpeggios of “I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI” and his raspy snarl swerving around the cinematic noise of “COCAINE NOSE.” Not exclusively looking towards the future, there’s an almost nostalgic appreciation for Atlanta’s early 2010s sound evoked on “RADAR,” its beat reminiscent of classic 1017 Brick Squad tapes.\n","short":"Rage rap’s raconteur makes his long-awaited return in
