Album","standard":"The Chicago drill superstar’s eighth studio album, 2023’s <i>Almost Healed</i>, was devoted to the concept of recovering from trauma—a theme that’s haunted Lil Durk’s music, either implicitly or explicitly, since his emergence in the early 2010s as the most melodically gifted of the genre’s rising stars. Its March 2025 follow-up, <i>Deep Thoughts</i>, was slated for release in October 2024. But that same month, Durk was arrested (along with several affiliates of his record label and collective, Only the Family) in connection to a murder-for-hire case against a rival rapper. The rapper born Durk Banks has maintained his innocence, but was denied bail on the grounds of being a flight risk. If convicted of the charges, the 32-year-old faces life in prison.\n\nThis changes the gravity of his long-awaited ninth album, which was delayed four times since the 2024 arrest. But the tracklist of <i>Deep Thoughts</i> seems to reflect a different lifetime, with pre-arrest singles like “Turn Up a Notch” and a suite of lusty ballads like the benny blanco-produced Jhene Aiko duet, “Can’t Hide It.” The resounding pathos of Durk’s work remains—most potently on “Keep on Sippin’,” whose candid bars detail the vicious cycle of addiction. But the stakes have changed, and it’s hard not to wonder what the Lil Durk of the past year might have to get off his chest instead. Still, an offhand line from “They Want to Be You,” a melancholy Future collab about the expectations of fame, hits even harder now: “All the kids rap, they wanna be just like you.”","short":"The drill

Album","standard":"For their first album in seven years, and first as a trio, the British folk-rockers Mumford & Sons went back to their roots. <i>RUSHMERE</i>, their fifth album, is named after the pub in southwest London where Marcus Mumford, Ted Dwane, and Ben Lovett first got to know each other as friends and eventual creative collaborators. They were humble days, coming years before tracks like “Little Lion Man” helped define a strand of optimistic folk pop that dominated the early 2010s and influenced 2020s stadium-fillers like Noah Kahan and Zach Bryan.\n\n<i>RUSHMERE</i> pulls back from the pomp and splendor of folk-rock stardom and gets back to basics: furiously played guitars and rousing vocal harmonies, with Marcus Mumford’s sincere, resolute burr leading the way. Produced by Nashville straight-shooter Dave Cobb, who’s known for his unfussy, song-forward approach to the studio, <i>RUSHMERE</i> places the powerful songwriting and strong musical chemistry of Mumford & Sons front and center. “Monochrome” is a hushed hymn to a long-gone muse, with Mumford rueful about time’s passage yet generous to someone who has faded to “monochrome out of sight.” The stirring “Surrender” is propelled by stomps and strummed strings, moving briskly forward even as Mumford sings of his world-weariness. “Blood on the Page,” a collaboration with next-generation folk-rocker Madison Cunningham, is delicate and ghostly in a way that amplifies the pain in its lyrics. \n\n“Time, don’t let us down again/’Cause I won’t wait,” the trio wails near the end of the title track, with ferocious banjos driving home the plea’s urgency. It’s a sly callback to “I Will Wait,” the 2012 song that cemented Mumford & Sons as leaders of the 2010s’ folk-rock vanguard. But it’s also a signal of the urgency and hope underpinning <i>RUSHMERE</i>, making it a taut, potent statement of reintroduction that doubles as a declaration of intent to stick around.","short":"Their first album in seven years—and first as a trio—gets back to basics."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rushmere/1784288625","playParams":{"id":"1784288625","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/15oPzWZQmZyyrsJt4st3U4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784288625/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"307699986","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/307699986?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743162672937}}},"1785014848":{"id":"1785014848","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785014848?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wythersake/1437179470","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"At War With Their Divinity","artistName":"Wythersake","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0d/fe/a7/0dfea7d8-2f33-ad62-0d6f-ecf49bfaf176/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c09154","textColor2":"d2a05a","textColor4":"b38348","textColor1":"e2b269","bgColor":"371000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/at-war-with-their-divinity/1785014848","playParams":{"id":"1785014848","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/09sOP4aUyIDEWNYQf4mk8Y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785014848/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1437179470","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1437179470?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743171184264}}},"1785033327":{"id":"1785033327","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785033327?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/unknown-mortal-orchestra/437580308","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/7c/50/ff/7c50ff4b-f95d-330d-1411-ec0a2c3d350c/Job461d5015-eee9-475c-a0f7-b33fa449f358-187277852-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366561459_2075790551-Time1741128858393.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","a4c0e4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"171b0b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"98abb8","textColor2":"a4c0e4","textColor4":"87a1bb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"171b0b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8e/76/f2/8e76f20f-3a96-2ba4-5565-9a3652b2feed/76f0f490-f88d-4793-8ca0-de554fe11dc5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfb7b1","textColor2":"c9ccc2","textColor4":"acada4","textColor1":"e0d9d2","bgColor":"3a332d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/92/ec/c0/92ecc0c2-0235-267b-e6b4-e18f7048b145/Job5a756950-1d66-441f-b09f-4d1581412492-187277853-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366561458_2075790552-Time1741129754466.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9dacde"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"171b0b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"a6b6bb","textColor2":"9dacde","textColor4":"8290b3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"171b0b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/03/be/7c/03be7c79-ebed-d7a0-282f-892d1d5e3e92/24b0d892-71ab-494e-b87e-9c0f04130ff5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"9dabba","textColor2":"acc2d2","textColor4":"93a6b1","textColor1":"b9c9dc","bgColor":"2f362f","hasP3":false}},"name":"IC-02 Bogotá","artistName":"Unknown Mortal Orchestra","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d3/c6/8c/d3c68cae-9970-da3f-fdac-d3079cecf607/50943.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9bb1bc","textColor2":"e3b73a","textColor4":"b99b32","textColor1":"bdd3e7","bgColor":"142a12","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The first volume of New Zealand indie heroes Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s all-instrumentals <i>IC</i> series leaned into the abstract.

After spending five years writing <i>Crying in H Mart</i>, her best-selling memoir about grief, Zauner devoted the record to joy and catharsis, all triumphant horns and swooning synths. But for its follow-up, the ambitious polymath found herself drawn to darker, knottier themes—loneliness, desire, contemporary masculinity. She also gravitated to the indie-rock sounds of her past, recruiting producer and guitarist Blake Mills, known for his work with artists like Fiona Apple, Feist, and Weyes Blood. “[For <i>Jubilee</i>] we wanted to have bombastic, big instrumentation with lots of strings and horns; I wanted this to come back to a more guitar-oriented record,” Zauner tells Apple Music. “I think I’m going back to my roots a little bit more.”\n\nWhen she began to write the band’s fourth record in 2022, Zauner found inspiration in an unlikely literary juxtaposition: Greek mythology, gothic romance classics, and works that she wryly deemed as part of the “incel canon” à la Bret Easton Ellis’ <i>American Psycho</i>. From such seemingly disparate sources emerged the gorgeously bleak songs of <i>For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women)</i>, whose title is presented with an implied wink, acknowledging the many women songwriters whose work is reduced to “sad girl music.”\n\nIndeed, the atmosphere on <i>For Melancholy Brunettes</i> is less straightforwardly sad, and more…well, it’s complicated. On “Leda,” the story of a strained relationship unfolds by way of Greek myths in which Zeus takes the form of a swan to seduce a Spartan queen. “Little Girl,” a deceptively sweet-sounding ballad about a father estranged from his daughter, opens with a spectacularly abject image: “Pissing in the corner of a hotel suite.” And on the fascinatingly eerie “Mega Circuit,” on which legendary drummer Jim Keltner lays down a mean shuffle, Zauner paints a twisted tableau of modern manhood—muddy ATVs, back-alley blowjobs, “incel eunuchs”—somehow managing to make it all sound achingly poetic with lines like, “Deep in the soft hearts of young boys so pissed off and jaded/Carrying dull prayers of old men cutting holier truths.”\n\nThe universe Zauner conveys on <i>For Melancholy Brunettes</i> is sordid and strange, though not without beauty in the form of sublime guitar sounds or striking turns of phrase. (“I never knew I’d find my way into the arms/Of men in bars,” she sings on the wistful “Men in Bars,” which includes the album’s only feature from…Jeff Bridges?!) As for the title’s bone-dry humor—sardonically zesty castanet and tambourine add extra irony to “Winter in LA,” on which Zauner imagines herself as a happier woman, writing sweet love songs instead of…these.","short":"“I’m going back to my roots.” Michelle Zauner finds beauty in the

Album","standard":"My Morning Jacket leader Jim James will be the first to tell you that the band’s 10th album is, on some fundamental level, more of the same: the same rootsy eclecticism, the same soft-but-chunky ’70s rock (“Squid Ink,” “Die for It”), the same lightly psychedelic insights into the human condition (“Everyday Magic,” “Time Waited”). “Love or hate the band, I think you could agree we try a lot of different things,” he says. “We’re open to any kind of music, any style of music, this or that. And I think this album is kind of the same.”\n\nThe difference this time was in the approach—namely, the hiring of an outside producer, Brendan O’Brien (Pearl Jam, Bruce Springsteen), for the first time in their 25-plus-year career. The result was a collective shift in which the band was able to free themselves from the minutiae of record-making and relax into being a band—an experience James likened to an athlete connecting with the right coach (and this from a guy who insists he was “never good at sports”).\n\nTake “Everyday Magic” and “Time Waited,” highlights that come early in the album but that James wrote deep into the recording process. “It was hilarious because when I started working with Brendan, all these songs kept coming out,” James says. “I email him one song. I’m like, ‘Oh, my God. Check this out.’ No response.” Then another, and another. “‘I wonder if he just missed the email.’” Just when it seemed like he’d reached the end of his efforts, the right ones materialized. “I realized for the first time that I don’t have to take it personally,” he says. “Even when I was trying so hard to micromanage and force everything, at the end of the day, the record makes itself,” he says. <i>is</i> is.","short":"An indie-Americana institution’s long, strange trip continues."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/is/1786273438","playParams":{"id":"1786273438","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6gcyvR5ngQwblVmrWeNaNe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786273438/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2322618","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2322618?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743160431637}}},"1786362148":{"id":"1786362148","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786362148?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/perfume-genius/374887266","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0e/79/10/0e7910e3-d6fe-19f9-1326-244a60831563/Jobc54596d9-bcf7-4dba-85b9-cc87db874e0f-185387213-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362729051_2047418429-Time1738969185331.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d29f5f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"131313"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d1d0d0","textColor2":"d29f5f","textColor4":"af8451","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7b/dc/0b/7bdc0bd4-da84-af82-014e-6f10c03eb582/75c5fcb2-f89f-4e57-8f27-a9b392be4ea1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a2928e","textColor2":"d7ab96","textColor4":"af8c7c","textColor1":"c7b3ad","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d9/d1/aa/d9d1aa27-f058-e7ba-d391-0041996347c2/Job1fc59dee-b87a-48db-bc53-00b260f4ae90-184923023-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361743018_2039724797-Time1738349560064.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bfc5cc","textColor2":"daba9b","textColor4":"b09881","textColor1":"ecf3f8","bgColor":"0c0d1b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/91/89/da/9189da5d-de08-632f-043d-9e2779fd0c3a/efe33694-c081-4e7d-8fff-2551b65e453b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b0b7ae","textColor2":"a7c4b5","textColor4":"8ea69a","textColor1":"d0d9ce","bgColor":"2d2f30","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/22/c1/5d22c17a-7a37-b0db-c6fd-9ba3b6b540c0/94b48a48-a030-4691-a4f2-77257bc66155.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a79e9f","textColor2":"c6c3c3","textColor4":"9f9c9d","textColor1":"d0c5c5","bgColor":"040407","hasP3":false}},"name":"Glory","artistName":"Perfume Genius","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2b/82/d5/2b82d50c-e3c2-3881-260c-8e94f36d6ef6/191401210577.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d0d0cf","textColor2":"d6bd6e","textColor4":"b09b5b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"171611","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The remarkable thing about Mike Hadreas’ music is how he manages to fit such big feelings into such small, confined spaces.

In the case of Lucy Dacus—the dreamy singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known these days as one-third of indie-rock supergroup boygenius—the conundrum could apply to any number of current-life situations, among them her unexpected success as a Grammy-winning rock god. “I think that through boygenius, it felt like, ‘Well, what else? I don’t want more than this,’” Dacus tells Apple Music. “I feel like I’ve been very career-oriented because I’ve just wanted to play music, satisfy my own drive, and make things that I can be proud of. Getting Grammys and stuff, I’m like, ‘Well, I guess that’s the end of the line. What is my life about?’”\n\nOn her fourth solo album, <i>Forever Is a Feeling</i>, Dacus takes a heartfelt stab at answering that question, and in doing so, opens another desire-related can of worms. While the record explores the intoxicating, confusing, fleeting qualities of romance, it simultaneously functions as a fan-fic-worthy relationship reveal. (She went public with her relationship with boygenius bandmate Julien Baker weeks before the album’s release.) On <i>Forever</i>, Dacus dives headfirst into the implied complications, recruiting co-producer Blake Mills for subversive, swooning folk-pop numbers that revel in the mysteries of love, and what precedes it. \n\nDacus’ songwriting has always been vulnerable, though perhaps never this much, nor in this way. “What if we don’t touch?” she begins the super-sexy “Ankles” by proposing—instead, she imagines hypothetical bitten shoulders, pulled hair, crossword puzzles finished together the morning after. (“It’s about not being able to get what you want,” Dacus says of the song. “You want to get them in bed, but you also want to wake up with them in the morning and have sweet, intimate moments, and you can’t. So, you just have to use your imagination about what that might be like.”) She explores the in-between stages of a relationship on the wispy “For Keeps,” takes a quiet road trip through the mountains with her partner on “Talk,” and on “Big Deal,” she wonders to a star-crossed lover if things could ever go back to how it was before, though the climactic final chorus suggests otherwise.\n\nWriting <i>Forever</i> brought Dacus closer to an answer to the question she posed to herself earlier, and she doesn’t care how cheesy it may sound. “I want my life to be about love,” she explained to Apple Music. “It feels corny to say. But that’s part of what this project is—the idea that talking about love is corny. I don’t think love is all you need, but I do think you need it amongst everything else.”","short":"Swooning folk pop that revels in the mysteries of love, and what precedes it."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-is-a-feeling/1787193107","playParams":{"id":"1787193107","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PedUC4azy5ywqWp8gVVrs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787193107/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1060812309","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1060812309?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743162331944}}},"1787414630":{"id":"1787414630","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787414630?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/false-heads/1062317103","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Cracked - EP","artistName":"False Heads","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e3/6b/cf/e36bcf77-9944-ef87-6371-f65f710387a4/199066336793.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"002226","textColor2":"1d1615","textColor4":"173437","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"01adbf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cracked-ep/1787414630","playParams":{"id":"1787414630","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7fFRrzFRF6UvfRgaI97nC4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787414630/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1062317103","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1062317103?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743168191229}}},"1787840904":{"id":"1787840904","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787840904?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lady-beast/1300433888","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Inner Alchemist","artistName":"Lady Beast","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/95/98/fc/9598fcef-d4b7-5eec-c3b5-a519c48cecee/199066432631.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5ac8c","textColor2":"abb5ce","textColor4":"8d95aa","textColor1":"f1d2a7","bgColor":"16151d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-inner-alchemist/1787840904","playParams":{"id":"1787840904","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58hEH9Vzj25jTgJlH9Zy5y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787840904/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1300433888","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1300433888?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743070065520}}},"1789844150":{"id":"1789844150","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789844150?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Bluegrass","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alison-krauss-union-station/354058195","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/06/32/2d/06322d3b-833f-c8a5-0786-c64f5563c117/Job300486c3-ffe1-45ee-b316-a7a8db1fa903-184630565-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361101708_2034857052-Time1738005268952.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","2c2926"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"f4ecdf"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"484743","textColor2":"2c2926","textColor4":"534f4a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f4ecdf","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ca/60/7c/ca607cd4-a5bf-8905-ca88-eff1496761fd/Job4c7fceac-a9e1-4b25-92d0-13c051838339-184630566-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361101709_2034857051-Time1738006509865.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"49453f","textColor2":"2a251f","textColor4":"4f493f","textColor1":"22201f","bgColor":"e3d7c2","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fe/62/ad/fe62ad44-87cc-1f26-f411-5c0d3c1a437e/96d64bc1-dd42-40b4-bf0a-2c223dcd9e0c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"3a3a37","textColor2":"1f1e1b","textColor4":"3c3a37","textColor1":"1c1d1b","bgColor":"b2aea7","hasP3":false}},"name":"Arcadia","artistName":"Alison Krauss & Union Station","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/96/44/97/964497e1-ba69-74a0-f546-de8967022e56/108908.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"413d39","textColor2":"282824","textColor4":"4c4943","textColor1":"1b1917","bgColor":"dccfbe","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Alison Krauss and her band Union Station aren’t what you’d call prolific. After all, this eighth studio album from the bluegrass outfit comes 14 years after its predecessor, the critically acclaimed <i>Paper Airplane</i>. As any Krauss fan knows, though, the 27-time Grammy-winning multi-hyphenate prioritizes quality over quantity, and the 10 new songs comprising this collection are no exception to that rule. Krauss and the band produced <i>Arcadia</i> alongside fellow Grammy winner Gary Paczosa (Dolly Parton, Sierra Ferrell), with IIIrd Tyme Out’s Russell Moore joining Union Station in place of longtime guitarist Dan Tyminski, whose own solo and side projects have picked up significantly in the near decade and a half since <i>Paper Airplane</i>’s release.\n\n<i>Arcadia</i> opens with the Jeremy Lister-penned “Looks Like the End of the Road,” a dusky and dramatic ballad with a sparkling vocal from Krauss, whose voice sounds as pristine as it ever has. Moore’s guitar retains the Southern gothic moodiness once brought by Tyminski, and his lead vocal on tracks like “The Hangman” offers a sturdy, soulful counterpoint to Krauss’s honeyed soprano—notably, Moore is the most decorated male vocalist in International Bluegrass Music Association history. Other highlights include the Tyminski co-write “The Wrong Way,” which lets Jerry Douglas shine on dobro and lap steel guitar, and closer “There’s a Light Up Ahead,” another Lister tune with gorgeously atmospheric production that really gives Krauss space to soar.","short":"Their first album together in 14 years preserves their rep as bluegrass

Central Cee and Kyle Richh of 41 both come through for guest verses, but Nemzzz, who’s originally from Manchester, manages to approach the project with a humility that’s infectious: He’s playing big shows and moving tons of units, but he’s still got plenty more to prove. \n\nWith his signature, UK drill-inspired flow, Nemzzz takes us deep into his psyche. Over stomping percussion, rubbery 808s, and a retro horn melody on “COLD,” he raps, “Apart from bro, when I ain’t have bread, me, I didn’t hear from no one.” He sums it up nicely during the next verse when he adds, “Mumsy didn’t expect this life for me when I was an infant.” On <i>RENT’S DUE</i>, Nemzzz makes it clear he’s still growing into his status as a superstar, but he’s getting a bit more comfortable with each chart-topper.","short":"The British MC follows up his breakthrough with humility."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rents-due/1791866842","playParams":{"id":"1791866842","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3uKar0bX3b6g6YcLrGDDuD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791866842/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1434427948","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1434427948?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743164583455}}},"1791946809":{"id":"1791946809","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791946809?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Electronic","Ambient"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/apparitions/298845730","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Volcanic Reality","artistName":"Apparitions","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bd/2c/21/bd2c2116-9a50-827a-bfe3-318872e19458/12038.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"262626","textColor2":"090909","textColor4":"2a2a2a","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"ababab","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/volcanic-reality/1791946809","playParams":{"id":"1791946809","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/41cKgKBFnJyuCroiIa7own"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791946809/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"298845730","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/298845730?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743128432509}}},"1792063107":{"id":"1792063107","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792063107?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wallows/1225257328","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/97/82/a7/9782a7cb-1a75-b40a-00d9-a07c1fc468c5/f994b46d-87e9-448e-8e3e-6483960af07c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e0d3cf","textColor2":"f2eceb","textColor4":"dbcbc7","textColor1":"f8f5f5","bgColor":"7f4837","hasP3":false}},"name":"More","artistName":"Wallows","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1a/4b/2b/1a4b2bd9-bd21-b722-01f9-6717044a609a/075679624536.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"31170e","textColor2":"140909","textColor4":"3a1c14","textColor1":"090201","bgColor":"d56a40","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"It takes a certain amount of gumption to name a track “Your New Favorite Song,” but LA alt-pop trio Wallows possess just the right combination of humble charm and outsized confidence to pull it off. On the one hand, it’s an intimate breakup serenade about a guy trying to win back his girl by writing her a pretty tune; on the other hand, the sax-sweetened, flute-speckled, bongo-grooved track is emblematic of a band that’s become ever more adept at hitting myriad pop-song pleasure points simultaneously. \n\nComing on the heels of 2024’s John Congleton-produced <i>Model</i>, <i>More</i> is a seven-song EP overflowing with a double album’s worth of ideas: “Not Alone” blossoms from a bedroom synth-pop sketch into a skyscraping, drum-pounding anthem, while “Coffin Change” angles for retroactive placement on your 2009 Indie Bops playlist sandwiched between Phoenix and Vampire Weekend. But the two appearances of “Deep Dive”—first as a lush ’70s soft-rock flashback and then as a summer-vibed pool-party soundtrack—provide the clearest view of Wallows’ ever-expanding talent for updating classic pop craftsmanship with contemporary indie aesthetics.","short":"The alt-pop trio stuffs a double album’s worth of ideas into an

Album","standard":"“It’s like a thank-you note,” Jay Wheeler tells Apple Music about <i>GIRASOLES</i>. “It’s like a letter saying I’m here for these people.” By “these people,” the Puerto Rican singer is referring specifically to his family, paying tribute to both his wife Zhamira Zambrano and their young daughter throughout this, his most personal project yet. Making the transition from R&B singing reggaetonero to full-fledged Latin pop star all but official here, he largely eschews the genre styles prevalent on his prior albums to push forward a more mature sound to match his grown-up lyricism.\n\nIndeed, apart from “Nota” with Omar Courtz and “Verte Por Ahí,” Wheeler prefers a more balladic approach across these 15 tracks. Though hip-hop has long been part of his formula, the way he repurposes its rhythms and flows for “Dañao Pa Siempre” and “Roma” feels noticeably different from, say, 2023’s <i>TRAPPii</i>. Inspired by a car accident he survived, “Abrázame Fuerte” gets boosted by a spiritual element that corresponds with its melancholy, off-kilter synths. “In that moment, I only wanted a hug from God,” he says. “I only wanted to know that He come down and be like, ‘Everything is good, you are going to be fine.’”\n\nWhile several of the themes here tend towards the universal, Wheeler’s familial dedications give <i>GIRASOLES</i> some of its most powerful peaks. Written prior to his daughter’s birth, “Aiunii” bursts with paternal hope towards what fatherhood could entail. “What I sang in the song, there are things missing, things I haven’t experienced in that song, but I know I’m going to experience them with her,” he says. “Now that I have her in my arms, it’s everything I sang, and even better, and there’s still more to come.”","short":"The Puerto Rican

In a sense, <i>PAID IN MEMORIES</i> makes good on those interests. She recruits hip-hop icons like Lil Wayne and Big Sean, alongside peers such as Lil Yachty, to help formulate some of these rap-leaning ideas. Despite the prevalence of these moments, though, she still offers up plenty of alt-pop songs for fans of her first two efforts: 2020’s <i>BEFORE LOVE CAME TO KILLS US</i> and 2022’s <i>YESSIE</i>. “PSILOCYBIN & DAISIES” flips the guitar riff from The Smashing Pumpkins’ “1979” and turns it into a hard-charging pop cut. Elsewhere, she displays her versatility with the downtempo neo-soul of “TORONTO SHORDIE” and the reggaetón-inspired groove of “PALO SANTO,” creating an album that pays tribute to all her passions.","short":"On her third album, hip-hop flourishes push her pop into new directions."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paid-in-memories/1799789428","playParams":{"id":"1799789428","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5L3z1dICHHIS9FWewUhvu9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799789428/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1043591612","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1043591612?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743148554017}}},"1799804278":{"id":"1799804278","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799804278?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-21","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stray-kids/1304823362","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0a/85/49/0a8549ec-2d3c-affa-90a3-78d5a63d9e9a/Jobaddb6af2-9288-4791-9dae-6fa242cee808-188402420-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368928730_2093347577-Time1742504579463.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","3cb4d6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0c2753"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"3cb4d6","textColor4":"3090ab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0c2753","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/61/91/43/619143d7-ea3f-1ee6-83d4-30daf243bb52/039ac6a5-551b-45bb-ab1b-4604570628f4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcbec5","textColor2":"dcdde0","textColor4":"b3b4b7","textColor1":"e7e9f2","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/fb/6d/a6/fb6da60c-61cf-49a8-41e4-971066c47226/Jobb3d8e015-7a53-4022-bfd5-b33c212be2e4-188402421-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368928731_2093347576-Time1742506451221.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2e86e9"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0c2753"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cccbcc","textColor2":"2e86e9","textColor4":"256bbb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0c2753","hasP3":false}},"name":"Mixtape : dominATE - EP","artistName":"Stray Kids","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/92/51/8a/92518ab3-5447-9fc1-57b2-206e2dc48e8a/8809928953489_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"cdcdcd","textColor2":"0f86f5","textColor4":"0d6cc6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"060608","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"On the heels of 2024’s <i>HOP</i>, K-pop phenoms Stray Kids continue their tradition of more casual, self-produced “mixtape” releases with <i>Mixtape : dominATE</i>.

In restless, electric guitar-led “Burnin’ Tires,” Changbin and I.N. are “running until the end,” while HAN and Felix rap about riding Benzes and saluting fans in swagger song “Truman.” Bang Chan and Hyunjin beckon listeners to follow in head-banging pop-rock track “ESCAPE,” while Lee Know and Seungmin promise to keep singing in lyrical ballad “CINEMA.”\n\nThe octet is all together for a Korean-language version of “GIANT,” a stadium-stomper that was first released in its Japanese-language version as the title track of the group’s second full-length Japanese album in 2024.

Beyond the controversies and improprieties that added a tabloid-ready gloss to his career, the Baton Rouge artist stood out on that second proper album for his inventive, oft-energetic takes on the trap era’s street-hustle mindset. Now, another half-decade later, freshly independent and pushing 40, he reveals both the rewards and the toll of that lifestyle on this concise sequel. \n\nIn line with hip-hop’s ongoing mental health journey in rhyme, opener “Therapy Sessions” dives deep into a psyche so fraught with trauma that it would send most so-called pain rappers into hiding. “Same Way” finds him operating as a master of that particular subgenre, calculating loss amid the wins as a form of cautionary tale for the listener. Via the duality of “Big Bruddah (Don’t Be Mad),” he recounts betrayals and slights endured in the trenches while also flaunting his wealth and the intricate means through which he’s acquired it. Still, he can’t help but come off as triumphant on “Brasi the Eagle,” evoking his infamous mobster moniker to emphasize that his successes surpass his suffering.\n\nGates’ characteristically unfiltered approach serves him well here. Whether truth-telling on the grimy motivational “Manifest” or casually pulling the baddest of baddies on the explicit “No Pressure,” that outlandish streak resurfaces enough times that it rewards his day-one listenership. Those long-term fans know that he’s remained true to form all these years, though anyone needing a reminder can reference “Block Away” and “Kiss the Ring” for clarity.","short":"The Baton Rouge rap star stays winning while contemplating loss."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/im-him-2/1799810836","playParams":{"id":"1799810836","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4qcdBStuMPfHMYOUzqBjbp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799810836/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"298383551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/298383551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743169616917}}},"1799973586":{"id":"1799973586","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799973586?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/unsolicited/1570003955","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Life Energies","artistName":"Unsolicited","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8e/f7/c3/8ef7c309-b03d-a291-0664-b8c98abad523/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9ced2","textColor2":"bffbf9","textColor4":"9fcece","textColor1":"f4fcfe","bgColor":"1c1721","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-energies/1799973586","playParams":{"id":"1799973586","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ot5Gy5vXU3y2LwJGXwXK7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799973586/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1570003955","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1570003955?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743125336149}}},"1800022227":{"id":"1800022227","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800022227?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":89,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/whitesnake/107115","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Access All Areas: Live","artistName":"Whitesnake","artwork":{"width":3780,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/be/0f/c1be0fc8-3c68-ce0f-3362-b20a42b1dd4c/603497813308.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3780,"textColor3":"cacaca","textColor2":"d9d2d7","textColor4":"ada8ac","textColor1":"fcfcfc","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/access-all-areas-live/1800022227","playParams":{"id":"1800022227","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800022227/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"107115","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/107115?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742595321682}}},"1800302702":{"id":"1800302702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800302702?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flying-lotus/120737020","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cd/ea/58/cdea5872-7494-5dbb-fb39-97abe698e19b/28c698a5-1ab4-4aa3-9415-d091adef6e73.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ca2c2e","textColor2":"f6303c","textColor4":"c82933","textColor1":"f83335","bgColor":"111112","hasP3":false}},"name":"ASH (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Flying Lotus","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/4a/e8/054ae876-d993-e1d5-e1c1-5150c6d42044/196872904000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e8b9c1","textColor2":"e9e9e9","textColor4":"ddbcc1","textColor1":"f6e6e9","bgColor":"ae0824","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","standard":"Fans of Los Angeles beat-scene vanguard Flying Lotus (born Steven Ellison) are growing accustomed to a new side of the artist. Known for shapeshifting, jazz-inspired electronic compositions, Ellison has spent much of the 2020s diving into the expansive world of film scoring, serving up the soundtrack for 2021’s <i>Yasuke</i> anime series and his feature-length directorial debut, <i>ASH</i>. The latter combines his interest in sci-fi lore with the electronic soundscapes of his solo albums (2010’s <i>Cosmogramma</i> and 2019’s <i>Flamagra</i>, in particular), embracing the droning foreboding of seminal soundtracks from <i>Blade Runner</i> to <i>Dune</i>. Like 2024’s <i>Spirit Box</i>, which was inspired by Ellison revisiting David Lynch’s <i>Twin Peaks</i>, <i>ASH</i> takes its influence from the history of film score epics. “INTRIGUE AND WINDOW” creeps along with horror-inspired synths and rumbling bass, while “A CURIOUS MIND” is built around the atmospheric and textural strings that accent so many iconic moments throughout cinematic

But its longing is cut off at the knees when Grande begins describing her desire to “jump into your skin and change your eyes” so she can provide a kind of turbo-charged empathy that reveals the relationship’s darker side. While its pillow-soft sonics and Grande’s resolute singing are gentle, it’s still a jarring lyric to hear right after the album proper’s closer, “ordinary things,” on which Grande's nonna Marjorie tells her granddaughter in no uncertain terms about the signals that a relationship is over. Nonna spoke, Grande listened, that book is closed.\n\nOr is there even a book in the first place? When discussing the beat-forward, hit-packed <i>eternal sunshine</i> with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe around its initial release in 2024, Grande said, “Finding a home in <i>eternal sunshine</i> was a lovely costume to wear,” noting that the “freedom within art” was present because of the endless possibilities for sources—personal truths, films (like <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, the surrealistic love story  that provides the album’s title), high concepts. With the release of <i>Wicked</i>, Ariana's big-screen coming-out party in late 2024, Grande had reached new heights of celebrity—and with that newfound status, her personal life was under further scrutiny.\n\nOver the rest of <i>brighter days ahead</i>, Grande is playfully opaque, making a reference to “holding space” on the simmering “warm,” which turns Grande’s vocals into a neon-lit cloud settling over glossy synth skyscrapers, and declaring “I’m still the same but only entirely different” on “Hampstead,” a reimagining of the barroom-piano-led last-call lament. That’s only one spot where Grande’s voice pushes into exciting new territory: “dandelion,” a lusty expression of desire, spins out of a drowsy trumpet line, its looped horn and sampled trap drums adding heat.\n\n“Might fuck around and elevate my expectations,” Ariana muses on the chorus of “past life,” a low-lit synth-R&B cut. As with her other releases, <i>brighter days ahead</i> shows how her attention to detail and desire to evolve have resulted in a singular body of work that, even if it’s playing coy about where the public Grande ends and the private Ari begins, is utterly her own.","short":"A reworking of the 2024 album holds space for six additional tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eternal-sunshine-deluxe-brighter-days-ahead/1800579610","playParams":{"id":"1800579610","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6kXXIMyzRgQeai4A0DsXOn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800579610/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743144421070}}},"1800628077":{"id":"1800628077","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800628077?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rend-collective/775030640","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e3/64/ac/e364ac21-c889-5c6b-a16d-8c66e5251bea/409779fb-2ebc-4665-b822-c0d6bcd5e5c1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9ca1a6","textColor2":"c6bcb7","textColor4":"9f9794","textColor1":"c2c9ce","bgColor":"040407","hasP3":false}},"name":"FOLK!

This month’s Early Hours was crafted by the Chilean artist RUBIO, who envisioned a magical mix of the two. “I imagined something sensual, thoughtful, melancholic, dark, and bright,” she tells Apple Music. “Those things can mix while you’re waking, but the post-party [environment] makes you feel melancholy for that ecstasy that no longer exists.” This mix includes longtime staples like the moody meditation “Colomb” by fellow Chilean producer Nicolas Jaar, but she also calls out current favorites such as “Winona” by the Australian producer DJ BORING. “That’s the one I’m always putting on.” So hit play and settle into a downtempo mood—whether you’re thinking about turning in or just easing into the day.","short":"The Chilean artist crafts a sensual mix that shifts between darkness and light."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/early-hours-dj-mix/1801851790","playParams":{"id":"1801851790","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801851790/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"34747724","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/34747724?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743104545488}}},"1802013049":{"id":"1802013049","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802013049?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brian-eno/38124","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"AURUM","artistName":"Brian Eno","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ee/08/25/ee082585-6450-f091-bd34-a6675978edc8/4523132153889.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"adb1aa","textColor2":"b6d6ba","textColor4":"98ac99","textColor1":"d0ddcf","bgColor":"220116","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Play,” the pop-art experimentalist Brian Eno tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, “is a way of exploring things.” On <i>AURUM</i>, released exclusively on Apple Music in 2025, the ambient pioneer takes that idea to new frontiers, using sonic texture and his meticulous detailing to create hushed realms and grand landscapes. \n\nCollecting tracks that Eno debuted on his Apple Music Chill radio show AMBER, Eno’s first solo full-length since 2022 shows the British innovator at the peak of his powers. On “Gorgeous Night,” synthesized, sustained drones rise up and tangle into one another, creating the aural equivalent of a shimmering, imperceptibly shifting aurora borealis. “Material World” pairs harsh tones that recall an alert tone’s implicit warning with an insistent beat and metallic scrapes, evoking the pulse of a city before it melts into its darkest hours. “Friendly Reactor Near Menacing Forest” echoes the standoff-level tension of its title, its rumbling low end and insistent upper register seemingly at odds as oscillations and shooting-star synth-strings veer into the mix. \n\n<i>AURUM</i> is available in Spatial Audio, and, as Eno tells Lowe, he’s been working with the idea of making music immersive for years. In the past, he would set up boomboxes around a space and make them play at once. “They weren’t synchronized together—that was the whole point,” Eno says. “But not being synchronized allowed new clusters of sound to appear.” Now listeners can replicate that ideal at home, giving new breadth and depth to songs like the fog-shrouded opener “Fragmented Film” and the windswept “Cascade.” With <i>AURUM</i>, he continues to explore his sense of play while creating ambient music, a genre that he’s been instrumental in defining and refining.\n","short":"Hear the ambient pioneer’s latest album, only on Apple Music."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aurum/1802013049","playParams":{"id":"1802013049","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802013049/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"38124","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/38124?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743158914713}}},"1802058474":{"id":"1802058474","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802058474?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ty-myers/1674345303","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/df/20/f3/df20f34e-d473-f6d9-7a00-9725b0a88d9b/3412ec99-5b87-4ad3-95a3-f2c57b7cf081.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a3b39","textColor2":"1d1b17","textColor4":"474540","textColor1":"0d0e0d","bgColor":"f0eee7","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/03/16/13/0316136a-4e1b-4ae3-2f2d-e9b009811b25/88721184-9509-491a-9828-8c4ea036eac0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"caacad","textColor2":"f4c4b4","textColor4":"cda69a","textColor1":"f1cbcb","bgColor":"2f2f34","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4c/48/b2/4c48b2e4-a597-8b82-a18f-420d51c3d947/c9777a5b-aea1-4282-9293-2d8aac01968f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ad9797","textColor2":"d7ac9f","textColor4":"b18e86","textColor1":"d2b6b5","bgColor":"1a1a21","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Select (Deluxe)","artistName":"Ty Myers","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/85/e0/7f/85e07ff1-5e9d-0bd2-66ce-6abf2ba1983d/196872835892.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0aa80","textColor2":"e5836b","textColor4":"bd6e5d","textColor1":"eacd96","bgColor":"1a1c28","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Album","standard":"Many young artists are touted as being old souls, but few have the chops, confidence, and clarity of vision of Ty Myers. The Austin-based singer-songwriter is just 17 as he releases his debut, though you’d be forgiven for thinking him at least a decade older after hearing the soulful weariness of opener “Ends of the Earth,” or the scrappy wisdom of the melodic and tender “Let ’Em Talk.” Myers seems to find inspiration in virtuosity, naming Stevie Ray Vaughan and Chris Stapleton among his primary influences. You can hear those connections across <i>The Select</i>, like when Myers goes for broke on the loose and funky “Can’t Hold Me Down,” and in much of his guitar playing, which, like Vaughan’s did, tends toward blues while dipping into jazz. Myers also includes a cover of fellow SRV fan John Mayer’s “Man on the Side.” To boot, Myers is just as skilled at choosing collaborators, as Anderson East, Trent Dabbs, and Jessi Alexander are credited as co-writers.","short":"The Austin singer adds new tracks and acoustic versions to his debut

DJ Mix","standard":"The Rap Life playlist is home to hip-hop’s heavy hitters and its vanguard, which means that the Rap Life DJ mix has everything in hip-hop you need to hear right now. This month, the mix was put together by Godspeed, the man who controls the decks for New York City’s most beloved rapper and producer right now, Cash Cobain. The two met when Cobain discovered the exclusive parties Godspeed used to throw, so it’s safe to say the DJ knows what’s going to get bodies in motion. “When putting this mix together, my goal was to bridge the gap between NYC’s underground sound and the mainstream anthems that set the tone for any pre-game or night out,” Godspeed says. “I wanted to curate something that not only represents the city’s energy but also shines a light on some of the emerging artists shaping the culture in 2025.” The Rap Life DJ mix is the culture in action, so enjoy this set and check back each month for more one-of-a-kind mixes.","short":"New York-centric sounds to “set the tone for any pre-game or night

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Playboi Carti has hardly been absent in the roughly four years since <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, appearing alongside the likes of Future, Latto, and Trippie Redd in the interim. Still, that didn’t keep his enormous fanbase from persistently clamoring over the prospect of <i>I AM MUSIC</i>, ultimately released with the truncated title of, simply, <i>MUSIC</i>. Its substantial length seems to acknowledge the wait, opening with a flurry of rage-rap tracks like “POP OUT” and “CRUSH” that herald the raconteur’s welcome arrival. Over its 30-track, 77-minute runtime, his sonics shift between the aggressively blown-out, synth-heavy post-trap he became infamous for and something markedly poppier, yet all of it undeniably within his stylistic range. \n\nCarti initially kept his choice of guests close to the vest, as has become custom for high-profile album drops. Yet it would be impossible not to recognize Kendrick Lamar spitting on “GOOD CREDIT,” Future emoting over “TRIM,” or collaborative career mainstay Lil Uzi Vert gliding triumphantly through “TWIN TRIM.” The Weeknd’s prominent feature on “RATHER LIE” makes for perhaps the most overt example of his envelope-pushing here, though appearances by Travis Scott on “PHILLY” and the tag team of Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign on “WE NEED ALL DA VIBES” make the pivot even more plausible.\n\nEven with friends like these, Carti shines brighter on his own, his breathy near-falsetto vocal booming through the escalating video game arpeggios of “I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI” and his raspy snarl swerving around the cinematic noise of “COCAINE NOSE.” Not exclusively looking towards the future, there’s an almost nostalgic appreciation for Atlanta’s early 2010s sound evoked on “RADAR,” its beat reminiscent of classic 1017 Brick Squad tapes.\n","short":"The rage-rap raconteur’s long-awaited return gets four extra tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/music-sorry-4-da-wait/1804427542","playParams":{"id":"1804427542","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7sFZGbkCitoqQz7Rt3LoKg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804427542/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"982372505","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/982372505?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743151786121}}},"1804759284":{"id":"1804759284","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804759284?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=280215834-1410841257","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/e8/83/84e883f1-f6e9-b443-23fa-1e969c8d6c71/707e52d0-2fa4-4a59-8c39-93b834893967.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b3a3a","textColor2":"242428","textColor4":"4d4e51","textColor1":"0d0b0b","bgColor":"f3f5f5","hasP3":false}},"name":"I Said I Love You First...","artistName":"Selena Gomez & benny blanco","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d7/a2/54/d7a2545c-f4d8-d413-5b9f-abefd37822a4/25UMGIM10095.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3800b","textColor2":"fa8f00","textColor4":"c97301","textColor1":"f2a00c","bgColor":"060405","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The fourth album from Selena Gomez—the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate who needs no introduction, having been famous for approximately two-thirds of her life—doubles as her first album with her fiancé, benny blanco, who has produced and written more hit singles than you’ve had hot dinners. (It’s blanco’s third album, following 2018’s feature-happy <i>Friends Keep Secrets</i> and its 2021 sequel.) The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\n\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”","short":"“An idea that started in our bedroom”: Pop’s power couple
