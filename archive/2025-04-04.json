Thoughts","artistName":"Lil Durk","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Chicago drill superstar’s eighth studio album, 2023’s <i>Almost Healed</i>, was devoted to the concept of recovering from trauma—a theme that’s haunted Lil Durk’s music, either implicitly or explicitly, since his emergence in the early 2010s as the most melodically gifted of the genre’s rising stars. Its March 2025 follow-up, <i>Deep Thoughts</i>, was slated for release in October 2024. But that same month, Durk was arrested (along with several affiliates of his record label and collective, Only the Family) in connection to a murder-for-hire case against a rival rapper. The rapper born Durk Banks has maintained his innocence, but was denied bail on the grounds of being a flight risk. If convicted of the charges, the 32-year-old faces life in prison.\n\nThis changes the gravity of his long-awaited ninth album, which was delayed four times since the 2024 arrest. But the tracklist of <i>Deep Thoughts</i> seems to reflect a different lifetime, with pre-arrest singles like “Turn Up a Notch” and a suite of lusty ballads like the benny blanco-produced Jhene Aiko duet, “Can’t Hide It.” The resounding pathos of Durk’s work remains—most potently on “Keep on Sippin’,” whose candid bars detail the vicious cycle of addiction. But the stakes have changed, and it’s hard not to wonder what the Lil Durk of the past year might have to get off his chest instead. Still, an offhand line from “They Want to Be You,” a melancholy Future collab about the expectations of fame, hits even harder now: “All the kids rap, they wanna be just like you.”","short":"The drill star’s ninth studio album is a dispatch from a different life."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fa/d8/05/fad8054e-8980-eb74-22d5-b163a8e41d7e/196872525182.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7bfc4","textColor2":"b0c4ba","textColor4":"8fa39c","textColor1":"e2e8ec","bgColor":"0a1e24","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deep-thoughts/1771970310","playParams":{"id":"1771970310","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1P7Zt5WwMMY6cwts6WkY1M"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771970310/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"541282483","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/541282483?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743759125851,"RTCI":0}}},"1772130247":{"id":"1772130247","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772130247?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anti-clone/658238709","name":"Inhuman - EP","artistName":"Anti-Clone","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/af/44/6d/af446d91-82f5-6bc0-3cec-81614cfc98da/198704185007_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c66827","textColor2":"ed5318","textColor4":"c24815","textColor1":"f27b2d","bgColor":"171e0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inhuman-ep/1772130247","playParams":{"id":"1772130247","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772130247/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"658238709","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/658238709?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743748954129,"RTCI":0}}},"1783306710":{"id":"1783306710","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783306710?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6b/db/77/6bdb77d5-8aff-3830-cd6c-f332127127ac/Jobde2f2c81-ff3c-42c1-86d6-2cc8e0ddc887-189409453-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370883016_2108620157-Time1743603632724.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","91bad2"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0d0902"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"8ba1b0","textColor2":"91bad2","textColor4":"7496ab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0d0902","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/76/7a/94/767a946e-88be-6db2-1f41-806cf6ccfc1a/8429a353-4faf-4499-8912-44a3b56b95ad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1bdc8","textColor2":"c1cdda","textColor4":"9da7b1","textColor1":"dbe9f7","bgColor":"0d0e0c","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fe/95/8f/fe958f75-628a-39a1-8205-703bf4dd4d3f/Job67a2786b-9460-4691-ba69-30204aaaa761-189409452-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370883017_2108620156-Time1743602103491.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","eedcb8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0d0902"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bfc8c1","textColor2":"eedcb8","textColor4":"c3c1ad","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0d0902","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lawrence-hart/286587757","name":"Come In Out Of The Rain","artistName":"Lawrence Hart","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I wanted this record to be sincere,” Lawrence Hart tells Apple Music. “It’s about the fragility of euphoria, the tinge of melancholy in uplifting moments.” Since the release of his debut EP, <i>Red Lion</i>, in 2021, British producer Hart has made his signature an infectious blend of thumping dance-floor drums, rumbling bass, and soaring vocal melodies—a peak-time club sound that treads the line between joy and emotive introspection.\n\nWith Hart having regularly collaborated with juggernauts of melodic dance music like George FitzGerald and Alan Fitzpatrick, this long-awaited debut album presents the fullest realization of a poignant and powerful production style that is distinctly his own. From the ambient melodics of “Lotus Bloom” to the thunderous 2-step of “NoMoreLuv4u”, enveloping harmonies of “Still But Still Moving,” and classic garage feel of “Hear Ur Heartbeat,” the record’s 12 tracks play out the sound of Hart’s defiant arrival. “This is the summation of everything I’ve been working towards over the past few years,” he says. “It’s a record to bring people together on the dance floor.” Read on for Hart’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Lotus Bloom”</b>\n“I’ve had this instrumental intro for a few years and have always tried to shoehorn it into a lot of different ideas because I love it so much but it’s never quite worked. When it came to making the album, I realized it should just stand alone as a bit of drama to kick off the record, since I love albums like <i>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</i> by Genesis or anything by King Crimson—they’re all prog albums that have so much melodrama and narrative to them too!”\n\n<b>“NoMoreLuv4u”</b>\n“These chords were written sometime during the COVID lockdowns, and I couldn’t find a tune to fit them into until I came across this sample by a great Australian R&B singer called TANISHA. When I heard her vocal line, it chopped perfectly to make the hook alongside the chords and stood out straightaway as a single. I probably did the least work on this track out of the entire record and it subsequently has a directness to it that really connects to audiences whenever I play it.”\n\n<b>“Closer to You”</b>\n“‘Closer to You’ is the second track I wrote for the record at the end of 2022, when I was putting up lots of 16- or 32-bar ideas on Instagram and getting people’s reactions. Everyone reacted well to this one, and then I found an amazing ’90s R&B cover of Anita Baker’s ‘Sweet Love’ that fit beautifully to round it off with an a cappella feel. It ended up producing the sound for the whole album to come.”\n\n<b>“Out of the Rain”</b>\n“I went on a deep dive into YouTube playlists of unreleased R&B projects from the late ’90s and early 2000s while I was writing the album and came across this really fun sample. I love finding things that are really obscure and giving them some life through a sample. We ended up using my friend Sashi Wild’s own lyrics and vocals over that sampled melody, and then I combined it with the Burial feel of the backing to produce the final track.”\n\n<b>“Just Belong”</b>\n“I had written the track ‘Trust’ a few months before this with Giulia Tess and loved the trance-y synth sound we found for that on the Moog. I felt like I could live in that sound for another track, so I started writing chords and playing around with these Special Request samples to ground it. It’s another one that touches on the prog influence because it has so many layered sections to it!”\n\n<b>“Still But Still Moving”</b>\n“I wanted to take every opportunity I could to have as many ambient moments as possible on the album. The next track, ‘Love U Bring,’ starts with just a vocal pad so I wanted to make a palate cleanser before that with this drone playing a melody over piano chords. It’s something to start the second half of the record, like DJing, where every fourth or fifth track you bring the energy down before you bring it up again.”\n\n<b>“Love U Bring”</b>\n“This track is all about a wild ‘rug pull’ moment that comes halfway through. You’re listening to the chopped vocal sample I found from a 1999 album by this American R&B singer called Coko and then it’s sequenced over a simple bassline that suddenly transitions into a crazy ending that takes the listener to another place entirely. I love the feeling of the switch-up.”\n\n<b>“Hear Ur Heartbeat”</b>\n“I love to find a little line from a verse that I can then chop and pitch to create a chorus hook. That’s what happened with this ‘hear your heartbeat’ phrase from a beautiful record called ‘7am’ by Shivum Sharma that I instantly knew I had to make a song with. It came together quickly but the mixing of it was very long because I wanted to create an overwhelming sense of euphoria in the chorus without giving the listener anxiety from playing too much melody all at once. It’s all about balance.”\n\n<b>“The Wind Cry”</b>\n“In my studio, I have this granular sampler that has a condenser mic on the front that can pick up anything I’m playing in the room. I played the end of ‘Hear Ur Heartbeat’ into it and the sounds of ‘The Wind Cry’ are those chords decaying before being plugged into an ambient pedal to build the piece. All the ambient pieces on the album aren’t over-polished, since I want to let them be what they are.”\n\n<b>“Fucking Mega”</b>\n“This is the only track on the album that was initially an older demo. It has a certain sincerity to it because of the sample of this guy talking about his clubbing heyday, which came from a mate of mine recording a 20-minute convo he had with a stranger on the street about dance music. I wasn’t considering putting it on the record but it was one that everyone loved, which took me by surprise. It feels like a more challenging listen but I guess it’s all the more rewarding for that.”\n\n<b>“Daydreamers”</b>\n“I was feeling a bit creatively drained when it came to writing this track since I had already finished most of the album and my brain was in a mixing and finishing mode. I came across this folder of ideas from a few years before that I’d completely forgotten about, and ‘Daydreamers’ was a track I couldn’t believe I hadn’t done anything with. It felt perfect to finish off the record with but had no vocals on it so I ended up adding these lines constructed entirely of runs that singers do between lyrics.”\n\n<b>“The Wave Cry”</b>\n“I was listening to Keith Jarrett’s solo piano concerts a lot when writing this, and so I went to my piano and played some diatonic chords that I then put through the granular sampler and took off the metronome beat. The whole record is so beat-oriented it’s nice to have this moment where time breaks down to close. It’s also bringing back the chords from ‘Still But Still Moving’ in a new key to create a full-circle moment as we end.”","short":"The producer unveils a debut to “bring people together on the dance floor.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/e1/fc/cfe1fcb0-30eb-e92f-907e-e98dabdee81f/887832017761.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacabc","textColor2":"f9d6b2","textColor4":"ccbda9","textColor1":"f6e5ca","bgColor":"1b5d86","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-in-out-of-the-rain/1783306710","playParams":{"id":"1783306710","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6jZhhKMNsN5C6LpypG7SdO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783306710/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"286587757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/286587757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743757856126,"RTCI":0}}},"1783713554":{"id":"1783713554","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783713554?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e2/09/2b/e2092b65-d75d-c4e7-dcb0-3cf1d99e42eb/Job05f4b1a0-1d53-42fb-a7b5-0181b181f393-184637219-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361115728_2034970842-Time1738011021329.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","f79051"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ce1d28"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"ecaf85","textColor2":"f79051","textColor4":"e77644","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ce1d28","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8d/14/33/8d1433fa-a55a-3b37-9293-9ecf838fc718/45a371ad-2ade-4376-aab2-0b31266728e1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383432","textColor2":"1e1611","textColor4":"3d3733","textColor1":"171110","bgColor":"bcbcbc","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a5/7e/5c/a57e5c29-516b-2ecb-de73-d7484804aec2/Joba45f37cc-3389-43a8-8444-973454b95039-184637220-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361115729_2034970837-Time1738011934549.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","fcab86"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ce1d28"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"ebc4b6","textColor2":"fcab86","textColor4":"e98b6e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ce1d28","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d7/06/6e/d7066e05-ed71-2d7b-2410-f129509157fb/73f522d9-fe81-4212-833d-4f9f802fdc31.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e8c7ae","textColor2":"fbdbaa","textColor4":"e8bd95","textColor1":"fce8ca","bgColor":"99433e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/black-country-new-road/1449884900","name":"Forever Howlong","artistName":"Black Country, New Road","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"By the time Black Country, New Road released their sprawling second album <i>Ants from Up There</i> in 2022, lead vocalist Isaac Wood had departed the London-based indie experimentalists and a magical first phase of the group had come to a close. Rather than tour those records without their original singer, they rejigged their dynamic and wrote a whole new batch of songs—captured on 2023’s <i>Live at Bush Hall</i>—to initiate a new period of the band where vocals and much of the songwriting were led by Tyler Hyde, Georgia Ellery, and May Kershaw. It made for an exhilarating fresh start and their third album <i>Forever Howlong</i> directly picks up from the momentum of starting over again. “We’d done a lot of touring of the live album and we really wanted to further develop this new lineup and write new songs so we could get them into the set list,” saxophonist Lewis Evans tells Apple Music. “There’s a whole bunch of songs within the album that were written fairly early on as a buffer to the <i>Live at Bush Hall</i> songs so we could not have to play the same thing every single night.”\n\nThat feeling of trying to capture the energy and edginess of a live show runs right through <i>Forever Howlong</i>. It’s a record of tightly mapped baroque folk pop, jagged indie explosions, and woodwind-heavy art-rock explorations, and it feels punchier and more contained than their previous work. “[The songs] developed way more on the live setting,” says Evans. “Our headspace was to really make sure that all of the songs that were brought into the writing room, to the rehearsal room, were arranged in such a way that the song could be served as well as possible and not adding anything to it that didn’t need to be there.”\n\nDrummer Charlie Wayne thinks that, even without the lineup change, the band was always heading towards doing something different. “I think it was always trending in this direction,” he says. “Having the three different singers definitely gave it a different quality, both in terms of the outcome and also in the actual songwriting. Three different perspectives grants you three completely different worlds to dive into and to try and pull together.” Let Evans and Wayne guide you through <i>Forever Howlong</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Besties”</b>\nLewis Evans: “It’s a great big fanfare opening, really ramshackle and swashbuckling. It’s a great introduction into the new sound. It’s still got this very BCNR musical-communication thing that we have but also feels like a new style. That’s also why it was good to do as the first single, it was a good welcome to the new thing.”\n\n<b>“The Big Spin”</b>\nLE: “This was the first of the songs which we’re calling the Holy Trinity on the record, those songs being ‘The Big Spin,’ ‘Besties,’ and ‘Happy Birthday,’ which all came together at a very similar time. May brought this song in. It was much more light-hearted and groovy, and it had this light feel that we haven’t had before as a band. That went on to really inspire Georgia’s writing for ‘Besties,’ which then really inspired Tyler’s writing for ‘Happy Birthday,’ so this was the start of the domino effect of those three pop-ish songs on the record.”\n\n<b>“Socks”</b>\nCharlie Wayne: “This was one that we wrote at the beginning of last year. I think we saw Tyler performing a version of it on the piano before we’d thought about it as a band thing. It’s weird because it’s like a mini musical in itself, there are loads of ups and downs, and you can really focus in on the songwriter and the voice, and the band operates around it and expands and contracts. There are moments of real softness and rubato, that the time is moving in and out and it’s not, you’re just focusing in on the piano. Tyler recorded it all in that way, and the band had to try and play around her performance instincts where she allowed herself to just be on the piano playing with it.”\n\n<b>“Salem Sisters”</b>\nLE: “I originally wrote this song and sang on it live for a while when I was singing in the band for a short spell. I decided against singing anymore because I just didn’t enjoy it whatsoever. I thought that Tyler would be best suited for singing it. She wrote new lyrics, and it benefits a lot more from her vocals. I wasn’t able to bring what she can to the song. It’s like the closest we get to a ’70s songwriter-y throwback tune on the record I think but it still retains quite a bit of weirdness that I don’t think would exist quite yet in the ’70s. It’s a catchy song.”\n\n<b>“Two Horses”</b>\nCW: “This slightly preceded the actual getting under the bonnet and figuring out what the album is. It was the first time that Georgia really felt as though she brought a song specifically for BCNR with the intention of figuring out what her songwriting was going to maybe look like. Georgia had written a pretty good, complete song and all the arrangements had already been thought out. One of the big takeaways in the album is just serving songs and sometimes they don’t need to be these enormous expansive things, no one needs to be playing extremely loud all the time. It can just be following the journey.”\nLE: “This is quite a unique record for us because there’s no one way that we’ve written all the songs. This one is the only time we’ve ever written a song where it was all thought out before it was in the practice room. Georgia had a proper Brian Wilson imagination with this song and she knew exactly how she wanted it to sound. We were like, ‘No, let’s put our own thing on it,’ and then it worked out actually better the way that she decided it in the first place.”\n\n<b>“Mary”</b>\nCW: “This is the bit in the album where you can kind of step back from the instrumentation, which can often be a massive focal point of the band. It was a song that was always just going to work with the three vocals. It’s heavily inspired by The Roches. Having very light instrumentation behind it gives you the opportunity to see it as like group storytelling, watching those voices deviate away from each other and then come back.”\n\n<b>“Happy Birthday”</b>\nLE: “This was the quickest song to put together. It basically arranged itself. Tyler played us a couple of songs that she’d been writing when she went on a writing retreat in Italy with some friends. She played ‘Happy Birthday,’ which was called ‘Kids’ at the time, but we didn’t want to name it the same as the MGMT song, so we opted for a more famous song. We took it into the rehearsal room and just banged it out in a couple rehearsals, really. It was so satisfying and punchy, it really felt like we were so in the groove at that point. We all knew what the record was. We all knew at that point this song was going to be the thing that completes the album a little bit.”\n\n<b>“For the Cold Country”</b>\nLE: “May played this for the first time on the piano, or at the rough outline of it, when we were mixing <i>Live at Bush Hall</i>. I remember being like, ‘Wow, that’s crazy. How the fuck are we going to make that into a BCNR song?’ We spent the next two years trying to write it, because it is just unwieldy and enormous.”\nCW: “It didn’t really make sense until we’d gotten into the studio and we felt as though we could place everyone in a small room and then expand out again from there.”\nLE: “This was one of those songs that really didn’t benefit from us playing it loads live because we realized what was best suited for it was that the first half be this acoustic, really acoustic, warm, woody feeling section that would then open up into a more expansive guitars would turn electric.”\n\n<b>“Nancy Tries to Take the Night”</b>\nLE: “This was also an earlier-stage one. Tyler had the whole first half of the song, just the two acoustic guitars and the chorus, the chorus melody thing that happens. The whole minimalist section hadn’t yet been written. We felt like we wanted a new part of the song, and so I wrote this minimalist cell block kind of thing. It was quite inspired by something that I heard on a new Kiran Leonard record. That allowed us to have these two very different sections that are really contrasting.”\n\n<b>“Forever Howlong”</b>\nCW: “We started off doing a band arrangement for this and it didn’t quite fit. After speaking about it, May was like, ‘I think maybe it would sound really good if all of us were playing five clarinets as an arrangement,’ which was a cool idea, but maybe slightly impractical. The next best step was five recorders. The beginning of the song is fairly sparse and simple because all of us didn’t know how to properly play the recorder, and it gets more complicated towards the end. The bit at the end, which is a bit like a carousel, is a bit of a victory lap for us because we just all get our individual parts to play because we can all actually play them. The Royal Society of Recorders and Recorder Players should be getting in touch soon.”\n\n<b>“Goodbye (Don’t Tell Me)”</b>\nLE: “This is the oldest song on the record. Georgia brought this in when we were writing <i>…Bush Hall</i> stuff in 2022 and because she just wasn’t around enough because of Jockstrap commitments [Ellery is also one half of Jockstrap], we didn’t play it. We’d kind of made a half-baked version of it and it was good, but it really wasn’t sitting with the stuff that we were doing on <i>…Bush Hall</i>. But then as these songs like ‘Happy Birthday’ and ‘The Big Spin’ and ‘Besties’ came about, it really started to make more sense. We were really trying to go for a Neil Young thing on this tune, and the way that it can feel loose, but also there’s a deeper feeling in the pit of your stomach about it that is an unexplainable thing that just grooves.

They were humble days, coming years before tracks like “Little Lion Man” helped define a strand of optimistic folk pop that dominated the early 2010s and influenced 2020s stadium-fillers like Noah Kahan and Zach Bryan.\n\n<i>RUSHMERE</i> pulls back from the pomp and splendor of folk-rock stardom and gets back to basics: furiously played guitars and rousing vocal harmonies, with Marcus Mumford’s sincere, resolute burr leading the way. Produced by Nashville straight-shooter Dave Cobb, who’s known for his unfussy, song-forward approach to the studio, <i>RUSHMERE</i> places the powerful songwriting and strong musical chemistry of Mumford & Sons front and center. “Monochrome” is a hushed hymn to a long-gone muse, with Mumford rueful about time’s passage yet generous to someone who has faded to “monochrome out of sight.” The stirring “Surrender” is propelled by stomps and strummed strings, moving briskly forward even as Mumford sings of his world-weariness. “Blood on the Page,” a collaboration with next-generation folk-rocker Madison Cunningham, is delicate and ghostly in a way that amplifies the pain in its lyrics. \n\n“Time, don’t let us down again/’Cause I won’t wait,” the trio wails near the end of the title track, with ferocious banjos driving home the plea’s urgency. It’s a sly callback to “I Will Wait,” the 2012 song that cemented Mumford & Sons as leaders of the 2010s’ folk-rock vanguard. But it’s also a signal of the urgency and hope underpinning <i>RUSHMERE</i>, making it a taut, potent statement of reintroduction that doubles as a declaration of intent to stick around.","short":"Their first album in seven years—and first as a trio—gets back to basics."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8b/7b/2f/8b7b2fc3-b8fe-595c-99fa-77d8199d92e3/198846810775.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0c2c4","textColor2":"c9cfd0","textColor4":"a7acad","textColor1":"eaebed","bgColor":"1c2021","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rushmere/1784288625","playParams":{"id":"1784288625","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/15oPzWZQmZyyrsJt4st3U4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784288625/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"307699986","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/307699986?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743757981726,"RTCI":0}}},"1785006257":{"id":"1785006257","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785006257?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/highsociety/582839938","name":"Datamosh","artistName":"HIGHSOCIETY","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8a/60/34/8a60344f-29c1-8588-40b4-0944d539abfd/732623007776.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363738","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"3d3e3d","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"dcdedd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/datamosh/1785006257","playParams":{"id":"1785006257","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3i7N4NfErE9SpQH55pTgj7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785006257/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"582839938","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/582839938?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743740851119,"RTCI":0}}},"1785033327":{"id":"1785033327","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785033327?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/7c/50/ff/7c50ff4b-f95d-330d-1411-ec0a2c3d350c/Job461d5015-eee9-475c-a0f7-b33fa449f358-187277852-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366561459_2075790551-Time1741128858393.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","a4c0e4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"171b0b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"98abb8","textColor2":"a4c0e4","textColor4":"87a1bb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"171b0b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8e/76/f2/8e76f20f-3a96-2ba4-5565-9a3652b2feed/76f0f490-f88d-4793-8ca0-de554fe11dc5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfb7b1","textColor2":"c9ccc2","textColor4":"acada4","textColor1":"e0d9d2","bgColor":"3a332d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/92/ec/c0/92ecc0c2-0235-267b-e6b4-e18f7048b145/Job5a756950-1d66-441f-b09f-4d1581412492-187277853-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366561458_2075790552-Time1741129754466.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9dacde"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"171b0b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"a6b6bb","textColor2":"9dacde","textColor4":"8290b3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"171b0b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/03/be/7c/03be7c79-ebed-d7a0-282f-892d1d5e3e92/24b0d892-71ab-494e-b87e-9c0f04130ff5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"9dabba","textColor2":"acc2d2","textColor4":"93a6b1","textColor1":"b9c9dc","bgColor":"2f362f","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/unknown-mortal-orchestra/437580308","name":"IC-02 Bogotá","artistName":"Unknown Mortal Orchestra","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The first volume of New Zealand indie heroes Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s all-instrumentals <i>IC</i> series leaned into the abstract.

The bold moments here are easy to grasp (“It’s a Mirror,” “Me & Angel”), but it’s the quieter ones that make you sit up and listen (“Capezio,” “In a Row”).

Is A Feeling","artistName":"Lucy Dacus","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The thing about desire is it relies on the not-having of the thing you want; then sometimes you get it, and the whole game changes. In the case of Lucy Dacus—the dreamy singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known these days as one-third of indie-rock supergroup boygenius—the conundrum could apply to any number of current-life situations, among them her unexpected success as a Grammy-winning rock god. “I think that through boygenius, it felt like, ‘Well, what else? I don’t want more than this,’” Dacus tells Apple Music. “I feel like I’ve been very career-oriented because I’ve just wanted to play music, satisfy my own drive, and make things that I can be proud of. Getting Grammys and stuff, I’m like, ‘Well, I guess that’s the end of the line. What is my life about?’”\n\nOn her fourth solo album, <i>Forever Is a Feeling</i>, Dacus takes a heartfelt stab at answering that question, and in doing so, opens another desire-related can of worms. While the record explores the intoxicating, confusing, fleeting qualities of romance, it simultaneously functions as a fan-fic-worthy relationship reveal. (She went public with her relationship with boygenius bandmate Julien Baker weeks before the album’s release.) On <i>Forever</i>, Dacus dives headfirst into the implied complications, recruiting co-producer Blake Mills for subversive, swooning folk-pop numbers that revel in the mysteries of love, and what precedes it. \n\nDacus’ songwriting has always been vulnerable, though perhaps never this much, nor in this way. “What if we don’t touch?” she begins the super-sexy “Ankles” by proposing—instead, she imagines hypothetical bitten shoulders, pulled hair, crossword puzzles finished together the morning after. (“It’s about not being able to get what you want,” Dacus says of the song. “You want to get them in bed, but you also want to wake up with them in the morning and have sweet, intimate moments, and you can’t. So, you just have to use your imagination about what that might be like.”) She explores the in-between stages of a relationship on the wispy “For Keeps,” takes a quiet road trip through the mountains with her partner on “Talk,” and on “Big Deal,” she wonders to a star-crossed lover if things could ever go back to how it was before, though the climactic final chorus suggests otherwise.\n\nWriting <i>Forever</i> brought Dacus closer to an answer to the question she posed to herself earlier, and she doesn’t care how cheesy it may sound. “I want my life to be about love,” she explained to Apple Music. “It feels corny to say. But that’s part of what this project is—the idea that talking about love is corny. I don’t think love is all you need, but I do think you need it amongst everything else.”","short":"Swooning folk pop that revels in the mysteries of love, and what precedes it."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d6/05/38/d60538d1-a39e-cc54-f7db-a30645136486/24UM1IM40022.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5b9ae","textColor2":"e4c7bf","textColor4":"cbaea0","textColor1":"f1d6d0","bgColor":"684924","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-is-a-feeling/1787193107","playParams":{"id":"1787193107","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PedUC4azy5ywqWp8gVVrs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787193107/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1060812309","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1060812309?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743777509161,"RTCI":0}}},"1789008400":{"id":"1789008400","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789008400?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-02","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8f/1e/54/8f1e543c-c5d5-618c-26b8-4f2e6eda9efd/be19bf4a-d660-48c3-bf09-0da775444095.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"524742","textColor2":"372824","textColor4":"5c4e4a","textColor1":"2b1f1a","bgColor":"eee6e1","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/black-sherif/1485819772","name":"IRON BOY","artistName":"Black Sherif","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"From the very start of his career, Black Sherif’s music has parsed complex emotions from the depths of his consciousness with a startling acuity that stood him out as the rare superstar with a cogent message for his generation. Whether channeling grief, confronting betrayal, or coming to terms with the end of a whirlwind romance, the Konongo native’s dexterous mastery of metaphors has carried deep personal significance but landed perfectly with a generation grappling with the exact emotions that course through Blacko’s music. On his sophomore album, <i>IRON BOY</i>, Black Sherif leans more into the dense, ruminative soul-inflected dispatches that established his profile as a relentless street preacher. \n\nWhere <i>The Villain I Never Was</i> confronted and made sense of the unavoidable sense of nihilism that powered his breathless breakthrough, <i>IRON BOY</i> is a meditative status update on life since his 2022 debut. There are moments of exasperation, hopelessness, dreamy elation, and unadulterated subversiveness throughout the 43-minute runtime as the artist candidly articulates his innermost thoughts vis-à-vis the anxiety, desires, and fears of a generation that he unapologetically speaks to and for. Ultimately, these challenges are viewed through the prism of the experiences of living through unprecedented times and finding a way to work through the issues. On the opener, “The Victory Song,” he’s claiming a win as he deals with his challenges without losing his head: “Trouble in my soul, war with my mind/Keeping it together like the grown man I am,” he explains. \n\nFor all his deconstruction of the wider world, Blacko does not lose sight of self, keenly trying to understand the factors that influence his decisions. He interrogates his persona and quirks on “One” and acknowledges that he’s still working through personal issues on “Soma Obi.” There are wholesome odes to the power of perseverance on songs like the Fireboy DML-featuring “So It Goes” and “Rebel Music” as well as lively cuts such as “Top of the Morning” and “Eye Open” that provide reminders of Blacko’s imperviousness. In many ways, <i>IRON BOY</i> sees Black Sherif walk into the light and allow himself the broadest embrace of his humanity while still making room for the haunting questions that poke at his soul.","short":"The Ghanaian superstar returns with a spirited dedication to resilience."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d2/27/06/d2270603-b15f-3f05-c4e4-0f66a24dc18d/197342926201_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1dbe3","textColor2":"d1d4d0","textColor4":"acb9be","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"194d78","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/iron-boy/1789008400","playParams":{"id":"1789008400","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3gi5efMf1SiQfnqpy1o0CK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789008400/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1485819772","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1485819772?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743764298493,"RTCI":0}}},"1789808579":{"id":"1789808579","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789808579?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/32/44/7f/32447f50-df48-2d96-d3e1-d9388cf5e99d/c26cf0c5-b7ea-452e-b5a3-c793fe280de5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"272929","textColor2":"161618","textColor4":"2f3031","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"939895","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c5/53/5a/c5535a40-43ec-881a-5924-13420c66ad71/5fe2afd8-bc1b-4dc3-be18-8f3b160a4adf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d8d4c5","textColor2":"fdda91","textColor4":"e9ba7e","textColor1":"e7fae9","bgColor":"9c3a35","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/18/a2/26/18a22680-17ce-e274-7f6d-072f6d741186/759dea88-5e48-4ca0-9ac2-28c992d24952.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"3b3834","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"47443f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"efe3c8","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=54657-64387579","name":"Who Believes In Angels?","artistName":"Elton John & Brandi Carlile","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I’ve been singing with Elton all my life—he just didn’t know it until about 10 or 20 years ago,” Brandi Carlile tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about working with the storied singer-songwriter Sir Elton John. Featuring compositions co-written by John and Carlile along with John’s longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin and producer Andrew Watt, their collaborative album <i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> is a triumphant collection that celebrates the eternal promise held by music.\n\nFor John, after ending his touring career in 2023 on the highest note possible with performances at Dodger Stadium and Glastonbury, he was seeking a project that would be forward-looking and feel different from his usual collaboration with Taupin. “If I’d just made another Elton John record, I would’ve killed myself,” he says. “I needed her. I needed her talent, her energy, her humor, and her brilliant lyrics. I’ve got two of the greatest lyric writers in the world, Bernie Taupin and Brandi Carlile, and the lyrics in front of me. When we got going, it was like, <i>whoosh</i>—like an express train.” The album was done in three weeks, start to finish.\n\n<i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> opens with back-to-back salutes to two other titans of queer pop—the emotionally charged singer-songwriter Laura Nyro and the fiery soul-preacher Little Richard. While Carlile credits John as one of her heroes and biggest influences, the project is a true team effort, with cuts like the raucous “The River Man” and “Someone to Belong To” feeling inspired simultaneously by John’s carousing, hooky rock and Carlile’s meticulously crafted Americana. It is, as John notes, a proper “duet album,” with both their voices harmonizing through each song. The prospects of getting real and celebrating differences recur throughout; the questioning title track tackles the idea of true friendship where people “set the pleasantries aside,” while the joyful “Swing for the Fences” highlights those who resemble “a heartbeat cannon in a quiet spot.”\n\n<i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> is structured like an old-fashioned vinyl record even in its digital release, with definitive closing tracks for each five-song “side.” Both tracks—one by a solo Carlile, the other by John—have a sense of bittersweetness. Carlile’s hushed ballad “You Without Me” preemptively looks at how her life will change when her children leave the nest. John’s sweeping “When This Old World Is Done with Me” comes to terms with his mortality and looks back on his life—“I’ve had clouds with silver linings, complicated mornings,” he sings—with a brass band providing its mournful yet hopeful coda. Together, they make a resounding statement about life’s perpetual motion—one that began from a place of frustration and ended up in one of gratitude. I was in such a horrible mood when I started making this record,“ John says. ”I was really tired. I was irritable. The world was going crazy. I needed her to push me. I knew she could just go along with anything. She’s that talented.”","short":"Sir Elton on teaming up with the folk-rock pioneer: “I needed her to push me.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/af/23/54/af23546e-4bc7-93f1-561d-837c9a556713/24UMGIM74322.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccb0aa","textColor2":"ffaf00","textColor4":"d08f0a","textColor1":"fad8c8","bgColor":"181333","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-believes-in-angels/1789808579","playParams":{"id":"1789808579","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5eS9zcWHCbkOiyXPRiIgg4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789808579/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"54657","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/54657?l=en-US"},{"id":"64387579","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/64387579?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743770698622,"RTCI":0}}},"1789844150":{"id":"1789844150","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789844150?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Bluegrass","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/06/32/2d/06322d3b-833f-c8a5-0786-c64f5563c117/Job300486c3-ffe1-45ee-b316-a7a8db1fa903-184630565-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361101708_2034857052-Time1738005268952.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","2c2926"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"f4ecdf"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"484743","textColor2":"2c2926","textColor4":"534f4a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f4ecdf","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d1/bc/7f/d1bc7f8f-2307-fb41-2f27-951022427998/c888ed54-6a5c-46b8-8694-838998ed8fe6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bc9367","textColor2":"d3ab68","textColor4":"af8d56","textColor1":"e4b27d","bgColor":"1e1511","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ca/60/7c/ca607cd4-a5bf-8905-ca88-eff1496761fd/Job4c7fceac-a9e1-4b25-92d0-13c051838339-184630566-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_361101709_2034857051-Time1738006509865.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"49453f","textColor2":"2a251f","textColor4":"4f493f","textColor1":"22201f","bgColor":"e3d7c2","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fe/62/ad/fe62ad44-87cc-1f26-f411-5c0d3c1a437e/96d64bc1-dd42-40b4-bf0a-2c223dcd9e0c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"3a3a37","textColor2":"1f1e1b","textColor4":"3c3a37","textColor1":"1c1d1b","bgColor":"b2aea7","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alison-krauss-union-station/354058195","name":"Arcadia","artistName":"Alison Krauss & Union Station","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Alison Krauss and her band Union Station aren’t what you’d call prolific. After all, this eighth studio album from the bluegrass outfit comes 14 years after its predecessor, the critically acclaimed <i>Paper Airplane</i>. As any Krauss fan knows, though, the 27-time Grammy-winning multi-hyphenate prioritizes quality over quantity, and the 10 new songs comprising this collection are no exception to that rule. Krauss and the band produced <i>Arcadia</i> alongside fellow Grammy winner Gary Paczosa (Dolly Parton, Sierra Ferrell), with IIIrd Tyme Out’s Russell Moore joining Union Station in place of longtime guitarist Dan Tyminski, whose own solo and side projects have picked up significantly in the near decade and a half since <i>Paper Airplane</i>’s release.\n\n<i>Arcadia</i> opens with the Jeremy Lister-penned “Looks Like the End of the Road,” a dusky and dramatic ballad with a sparkling vocal from Krauss, whose voice sounds as pristine as it ever has. Moore’s guitar retains the Southern gothic moodiness once brought by Tyminski, and his lead vocal on tracks like “The Hangman” offers a sturdy, soulful counterpoint to Krauss’s honeyed soprano—notably, Moore is the most decorated male vocalist in International Bluegrass Music Association history. Other highlights include the Tyminski co-write “The Wrong Way,” which lets Jerry Douglas shine on dobro and lap steel guitar, and closer “There’s a Light Up Ahead,” another Lister tune with gorgeously atmospheric production that really gives Krauss space to soar.","short":"Their first album together in 14 years preserves their rep as bluegrass

Crux","artistName":"Djo","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The creation—and especially the success—of his 2024 viral hit “End of Beginning” prepared Djo, the musical alter ego of <i>Stranger Things</i> star Joe Keery, for the recording of his third album. “It was a boost of confidence and a good shot in the arm,” he tells Apple Music. “Doing a song from beginning to end in a studio and getting bit by that was like, ‘Oh man, this is how I want to do this. I don’t think I really want to try to do this in my bedroom.’” Famed New York City studio Electric Lady provided Keery and his frequent producer Adam Thein with the environment they needed. “We were using all the toys,” Keery notes. “This piece of gear was laying around, so let’s mess with it. And it ends up, it informs the whole track. There’s a lot of that going on on this record.” And so, <i>The Crux</i> was born.\n\nUnlike his past endeavors, this time he chose to focus on collaboration. “I came up musically in a time where it was Kevin Parker and Mac DeMarco and these guys who did it all by themselves. So I think for a while that was what I thought I wanted to be,” he says. “But doing this project, it made me come back to working more collaboratively, still producing stuff, but with other people. It was a real joy to have friends and family and outside musicians coming in and bringing this thing to life.” One surprising guest? Charlie Heaton, Keery’s <i>Stranger</i> love-triangle competitor, appears on the jaunty “Charlie’s Garden.”\n\n<i>The Crux</i> is filled with psychedelic beats, electronica tones, and groovy guitar licks and floats through Keery’s particular brand of twee indie pop with a blend of bright sounds and hazy nostalgia. There’s the uplifting (“Lonesome is a State of Mind”), carefree (“Basic Being Basic”), regretful (“Delete Ya”), somber (“Egg”), and bittersweet (“Crux”). And classic-rock influences abound, particularly on “Potion.” (“Love Fleetwood Mac. You can definitely hear that on that track,” he says.)\n\nKeery takes special pride in his output. “It’s my outlet for talking about my own life and my little diary,” he says. “I’m sure a lot of musicians, that’s the way that they do it. So to use it as a way to cope with what’s going on, and then especially one of my favorite parts is just, like, album order and the structure of the record as a whole. That’s one part of that journey.”","short":"“It's my outlet”: Joe Keery gets to the heart of it on his third album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/20/c4/3e20c433-92a9-8866-ee86-b6dc6bc5e76d/199066503560.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbb895","textColor2":"62a9e7","textColor4":"538cbd","textColor1":"f7e0b6","bgColor":"191514","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-crux/1791184860","playParams":{"id":"1791184860","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1xQGeKOIMZrPBUlDJuqZGQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791184860/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1473178582","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1473178582?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743777711737,"RTCI":0}}},"1791854908":{"id":"1791854908","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791854908?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/simona/1479199735","name":"ASTUTA","artistName":"SIMONA","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/47/69/74/476974bd-9c69-65cb-a59d-57b25c62dd9c/663918045732.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c7cfea","textColor2":"ecc79a","textColor4":"c1aea4","textColor1":"f2f0f1","bgColor":"1849cf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/astuta/1791854908","playParams":{"id":"1791854908","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2zFuVAQW2Px95oI9w12PN1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791854908/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1479199735","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1479199735?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743741831374,"RTCI":0}}},"1791866842":{"id":"1791866842","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791866842?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/97/a9/73/97a9732a-dd26-ba31-b336-a16ac2d9b5ee/Jobae1e0890-b855-4201-8c99-38f58687ad13-186132942-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364184252_2058350361-Time1739889073759.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c7b7b5"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bacdce","textColor2":"c7b7b5","textColor4":"a29493","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/89/33/07/89330777-1fe9-eae9-29a3-c8a08ff732f5/4ae815ad-8bba-47e6-8977-eca7d1b93b70.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"232521","textColor2":"181713","textColor4":"33312c","textColor1":"050806","bgColor":"9d988f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/51/d8/1e/51d81e41-525f-500a-c4a3-c92b516a3018/Job87c7ae5b-d407-4951-bbef-68a5a5da2e1c-185776896-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_363527226_2053206885-Time1739473516650.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cfcecf","textColor2":"e6feff","textColor4":"bbcdcf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"110d13","hasP3":false},"coreTRWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3c/5b/99/3c5b9987-3ea2-11ac-3787-93d90fa785ea/4ae815ad-8bba-47e6-8977-eca7d1b93b70.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"232521","textColor2":"181713","textColor4":"33312c","textColor1":"050806","bgColor":"9d988f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c7/c5/65/c7c5653f-25fb-fbc5-7acc-f5dba079e051/c22fd7ca-e629-4f8e-8c0f-02a9914c47f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c7c3c3","textColor2":"e5dce3","textColor4":"beb6bc","textColor1":"f1ecec","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nemzzz/1434427948","name":"RENT'S DUE","artistName":"Nemzzz","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Despite a breakthrough mixtape in 2024’s <i>DO NOT DISTURB</i> under his belt, Nemzzz still has to sweat the little things on its follow-up, 2025’s <i>RENT’S DUE</i>.

Over stomping percussion, rubbery 808s, and a retro horn melody on “COLD,” he raps, “Apart from bro, when I ain’t have bread, me, I didn’t hear from no one.” He sums it up nicely during the next verse when he adds, “Mumsy didn’t expect this life for me when I was an infant.” On <i>RENT’S DUE</i>, Nemzzz makes it clear he’s still growing into his status as a superstar, but he’s getting a bit more comfortable with each chart-topper.","short":"The British MC follows up his breakthrough with humility."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8c/4f/7b/8c4f7b11-8a78-8c8c-c209-fc314522df8b/5034644416991.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecdce","textColor2":"f2707c","textColor4":"c45c66","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"0c0b10","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rents-due/1791866842","playParams":{"id":"1791866842","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3uKar0bX3b6g6YcLrGDDuD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791866842/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1434427948","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1434427948?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743766094264,"RTCI":0}}},"1792024346":{"id":"1792024346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792024346?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/frantic-amber/418404067","name":"Death Becomes Her","artistName":"Frantic Amber","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d0/5b/47/d05b47a7-72ba-a0f5-aeab-6587b05a7288/4262464733948.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0746f","textColor2":"d39188","textColor4":"a9746d","textColor1":"dc918b","bgColor":"010100","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/death-becomes-her/1792024346","playParams":{"id":"1792024346","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ziA1gGVI7tUO8UFP5zy2r"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792024346/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"418404067","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/418404067?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743723291456,"RTCI":0}}},"1792063107":{"id":"1792063107","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792063107?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-28","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/97/82/a7/9782a7cb-1a75-b40a-00d9-a07c1fc468c5/f994b46d-87e9-448e-8e3e-6483960af07c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e0d3cf","textColor2":"f2eceb","textColor4":"dbcbc7","textColor1":"f8f5f5","bgColor":"7f4837","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wallows/1225257328","name":"More","artistName":"Wallows","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"It takes a certain amount of gumption to name a track “Your New Favorite Song,” but LA alt-pop trio Wallows possess just the right combination of humble charm and outsized confidence to pull it off.

But the two appearances of “Deep Dive”—first as a lush ’70s soft-rock flashback and then as a summer-vibed pool-party soundtrack—provide the clearest view of Wallows’ ever-expanding talent for

composing today, her reputation surely substantially enhanced by this collection of a selection of her many orchestral works.\n\nStylistically, Wallen traverses from Britten and Tippett (<i>This Frame is Part of the Painting</i>, a playful tribute to British abstract artist Howard Hodgkin) over to Reich and Copland (Wallen’s eloquent celebration of freedom, <i>Mighty River</i>). Everything she touches is supremely orchestrated, each piece brimming with intriguing sonic effects and genuine popular appeal.\n\nThe skittish <i>Orchestral Dances</i> that open the album are unabashedly joyful, drawing on blues, spirituals, jazz, musicals, and more. In “Dance VIII” Wallen brilliantly marries the worlds of pop and classical, and Handel even gets a look-in in “Dance X.”","short":"Evocative, exciting, and richly scored music that zings with

House - EP","artistName":"Rachel Chinouriri","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The <i>Little House</i> EP finds Rachel Chinouriri still a month shy of celebrating the one year anniversary of her career-accelerating debut album, 2024’s <i>What a Devastating Turn of Events</i>, an anthemic, Britpop-inspired chronicle of her turbulent early twenties. With her star in rapid ascendance—critical acclaim, two BRIT Award nominations, a sold-out headline tour of her own, and an A-list guest spot opening for Sabrina Carpenter—the London-born singer-songwriter’s 180-degree pivot from devastation to satisfaction marks this four-track EP. It’s out with the self-doubt and second-guessing that shrouded her previous works and in with sunny optimism and an unassuming confidence, amplified by the heady rush of new love.\n\nChinouriri is an expert when it comes to channeling boundless levels of unchecked feelings into potent shots of ear-snagging indie pop and while the tenor of her emotions has shifted, it’s clear from the effusive one-two punch of “Can we talk about Isaac?” and “23:42” that she has ample raw material at her disposal. The former recalls Chinouriri’s meet-cute moment in a burst of barely suppressed excitement propelled by surfy guitar riffs and finger-snapping percussion; on the latter she pinballs between delight and disbelief at her romantic luck over a cheerful, jaunty beat peppered with sci-fi synth stabs. Later, “Indigo” slows all the gushing to a measured pour, echoing the refrain “You make love feel like...” and letting an atmospheric swell of harmonic vocals fill in the blank. Sandwiched in between, “Judas (Demo)” is somewhat of an outlier, but the simple combination of Chinouriri’s anxious late-night musings backed by the soft strum of an acoustic guitar offers a familiar flash of haunting vulnerability—a reminder of the strong foundations <i>Little House</i> is building on.","short":"The rising pop sensation moves into a new artistic space on this lovestruck

an eighth grader, and in a section titled favorite hobbies, she writes, “Rapping/singing/dancing.” In a sense, <i>PAID IN MEMORIES</i> makes good on those interests. She recruits hip-hop icons like Lil Wayne and Big Sean, alongside peers such as Lil Yachty, to help formulate some of these rap-leaning ideas. Despite the prevalence of these moments, though, she still offers up plenty of alt-pop songs for fans of her first two efforts: 2020’s <i>BEFORE LOVE CAME TO KILLS US</i> and 2022’s <i>YESSIE</i>. “PSILOCYBIN & DAISIES” flips the guitar riff from The Smashing Pumpkins’ “1979” and turns it into a hard-charging pop cut. Elsewhere, she displays her versatility with the downtempo neo-soul of “TORONTO SHORDIE” and the reggaetón-inspired groove of “PALO SANTO,” creating an album that pays tribute to all her passions.","short":"On her third album, hip-hop flourishes push her pop into new directions."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/12/54/51/12545128-9a9e-2168-0eac-fc1e2374fb46/25UMGIM26807.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"3c3504","textColor2":"2c343e","textColor4":"565831","textColor1":"0c0905","bgColor":"fee800","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paid-in-memories/1799789428","playParams":{"id":"1799789428","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5L3z1dICHHIS9FWewUhvu9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799789428/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1043591612","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1043591612?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743758462847,"RTCI":0}}},"1799941582":{"id":"1799941582","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799941582?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ae/bf/4c/aebf4c11-a194-9083-6f2d-de1098d510a5/6798033a-90c2-4cda-b824-766154cf0491.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bac9c0","textColor2":"f0dda9","textColor4":"c8b98f","textColor1":"def1e5","bgColor":"292929","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/adrien-nunez/1760749583","name":"LOW ROAD","artistName":"Adrien Nunez","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The athlete-to-country-artist pipeline has been alive and well for a minute now, with former football players like Sam Hunt and Chase Rice finding post-pigskin success as singer-songwriters. Like Warren Zeiders, who played lacrosse, up-and-comer Adrien Nunez comes to country music via college sports, having played basketball for the University of Michigan before finding viral success as a musician on TikTok. This debut album from Nunez shows the Brooklyn-born artist is more than just the latest iteration of a trend, though, as he serves up eight tracks that reveal a fresh, genre-agnostic take on country music. \n\n<i>LOW ROAD</i> opens with its title track, a folky Avery Anna collaboration that has shades of Zach Bryan and, in turn, one of Bryan’s primary influences, The Lumineers. “ALL I EVER DO” is similarly jaunty, with a rollicking chorus and foot-stomping beat. Other highlights on <i>LOW ROAD</i> include the playfully moody “NEVER TELL YOU NO,” an infectious situationship anthem with a Southern gothic vibe and flourishes of spaghetti western guitar, and “ANOTHER DAY,” one of the album’s poppier moments thanks to a catchy, cascading verse melody and interplay between synth and banjo.","short":"A former college hoops star turns rising country star on a refreshing debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/b4/ec/0db4eca1-6844-de73-56d4-4554db855833/093624833789.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b4a055","textColor2":"e4b650","textColor4":"b79140","textColor1":"e1c86a","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/low-road/1799941582","playParams":{"id":"1799941582","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MMo6irssSwZPqitG2bMAl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799941582/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1760749583","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1760749583?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743742383541,"RTCI":0}}},"1799969578":{"id":"1799969578","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799969578?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Electronic","IDM/Experimental"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-03","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aaron-drake/537692892","name":"Some Other Woman (Original Motion Picture Score)","artistName":"Aaron Drake","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/6e/3c/3b6e3c66-e602-6def-947a-599bc199b2c5/764656183479_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b59997","textColor2":"afc0d6","textColor4":"91a0b2","textColor1":"ddb7b4","bgColor":"192123","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/some-other-woman-original-motion-picture-score/1799969578","playParams":{"id":"1799969578","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22UyNnh8INyfIUcojL155Z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799969578/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"537692892","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/537692892?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743723168512,"RTCI":0}}},"1800529599":{"id":"1800529599","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800529599?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-27","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/19/50/b7/1950b71f-bbf3-d997-0cbd-68f8cfb285fc/c7e3bd41-3b3c-4536-9621-489448b22b12.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c2c7","textColor2":"cdadb0","textColor4":"a88f92","textColor1":"ededf2","bgColor":"14161c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grupo-maximo-grado/918328604","name":"Somos Leyenda","artistName":"Grupo Maximo Grado","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“In 2012, when world-ending theories were circulating, I got so stuck that I said to myself, ‘If this happens, I don’t want to be anywhere else but home with my children and wife,’” Christian Félix—leader, composer, and vocalist of Grupo Maximo Grado—tells Apple Music. “And if it doesn’t end, then brace yourselves, because I’m going to give my all.” Thirteen years later, the bet that the Baja Californian made with his future—leaving other people’s projects to focus on his own—seems to have paid off. Grupo Maximo Grado has established itself as the very definition of contemporary corrido, with a special composition style that’s key to the development of the genre.\n\nFélix celebrates that mystical anniversary by recording new duets with the cream of the crop from corrido’s last decade. Together they reinterpret Grupo Maximo Grado’s most iconic songs, the ones that soundtracked nights of partying while also laying a foundation for what was to come. From current stars such as Natanael Cano, Carín León, and Tito Double P to legends like Los Dareyes De La Sierra, LEGADO 7, and Grupo Marca Registrada, these talents come together to pay tribute to the Sinaloan group. “Some of these personalities tell me that I came to change corridos,” Félix says. “And I do consider myself part of that evolution. But during the past five years, everything has become 300 percent bigger. The admiration is reciprocal, and it is an honor that they admire me.” Below, he gives Apple Music a little more about some of the collaborations, in his own words.\n\n<b>“Gallos Y Caballos”</b>\n“This composition of mine was recorded in 2015. It was chosen by Nata [Cano]. I never imagined he would ask for this one, but that was it. Then, we did a lot more things to it. It occurred to me to put something more up-to-date, some sound effects and so on. I really liked the result. Nata’s sound is amazing. I had never heard him sing a genre like this, and I loved it.”\n\n<b>“Unas Heladas”</b>\n“I wrote this song a while ago at a private event. I told the client, ‘Give me 15 minutes, I’ll bring an idea, just let me rest a little.’ I went to the car and wrote the corrido in those 15 minutes. Then he came out and he loved it. When setting it up for my buddy Eden Muñoz, we tried to bring something fresher to it. We added an even longer introduction, with drums and all. I added an effect so it sounds like you’re spinning up a vinyl record. Hats off to Eden, whose voice was incredible. From singing all the romantic music that he does now, I told him, ‘Come here, to the urban, to the corridos,’ just like back when he sang with Calibre 50. The truth is that he sounds very cool in this track. He decided to put tuba on it, and that was also spectacular.”\n\n<b>“La Güera y La Morena”</b>\n“We originally recorded this song on the album <i>Marca Acme</i>, and it talks about female empowerment. It’s a duet with Carín León, who had first chosen to sing ‘Unas Heladas,’ but then told me ‘Wait, compa, I’m better with this one.’ I don’t know what he saw in it, but it was a very smart move, because it’s known that Carín’s audience is mostly women and they are going to like the song. We recorded it, made a fresher production, and Carín’s voice sounds great, like he belonged in it since the beginning. He has that very true confidence in his voice and in what he sings. That’s why what he delivers—and everything he does—sounds incredible. Moreover, Carín is a big admirer of the group. He told me that my music fed him. He even says that Christian Félix was one of the first rock stars in Mexico, because of my very peculiar way of making him carefree about absolutely everything.”\n\n<b>“Yo Soy Iván”</b>\n“The selection of this song was unlike the others. Darey [de la Sierra] has always been part of my personal tastes. I love his career, his history, and I love that, at 13 years old, I got drunk for the first time listening to songs by Los Alteños De La Sierra, Dareyes de la Sierra, and so on. I get very nostalgic about that. Darey has now decided to jump back into the ring and I am loving what he’s doing. I think he was one of the few who didn’t pick their song. It seems to me that the voices of Christian Félix and Darey are totally different. Like black and white or yin and yang. Then I thought that ‘Yo Soy Iván’ was a good experiment, because it was going to have a totally different air. For us, this is one of our great anthems, and I am very satisfied with the result of the collaboration with Darey.”\n\n<b>“Capitán América”</b> \n“This song was chosen by my compadre Alfredo [Olivas]. I vaguely have a clue as to why. He told me that he really likes our music and how I compose, so he knew the song. I believe he chose it because he identifies it with a very delicate family issue that he had with his brother, sister-in-law, and nephew. The lyrics speak of a boy who passed away on his birthday while disguised as Captain America, and of all the consequences that his family experiences. I think that’s why my compadre related to it a lot. I even saw him crying once. We went to the studio and when Alfredo started singing the song, I got goosebumps, I swear. My compadre’s interpretation of it is very powerful. I know it’s going to be a hit, too.”\n\n<b>“8,000 KM”</b>\n“Belinda came to be what the album was missing—the feminine part. Then Nata invited us to his concert in Mexico City, and Belinda was also there. When we arrived, David [Bonilla], who’s Warner’s A&R rep, had already told her about the album. We went to greet her and she said, ‘Hey, why didn’t you invite me to guest on the album, huh? Not nice.’ I was shocked and replied, ‘Well, that’s why I’m here, Beli, to invite you. We already had you in our sights.’ I liked the idea of hearing a bélico Beli fused with the sound of Grupo Maximo Grado, and we did it. I loved it.

But its longing is cut off at the knees when Grande begins describing her desire to “jump into your skin and change your eyes” so she can provide a kind of turbo-charged empathy that reveals the relationship’s darker side. While its pillow-soft sonics and Grande’s resolute singing are gentle, it’s still a jarring lyric to hear right after the album proper’s closer, “ordinary things,” on which Grande's nonna Marjorie tells her granddaughter in no uncertain terms about the signals that a relationship is over. Nonna spoke, Grande listened, that book is closed.\n\nOr is there even a book in the first place? When discussing the beat-forward, hit-packed <i>eternal sunshine</i> with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe around its initial release in 2024, Grande said, “Finding a home in <i>eternal sunshine</i> was a lovely costume to wear,” noting that the “freedom within art” was present because of the endless possibilities for sources—personal truths, films (like <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, the surrealistic love story  that provides the album’s title), high concepts. With the release of <i>Wicked</i>, Ariana's big-screen coming-out party in late 2024, Grande had reached new heights of celebrity—and with that newfound status, her personal life was under further scrutiny.\n\nOver the rest of <i>brighter days ahead</i>, Grande is playfully opaque, making a reference to “holding space” on the simmering “warm,” which turns Grande’s vocals into a neon-lit cloud settling over glossy synth skyscrapers, and declaring “I’m still the same but only entirely different” on “Hampstead,” a reimagining of the barroom-piano-led last-call lament. That’s only one spot where Grande’s voice pushes into exciting new territory: “dandelion,” a lusty expression of desire, spins out of a drowsy trumpet line, its looped horn and sampled trap drums adding heat.\n\n“Might fuck around and elevate my expectations,” Ariana muses on the chorus of “past life,” a low-lit synth-R&B cut. As with her other releases, <i>brighter days ahead</i> shows how her attention to detail and desire to evolve have resulted in a singular body of work that, even if it’s playing coy about where the public Grande ends and the private Ari begins, is utterly her own.","short":"A reworking of the 2024 album holds space for six additional tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/14/2a/2d/142a2d3e-fb3a-e818-8c7b-6eeb92990084/25UMGIM42095.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b1b5b6","textColor2":"b2c4cd","textColor4":"909fa4","textColor1":"dbe0e3","bgColor":"0a0a02","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eternal-sunshine-deluxe-brighter-days-ahead/1800579610","playParams":{"id":"1800579610","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6cbwstHlsAIIWurIIXXBPd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800579610/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743758259902,"RTCI":0}}},"1800706587":{"id":"1800706587","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800706587?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1605513716-338323830","name":"Assassin's Creed Shadows - Ukombozi (feat.

Letting David Lynch's murky netherworld spill out his subconscious, Ellison conjured “Garmonbozia,” a single that creeps forward on waves of chilly synths and tense bass—a sound that threatens to veer into darkness yet never quite does. Flying Lotus chooses the light throughout <i>Spirit Box</i>, populating the EP with playful excursions into house and neo-R&B, teaming with Dawn Richard on the shimmering “Let Me Cook” and Indian singer Sid Sriram on “The Lost Girls.” The bustling nocturnal vibe of the latter teams nicely with the subdued crawl of “Ajhussi” and the insistent pulse of “Ingo Swann,” each lending <i>Spirit Box</i> a sweep that feels vivid and cinematic.

The Austin-based singer-songwriter is just 17 as he releases his debut, though you’d be forgiven for thinking him at least a decade older after hearing the soulful weariness of opener “Ends of the Earth,” or the scrappy wisdom of the melodic and tender “Let ’Em Talk.” Myers seems to find inspiration in virtuosity, naming Stevie Ray Vaughan and Chris Stapleton among his primary influences. You can hear those connections across <i>The Select</i>, like when Myers goes for broke on the loose and funky “Can’t Hold Me Down,” and in much of his guitar playing, which, like Vaughan’s did, tends toward blues while dipping into jazz. Myers also includes a cover of fellow SRV fan John Mayer’s “Man on the Side.” To boot, Myers is just as skilled at choosing collaborators, as Anderson East, Trent Dabbs, and Jessi Alexander are credited as co-writers.","short":"The Austin singer adds new tracks and acoustic versions to his debut

on a True Story","artistName":"Will Smith","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Will Smith has heard the chatter. So much of it, in fact, that the armchair punditry he apes on his <i>Based on a True Story</i> opener, “Int. Barbershop - Day,” sounds like it could be a field recording from any number of Black American gathering spaces. “Who the fuck Will Smith think he is?/And that boy damn crazy how he raising them kids,” goes a particularly cartoony quip. But that’s the beauty of Smith’s creative practice. Whether as star of television’s groundbreaking <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>, hunky lead of rom-coms like <i>Hitch</i>, and even action flicks like the <i>Bad Boys</i> franchise, Smith has never had a problem poking fun at himself. But keep playing…and he’ll get serious quick.\n\nWhich is exactly what happens on <i>Based on a True Story</i>, Smith’s first body of work following 2022’s infamous Chris Rock/Oscars altercation and his first full-length album since 2005’s <i>Lost and Found</i>. Once he gets the jokes out of the way, Smith is out to remind us that he can still rap, and maybe more importantly, that he’s one of the greatest entertainers of all time.\n\nThe album is Smith doing him to the fullest extent of his abilities, reveling in a storied legacy of acting and rapping (“You Lookin’ For Me?,” “Bulletproof,” “Tantrum”), while affirming his faith and the respect he has for his status as a role model (“Beautiful Scars,” “Make It Look Easy,” “You Can Make It”). It’s no light lift, but as he states on “Work of Art,” he’s built for it: “Ima king no denying this/Every limit, I’m defying it/Everybody wanna be a lion/Until it’s time to do lion shit,” he raps. Say what you want about Will Smith—you probably already have—but if you let him tell the story, there’s gonna be a little bit of boasting and a whole of gratitude.

but impossible to ignore in recent years thanks to homegrown stars like Flo Milli, NoCap, and Rylo Rodriguez. Add 19-year-old FattMack to that growing list, his hard-hitting 2024 releases <i>Money Music Murder</i> and <i>TMK</i> setting the stage for the bar-raising <i>Here to Stay</i>. Linking with consistent producers like Tahj Money and Yakree, he confidently rides a wave of relatable yet streetwise themes gratifyingly delivered in a partially sung style with cuts like “Kai Cenat” and the aggressively Auto-Tuned “Sacred.” Standout moments like “Body” and the Cashmoney AP-helmed opener “Hell” offer glimpses of his promising range without depriving the overall project of consistency. Though most of the tracks center him, he allows a handful of others in the studio to amplify his offering. Atlanta rapper Lil Tony drawls with wisdom beyond his years on the booming “Hit It,” while Jay Montana turns up with the goods for the narcotized “It’s a Drought.”","short":"A booming level-up opportunity from the rising Mobile, Alabama, MC."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b7/3f/20/b73f2023-d0ff-79ec-a6d0-1dedc515c915/51520.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccacb","textColor2":"d8d5d7","textColor4":"b3b1b2","textColor1":"f7f5f6","bgColor":"1f2022","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/here-to-stay/1803643424","playParams":{"id":"1803643424","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2a77t1VrX4BW3NTdqY345t"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803643424/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1526850149","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1526850149?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743741563713,"RTCI":0}}},"1803680650":{"id":"1803680650","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803680650?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-01","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/palace/899652201","name":"Greyhound - EP","artistName":"Palace","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d5/ab/ed/d5abedc3-80b6-1ee5-28b1-5d95780344eb/199203316145_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"d1d0d0","textColor2":"97c5b9","textColor4":"7ea398","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1a1917","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/greyhound-ep/1803680650","playParams":{"id":"1803680650","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803680650/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"899652201","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/899652201?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1743757033498,"RTCI":0}}},"1803723439":{"id":"1803723439","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803723439?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-27","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c5/b8/2a/c5b82a36-4445-0e26-4453-806810044293/387b73f1-beba-454a-a849-c9c8ce559f41.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"252825","textColor2":"111211","textColor4":"252826","textColor1":"111110","bgColor":"748377","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dei-v/1515317241","name":"LOS FLAVORZ","artistName":"Dei V","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Dei V made the most of his 2024, collaborating with everyone from Feid and Omar Courtz to Anuel AA and Ozuna in addition to dropping his proper full-length debut. Following a standout appearance on Bad Bunny’s 2025 album <i>DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS</i>, the Puerto Rican rising star returns with an EP-length effort to satisfy his expanding fanbase. Befitting its title, <i>LOS FLAVORZ</i> provides a sampler of styles that the agile artist outperforms over. From the tech-house thump of “Sirena” to the shimmering dancehall reggae of “Toa” with De La Rose, he crosses genres while keeping the project remarkably cohesive. The dance floor-centric “Quiere” presents no fewer than three different rhythmic change-ups in its roughly two-and-a-half-minute runtime. The aforementioned Courtz keeps up his side of their growing joint catalog on the Ty$-esque “Amber,” while an emerging Clarent makes a meaningful impression on the similarly popping “Lollipop.”","short":"A seven-song sampling of the Puerto Rican rising star’s

- SORRY 4 DA WAIT","artistName":"Playboi Carti","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Playboi Carti has hardly been absent in the roughly four years since <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, appearing alongside the likes of Future, Latto, and Trippie Redd in the interim. Still, that didn’t keep his enormous fanbase from persistently clamoring over the prospect of <i>I AM MUSIC</i>, ultimately released with the truncated title of, simply, <i>MUSIC</i>. Its substantial length seems to acknowledge the wait, opening with a flurry of rage-rap tracks like “POP OUT” and “CRUSH” that herald the raconteur’s welcome arrival. Over its 30-track, 77-minute runtime, his sonics shift between the aggressively blown-out, synth-heavy post-trap he became infamous for and something markedly poppier, yet all of it undeniably within his stylistic range. \n\nCarti initially kept his choice of guests close to the vest, as has become custom for high-profile album drops. Yet it would be impossible not to recognize Kendrick Lamar spitting on “GOOD CREDIT,” Future emoting over “TRIM,” or collaborative career mainstay Lil Uzi Vert gliding triumphantly through “TWIN TRIM.” The Weeknd’s prominent feature on “RATHER LIE” makes for perhaps the most overt example of his envelope-pushing here, though appearances by Travis Scott on “PHILLY” and the tag team of Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign on “WE NEED ALL DA VIBES” make the pivot even more plausible.\n\nEven with friends like these, Carti shines brighter on his own, his breathy near-falsetto vocal booming through the escalating video game arpeggios of “I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI” and his raspy snarl swerving around the cinematic noise of “COCAINE NOSE.” Not exclusively looking towards the future, there’s an almost nostalgic appreciation for Atlanta’s early 2010s sound evoked on “RADAR,” its beat reminiscent of classic 1017 Brick Squad tapes.\n","short":"The rage-rap raconteur’s long-awaited return gets four

KBRN","artistName":"Eladio Carrión","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Prior to his poppy pivot on last year’s oft personal <i>Sol María</i>, Eladio Carrión thrived as a trapero. A run of mixtape-style projects like 2020’s <i>Sauce Boyz</i> and two feature-free <i>SEN2 KBRN</i> installments advanced the Puerto Rican rapper’s career from underground stardom to a pivotal part of a contemporary vanguard. That peaked in 2023 with the release of <i>3MEN2 KBRN</i>, a bold and boastful album that paired the bilingual artist with Future, 50 Cent, and Quavo without losing his foothold in Latin hip-hop. That uncompromising spirit and deep love for rap music persists on <i>DON KBRN</i>, less a return-to-form post-<i>Sol María</i> than a full-throated statement of dedication to the proverbial culture.\n\nAs a lyricist, Carrión has reached a stage in his rap craft that surpasses both peers and veterans alike. This quickly becomes clear after the brief yet potent intro “Invencible” gives way to the stunning “Ohtani,” the first of several solo moments where his powers rightfully surge under the spotlight. With its Hypnotize Minds flair and references to everything from Samuel L. Jackson’s <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> to star running back Saquon Barkley, “H.I.M.” succinctly sums up his highly stylized braggadocio. It certainly doesn’t hurt that he continues to work with great producers who’ve grown with him, the Foreign Teck tags on cuts like “AMG” and “Piedras en la ventana” feeling like a victory for the whole team.\n\nCarrión’s guest list is nothing short of a flex in and of itself, freely crossing borders via jet-setting collaborations with North American hitmakers like Big Sean and Jessie Reyez as well as respected Latin artists including Neutro Shorty, Quevedo, and Young Miko. A hospitably inclusive host, he brings música mexicana powerhouse Peso Pluma into the trap space on the brassy “Tiffany” and taps breakout Chilean upstart Cris MJ for the perreo thump of “El Reggaeton del Disco.” Still, when he locks in with the like-minded Myke Towers for the explosive “Vetements,” the fan-friendly team-up’s bars will leave more than a few jaws on the floor.

The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\n\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”","short":"“An idea that started in our bedroom”: Pop’s power couple

U SKRILLEX YOU THINK UR ANDY WARHOL BUT UR NOT!! <3","artistName":"Skrillex","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The tale of Sonny Moore’s career is a long and unpredictable one: Emo kid from LA makes a name as leader of a screamo band, then pivots in the late 2000s to effectively redefine dubstep for millions of raging revelers at the exact moment the EDM economy exploded. Early 2010s EPs like <i>Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</i> are now considered canon; along the way, he had a hand in some of the best pure pop tunes of the decade, scored a Harmony Korine film (2012’s <i>Spring Breakers</i>), and circled back to reunite with his old band, From First to Last. But for his outsized impact on the past two decades of pop culture, his studio albums have been few and, well, not always far between. Nine years passed between his full-length debut, 2014’s <i>Recess</i>, and his second album, 2023’s <i>Quest for Fire</i>; one day later, he released his third album, <i>Don’t Get Too Close</i>.\n\nNaturally, it follows that the roguish superproducer would drop his fourth album out of the sky with no warning on April Fools’ Day. But the appeal of the so-called “brostep” disrupter has long been his ability to balance his prankster impulses with technical wizardry and boundary-pushing ideas. And though the title’s all-caps rant is delivered with a wink, there is a case for <i>F*CK U SKRILLEX...</i> as a work of bona fide pop art. In this case, replace soup cans with DJ drops, which Skrillex incorporates gratuitously in a way you might call avant-garde as the album’s 34 tracks gallop into one another, then disappear just as you’ve started to wrap your head around them. Cacophonous Brazilian phonk wails into classic dubstep, hardcore techno, trance, and less-than-a-minute bursts of pop-EDM perfection.\n\nMeanwhile, increasingly unhinged Trap-A-holics-type DJ drops hint playfully at Skrillex’s mindset at this juncture in his career. “REJECT SOCIETY! RETURN TO NATURE!” bellows one such drop over the mystic-sounding “KORABU,” which crams six collaborators into two minutes (among them Drain Gang affiliates Whitearmor and Varg2™). “I SOLD MY SOUL TO GIVE YOU THIS SONG!” proclaims another one on “ZEET NOISE,” whose breakneck beat is co-produced by Boys Noize and 100 gecs’ Dylan Brady. “THIS BEAT DROP HAS BEEN SEIZED BY ATLANTIC RECORDS AND HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH SILENCE!” the cartoonish voice announces a minute into “BIGGY BAP” before the build-up ratchets back and the narration continues: “MY LIFE IS IN SHAMBLES! I HAVE SEVERE DEPRESSION!” Yet on “VOLTAGE,” the Platonic ideal of “filthy dubstep” erupts into a sentimental chorus: “Gotta believe there’s something more!”\n\nOf course, that’s before our ringleader brings things back to earth on closing track “AZASU” with a hearty thank-you to “the unknown graffiti artist who vandalized our wall,” as pictured on the album cover. These days, you never know where you might stumble upon a bold new work of pop art.","short":"The roguish superproducer’s fourth album aims for bona fide pop
