Composed of friends-turned-collaborators Quinn D’Andrea, Georgia Greene, and Lauren Jones, the Southern California-based trio first found acclaim posting an eclectic assortment of cover videos online, attracting fans with unorthodox takes on songs by the Eagles, ABBA, and everyone in between. On this sophomore outing, the group shows off their songwriting and arranging chops across a dozen tracks, crafting a sound that lands somewhere between HAIM and The Chicks. \n\nThe album opens with its title track, a rollicking two-stepper with harmonies for days. On “Over and Over,” the trio experiments with singing in unison, pulling off that deceptively tough feat with brightness and joy. The soaring harmonies of “Death Grip” recall Little Big Town or Nickel Creek, while “Don’t Tell Me” once again finds the group singing as a unit, this time adding subtle harmonies that create texture and depth. Trousdale co-produced <i>Growing Pains</i> with John Mark Nelson and recorded the bulk of the collection live in an effort to mirror their electric onstage performances.","short":"The SoCal trio shows off their songwriting chops on their second album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/71/b9/28/71b92806-2eaf-ee3d-7260-a79edb4db6c6/199066303610.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0cbd2","textColor2":"e6ddda","textColor4":"c9c1bd","textColor1":"c7e9f5","bgColor":"545149","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/growing-pains/1785985202","playParams":{"id":"1785985202","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/34ISREKShXsEfkYLbxExdJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785985202/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1534241692","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1534241692?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744355477383}}},"1786260133":{"id":"1786260133","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786260133?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jon-pardi/371085834","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/6e/41/1c/6e411c7d-a0d1-3540-12e1-7749aad93354/Jobb398a4a1-1418-4ef3-9454-d766176717d0-189942926-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371910480_2116842266-Time1744221099430.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d4944f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"010b0e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c38a4a","textColor2":"d4944f","textColor4":"ad7a42","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010b0e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1f/f4/14/1ff414e4-cc9d-9b81-e28d-301bbb63eacd/e0c7e949-26ba-49dc-9db2-e2c6b64fb561.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"baa281","textColor2":"d2c2b8","textColor4":"ac9f96","textColor1":"e4c69c","bgColor":"111112","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ee/83/b5/ee83b58e-fce6-0108-c6ab-027cbba6d7e2/Job09d9acfc-f8c0-4416-a710-c97b1a654e99-189942927-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371910479_2116842267-Time1744222781829.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","da9b54"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"010b0e"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d19337","textColor2":"da9b54","textColor4":"b78146","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010b0e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2f/06/65/2f06658a-680d-71e9-7f11-f37e9ac5a483/3c6acda0-9a66-4f6f-a33f-fdfeefbdf07a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c19d7a","textColor2":"e8a475","textColor4":"c18b65","textColor1":"e8ba8f","bgColor":"252827","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d2/68/49/d26849bc-324e-2f35-eae9-6ec738c2375e/56d5ed38-c516-4da7-87b1-4d1311623d3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c49176","textColor2":"dba884","textColor4":"af876c","textColor1":"f5b490","bgColor":"02050f","hasP3":false}},"name":"Honkytonk Hollywood","artistName":"Jon Pardi","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Life has changed for Jon Pardi since he released <i>Mr. Saturday Night</i> in 2022. The California-born country hitmaker and notorious party boy has since become a father, welcoming his first daughter in 2023 and a second daughter a year later. As he releases this follow-up, Pardi is also on the cusp of turning 40, and the resulting music finds him in a more contemplative place than on past releases. While there’s no shortage of booze or bad ideas across the album’s 17 tracks, Pardi also dips into more serious territory, like exploring parenthood on the tear-jerking ballad “She Drives Away” and pushing the party too far on the down-and-out “Gamblin’ Man.”\n\n“I feel like this album is less party and a lot of soul, but it’s still party and dancing,” he tells Apple Music. “There’s lots of layers to this album, I think. There’s some big songs that are going to feel more personable to the listener than my other albums.” Other highlights on <i>Honkytonk Hollywood</i> include opener “Boots Off,” a cheeky, retro ode to knocking boots, and penultimate track “Who I Don’t Wanna Be,” a gritty, melodic exploration of regret and redemption. Pardi closes the collection with “Kinda Wanna Keep It That Way,” a slinky, soulful celebration of going against the grain. Below, he shares insight into several key tracks. \n\n<b>“Boots Off”</b>\n“I didn’t have a bootjack, and regardless, if you got nice boots, they’re not vented, so your feet get hot. If everything gets a little swollen or whatever, it’s a little harder to get the boots off. And then I thought about, well, we were trying to get it on, and I’m over here trying to get my boots off. I can’t get my boots off quick enough. That’s how I came up with that whole hook. And it was funny: I was like, ‘Man, we were just trying to get it on. You’re stuck trying to get your boots off.’ Made for a good song.”\n\n<b>“Gamblin’ Man”</b>\n“‘Gamblin’ Man’ is a hard song. It’s about loss, more than just losing a girl. It’s about losing yourself into something that took everything and just making mistakes. And my favorite line in ‘Gamblin’ Man’ [is], ‘Yeah, they keep on bringing them drinks.’ It’s talking about [how when] you [are] gambling, you get the free drinks. It don’t cost you any money, but they sure ain’t free. I love that line, and it’s like you can put that to anything. Yeah, a little bit too much of it, it comes with a cost.”\n\n<b>“She Drives Away”</b>\n“We always try to sell the drink and the beer and the good time and dancing, and this is my first dad song and a parent song. There’s so many parents out there and so many newborn babies, and it’s nice to have a little theme song for the girl dads out there. I’m still thinking I might see it at some weddings, some father-daughter dances.”","short":"From Mr. Saturday Night to Girl Dad: “There’s lots of layers to this album.“"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/92/99/da/9299daf7-f6c2-e8a0-9eb8-ac19efd1c4de/24UM1IM29689.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ce962f","textColor2":"d99445","textColor4":"b17838","textColor1":"feb93a","bgColor":"120902","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/honkytonk-hollywood/1786260133","playParams":{"id":"1786260133","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1eDL4Z6TcdCDul9hip9WiS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786260133/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"371085834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/371085834?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744347367199}}},"1788359410":{"id":"1788359410","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1788359410?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/l-a-witch/825803479","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"DOGGOD","artistName":"L.A.

Featuring compositions co-written by John and Carlile along with John’s longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin and producer Andrew Watt, their collaborative album <i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> is a triumphant collection that celebrates the eternal promise held by music.\n\nFor John, after ending his touring career in 2023 on the highest note possible with performances at Dodger Stadium and Glastonbury, he was seeking a project that would be forward-looking and feel different from his usual collaboration with Taupin. “If I’d just made another Elton John record, I would’ve killed myself,” he says. “I needed her. I needed her talent, her energy, her humor, and her brilliant lyrics. I’ve got two of the greatest lyric writers in the world, Bernie Taupin and Brandi Carlile, and the lyrics in front of me. When we got going, it was like, <i>whoosh</i>—like an express train.” The album was done in three weeks, start to finish.\n\n<i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> opens with back-to-back salutes to two other titans of queer pop—the emotionally charged singer-songwriter Laura Nyro and the fiery soul-preacher Little Richard. While Carlile credits John as one of her heroes and biggest influences, the project is a true team effort, with cuts like the raucous “The River Man” and “Someone to Belong To” feeling inspired simultaneously by John’s carousing, hooky rock and Carlile’s meticulously crafted Americana. It is, as John notes, a proper “duet album,” with both their voices harmonizing through each song. The prospects of getting real and celebrating differences recur throughout; the questioning title track tackles the idea of true friendship where people “set the pleasantries aside,” while the joyful “Swing for the Fences” highlights those who resemble “a heartbeat cannon in a quiet spot.”\n\n<i>Who Believes in Angels?</i> is structured like an old-fashioned vinyl record even in its digital release, with definitive closing tracks for each five-song “side.” Both tracks—one by a solo Carlile, the other by John—have a sense of bittersweetness. Carlile’s hushed ballad “You Without Me” preemptively looks at how her life will change when her children leave the nest. John’s sweeping “When This Old World Is Done with Me” comes to terms with his mortality and looks back on his life—“I’ve had clouds with silver linings, complicated mornings,” he sings—with a brass band providing its mournful yet hopeful coda. Together, they make a resounding statement about life’s perpetual motion—one that began from a place of frustration and ended up in one of gratitude. I was in such a horrible mood when I started making this record,“ John says. ”I was really tired. I was irritable. The world was going crazy. I needed her to push me. I knew she could just go along with anything. She’s that talented.”","short":"Sir Elton on teaming up with the folk-rock star: “I needed her to push me.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/af/23/54/af23546e-4bc7-93f1-561d-837c9a556713/24UMGIM74322.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccb0aa","textColor2":"ffaf00","textColor4":"d08f0a","textColor1":"fad8c8","bgColor":"181333","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-believes-in-angels/1789808579","playParams":{"id":"1789808579","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5eS9zcWHCbkOiyXPRiIgg4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789808579/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"54657","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/54657?l=en-US"},{"id":"64387579","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/64387579?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744363841384}}},"1789846994":{"id":"1789846994","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789846994?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lumens/1622979568","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"LUMENS - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"LUMENS","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/b5/5a/9fb55a00-a8c1-d25a-bab1-8bf3906e132f/199066430750.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbca","textColor2":"f70056","textColor4":"c60044","textColor1":"fefefc","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lumens-ep/1789846994","playParams":{"id":"1789846994","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789846994/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1622979568","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1622979568?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744347126762}}},"1790215378":{"id":"1790215378","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790215378?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amanda-rheaume/278047421","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/1f/b8/7d1fb8de-74f4-3136-2059-793c7818391e/8156a805-45f9-421f-b5df-f06a1f203aeb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2b2a","textColor2":"161614","textColor4":"353533","textColor1":"0a0a09","bgColor":"b3b3ae","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Truth We Hold","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Amanda Rheaume","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"A resilient sixth LP from the Métis singer-songwriter."},"artwork":{"width":3703,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/6a/e2/9f6ae21a-d2b1-3618-e282-2f75c19b598e/25SYMIM17571.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3703,"textColor3":"4b4a48","textColor2":"451a26","textColor4":"614049","textColor1":"292625","bgColor":"d1dad5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-truth-we-hold/1790215378","playParams":{"id":"1790215378","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZECwfb4wwu830xgPnTk52"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790215378/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"278047421","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/278047421?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744345890148}}},"1790669626":{"id":"1790669626","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790669626?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jonathan-hutcherson/1091680423","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"American Dream - EP","artistName":"Jonathan Hutcherson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dc/cf/69/dccf6955-1c76-d100-7ccb-d263453f3530/193436413237_AmericanDreamCoverFinal.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d0d0","textColor2":"38a5d6","textColor4":"3189af","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"191816","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-dream-ep/1790669626","playParams":{"id":"1790669626","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790669626/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1091680423","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1091680423?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744370952479}}},"1790691526":{"id":"1790691526","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790691526?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/muscadine-bloodline/1067855235","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"...

Four albums and 18 years after <i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i>, <i>SABLE, fABLE</i> is a document of finding peace—joy, even—and a testament to the work it’s taken to get there. “This record, as much as that first record, if not more, was really just a keystone for healing and growing away from this time period where I felt trapped,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Once COVID wiped out the tour plans for 2019’s <i>i,i</i>, Vernon, like pretty much everyone, used the time to take stock, and he came to understand, among other things, that touring might not be the healthiest thing for him. So he made songs.\n\n“It really was like, ‘Okay, I’m not well and I won't make it if I don't do something to change this pretty drastically and stop the whole touring engine,” Vernon says. “There was a sense of relief and an incredible grief to say goodbye to the team that we built. I was like, ‘Let me just get these songs done and just sneak them out there so I can just get them off my chest,’ because that’s what I really needed: to finish them, to learn what was inside them.” The first of these songs, written at the beginning of lockdown, “THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS” is a snapshot of that lonely, uncertain time, but it feels bigger and more hopeful than that to Vernon with five years of hindsight. “In the short term, it makes you feel better, but it’s also a way to lean into your grief and lean into your pain and lean into your guilt,” he says. “I think eventually when I hear that song now, I feel clean from everything that I was dealing with when I had to write it and after I wrote it. But it takes years for things to take shape and for internal things to budge.”\n\nFrom there, the album begins to let more light in with songs like the evidently more hopeful “Everything Is Peaceful Love” (“It’s just all about celebrating this moment right here and just sort of trying to express that heart-leaping-out-of-your-chest feeling”) and “If Only I Could Wait,” featuring vocals from Danielle Haim of HAIM, which Vernon considers nothing less than his favorite American rock band. The album splits the difference between the immediacy of <i>For Emma</i> and the often inscrutable maximalism of <i>22, A Million</i> and <i>i,i</i>. It was during the album’s long gestation that Vernon’s profile was boosted by his work with Taylor Swift, even as his own project remained in the shadows, Vernon exercising a patience and restraint and creating a healthier perspective that was nothing less than career-saving, if not life-saving. \n\n“We are insanely beautiful creatures,” he says. “And so I think where I’ve got to with the simplicity of this music, it was just like, I just want to give it to you. I just want to have it be my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind’—just boom, here it is. We’re not going to hide, we’re not going to put it behind any drapery. We’re going to just give it to you as much as humanly possible.”\n","short":"Justin Vernon returns with “my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind.’”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/44/95/21/449521a9-3e07-9a15-02be-d1412884e240/51719.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"331e19","textColor2":"080601","textColor4":"39221a","textColor1":"010100","bgColor":"fd947c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sable-fable/1791161215","playParams":{"id":"1791161215","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3L3UjpXtom6T0Plt1j6l1T"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791161215/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"273428126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/273428126?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744352510132}}},"1791184860":{"id":"1791184860","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791184860?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/djo/1473178582","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/9f/f1/67/9ff1670b-9a23-e663-0766-de3cd9ed4c96/aa747a05-a74e-4f7f-93f2-adfc339e6acb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfb89e","textColor2":"51b6e2","textColor4":"4495ba","textColor1":"ebe1bf","bgColor":"11131a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8a/29/bf/8a29bf6e-1ac6-82d3-58d9-414349b5c263/a13168c1-aadd-4f81-bc5c-5ebb7c90cd65.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4c5b0","textColor2":"fad89c","textColor4":"d3be94","textColor1":"fae1be","bgColor":"3a5677","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Crux","artistName":"Djo","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The creation—and especially the success—of his 2024 viral hit “End of Beginning” prepared Djo, the musical alter ego of <i>Stranger Things</i> star Joe Keery, for the recording of his third album. “It was a boost of confidence and a good shot in the arm,” he tells Apple Music. “Doing a song from beginning to end in a studio and getting bit by that was like, ‘Oh man, this is how I want to do this. I don’t think I really want to try to do this in my bedroom.’” Famed New York City studio Electric Lady provided Keery and his frequent producer Adam Thein with the environment they needed. “We were using all the toys,” Keery notes. “This piece of gear was laying around, so let’s mess with it. And it ends up, it informs the whole track. There’s a lot of that going on on this record.” And so, <i>The Crux</i> was born.\n\nUnlike his past endeavors, this time he chose to focus on collaboration. “I came up musically in a time where it was Kevin Parker and Mac DeMarco and these guys who did it all by themselves. So I think for a while that was what I thought I wanted to be,” he says. “But doing this project, it made me come back to working more collaboratively, still producing stuff, but with other people. It was a real joy to have friends and family and outside musicians coming in and bringing this thing to life.” One surprising guest? Charlie Heaton, Keery’s <i>Stranger</i> love-triangle competitor, appears on the jaunty “Charlie’s Garden.”\n\n<i>The Crux</i> is filled with psychedelic beats, electronica tones, and groovy guitar licks and floats through Keery’s particular brand of twee indie pop with a blend of bright sounds and hazy nostalgia. There’s the uplifting (“Lonesome is a State of Mind”), carefree (“Basic Being Basic”), regretful (“Delete Ya”), somber (“Egg”), and bittersweet (“Crux”). And classic-rock influences abound, particularly on “Potion.” (“Love Fleetwood Mac. You can definitely hear that on that track,” he says.)\n\nKeery takes special pride in his output. “It’s my outlet for talking about my own life and my little diary,” he says. “I’m sure a lot of musicians, that’s the way that they do it.

disparate genre: grunge. Like contemporaries Cody Jinks and HARDY, the East Texas-born singer-songwriter incorporates heavier elements into his take on twang, and on this outing he also dips into sounds from melodic pop-rock and ’90s country radio. Cooper opens <i>Love You, Goodnight</i> with “Apt. 208,” an aching anthem with shades of 2000s crossover rock. “Fighting with God” is one of the album’s most compelling moments, with an unexpected chorus topline that recalls the acrobatic melodies of early Brooks & Dunn. “Hate You Too” is more power pop than grunge, though some screeching electric guitar beefs things up between verses. Songs like “One Big Happy Sad Family” and “Mama” show the softer side of Cooper’s lyric writing, and the title track, which closes the project, is as tender as it is atmospheric. Fellow Texan Danielle Bradbery joins Cooper on “One Last,” a tear-stained duet chronicling the final, painful days of a doomed relationship. Cooper co-wrote each of the album’s 14 tracks, with Andrew Baylis and Michael Whitworth tag-teaming production.

The Nashville-based singer-songwriter’s 2021 debut <i>Southern Curiosity</i> was a surprising and inventive mix of rootsy folk pop and queered, left-of-center country that remains delightfully uncategorizable. On this sophomore album, though, Hagood goes all in on ’90s country, channeling genre legends like Brooks & Dunn and Reba McEntire to infectious effect. There’s a stacked roster of co-writers, too, including Nashville mainstays Caitlyn Smith and Mindy Smith as well as actor and musician Mary Steenburgen.\n\n<i>American Spirit</i> opens with “Ever Really Ready,” a Jarrad K (Ruston Kelly, Lucie Silvas) co-write about opening up to love after heartbreak. It’s a sweet, wistful song with ample room for Hagood to show subtler shades of his versatile voice. The title track uses the metaphor of an American Spirit cigarette to explore the darker edges of a secret romance, telling of “white lies in a talking town.” Hagood taps Michelle Branch to join him on “Isn’t That Life,” a laid-back, rootsy number well suited to Branch’s rich and agile voice. And on “The Chase,” Hagood gets an assist from all-star folk act Watkins Family Hour, the long-running side project of siblings and Nickel Creek members Sean and Sara Watkins.\n\nOn this deluxe edition, Hagood adds five new tracks, including the closing Mindy Smith and Maia Sharp collaboration, “Where Rainbows Never Die.” That one is a cover of beloved bluegrass outfit The SteelDrivers, who, famously, once boasted Chris Stapleton as lead vocalist. Stapleton co-wrote “Where Rainbows Never Die” for the band’s 2010 album <i>Reckless</i>, and Hagood is one of a handful of vocalists working in Nashville today who can fill the space left by the country superstar’s larger-than-life voice. Other highlights from The Last Drag additions include the Tom Petty-esque “High On You,” which Hagood co-wrote with critically acclaimed Nashville songwriter Caroline Spence, and “The Mountains,” a sweetly hopeful ode to dreamers who get by “on a prayer and the stars in [their] eyes.”","short":"The Nashville genre-bender goes all in on ’90s country on his second

House - EP","artistName":"Rachel Chinouriri","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The <i>Little House</i> EP finds Rachel Chinouriri still a month shy of celebrating the one year anniversary of her career-accelerating debut album, 2024’s <i>What a Devastating Turn of Events</i>, an anthemic, Britpop-inspired chronicle of her turbulent early twenties. With her star in rapid ascendance—critical acclaim, two BRIT Award nominations, a sold-out headline tour of her own, and an A-list guest spot opening for Sabrina Carpenter—the London-born singer-songwriter’s 180-degree pivot from devastation to satisfaction marks this four-track EP. It’s out with the self-doubt and second-guessing that shrouded her previous works and in with sunny optimism and an unassuming confidence, amplified by the heady rush of new love.\n\nChinouriri is an expert when it comes to channeling boundless levels of unchecked feelings into potent shots of ear-snagging indie pop and while the tenor of her emotions has shifted, it’s clear from the effusive one-two punch of “Can we talk about Isaac?” and “23:42” that she has ample raw material at her disposal. The former recalls Chinouriri’s meet-cute moment in a burst of barely suppressed excitement propelled by surfy guitar riffs and finger-snapping percussion; on the latter she pinballs between delight and disbelief at her romantic luck over a cheerful, jaunty beat peppered with sci-fi synth stabs. Later, “Indigo” slows all the gushing to a measured pour, echoing the refrain “You make love feel like...” and letting an atmospheric swell of harmonic vocals fill in the blank. Sandwiched in between, “Judas (Demo)” is somewhat of an outlier, but the simple combination of Chinouriri’s anxious late-night musings backed by the soft strum of an acoustic guitar offers a familiar flash of haunting vulnerability—a reminder of the strong foundations <i>Little House</i> is building on.","short":"The rising pop sensation moves into a new artistic space on this lovestruck EP."},"artwork":{"width":3286,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/8c/00/e18c00b5-666e-8059-3230-4f8117f041e2/5021732722263.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3286,"textColor3":"a7bdc3","textColor2":"c9e9ea","textColor4":"a4bcbb","textColor1":"ceeaf4","bgColor":"0e0a01","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/little-house-ep/1798461135","playParams":{"id":"1798461135","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798461135/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1033202344","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1033202344?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744357801070}}},"1798796697":{"id":"1798796697","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798796697?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Death Metal/Black Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/celestial-sanctuary/1526306794","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Visions of Stagnant Blood -

This debut album from Nunez shows the Brooklyn-born artist is more than just the latest iteration of a trend, though, as he serves up eight tracks that reveal a fresh, genre-agnostic take on country music. \n\n<i>LOW ROAD</i> opens with its title track, a folky Avery Anna collaboration that has shades of Zach Bryan and, in turn, one of Bryan’s primary influences, The Lumineers. “ALL I EVER DO” is similarly jaunty, with a rollicking chorus and foot-stomping beat. Other highlights on <i>LOW ROAD</i> include the playfully moody “NEVER TELL YOU NO,” an infectious situationship anthem with a Southern gothic vibe and flourishes of spaghetti western guitar, and “ANOTHER DAY,” one of the album’s poppier moments thanks to a catchy, cascading verse melody and interplay between synth and banjo.","short":"A former college hoops star turns rising country star on a refreshing debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/b4/ec/0db4eca1-6844-de73-56d4-4554db855833/093624833789.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b4a055","textColor2":"e4b650","textColor4":"b79140","textColor1":"e1c86a","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/low-road/1799941582","playParams":{"id":"1799941582","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MMo6irssSwZPqitG2bMAl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799941582/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1760749583","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1760749583?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744345869171}}},"1799969578":{"id":"1799969578","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799969578?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Electronic","IDM/Experimental"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aaron-drake/537692892","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Some Other Woman (Original Motion Picture Score)","artistName":"Aaron Drake","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/6e/3c/3b6e3c66-e602-6def-947a-599bc199b2c5/764656183479_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b59997","textColor2":"afc0d6","textColor4":"91a0b2","textColor1":"ddb7b4","bgColor":"192123","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/some-other-woman-original-motion-picture-score/1799969578","playParams":{"id":"1799969578","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22UyNnh8INyfIUcojL155Z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799969578/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"537692892","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/537692892?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743723168512}}},"1800524475":{"id":"1800524475","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800524475?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marie-dresselhuis/1710044428","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Untils -

But its longing is cut off at the knees when Grande begins describing her desire to “jump into your skin and change your eyes” so she can provide a kind of turbo-charged empathy that reveals the relationship’s darker side. While its pillow-soft sonics and Grande’s resolute singing are gentle, it’s still a jarring lyric to hear right after the album proper’s closer, “ordinary things,” on which Grande's nonna Marjorie tells her granddaughter in no uncertain terms about the signals that a relationship is over. Nonna spoke, Grande listened, that book is closed.\n\nOr is there even a book in the first place? When discussing the beat-forward, hit-packed <i>eternal sunshine</i> with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe around its initial release in 2024, Grande said, “Finding a home in <i>eternal sunshine</i> was a lovely costume to wear,” noting that the “freedom within art” was present because of the endless possibilities for sources—personal truths, films (like <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, the surrealistic love story  that provides the album’s title), high concepts. With the release of <i>Wicked</i>, Ariana's big-screen coming-out party in late 2024, Grande had reached new heights of celebrity—and with that newfound status, her personal life was under further scrutiny.\n\nOver the rest of <i>brighter days ahead</i>, Grande is playfully opaque, making a reference to “holding space” on the simmering “warm,” which turns Grande’s vocals into a neon-lit cloud settling over glossy synth skyscrapers, and declaring “I’m still the same but only entirely different” on “Hampstead,” a reimagining of the barroom-piano-led last-call lament. That’s only one spot where Grande’s voice pushes into exciting new territory: “dandelion,” a lusty expression of desire, spins out of a drowsy trumpet line, its looped horn and sampled trap drums adding heat.\n\n“Might fuck around and elevate my expectations,” Ariana muses on the chorus of “past life,” a low-lit synth-R&B cut.

Album","standard":"Chilean sensation FloyyMenor rightfully earned rising-star status off of 2024’s “Gata Only,” a collaborative reggaetón cut with the like-minded Cris MJ. Within a matter of months, the track’s international success led to the timely release of his first EP, <i>EL COMIENZO</i>, that summer. Since then, he’s continued to ride that momentum, kicking off 2025 with singles “BAYAMÓN,” a meta-commentary of his breakout hit, and the forthright Gaby Music team-up “TÚ ME CALIENTAS.” Then came “BANSHEE,” a thumping bit of dembow-driven futurism with Colombian superstar J Balvin that opened up the junior artist’s sonic prospects further. \n\nWhile his latest project, <i>YTSQS</i>, an abbreviation for <i>Ya Tú Sabes Quienes Somos</i>, contains all of those recent drops in addition to a number of brand-new songs, FloyyMenor largely avoids bringing guests into his space. Instead, he focuses on honing his homegrown sound further, leaning into an atmospheric and explicit reggaetón blend on “MI LULI” and “PLACERES.” On tracks like “G WAGON” and “SOUTH BEACH,” his heavily Auto-Tuned sung vocals recall something akin to Travis Scott or Chief Keef at their most fantastically faded. Elsewhere, he reunites with Cris MJ for “TOA,” their interplay as vibrant and bold as before as they unapologetically present their respective would-be partners with physical promises and clear boundaries alike. A proven hitmaker for Anuel AA and Bad Bunny, DJ Luian glides into “PIN” with trademark confidence and a subtle throwback touch over the synthy shimmer and low-end pulsations.","short":"The Chilean

Price of Admission","artistName":"Turnpike Troubadours","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In recent years Evan Felker has transcended his role as the Turnpike Troubadours lead vocalist, representing for his legion of fans something more like a saint than a singer. Since he found sobriety after time off from music in the early 2020s, Felker and his redemption arc have influenced and inspired a number of today’s biggest and brightest country up-and-comers, including Zach Bryan, who wrote a song, 2019’s “Felker,” about the enigmatic musician and references the band in fan favorite “East Side of Sorrow.” \n\nThat this follow-up to 2023’s <i>A Cat in the Rain</i> arrives after just two years is a welcome development given the drought of new Turnpike music between 2017 and 2023, and the relatively short period between LPs also, fortunately, does not point to hasty writing or half-assed recording. Instead, Felker and company sound invigorated as ever, with producer Shooter Jennings returning to lend his light but capable touch to 11 new tunes. <i>The Price of Admission</i> opens with “On the Red River,” a vivid and contemplative co-write with Old Crow Medicine Show lead singer Ketch Secor. John Fulbright lends his pen to “Searching for a Light,” a fiddle-heavy exploration of redemption. Other highlights include “Be Here,” an old-timey jaunt complete with gang vocals, and “Leaving Town (Woody Guthrie Festival),” a road song with a heavy dose of reflection.\n","short":"Evan Felker and co. continue their comeback, as invigorated as ever."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1a/61/0d/1a610d53-611b-dbc8-dff6-40583a9923ce/199350022951.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a9a9a4","textColor2":"cdbda6","textColor4":"a49986","textColor1":"d3d2cc","bgColor":"000905","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-price-of-admission/1804389750","playParams":{"id":"1804389750","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0lMU9le9QkLUKR0VFBwxSq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804389750/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"271045477","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/271045477?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744378718589}}},"1804419383":{"id":"1804419383","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804419383?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=111238-362550328","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Wish You Were Here (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Vanessa Carlton & John McCauley","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3f/76/35/3f76357a-29e7-2608-1c92-41931e90b342/199350107504.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b98462","textColor2":"d48f80","textColor4":"ae766c","textColor1":"e29f74","bgColor":"16151d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wish-you-were-here-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1804419383","playParams":{"id":"1804419383","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4MQjLDXPv5xBowm30j8IEe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804419383/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"111238","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/111238?l=en-US"},{"id":"362550328","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/362550328?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1742935959170}}},"1804749489":{"id":"1804749489","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804749489?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eladio-carri%C3%B3n/1024801206","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d2/16/c0/d216c04c-cab8-a161-c68b-cc962f83b51c/e2913303-87ed-4687-af41-32a009fdbb75.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"f4ded4","textColor4":"d4c2ba","textColor1":"e9e9e9","bgColor":"525155","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/06/12/ee/0612ee67-b79d-96c0-f213-8947df9fa5df/957ce180-d43b-4ae4-a9ce-e1df253778d5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5b5bb","textColor2":"ccbbbe","textColor4":"aea0a4","textColor1":"d5d5da","bgColor":"34373d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c8/96/e6/c896e69e-7bb0-d5d7-1b49-06c08f44b6a4/56b4d342-9f99-4286-9148-3b87069e51b5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9ea1a6","textColor2":"c5b7ba","textColor4":"a19698","textColor1":"c1c5cb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"DON KBRN","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Eladio Carrión","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Prior to his poppy pivot on last year’s oft personal <i>Sol María</i>, Eladio Carrión thrived as a trapero. A run of mixtape-style projects like 2020’s <i>Sauce Boyz</i> and two feature-free <i>SEN2 KBRN</i> installments advanced the Puerto Rican rapper’s career from underground stardom to a pivotal part of a contemporary vanguard. That peaked in 2023 with the release of <i>3MEN2 KBRN</i>, a bold and boastful album that paired the bilingual artist with Future, 50 Cent, and Quavo without losing his foothold in Latin hip-hop. That uncompromising spirit and deep love for rap music persists on <i>DON KBRN</i>, less a return-to-form post-<i>Sol María</i> than a full-throated statement of dedication to the proverbial culture.\n\nAs a lyricist, Carrión has reached a stage in his rap craft that surpasses both peers and veterans alike. This quickly becomes clear after the brief yet potent intro “Invencible” gives way to the stunning “Ohtani,” the first of several solo moments where his powers rightfully surge under the spotlight. With its Hypnotize Minds flair and references to everything from Samuel L. Jackson’s <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> to star running back Saquon Barkley, “H.I.M.” succinctly sums up his highly stylized braggadocio. It certainly doesn’t hurt that he continues to work with great producers who’ve grown with him, the Foreign Teck tags on cuts like “AMG” and “Piedras en la ventana” feeling like a victory for the whole team.\n\nCarrión’s guest list is nothing short of a flex in and of itself, freely crossing borders via jet-setting collaborations with North American hitmakers like Big Sean and Jessie Reyez as well as respected Latin artists including Neutro Shorty, Quevedo, and Young Miko. A hospitably inclusive host, he brings música mexicana powerhouse Peso Pluma into the trap space on the brassy “Tiffany” and taps breakout Chilean upstart Cris MJ for the perreo thump of “El Reggaeton del Disco.” Still, when he locks in with the like-minded Myke Towers for the explosive “Vetements,” the fan-friendly team-up’s bars will leave more than a few jaws on the floor. And while the focus is almost exclusively centered on the global rap world, he finds room here for his relatively newfound pop appeal, notably on the duet “Me Muero” with Barcelona’s versatile Lia Kali.","short":"The Puerto Rican rap star does it all for the culture."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/96/85/16/9685167b-62a2-ef69-a139-72ae0b9b5d43/dj.uluxnuza.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cd813f","textColor2":"f4863c","textColor4":"c66e33","textColor1":"fd9e4b","bgColor":"0d0d0f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/don-kbrn/1804749489","playParams":{"id":"1804749489","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/77WXheyyYBkqqz6Q19l37a"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804749489/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1024801206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1024801206?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744370772299}}},"1804768478":{"id":"1804768478","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804768478?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mark/1256529606","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ac/04/0f/ac040f1d-6e8f-8971-b1ff-eff8105de9b7/04771aa4-9781-4d95-ad21-e503b4b0ab40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2b2e","textColor2":"19100c","textColor4":"352d2c","textColor1":"110d0d","bgColor":"a5a2af","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/40/bc/1e/40bc1e92-c937-f9b3-3e62-e799c4ff4773/561289dd-49fb-4763-acfb-f494a1b78707.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c7cab9","textColor2":"e5c6a5","textColor4":"c4ac90","textColor1":"e8ecd9","bgColor":"43443a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1d/e6/33/1de63348-b7f4-b5fe-dcce-a5b44e1b1eb2/82ae1793-63ec-411e-af44-7d27fd1cf251.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfb6b1","textColor2":"e1dee6","textColor4":"b8b5bb","textColor1":"e9dfd8","bgColor":"141213","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Firstfruit - The 1st Album","artistName":"MARK","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"<i>The Firstfruit</i>, the debut solo album from NCT rapper MARK, is achingly personal. “After nearly a decade of being an NCT member,” MARK told listeners on his Apple Music 1 radio show on your MARK, “I feel very, very honored to release a solo album with just my voice, with just my ideas, and just based on me.” Loosely divided into sections based on the four cities—Toronto, NYC, Vancouver, and Seoul—the K-pop artist has called home, <i>The Firstfruit</i> tells the story of MARK’s life up until the album's 2025 release. \n\nThe 13-track collection begins in Toronto, where the rapper was born and spent the early years of his life. MARK sets the scene in acoustic, spoken-word opener “Toronto’s Window”: “I never thought that I could dream in detail, you know?/Always thought that/All I really had to do was to just be faithful and that’s it.” The artist’s faith is a theme throughout the album. “I was born and raised in a Christian family, and so I would always listen to gospel music,” MARK tells Apple Music, recalling sleeping under his mother’s piano as she played in church. While the album’s title is a reference to its role as his first major solo release, it’s also biblical in nature. “In the Bible, it says the first of the first fruits are considered the most important, and it holds the most significance,” explains MARK.\n\nFalsetto-laced pop-funk track “1999” is the album’s lead single. The song’s title is a reference to MARK’s birth year, but it also evokes the rebirth he feels as a solo artist. “Writing the lyrics for this one was actually really, really hard. I think I had about five drafts,” he says. “The song really focuses on that feeling of being reborn, the subject of rebirth. And you can take it literally, but it’s really just figuratively speaking, like a new understanding.” MARK moved from Toronto to NYC when he was in elementary school, a moment sonically recreated in ambient skit-track “Flight to NYC.” “Righteous” and “Fraktsiya,” a rap collaboration with LEE YOUNG JI, round out the album’s New York chapter.\n\nIn “Raincouver,” “Loser,” and “Watching TV” (feat. Crush), MARK’s focus moves to Vancouver. “In my heart, I think Vancouver feels the most home to me,” he tells Apple Music. “I’ll kiss the rain drops, oh,” MARK croons in the sentimental, easy-listening track “Raincouver.” He would stay in the city until 2012, when he passed an SM Global Audition and moved to Seoul to become a K-pop trainee. With “+82 Pressin’,” <i>The Firstfruit</i> shifts location for a final time. The confident hip-hop track, which also features MARK’s NCT co-member HAECHAN, is a reference to the country code needed to call South Korea. “200,” “Journey Mercies,” “Mom’s Interlude,” and “Too Much” round out <i>The Firstfruit</i>’s Seoul story. “This is the city where my musical journey really begins,” says MARK.","short":"The NCT rapper’s solo debut is a map of his life’s

U SKRILLEX YOU THINK UR ANDY WARHOL BUT UR NOT!! <3","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Skrillex","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The tale of Sonny Moore’s career is a long and unpredictable one: Emo kid from LA makes a name as leader of a screamo band, then pivots in the late 2000s to effectively redefine dubstep for millions of raging revelers at the exact moment the EDM economy exploded. Early 2010s EPs like <i>Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</i> are now considered canon; along the way, he had a hand in some of the best pure pop tunes of the decade, scored a Harmony Korine film (2012’s <i>Spring Breakers</i>), and circled back to reunite with his old band, From First to Last. But for his outsized impact on the past two decades of pop culture, his studio albums have been few and, well, not always far between. Nine years passed between his full-length debut, 2014’s <i>Recess</i>, and his second album, 2023’s <i>Quest for Fire</i>; one day later, he released his third album, <i>Don’t Get Too Close</i>.\n\nNaturally, it follows that the roguish superproducer would drop his fourth album out of the sky with no warning on April Fools’ Day. But the appeal of the so-called “brostep” disrupter has long been his ability to balance his prankster impulses with technical wizardry and boundary-pushing ideas. And though the title’s all-caps rant is delivered with a wink, there is a case for <i>F*CK U SKRILLEX...</i> as a work of bona fide pop art. In this case, replace soup cans with DJ drops, which Skrillex incorporates gratuitously in a way you might call avant-garde as the album’s 34 tracks gallop into one another, then disappear just as you’ve started to wrap your head around them. Cacophonous Brazilian phonk wails into classic dubstep, hardcore techno, trance, and less-than-a-minute bursts of pop-EDM perfection.\n\nMeanwhile, increasingly unhinged Trap-A-holics-type DJ drops hint playfully at Skrillex’s mindset at this juncture in his career. “REJECT SOCIETY! RETURN TO NATURE!” bellows one such drop over the mystic-sounding “KORABU,” which crams six collaborators into two minutes (among them Drain Gang affiliates Whitearmor and Varg2™). “I SOLD MY SOUL TO GIVE YOU THIS SONG!” proclaims another one on “ZEET NOISE,” whose breakneck beat is co-produced by Boys Noize and 100 gecs’ Dylan Brady. “THIS BEAT DROP HAS BEEN SEIZED BY ATLANTIC RECORDS AND HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH SILENCE!” the cartoonish voice announces a minute into “BIGGY BAP” before the build-up ratchets back and the narration continues: “MY LIFE IS IN SHAMBLES! I HAVE SEVERE DEPRESSION!” Yet on “VOLTAGE,” the Platonic ideal of “filthy dubstep” erupts into a sentimental chorus: “Gotta believe there’s something more!”\n\nOf course, that’s before our ringleader brings things back to earth on closing track “AZASU” with a hearty thank-you to “the unknown graffiti artist who vandalized our wall,” as pictured on the album cover. These days, you never know where you might stumble upon a bold new work of pop art.","short":"The roguish superproducer’s fourth album aims for bona fide pop

But on 2025’s <i>Greatest Rapper Alive</i>, G Herbo isn’t merely asking for his flowers—he’s demanding them. The project comes during the most productive time of the rapper’s career, following a busy 2024 highlighted by projects like <i>Big Swerv</i>/<i>Big Swerv 2.0</i> and <i>Strictly for My Fans 2.0</i>. Herbo knows that influence is nice, but attribution is better. On <i>Greatest Rapper Alive</i>, he tries to cash in that goodwill for a different sort of accolade.
