Album and Interview","standard":"“Five is freedom, unbound by borders/Rising by lifting others/The artist, the father; the man walking two worlds.” These words, written and performed by Nigerian poet Alhanislam, not only form part of the overture to Davido’s fifth studio album, but also offer insight into the mind and methodology of an artist who’s been at the forefront of African music for over a decade.\n\nDavido frames 2025’s <i>5ive</i> as something of a victory lap, not just for his own pursuits, but for the entire contemporary African soundscape. “This is definitely about celebrating the longevity and how far we’ve come,” he tells Apple Music. “It’s been a long, long journey. Afrobeats is in an amazing place. Everybody’s doing well, all the way from South Africa to Ghana to Nigeria. For us to have risen and taken this culture and the music to such heights—we have our own categories at the Grammys, at the Billboard Awards; we have our own festivals selling out more than the festivals in America. It’s crazy. Because of the nature of the whole genre, everybody’s messing with the culture. So every album is to push Afrobeats further.” \n\nHere, he’s as intentional as ever about eliminating gaps between cultures and sounds altogether, employing even more of the sonic fusions that permeated his 2023 album <i>Timeless</i>. The distinctive log drum of South Africa’s amapiano again features heavily here, along with fusions incorporating Caribbean and Latin styles—woven together with the red thread of Afrobeats and clever nods to African classics. “I love bringing different worlds to mine,” Davido explains, and he does so here through collaborations with Victoria Monét, Shenseea, Tayc, and Dadju; recurring guest stars Chris Brown, Musa Keys, and producers Shizzi, Marvey Muzique, and DJ Maphorisa; rising Jamaican star 450; and homegrown Nigerian heroes like ODUMODUBLVCK, Omah Lay, and Chike. Here, he talks through key tracks from <i>5ive</i>. \n\n<b>“Anything”</b>\n“This is a song you play before you run the Olympics. That’s a song you play before you get on a soccer pitch, the finals, Champions League. That’s a song you play before you do a final exam as a lawyer—it’s an inspirational song just to motivate you to action. Apart from inspirational stuff that we’re talking about on the record, it also kind of solidifies my longevity in the game and how long I’ve been here and how long I’ve still been able to do it. I’ve seen artists come and go and I’m still able to be here.”\n\n<b>“Be There Still”</b>\n“Shout-out to [co-producer] DJ Maphorisa; shout-out to South Africa; shout-out to my boy [co-producer] Marvey Muzique. I’ve always had a strong place in my heart for South Africa, because apart from Nigeria, South Africa was one of the countries to accept my music and push me, put money in my pocket, book me. ‘Be There Still’ is definitely about my longevity in the game, how long we’ve been here. Anywhere the money is going to be, anywhere success is going to be, I’m going to be there. Anywhere you see good things, anywhere you’re looking for n***as at the top, you’re going to see me.”\n\n<b>“Offa Me” (feat. Victoria Monét)</b>\n“If you ask me, it’s going to be one of the biggest records on the album. Victoria Monét—I met her at the 2024 Grammys, and she won three awards that night. She was on fire. And I feel like this record is the perfect matchup of what she does and what I do.”\n\n<b>“R&B” (feat. Shenseea & 450)</b>\n“I love the Caribbean, and I’ve done a lot of shows there. ‘R&B’ is produced by my boy Jonn P. I know people know Shenseea, but a lot of people back home might not have heard of 450. But he’s the new guy. He’s the new hot guy going crazy; he’s amazing. I’m excited to show him to Africa and to the world and just mix our worlds together.”\n\n<b>“Awuke” (with YG Marley)</b>\n “Shout-out to Jamaica, YG Marley. Like I said, I love bringing the two worlds together. What I loved about that record was the process, the making of the song and the making of the video. YG came to Nigeria for the first time; [it was his] first time being in Africa, him and his uncles, and I think his brother. I love when these artists come to my home and I show them, like, ‘Yo, this place is not that bad.’ You know what I’m saying? It’s kind of lit. And every time they come, they end up not even wanting to leave.”\n\n<b>“Holy Water” (feat. Victony & Musa Keys)</b>\n“Me and Musa Keys together [on 2023’s ‘UNAVAILABLE’]—we probably have the biggest songs of our career. For me, apart from collaborating with these people, they’re actually family. Musa ended up laying some ideas on the beat, and then me and Victony finished up the song. They’re just two strong, hardworking individuals that are going crazy right now. There’s nothing wrong in learning stuff from the newer generation. Look how Drake has done it. Even DJ Maphorisa, he’s still tapping in with the new producers. So I’ve never had a problem, and that’s probably why I’ve lasted so long, because a lot of people have a problem with tapping in. Just because I’ve done stadiums around the world, it doesn’t mean I don’t have a listening ear or don’t mean I still can’t learn. So I’m always open, and I never feel too big, because the music is bigger than all of us. What we’re trying to attain is bigger than all of us.”\n\n<b>“Nuttin Dey”</b>\n“This is a typical Nigerian record—it’s like my version of ‘Every Little Thing Gonna Be Alright’ [Bob Marley’s 1977 hit “Three Little Birds”]. When we say ‘nuttin dey’ in my country, it means ‘no problem.’ It’s like, ‘We’re good; everything is chill, everything is nice.’ So that’s the vibe of that record. And shout-out to Selebobo, an OG music producer from Nigeria that hasn’t been active in a while, and I met up with him in America. And then we got back in the studio and did that.”\n\n<b>“Titanium” (feat. Chris Brown)</b>\n“You know what’s crazy? Chris Brown has been on my last four albums. That’s my brother. When you do music with your brothers, with your family that you both care about, nah, it’s always going to work. Just that moment with me and him in South Africa performing to the biggest crowds of our careers [in 2024]…it’s crazy.\n\n<b>“Lately”</b>\n“You know when you sing depressing songs, but the songs are so good you have to dance? It’s really talking about a lot of things I was going through—a lot of smiling through sadness—and it was really talking about, ‘God, please save me. I have to be strong for everybody.’ And I’ve been in those type of situations where I’m not really strong mentally at that point, but then I have to act like everything is okay, for everybody else to be okay. It’s really a depressing record that bangs heavy.”\n\n<b>“Funds” (feat. ODUMODUBLVCK & Chike)</b>\n“I remember when they first played me the sample [of Brenda Fassie’s 1997 hit ‘Vuli Ndlela’] and I was like, ‘How we’re going to flip this?’ I’m not really a big fan of sampling music, but sampling Brenda Fassie is legendary. It was just amazing to see how we could just bring two worlds together. I’m Yoruba, and then Chike is Igbo, and then you bring in Brenda Fassie’s [South African] spice into that too—nah, I always knew it was going to <i>go</i>.”\n\n<b>“With You” (feat. Omah Lay)</b>\n“I remember when Kai Cenat came to Nigeria [in 2024], he was on a livestream, and then I took him out in my car. And when he was in the car, he was like, ‘Oh, what song is this?’ And it was Omah Lay’s song playing. I think the next day Omah Lay tweeted, ‘Wow, I thought Davido hated me.’ I’m like, ‘Hated you? Why would you think I hate you? I love your music. What you talking about?’ He was like, ‘Oh,’ he didn’t know. So I was like, ‘Yo, we got to get in studio.’ I don’t put no ego before my music. And I know this one is top three for me. So shout-out to Omah Lay. I feel like that’s going to be a big record for us.”\n","short":"Davido toasts to evolution and “celebrating how far we’ve

Arthur","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Water signs (for those unfamiliar with the astrological concepts underpinning the title of James Arthur’s sixth studio album) are typically represented as the sensitive, emotionally intense characters of the zodiac. Heightened feelings, unflinching self-examination, and an intuitive understanding of the human condition have been core elements of Arthur’s musical DNA as far back as his triumphant run on <i>The X Factor</i> in 2012; <i>PISCES</i> serves to further cement that identity. Animated production from Steven Solomon—whose chart-topping steer on Arthur’s previous project, 2024’s <i>Bitter Sweet Love</i>, sees him return to the helm here—plots out a lush, organic soundscape for the Middlesbrough-born singer-songwriter to explore. \n\nThe soft, languorous distortion of opening track “Summer” carves out space for ruminative self-examination before giving way to stadium-rock toned catharsis. “ADHD” swaps layers of dreamy piano riffs and acoustic guitar for rhythmic percussion and pop polish; “Celebrate” culminates in a mocking chant, flipping the sentiment of the word as Arthur dissects his lifelong struggle with anxiety. Underneath the self-effacing (and occasionally, self-flagellating) lyrical themes, the album’s true message is one of resilience, integrity, and pride—Arthur’s reckoning with his flaws amounting to a tacit admission that he cares about himself enough to do better, if not for his own ends then at least for the sake of those he loves. “Nothing ever comes easy, but with you it’s a walk in the park,” he sings on the swelling declaration of romantic devotion, “All My Love,” later turning over his past mistakes on “Water,” which crests with a belting refrain of “I rise and I fall,” that sounds like something close to acceptance. The temptation to wallow in shallow regret can be hard to resist; thankfully, on <i>PISCES</i>, he has chosen to dive deep.","short":"Arthur finds introspection and anthemic hooks written in the stars."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/96/76/33/96763397-07c3-26b8-0443-2d6ead9f7ec3/196872718706.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"162f3d","textColor2":"0c1215","textColor4":"18313f","textColor1":"091012","bgColor":"49aeea","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pisces/1783129795","playParams":{"id":"1783129795","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7nktQKQFOMkh40iOTOzzBS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783129795/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"193502798","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/193502798?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745579968703,"RTCI":0}}},"1783539009":{"id":"1783539009","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783539009?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bb/a8/5b/bba85b4f-34d9-3cd6-e3f1-790d9bb1bf1c/ce0be49b-098b-4054-9807-1d3c7ed206af.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2825","textColor2":"201e1a","textColor4":"413a35","textColor1":"080806","bgColor":"c8aaa0","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e6/b6/73/e6b67377-5b2a-b70a-d88e-7f46fc29e697/65b51f5a-82f0-4d55-8de8-0301486a2290.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"342d2b","textColor2":"151211","textColor4":"352e2d","textColor1":"13100f","bgColor":"b6a09c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fb/32/a3/fb32a3ba-8a50-f24c-1b01-beec1805541d/d64995c0-1c66-47fa-bc66-f020499218f3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"443330","textColor2":"140f0e","textColor4":"423431","textColor1":"160e0d","bgColor":"fac5bd","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stereophonics/2579656","name":"Make ‘em Laugh, Make ‘em Cry, Make ‘em Wait","artistName":"Stereophonics","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"You think you know what you’re getting with a Stereophonics album. Heading for three decades since their debut record, <i>Word Gets Around</i>, the Welsh heroes can be relied upon for radio-friendly singles, selling out stadiums, and nailing observations about the everyday that apply to both normal and rock-star life. \n\nBut their 13th album <i>Make ’em Laugh, Make ’em Cry, Make ’em Wait</i> finds Stereophonics with a lyrical restlessness and an urge to challenge the state of the world, cleverly wrapped up in their trademark catchy tunes. It’s not the sound of standing still and accepting your lot. “There’s Always Gonna Be Something” sees Kelly Jones lament the relentlessness of carrying on with life when you’ve “got the weight of the world on fire.” On “Colours of October” he senses that a “white flag in this warring feels hopeless,” but none of these darker thoughts dampen the Stereophonics’ sound, which burns brighter than ever. \n\nThere’s a welcome hint of nostalgia on “Backroom Boys,” where Jones recalls the days of kissing at the bus stop and sneaking a beer: “Nothing makes me feel alive/Like the sound of rock ’n’ roll/Not the time of mobile phones.” No word or chord is wasted in the eight tracks and Jones’ distinctive vocals are polished to perfection without losing their soul. This is a band who were thankful they were around then—and are grateful they are now—tapping into the mindset of their loyal fans and always delivering the goods, with a few surprises.","short":"The Welsh rockers mix their trademark charm with lyrical spike."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e2/2b/a1/e22ba197-4338-9a41-084d-760501b0ddca/24UM1IM34009.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"412a26","textColor2":"150805","textColor4":"412d29","textColor1":"150502","bgColor":"f3c1b8","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/make-em-laugh-make-em-cry-make-em-wait/1783539009","playParams":{"id":"1783539009","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0uyCKkvMu0F3pDzKUJsPOn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783539009/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2579656","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2579656?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745589044106,"RTCI":0}}},"1784280001":{"id":"1784280001","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784280001?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b5/33/6f/b5336f65-b220-e538-71aa-65367a66f087/Job096a651a-a249-48e4-9104-613d3656a65c-183822572-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359454470_2022512439-Time1736981953154.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b4c9e3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"252626"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"a0abb5","textColor2":"b4c9e3","textColor4":"97a8bd","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252626","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3e/39/be/3e39be33-17b2-1f04-2c36-13bc9a01f601/57797ab0-f8bf-4f97-b6a0-18a61d0a08d3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a322f","textColor2":"241c16","textColor4":"423b37","textColor1":"1a110c","bgColor":"b9b9ba","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/47/ef/51/47ef51c5-4153-4a96-a67c-78c2085ab385/Job88088b68-9420-4be6-9013-4b27c704b15d-183822573-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359454471_2022512438-Time1736987469638.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"aea4b4","textColor2":"afc2dc","textColor4":"92a2b7","textColor1":"d1c4d9","bgColor":"222221","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/samia/879399372","name":"Bloodless","artistName":"Samia","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Samia’s third album, <i>Bloodless</i>, sounds as if someone’s opened a nearby window, allowing for a gush of fresh air to carry Samia Finnerty’s voice into the skies. The 28-year-old Minneapolis-based singer-songwriter’s follow-up to 2023’s <i>Honey</i> feels lithe and buoyant even at its most emotionally weighty. At times—the slinky “Lizard,” the echo-laden swell of “Sacred,” the thicket of woodwinds and vocals that run through closing track “Pants”—Samia recalls the ethereal New Wave of British pop-rock phenom The Japanese House, or the timeless bounce of Fleetwood Mac. At the center of such gestures is Samia’s close-to-the-bone lyricism, which continues to convey her pitch-perfect sly humor; atop the stormy strums and electronic frissons of “North Poles,” she wraps

The two initially met at a show in 2016 and kept in touch, and during the pandemic lockdown they talked about making a collaborative country record—specifically, a queer country record. Five years later—and on the heels of Baker’s <i>other</i> indie all-star team-up in boygenius—<i>Send a Prayer My Way</i> makes good on that long-gestating idea and marks the latest entry in an exciting and energizing series of country releases from queer artists, like Chappell Roan and Fancy Hagood, unafraid to take up space in a traditionally conservative and gatekeeping genre. TORRES, aka Mackenzie Scott, tells Apple Music that trust was essential to the pair’s writing and recording processes. “We both just followed our gut instinct on this one,” Scott says. “And both of our gut instincts said to let the other person do their thing and not try and interfere too much, and not try to control the process so much that we were creating an environment where we were trying to make the other person do something that they didn’t want to do.”\n\nCo-produced with Sarah Tudzin of Illuminati Hotties, <i>Send a Prayer My Way</i> opens on a quiet note with “Dirt,” a delicate ballad about heartbreak and regret accented by mournful fiddle from Balmorhea’s Aisha Burns. The playfully titled “The Only Marble I’ve Got Left” livens up the mood, with Baker and TORRES serving up a darkly sweet love song about trying to stay sane in a world gone mad. “Downhill Both Ways” is a mesmerizing showcase of the pair’s harmonies, as Baker’s soft lilt counters TORRES’s sturdy tone. “Tuesday” digs into the more difficult side of the queer experience, as TORRES sings of falling for a girl whose “mama caught wind that her daughter’s friend might be of the wrong persuasion.” \n\nAnd it wouldn’t be a country record without a drinking song or two, with “Bottom of a Bottle” checking all the boxes: lost faith, a lost woman, and an empty glass bottle. Scott, whose original demo was slower and more mournful, was worried Baker might not be into it. The fact that her worries were unfounded turned out to be a vote of confidence in the strength of their collaboration. “She took it and ran with it,” Scott says. “God, she transformed the song.

Powered by slashing guitars and a droning chorus, “Man Made of Meat” offers historical perspective for modern complainers: “I don’t wanna pay for anything/Clothes and food and drugs for free/If it was 1970, I’d have a job at a factory.” Jet-propelled bass boogie “The Bog Body” doubles as a commentary on superficiality that plays out like an inversion of the Demi Moore body-horror flick <i>The Substance</i>, complete with a zombielike swamp woman.\n\n“Pyramid of Health” simultaneously apes and lampoons Marcy Playground’s grunge-esque ’90s hit “Sex and Candy” before veering into carnival music and electronic noise. Resurrecting a successful template from previous albums, Murphy cuts loose with a hilarious, possibly stream-of-consciousness rant over skronky free jazz on “Best in Show Pt. IV.” With breathy backing vocals and a chiming minor-key organ melody, “Medicine for Horses” is more plaintive, reflective, and—maybe—straight-faced. The same could be said of Murphy’s mournful, wavering vocal on closer “River King,” but who knows? Where Viagra Boys are concerned, it’s anyone’s guess.","short":"The Swedish quasi-punks double down on absurdism and

few years, from her striking breakout single “Wolves” and her debut LP <i>Are You Happy Now?</i> to a profile-raising stint opening for Noah Kahan on 2024’s Stick Season tour. Her sophomore bow <i>I Don’t Know How But They Found Me!</i> finds the 27-year-old taking her confessional folk-rock style—equally influenced by Tracy Chapman’s raw lyrical expressionism and Taylor Swift’s melodic grandeur—and blowing it up on the widest screen possible. Over bell-clear production courtesy of studio wiz Brad Cook (Bon Iver, Waxahatchee), McRae’s songwriting breathes like never before, from the countrified and Phoebe Bridgers-esque “Savannah” to the closely-mic’d piano ballad “Tuesday,” which features McRae leaning into her sturdy lower vocal register and spinning the type of quietly devastating lyrical gestures she’s become renowned for: “If you spent a day in my shoes/You’d know how it feels to be used.”","short":"Confessional folk rock blown up on the widest screen possible."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/09/05/c7/0905c741-9e67-3f85-787a-f357198c474b/51888.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5c7c8","textColor2":"d29b73","textColor4":"aa7f5e","textColor1":"f4f5f7","bgColor":"0b0d0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-dont-know-how-but-they-found-me/1792515736","playParams":{"id":"1792515736","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/61pSh8kSiqdyoTgDbaPG8h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792515736/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"591974463","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/591974463?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745835526336,"RTCI":0}}},"1793338780":{"id":"1793338780","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793338780?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/45/11/e2/4511e2cc-2400-af53-1c60-bd030583f080/Jobcb2af251-136f-4204-a71e-7980653fd05a-186452569-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364825487_2063162763-Time1740186560385.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","212428"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"27262c"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"303236","textColor2":"212428","textColor4":"3f4044","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"27262c","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a2/ac/50/a2ac50d2-b5df-e5ac-1740-25373970d390/5553ae49-8b90-42d3-9e29-6cf76b87a92e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"343533","textColor2":"16110b","textColor4":"353531","textColor1":"13110d","bgColor":"b5c3c9","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5f/87/cc/5f87cc7d-c4cf-028c-1f5f-0a5b5bdffe5d/Jobfe49273e-75bc-4d58-b614-8267e4718bf8-186452570-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_364825488_2063162764-Time1740187881736.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","24242a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"27262c"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"373943","textColor2":"24242a","textColor4":"444249","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"27262c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/salami-rose-joe-louis/1055288813","name":"Lorings","artistName":"Salami Rose Joe Louis","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Lindsay Olsen’s playful, dreamlike, channel-changing mix of jazz (“I dunno ways”), R&B (“I will never say”), goofy synth-pop (“Hobbies”), and New Age (“Basketball”) feels right at home in the Brainfeeder universe of Thundercat, Louis Cole, and Flying Lotus. But you can also connect her rightly and easily to a history of artists who have dared to quietly imagine other worlds beyond—or within—our own, from Max Tundra and Stereolab back through the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Joe Meek. Where her first couple of albums anchored themselves in complex sci-fi backstories, <i>Lorings</i> rests in how colorfully and expertly she emulsifies her various musical interests into something that feels both weird and off-kilter but deeply intimate—like an alien sitting down and taking off its socks.

His proper debut album, <i>WITHERED</i>, takes that impossible-to-pin-down tendency even further than before, with striking and surprising results; over the dusky dream pop of “You Left Me First,” Burke captures the weightlessness of Cigarettes After Sex, while the tangled guitars of penultimate track “Ghost” recall the dusky gothic indie rock of iconic indie label 4AD’s early years. A few notable guests pop up on <i>WITHERED</i>—Latin-pop polymath Kali Uchis lends her vocals to the lush “Crashing,” while songwriter Ryan Tedder (Beyoncé, Adele) throws in on the swirling “Is This Really Love”—but the album is first and foremost a showcase for Burke’s sonorous vocals, as well as an undeniable point of arrival in the field of left-of-center pop music.","short":"A full-length

A decade later, the Chicago band (now a three-piece with drummer Jon Alvarado and guitarist Anthony Vaccaro) has gone viral on TikTok, rocked huge festival stages, and inspired female-dominated mosh pits with their angsty anthems about broken hearts and bruised egos. Their third album, <i>Tunnel Vision</i>, sees the band shifting their focus away from love and towards what some might call a full-blown existential crisis. “The world is changing for the worse,” Trifilio sings bluntly on the deceptively chipper “Mr. Predictable” (whose chorus doesn’t not give “MMMBop,” with all due respect). She’s crying at the DMV on “Clueless,” winkingly extolling the powers of self-delusion on “Big Pink Bubble,” and on “Violence,” she rattles off a list of news items (“Mass extinction, fascists gloating, microplastics in our clothing…”) that are enough to make you want to chuck your phone off of a bridge. The world’s on fire, sure, but Beach Bunny lays it down with enough verve that you may as well mosh anyway.","short":"The Chicago indie trio shifts its focus to existential crisis."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5a/d6/c6/5ad6c63d-a5b2-7a38-023d-4e45bd1e031c/199066752685.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2c1b25","textColor2":"391034","textColor4":"59284e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"dc8ab9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tunnel-vision/1794412465","playParams":{"id":"1794412465","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7cKYTJlA0TDjAFA24oglTN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794412465/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1147783278","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1147783278?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745835703341,"RTCI":0}}},"1794970958":{"id":"1794970958","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794970958?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cosmic-cathedral/1765720262","name":"Deep Water","artistName":"Cosmic Cathedral","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/bf/5f/2dbf5f7a-36c6-ceb0-e311-6ac048ed653a/196872667202.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"31342a","textColor2":"061217","textColor4":"31362f","textColor1":"060f12","bgColor":"ddc78d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deep-water/1794970958","playParams":{"id":"1794970958","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0s8grv5g5bOAbeviyRj0Rd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794970958/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1765720262","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1765720262?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745556522942,"RTCI":0}}},"1795108181":{"id":"1795108181","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795108181?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e5/e4/c2/e5e4c2b0-0bfa-2a16-38ab-6c85d6c2712a/Job147dead1-5594-4972-9f8f-8c0eb2a4681c-190051234-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372134027_2118536317-Time1744331535814.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e3ad64"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"121210"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3ae80","textColor2":"e3ad64","textColor4":"be9257","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121210","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4d/4c/93/4d4c9314-1a65-4be3-98a1-f65321ba03a4/6ddaf95f-bf1b-4163-a95c-cf72909c9f01.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ada585","textColor2":"c9be9a","textColor4":"a2997c","textColor1":"d6cda5","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/70/53/57/70535746-5187-0741-fa35-a1270cf0f191/Job3b1b16cf-2f98-4d5e-9176-0e9d10e8273c-190812953-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373680717_2131156660-Time1745354401341.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"baa065","textColor2":"db843e","textColor4":"b77137","textColor1":"dfc078","bgColor":"26221c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/dd/c2/d9/ddc2d9f2-184e-e557-4a22-cf7cd66e7bc1/40520474-fa76-4479-966b-e533e0595ed6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dfcda2","textColor2":"fad69b","textColor4":"e0bd88","textColor1":"f9eabc","bgColor":"785b3d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/49/98/52/49985254-7493-af14-c2f4-5c0abae2a4b5/8366869d-c8d1-4ecf-96a3-09734433245b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3ab9c","textColor2":"c9c8c2","textColor4":"a7a6a0","textColor1":"d8cfbd","bgColor":"1e1d1a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tucker-wetmore/1486724646","name":"What Not To","artistName":"Tucker Wetmore","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The title track of Tucker Wetmore’s debut album, <i>What Not To</i>, holds poignant significance for the Washington-born singer-songwriter. As the “Wind Up Missin’ You” hitmaker tells Apple Music, “What Not To” is an advice song in reverse and is inspired by Wetmore’s difficult experiences with his estranged father, whose actions he believes serve as examples of how not to live a loving and fulfilled life. The wrenching tune is also imbued with hard-earned compassion for the man who abandoned Wetmore’s family, with a gut-punch of a lyric at the song’s bridge: “Momma said you don’t pray no more/Breaks my heart, so I do it for you.” “I obviously don’t talk to my dad often, and I haven’t talked to him in years,” Wetmore says. “One of the last conversations we had was him telling me that he don’t pray no more. And that’s when I said, ‘That’s all right, I’ll do it for you.’ And then we parted ways.”\n\nWhile “What Not To” is the beating heart of the album, it is anything but a maudlin affair, with Wetmore peppering in some more upbeat tunes like the moody but playful “Brunette” and the slick, melodic “Drink Alone.” Other highlights include opener “Whatcha Think Is Gonna Happen?” which pairs a soul-searching lyric with brooding production, and, of course, Wetmore’s biggest hit, “Wind Up Missin’ You,” a sweet and soulful tune about the excitement of new love.","short":"The Washington singer-songwriter’s debut is poignant and soulful."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/37/e9/2c/37e92c32-397a-9e0c-2af3-ab5de03d5a7f/25UMGIM11522.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfad65","textColor2":"dd9351","textColor4":"b87d47","textColor1":"e5cf76","bgColor":"27241f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-not-to/1795108181","playParams":{"id":"1795108181","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7IEXNrjznoPOllZ2TusbIl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795108181/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1486724646","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1486724646?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745858892532,"RTCI":0}}},"1795124497":{"id":"1795124497","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795124497?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ff/14/12/ff141263-7a42-bcf2-9bf0-5e076221ced3/Jobd56f2811-a030-4f15-bf01-bdfc1e873f05-190418887-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372895177_2125217015-Time1744822401418.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e67b57"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b69075","textColor2":"e67b57","textColor4":"b86245","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/09/49/78/09497888-2fa3-ed15-b2e1-8419dfeac58b/Job73ec7d4a-4b2a-4650-8b4a-8410f256c372-190418888-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372895176_2125217016-Time1744823467497.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c4afa2","textColor2":"e98f5e","textColor4":"ba724b","textColor1":"f5dbcb","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kassi-ashton/1260807519","name":"Made From The Dirt: The Blooms","artistName":"Kassi Ashton","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1f/3d/ee/1f3dee85-9882-ae6e-8704-a4bd80747003/25UMGIM08317.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8917b","textColor2":"e57f53","textColor4":"b76542","textColor1":"e6b59a","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/made-from-the-dirt-the-blooms/1795124497","playParams":{"id":"1795124497","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Mui85kJDWahH18S8i5WlA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795124497/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1260807519","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1260807519?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745542837174,"RTCI":0}}},"1795435357":{"id":"1795435357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795435357?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Violin","Orchestral","Chamber Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/47/20/6b/47206bf3-02d1-4b06-1eaf-542c2b717620/9ba9a817-951b-4bbf-b3f6-fee66b8655a2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"302d29","textColor2":"21201e","textColor4":"41403e","textColor1":"0b0905","bgColor":"c4bfbc","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/esther-abrami/1310973207","name":"Women","artistName":"Esther Abrami","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"There are many reasons why music by female composers should be more widely performed and appreciated—and perhaps the most powerful of these is particularly evident in Esther Abrami’s new album <i>Women</i>. “The music is so wonderful; we are missing out,” the French violinist tells Apple Music Classical. Her program consists of largely unknown music from across 800 years, from a beautiful arrangement of music by Hildegard von Bingen, to a rarely performed concerto by early 20th-century Irish composer Ina Boyle, and Miley Cyrus’ chart-topping song “Flowers”. The final track, <i>Transmission</i>, is by Abrami herself, its title referring to the passing of music down to future generations. “I’ve had little girls telling me that they’re bringing this music to their teachers, saying that they want to play it,” she adds. “And I think if we then manage to tell teachers to teach the students these pieces, and if at least the students want to learn them, that’s a fantastic way to go about it.”\n\nGiven the countless scores from across periods, genres, and countries still waiting to be discovered, how did Abrami settle on her 14 works? “I listened to many, many pieces by women composers. And there were certain melodies that really made me feel something. I fell in love with them as soon as I heard them.” Take Ina Boyle’s Violin Concerto, for instance, a timeless, rhapsodic work infused with folk song. “I love Vaughan Williams’ <i>The Lark Ascending</i>, and I felt some similarities in Boyle’s Concerto,” says Abrami. “It features beautiful, peaceful melodies and is linked to nature. I felt that it could be a concerto that people want to play and feature in programs.”\n\nBut Abrami had a sense that under the surface were great stories waiting to be told. <i>Women</i> is almost as much about their incredible personalities as it is about their work. “The women that I ended up including are ones whose stories I found really inspiring,” says Abrami. Take the late 19th-century Brazilian composer Chiquinha Gonzaga, for instance, whose beautiful song “Lua Branca” forms part of a larger stage work. Gonzaga, like many women of her generation, was discouraged from pursuing music. “Her husband forced her to choose between music and marriage,” says Abrami, “but unluckily for him she chose music, which at the time was a scandalous decision.” \n\nAnd there’s Pauline Viardot whose all-round musical talents, including singing and composing operas, placed her right at the center of 19th-century cultural Paris and in the social circles of Chopin and his partner, the novelist George Sand, as well as Gounod and Berlioz. Viardot’s song “Haï luli” arranged here for violin, harp, and string quintet, is proof of her fine melodic gifts. Abrami highlights, too, the poignant story of Ilse Weber, held at Theresienstadt during World War II before being taken to Auschwitz where she was murdered in 1944. “Weber composed all her music in Theresienstadt,” says Abrami. “Her husband buried her music in the ground and dug it up after the war.” It’s said that Weber sang her heart-rendingly beautiful lullaby “Wiegala” to her children as they all entered the gas chambers at Auschwitz.\n\nThrough an evocative arrangement for violin and string quintet by Penelope Axtens, Abrami introduces us to the world of the 12th-century abbess, philosopher, medical practitioner, mystic, and composer, Hildegard von Bingen. The piece “Solitude” is another discovery, composed by the late 19th-century French composer Rita Strohl who separated herself entirely from society to concentrate on her music. “When we talk about music that people don't know,” explains Abrami, “I think it really helps if there’s some storytelling involved. I hope this album brings new things to the violin repertoire.”","short":"Esther Abrami: “I hope this album brings new things to the

Album","standard":"“If I find myself just going through the motions and just trying to forcefully create 40 minutes of content in order to just fulfill contractual obligations, I wouldn’t do with that,” Ghost mastermind Tobias Forge tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Why waste the energy? Every new album, every new tour, it is very much like a new baby. It’s a new existence that you have to live with, that you want to love. And it takes a lot of effort to do that.”\n\nThe angelic choir that opens <i>Skeletá</i> might seem ironic for a band that openly preaches the virtues of Satan, but such is the upside-down church of Ghost. The soaring “Peacefield” kicks off the Swedish band’s sixth album before giving way to the deadly “Lachryma,” a tale of crying vampires bolstered by a killer metal riff and ’80s synth sounds, as if King Diamond went New Wave 40 years ago. (“That’s one of my favorite songs ever,” Forge says.)\n\nThe insanely catchy lead single, “Satanized,” wrestles with inner demons and heresy as Latin chants and a throbbing bassline guide the way to an inverted epiphany. Triumphant guitars break through the somber piano that opens “De Profundis Borealis,” a propulsive track that, like many of the songs on <i>Skeletá</i>, sees “new” vocalist Papa V Perpetua—Forge in his latest papal guise—addressing a listener experiencing inner turmoil. “Cenotaph” rides what sounds like a sawed-off Metallica riff into a colorful, twinkling vocal melody with ’70s classic-rock guitar stabs. “Marks of the Evil One” beckons Forge’s favorite antihero, Lucifer, for another stomping, jubilant curtain call. Closer “Excelsis” offers a sober meditation upon death not unlike Type O Negative’s “Everything Dies”—only this one has a vocal line like an award-winning Broadway musical.\n\nUltimately, <i>Skeletá</i> is proof positive that Ghost is still making infectious, devilishly appealing music nearly 20 years after Forge first hatched his concept. “My career is not really different from any other band,” he tells Apple Music. “Sooner or later, you’ll hit that point where a new record won’t really have any great relevance. And it’s hard to say when that is. It just happens. And when it’s a fact, it’s already a fact. And I am a firm believer that we haven’t really hit that yet.”","short":"Nearly 20 years in, the Swedish metal vets still hail Satan in grand

genre and tempo in vinyl-only sets known to flit from hip-hop to drum ’n’ bass to free jazz. Before that, though, the artist born Felix Manuel was something of a child prodigy as a pianist and harpist. On <i>Under Tangled Silence</i>, the first Djrum full-length since 2018’s <i>Portrait with Firewood</i>, Manuel’s talents as an instrumentalist (piano, harp, and percussion) are foregrounded as much as his electronic production. On “A Tune for Us,” cascading piano gradually gives way to jungle breaks; elsewhere, heady acid house and futuristic dancehall wash up against a blissful, piano-guided ambient meditation. Manuel began the record during the pandemic lockdowns, then rebuilt it from scratch after a catastrophic hard-drive meltdown; the result is a striking, holistic portrait of an artist fully inhabiting himself.","short":"Felix Manuel merges instrumentalism with striking electronic production."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/2d/6f/4a2d6f89-f204-8f91-9812-f9bd203e33b0/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d312d","textColor2":"08090a","textColor4":"303031","textColor1":"050905","bgColor":"d0d0ce","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/under-tangled-silence/1798265319","playParams":{"id":"1798265319","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1bMzS9D1chZ57onK5mU8ea"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798265319/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"457834696","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/457834696?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745665556727,"RTCI":0}}},"1798558992":{"id":"1798558992","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798558992?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b0/e2/d9/b0e2d98b-3c2f-b0c1-0380-916b341ec2e0/Jobfeb481f0-5c0b-448e-9fa5-1913b8ae6f7d-187760469-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367613807_2083405466-Time1741725623750.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d2c29f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1d1b17"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"beb7a3","textColor2":"d2c29f","textColor4":"ada082","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1d1b17","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/10/a0/a7/10a0a782-49fd-7121-d648-c20365098b49/Job365f84b5-27ea-4029-84dc-74d8e8a671ef-187760470-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367613806_2083405467-Time1741727119846.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c1bcaf","textColor2":"d1caa6","textColor4":"aaa486","textColor1":"ede8da","bgColor":"110f07","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/willie-nelson/71676","name":"Oh What A Beautiful World","artistName":"Willie Nelson","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Just shy of his 92nd birthday, the legendary American songwriter shows no signs of stopping: <i>Oh What a Beautiful World</i> is Nelson’s 77th solo studio album. This one continues his hallowed tradition of interpreting the work of his own favorite songwriters—in this case, its 12 songs were either written or co-written by fellow Texan Rodney Crowell, who also appears to sing backup on the title track. Nelson has been recording Crowell’s songs for decades (including on 2024’s <i>The Border</i>), but here the tracks he’s selected are poignant in their focus on the mundane sweetness of life: quiet mornings, rainstorms, old clothes that fit just right. Bittersweet memories of simple childhood pleasures resurface on “Banks of the Old Bandera,” though the rope they used to swing on over the swimming hole has long since tattered and frayed. All the more moving, then, when Nelson sings on “The Fly Boy & the Kid,” “May you always stay in touch with the things that keep you young/When you’re staring at injustice, may you never bite your tongue.”","short":"On LP 77, Willie pays tribute to the work of fellow Texan Rodney

(Deluxe Edition)","artistName":"Fontaines D.C.","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Perhaps more so than any other Irish band of their generation, Fontaines D.C.’s first three albums were intrinsically linked to their homeland. Their debut, 2019’s <i>Dogrel</i>, was a bolshy, drizzle-soaked love letter to the streets of Dublin, while Brendan Behan-name-checking follow-up <i>A Hero’s Death</i> detailed the group’s on-the-road alienation and estrangement from home. And 2022’s <i>Skinty Fia</i> viewed Ireland from the complicated perspective of no longer actually being there. \n\nOn their fourth album, however, Fontaines D.C. have shifted their attention elsewhere. <i>Romance</i> finds the five-piece wandering in a futuristic dystopia inspired by Japanese manga classic <i>Akira</i>, Paolo Sorrentino’s 2013 film <i>La Grande Bellezza</i>, and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn’s three <i>Pusher</i> films. “We didn’t set out to make a trilogy of albums but that’s sort of what happened,” drummer Tom Coll tells Apple Music of those first three records. “They were such a tight world, and this time we wanted to step outside of it and change it up. A big inspiration for this record was going to Tokyo for the first time. It’s such a visual, neon-filled, supermodern city. It was so inspiring. It brought in all these new visual references to the creative process for the first time.”\n\nRecorded with Arctic Monkeys producer James Ford (their previous three albums were all made with Dan Carey), <i>Romance</i> also brings in a whole new palette of sounds and colors to the band’s work. From the clanking apocalyptic dread of the opening title track, hip-hop-inspired first single “Starburster,” and the warped grunge and shoegaze hybrids of “Here’s the Thing” and “Sundowner,” it opens a whole new chapter for Fontaines D.C., while still finding time for classic indie rock anthems such as “Favourite”’s wistful volley of guitars or the Nirvana-like “Death Kink.” “Every album we do feels like a huge step in one direction for us, but <i>Romance</i> is probably a little bit more outside of our previous records,” says Coll. “It’s exciting to surprise people.” The deluxe edition includes three new tracks: “It’s Amazing to Be Young,” “Before You I Just Forget,” and a live version of “Starburster/In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song).” Read on as he dissects <i>Romance</i>, one track at a time. \n\n<b>“Romance”</b>\n“This is one that we wrote really late at night in the studio. It just fell out of us. It was one of those real moments of feeling, ‘Right, that’s the first track on the album.’ It’s kind of like a palate cleanser for everything that’s come before. It’s like the opening scene. I feel like every time we’ve done a record there’s been one tune that’s always stuck out like, ‘This is our opening gambit...’”\n\n<b>“Starburster”</b>\n“Grian [Chatten, singer] wrote most of this tune on his laptop, so there were lots of chopped-up strings and stuff—it was quite a hip-hop creative process. It’s probably the song that is furthest away from the old us on this album. This tune was the first single and we always try and shock people a bit. It’s fun to do that.”\n\n<b>“Here’s the Thing”</b>\n“This was written in the last hour of being in the studio. We had maybe 12 or 13 tracks ready to go and just started jamming, and it presented itself in an hour. [Guitarist Conor] Curley had this really gnarly, ’90s, piercing tone, and it just went from there.”\n\n<b>“Desire”</b>\n“This has been knocking around for ages. It was one of those tunes that took so many goes to get to where it was meant to sit. It started as a band setup and then we went really electronic with it. Then in the studio, we took it all back. It took a while for it to sit properly. Grian did 20 or 30 vocal layers on that, he really arranged it in an amazing way. Carlos [O’Connell, guitarist] and Grian were the main string arrangers on this record. This was the first record where we actually got a string quartet in—before people would just send it over. So being able to sit in the room and watch a string quartet take center stage on a song was amazing.”\n\n<b>“In the Modern World”</b>\n“Grian wrote this song when he was in LA. He was really inspired by Lana Del Rey and stuff like that. Hollywood and the glitz and the glamor, but it’s actually this decrepit place. It’s that whole idea of faded glamor.”\n\n<b>“Bug”</b>\n“This felt like a really easy song for us to write. That kind of buzzy, all-of-us-in-the-same-room tune. I really fought for this one to be on the record. I feel like, with songs like that, trying to skew them and put a spin on them that they don’t need is overwriting. If it feels right then there’s no point in laboring over it. That song is what it is and it’s great. It’s going to be amazing live.”\n\n<b>“Motorcycle Boy”</b>\n“This one is inspired by The Smashing Pumpkins a bit. We actually recorded it six months before the rest of the album. This tune was the real genesis of the record and us finding a path and being like, ‘OK, we can explore down here...’ That was one that really set the wheels in motion for the album. It really informed where we were going.”\n\n<b>“Sundowner”</b>\n“On this album, we were probably coming from more singular points than we have before. A lot of the lads brought in tunes that were pretty much there. I was sharing a room with Curley in London, and he was working on this really shoegaze-inspired tune for ages. I think he always thought that Grian would sing it, but when he put down the guide vocals in the studio it sounded great. We were all like, ‘You are singing this now.’”\n\n<b>“Horseness Is the Whatness”</b>\n“Carlos sent me a demo of that tune ages and ages ago. It was just him on an acoustic, and it was such a powerful lyric. I think it’s amazing. We had to kind of deconstruct it and build it back up again in terms of making it fit for this record. Carlos had made three or four drum loops for me and it was a really fun experience to try and recreate that. I don’t know how we’re going to play it live but we’ll sort it out!”\n\n<b>“Death Kink”</b>\n“Again, this came from one of the jams of us setting up for a studio session. It’s another one of those band-in-a-room-jamming-out kind of tunes. On tour in America, we really honed where everything should sit in the set. This is going to be such a fun tune to play live. We’ve started playing it already and it’s been so sick.”\n\n<b>“Favourite”</b>\n“‘Favourite’ was another one we wrote when we were rehearsing. It happened pretty much as it is now. We were kind of nervous about touching it again for the album because that first recording was so good. That’s the song that hung around in our camp for the longest. When we write songs on tour, often we end up getting bored of them over time but ‘Favourite’ really stuck. We had a lot of conversations about the order on this album and I felt it was really important to move from ‘Romance’ to ‘Favourite.’ It feels like a journey from darkness into light, and finishing on ‘Favourite’ leaves it in a good spot.”","short":"Three bonus tracks make the band’s fourth album even more lovable."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/93/d5/3e/93d53e93-6873-58fb-4e86-7d9042a665b2/191404153574.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cb8dbc","textColor2":"ff88c7","textColor4":"d171aa","textColor1":"f6a9de","bgColor":"1d1a35","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/romance-deluxe-edition/1803604510","playParams":{"id":"1803604510","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803604510/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1341828470","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1341828470?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745835816259,"RTCI":0}}},"1803716020":{"id":"1803716020","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803716020?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/27/e2/b5/27e2b556-4a81-70a3-5d4a-ca1684e9dcf0/Job91a349c4-3b6e-4c46-8f9c-3ba2eee66aa0-190873283-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373812082_2132096711-Time1745426487786.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c4cdb7"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"151b1d"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b6bca8","textColor2":"c4cdb7","textColor4":"a2aa9a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"151b1d","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4c/05/91/4c05912e-5bfd-e4ee-44fc-5ea64fe94b35/697e09c9-7e93-4a6b-8d22-ab4bb1b251c8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"d4cdc5","textColor4":"a9a49e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/1e/ea/5f/1eea5fb0-862a-b58a-bfbe-c8273aefdb80/Job1861d635-34e2-4de1-a2ca-d9a016b9905b-190873284-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373812083_2132096712-Time1745427927866.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b9c894"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"151b1d"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bdbc9f","textColor2":"b9c894","textColor4":"9ca980","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"151b1d","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a8/43/52/a8435231-2362-2ed6-1704-ef46600615bb/2f03b3c8-e7b5-4b47-80f7-bf8e27fbc084.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b3b4a3","textColor2":"c1c9bf","textColor4":"a2aaa3","textColor1":"d6d6bf","bgColor":"272b31","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/44/68/fc/4468fcfb-9c7b-4501-f559-c7d23220e54e/9b0fd68b-0012-4941-bedf-04ebfb77ac3a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bdbdbd","textColor2":"cdc4ba","textColor4":"a49d95","textColor1":"edecec","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wiz-khalifa/201714418","name":"Kush + Orange Juice 2","artistName":"Wiz Khalifa","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It was a big deal when #KushandOrangeJuice became the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter upon the release of the eighth Wiz Khalifa mixtape in April 2010, back when “hashtags” and “trending topics” were cutting-edge promotional tools. Back then, it was practically unheard of for a rapper with no major-label deal to be making such big waves (he’d left his former label, Warner Bros., in 2009). But there was something comforting about the red-eyed Pittsburgh rapper’s laidback mode of rapping about the staples of college dorm-room chatter: weed, women, cars, parties… Did we mention weed? Today, <i>Kush & Orange Juice</i> is considered a “blog era” classic—a throwback to a chiller, simpler time.\n\nAlmost exactly 15 years later, its sequel arrives like a visit from a friend from long ago who’s grown up and gotten richer, but otherwise mostly stayed the same. The 23 terminally chill tracks of <i>Kush + Orange Juice 2</i> feature more of the Taylor Gang touchstones you know and love: jet-ski races, beach picnics, fat joints, drop-tops, crab rolls, hot-boxing Ferrari F8s. He’s joined by a loaded roster of guests who haven’t changed much in the past decade and change, either: Curren$y, Smoke DZA, Chevy Woods, Terrace Martin. “I been doing the same thing since I was 19,” Khalifa crows on “I Might Be,” which might be tragic were those things not so timelessly appealing. Throughout the tape, a radio DJ (broadcasting on a station known as W-E-E-D) offers salient advice: “Don’t stay in the house, man. Jump in the car. Ride around with the homies and the homegirls, and put on some of that Wiz Khalifa, y’all.”","short":"After 15 years, a sequel arrives like the return of an old

3rd Mini Album 'TRY WITH US' - EP","artistName":"TWS","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"With their third mini album, <i>TRY WITH US</i>, fifth-generation K-pop group TWS continues expressing their self-described “boyhood pop” genre. Seemingly limitless in its energy and optimism, the bright, dynamic pop style is meant to evoke the ordinary emotions and experiences of teen-boy life. Though a few of TWS’s six members had entered their twenties when <i>TRY WITH US</i> was released in mid-2025, the mini album stays in the backpacks-and-bus-stops schoolboy space that defined the group’s debut just a year earlier. \n\nLike TWS’s 2024 breakout hit “plot twist,” the title of <i>TRY WITH US</i>’s lead single has a more specific, playful meaning in its Korean-language incarnation. Called “Countdown!” in English, the Korean title “마음 따라 뛰는 건 멋지지 않아?” translates to “Isn’t it cool to follow your heart?” The cheerful pop song is about going for what you want, even if you need a countdown to build courage first. Other subjects explored in the mini album include TWS’s gratitude towards their fans (“Lucky to be loved”), a call to indulge in the fun of youth (“Random Play”), and the scariness of planning an honest love confession (“GO BACK”).\n","short":"The K-pop group evokes the emotions and experiences of teen-boy

After the viral success of her 2024 single “Sailor Song”—an open plea for queer romantic connection that topped the UK singles chart and went platinum in several other countries—her self-produced debut album plays like unabashed memoir. “Sugar Water” opens with a nod to Perez’s birthplace of Hackensack, New Jersey before recounting schoolyard taunts and even the texture of her childhood Barbie’s hair. Her sister Celene’s death in 2020 sits at the center of “Fable,” with both that song and the closing title track featuring voicemails left by Celene. Perez also unpacks that family tragedy on the darker “Survivor’s Guilt,” while the album’s title was inspired in part by Perez sleeping on the beach after her sister died. \n\nThe emotive singing and busker-style folk balladry of Perez’s earlier releases is very much at play, though lilting strings interweave with the acoustic guitar on “Crown” and the especially surprising “Twister” adds Auto-Tune and a programmed beat. But again, the lyrics are most often the star here, with the singer-songwriter revisiting her intense religious upbringing alongside love, loss, and other weighty themes.","short":"There’s more to this confiding young songwriter than her viral hit."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/54/11/b5/5411b5e4-30e7-8853-a7d7-75b3700b810c/25UMGIM53543.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363636","textColor2":"2e2d2e","textColor4":"585758","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/at-the-beach-in-every-life/1807389775","playParams":{"id":"1807389775","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58vZavXqh1P5uoTXteudWl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807389775/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1553802745","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1553802745?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745835608012,"RTCI":0}}},"1807395137":{"id":"1807395137","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807395137?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/16/be/23/16be23fd-c786-81e3-aa50-f47eca34e1ff/Job487810af-1fd8-4f32-9b0d-56b9722acf98-190023976-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372082351_2118123148-Time1744307647519.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e0d7c6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"421717"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d1cac8","textColor2":"e0d7c6","textColor4":"c3b2a3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"421717","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/97/80/d3/9780d372-c665-31a6-35df-f66a01ee7e4e/5af846c3-a0a6-4bbc-b076-f79048e65843.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292928","textColor2":"1b1c1b","textColor4":"383835","textColor1":"08090b","bgColor":"aca99e","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c2/5c/01/c25c01b5-9a46-693d-90cf-74ecbab9cdec/Job741edc29-8ba4-4726-b973-21e205190b9f-190023977-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372082352_2118123149-Time1744311400550.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cdc5be","textColor2":"ebe7d9","textColor4":"cdc0b3","textColor1":"ebeee7","bgColor":"57211c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d8/c0/19/d8c01907-35eb-8905-32e8-6d50c7a9e63e/d682c395-455b-478c-9da4-253137f7e19d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ccc3b9","textColor2":"dfdad0","textColor4":"c3b9b0","textColor1":"ebe5db","bgColor":"543932","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/3f/9e/a5/3f9ea5bf-faf0-0778-5c05-9e4d0b4e0a20/b3aa3ca4-a345-4390-b77e-a84e5902a35e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ccc1bb","textColor2":"d4bba9","textColor4":"b79a8b","textColor1":"efebe5","bgColor":"411716","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shaboozey/914125510","name":"Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going: The Complete Edition","artistName":"Shaboozey","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Shaboozey has long been inspired by the romantic notion of the outlaw: “The guy who’s standing against a whole bunch of folks and it’s like, ‘We’re going to take them down.’ Yeah, you can try!” the musician tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. The obsession is less quaint than it sounds. Having pored through old western films, dime-store pulp novels, and gunslinger ballads à la Marty Robbins, the Virginia native noticed that old-school cowboy culture and hip-hop share a preoccupation with all things American renegade. \n\nThe conversation around country music’s Black roots will sound familiar to anyone who tuned in to Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>, which featured Shaboozey on two tracks. (“Beyoncé’s been such a big part of being Black in America,” he said, still in awe of the opportunity. “At every point in our lives, she has had some sort of cultural impact.”) But the 29-year-old singer/rapper has been staking his territory in the space between hip-hop and country for a decade, redefining what it means to be a modern country star.\n\nHis third album, <i>Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going</i>, plays out like a classic American road movie, opening with steel guitar, the gallop of horse hooves, and Shaboozey with his foot on the gas, fresh out of smokes and headed nowhere in particular. On tracks like “Let It Burn,” his rich baritone is equal parts Willie, Waylon, and woozy blues rap à la Future. Elsewhere, he channels Imagine Dragons’ arena-ready roots rock, where breakup banger “Annabelle” hits the sweet spot between Fleetwood Mac and Post Malone. But the star-making moment is “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the breakaway hit of 2024’s Stagecoach Festival: a Southern-fried riff on a 20-year-old J-Kwon club classic with TGIF vibes.","short":"The 2024

Nights","artistName":"Roy Woods","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Roy Woods’ superpower has always been transparency. Across his 2016 debut, <i>Waking at Dawn</i>, the Ontario native wrestled with the temptations and privileges of being a rising R&B star. He was a 20-year-old trying his best to stay true to his innermost desires. Nearly a decade later, on <i>Dark Nights</i>, the singer has grown, but his search for love hasn’t gotten any less complicated. \n\nAlbum opener “So Obvious” sets the tone: “Summer’s over/It’s so obvious,” he croons over a hard-hitting backdrop courtesy of frequent collaborator Dimi. We're hearing him realize relationships can be as fleeting as the seasons. But Woods is nothing if not self-aware. He looks inward on “Stay With Me,” owning up to the strain his career puts on his relationships. “What I Used to Get Into” is likewise an attempt to start fresh, the singer confessing to past mistakes as a way to move forward. At just nine tracks, <i>Dark Nights</i> is dense with moments that feel deeply reflective. Album closer “Tell Me What I’m Living For,” for instance, is Woods reckoning with his life’s choices, still wondering when it’s all going to make sense.","short":"What the Ontario singer needs now is love, sweet love."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6a/fb/3c/6afb3c6e-07ac-ab0a-0265-8b130ae17be3/52188.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2b1ad","textColor2":"c2c1bd","textColor4":"a09e9a","textColor1":"d8d8d5","bgColor":"1a150f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dark-nights/1807601782","playParams":{"id":"1807601782","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7hyrgjUIdVzGGtzIrLhcJE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807601782/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"401780269","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/401780269?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745835517899,"RTCI":0}}},"1807647757":{"id":"1807647757","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807647757?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a7/3b/cd/a73bcdce-9d66-2918-fe5e-705dbd9ae87f/Job255ca186-6f43-4652-866f-37a35c5c2da6-190126687-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372285524_2119917459-Time1744414219833.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","120f10"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c2c3c5"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"323231","textColor2":"120f10","textColor4":"3a3a39","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c2c3c5","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2b/bf/96/2bbf96e9-4c6b-0ac5-8849-b74d71aef1bd/339b1d29-c3d7-4b43-ad01-483bba8a9497.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"343531","textColor2":"2b1b13","textColor4":"42382f","textColor1":"191715","bgColor":"9faba2","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/31/c9/7d/31c97d15-f4b8-1ff9-6cc8-d70ad7ad3ab2/Job8c9873b5-e740-4f6e-9617-b1026eaf2af4-190126688-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372285523_2119917460-Time1744416686375.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"333231","textColor2":"22201f","textColor4":"464443","textColor1":"0b0909","bgColor":"d4d7d4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mozzy/418259765","name":"INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS","artistName":"Mozzy","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After a prodigious 2024 run, which included a late-in-the-year joint project with Kalan.FrFr, Sacramento rap star Mozzy took only a few short months before putting out his next full-length. Not unlike his reflective 2022 album <i>Survivor’s Guilt</i>, the 18-track <i>INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS</i> doesn’t shy away from the trials and tribulations that drive some of his most memorable recordings. On cuts like the unfiltered “UNDER OATH,” he doles out truths on his own terms, laying waste to those who fail to live by the hood code or, perhaps worse, flaunt it without regard. \n\nHe dismisses pocket watchers and cautions the opps on the ominous “KATTA CLIPS,” proudly standing on his principles for the existentially broader “KEEP CALLIN MY NAME.” That clear commitment to street-level ethics extends to some of his invited guests too, namely EST Gee on “DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR” and Polo G on “WHO WANT WAR.” As locked in with his contemporaries as he is, Mozzy also recognizes the Californian hip-hop lineage that precedes him on “PAC PROUD” and “HELLA HYPHY.”\n","short":"One of Sacramento’s finest returns with an honor-bound album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b6/0f/ce/b60fced7-e411-9e18-f3a0-8554e74e085c/197342993548_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"323232","textColor2":"1f1b19","textColor4":"43403e","textColor1":"090909","bgColor":"d5d7d6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/intrusive-thoughts/1807647757","playParams":{"id":"1807647757","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0tjWYspyQvDrgVk4ExxCKX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807647757/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"418259765","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/418259765?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745558450636,"RTCI":0}}},"1807956819":{"id":"1807956819","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807956819?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-21","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kai/1508288900","name":"Wait On Me - The 4th Mini Album","artistName":"KAI","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mini Album","standard":"Debuting as part of SM Entertainment boy group EXO in 2012, Kim Jongin—better known by the stage name KAI—made his solo debut in 2020 with a self-titled EP. In 2023, he had one of the biggest hits in K-pop with “Rover,” a remake of the bass-driven dancehall song “Mr. Rover” from Bulgarian singer Dara. With 2025’s <i>Wait on Me</i>, KAI made his return to K-pop after a two-year hiatus for mandatory military service. In that sense, the album’s title track—an Afrobeats-infused track about the heady power of anticipation—is aptly named. \n\nAcross the mini album, K-pop artist KAI refuses to stay still. From the rolling Latin trap of “Pressure” to the amapiano-inspired “Off and Away,” the seven tracks on <i>Wait on Me</i> are designed to be moved along to. Sensual and smooth, the performance-driven album evokes a hazy dance-floor sensibility—fitting for an artist known as one of the best dancers in K-pop. \n","short":"Seven songs from a returning K-pop star designed to make you move."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f4/0d/db/f40ddbdc-0717-485a-86ef-58707fa58555/KAI_M04_Wait_On_Me_DC.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d0b680","textColor2":"fedcb7","textColor4":"cfb399","textColor1":"ffe099","bgColor":"151120","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wait-on-me-the-4th-mini-album/1807956819","playParams":{"id":"1807956819","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/78cxz0pQ2TDtESNyCCX5Qj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807956819/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1508288900","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1508288900?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745837465076,"RTCI":0}}},"1808333343":{"id":"1808333343","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808333343?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-21","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/73/2c/7f/732c7f0d-77d4-40ec-fd61-6313abc083a1/Jobc1ccf066-243c-480d-b955-cb1aaab1590b-190463052-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372986474_2125923683-Time1744876581238.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","263038"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"052a4a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"384853","textColor2":"263038","textColor4":"4a555f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"052a4a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b4/29/c9/b429c937-b73d-701f-b5bd-2e2914a5a2e2/b0f15cae-7d2e-4b75-8e1a-3e32c4a5e608.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"585358","textColor2":"362f32","textColor4":"5c5659","textColor1":"312b30","bgColor":"f4f5f6","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4c/c3/3b/4cc33bd5-c61a-8cac-8977-cf7d94e451ff/Job16a8b129-f6fb-43d5-946f-5c720a3bf14b-190463053-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372986475_2125923682-Time1744877669779.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"323b43","textColor2":"001624","textColor4":"2e424e","textColor1":"050e16","bgColor":"e5f1f7","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chuu/324458584","name":"Only cry in the rain - EP","artistName":"CHUU","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"K-pop artist CHUU (츄) pairs introspection with synth-pop for the dreamy title track of her mini album <i>Only cry in the rain</i>.

Sol, however, doesn’t take lightly the responsibility of her instrument, treating each opportunity—both in and outside of her role as lead vocalist for Sault—as an opportunity to spread joy, foster hope, and offer up praise to the most high. Sault’s mission across <i>10</i>—actually their 12th full-length project—lies squarely inside those ramparts, with Sol working alongside the group’s production engine, Inflo, alongside a slew of other collaborators (dancehall singjay Chronixx, legendary bassist Pino Palladino, rising pianist NIJE) to offer a balm for increasingly trying times.\n\nThe titles alone—“The Healing,” “Know That You Will Survive,” “We Are Living”—telegraph their psalmic intention. So does Sol’s voice, which sails over Ohio funk in “Power,” recalls the radiance of disco queen Donna Summer on “Real Love,” and anchors uptempo jazz on “The Sound of Healing,” breathing life into relentless optimism.

Roughly one year later, on the eve of a much buzzed-about Las Vegas installment, he drops this EP-length release that links to his 4th Rope brand. \n\nFollowing the secular gospel opener “FISHSCALE FRIDAY,” he slips into Flygod mode for the rugged boom-bap reboot “EINSTEIN KITCHEN.” Stripped of the guest list that hopped into the ring on the preceding <i>12</i>, he appears to holler even louder over the choral soul of the Harry Fraud-produced “GORO.” Helmed by Denny Laflare, the piano-driven “DAVEY BOY SMITH” nods to a long-departed Hall of Famer while Gunn rattles off a referential barrage.","short":"The wrestling-fixated Griselda impresario shows us the ropes."},"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4e/50/5b/4e505b7e-160f-0c27-a61d-3ac6bb7be687/8721215189091.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"cbcbc5","textColor2":"e5ddc7","textColor4":"c1b5a4","textColor1":"f1f9f0","bgColor":"311717","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heels-have-eyes-ep/1809011562","playParams":{"id":"1809011562","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809011562/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829760702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829760702?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745838849008,"RTCI":0}}},"1809029346":{"id":"1809029346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809029346?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sting/94804","name":"STING 3.0 Live","artistName":"Sting","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/36/89/4a/36894a28-aac4-aebf-e9ef-2e9fa8dc7bec/25UMGIM54348.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bab3a0","textColor2":"efb0ae","textColor4":"c4928f","textColor1":"e2d9c3","bgColor":"1a1b15","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sting-3-0-live/1809029346","playParams":{"id":"1809029346","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4r8JECF7FXyBaIKLdNfRJa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809029346/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"94804","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/94804?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745682414789,"RTCI":0}}},"1809054200":{"id":"1809054200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809054200?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","Hip-Hop/Rap","Korean Hip-Hop"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/younite/1620137046","name":"YOUNI-T","artistName":"YOUNITE","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/f2/54/68f254e0-24f4-6b89-b096-5f42fdddaa0b/cover_KM0022566_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"39464c","textColor2":"5e0106","textColor4":"7d3336","textColor1":"091920","bgColor":"f9f9f9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/youni-t/1809054200","playParams":{"id":"1809054200","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6rTNYVHdejHf1dAdtvMr9t"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809054200/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1620137046","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1620137046?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1745560708597,"RTCI":0}}},"1809249520":{"id":"1809249520","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809249520?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-22","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eprom/269399600","name":"Tracks from the Vault -

Objekt envisioned his installment in this series as a soundtrack to coming home after a night out. The Berlin producer says he took some minor liberties in his interpretation of “chill-out,” favoring downtempo tracks with a “mildly unhinged” vibe. “I wanted to balance the mix being soothing but also rather unsettling and strange,” he tells Apple Music. “I try to let all my sets be guided by some kind of narrative arc of mood and energy. In this case, it’s a mix to shepherd you through varying states of mental disarray at the afterparty before eventually nudging you gently out the door and into the morning light.” Among his favorite tracks: “Things Happen” by Coil (a long obsession) and Scorn’s “Light Trap” (because he couldn’t <i>not</i> include a Scorn song, he says).

Given that track record, any TDE signee warrants at least some attention, especially if that artist happens to be from Los Angeles. Long Beach native Ray Vaughn certainly makes as strong a case as possible for his come-up on <i>The Good The Bad The Dollar Menu</i>, his substantial debut mixtape for the acclaimed label.\n\nOn the piano-driven opener “FLOCKER’S remorse,” he sets listeners on a whirlwind tour of his hardscrabble past, one explored in further graphic detail on “XXXL Tee.” Hunger is a well-established lyrical metaphor in rap, for literal and figurative means, but Vaughn makes it as resonant as ever on the shapeshifting “DOLLAR menu.” The troubling reveals of “3PM @ DAIRY’S” will hit like shockwaves for some, while others may find comfort or at least relatability in his contemplative assessments of generational trauma. Yet even when he’s scheming for a way out or at least a way forward, it’s hard not to bounce along when it sounds as danceable as “KLOWN dance” or “LOOK @ GOD.”\n\nSkits and segues, including one particularly profane maternal voicemail, somewhat remind of the ones that dotted <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, yet the comparatively looser mixtape feel here allows the rising rapper more flexibility and freedom as he maneuvers through his oft-difficult subject matter. Still, the rather personal nature of songs like “FLAT shasta” and “JANKY moral COMPASS” aligns the rapper with some of his TDE colleagues, past and present.\n\nTo Vaughn’s credit, though, he avoids relying on flashy features for what amounts to a proper introduction to his boisterous-yet-confessional style. So when labelmate Isaiah Rashad rolls up for “EAST CHATT.” it makes that internal team-up all the more meaningful. By the time the tape wraps up with “SUBURBAN KIDZ,” a thought-provoking summation that touches on themes of addiction and faith, Vaughn’s proverbial star seems well worth ascending.","short":"Top Dawg
