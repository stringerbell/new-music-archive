You Asked For A Picture","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Blondshell","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After the reception to her 2023 self-titled debut as Blondshell, it’s no surprise that Sabrina Teitelbaum’s follow-up, <i>If You Asked for a Picture</i>, came together while she was quite literally on the move. “I was touring a lot, so I was in a lot of new places and just writing about what was going on,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I didn’t have the intention of making an album, but when I got home, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m going to start demoing these songs.’” The resulting 12 tracks may have come together casually, but <i>If You Asked for a Picture</i> is a fuller and richer evocation of the Blondshell sound, pairing spiky ’90s alternative rock sounds with acerbic couplets. \n\nAlong with longtime studio collaborator Yves Rothman (Kim Gordon, Yves Tumor), Teitelbaum adds subtle sonic flourishes to her winning sound—peep the

Who else could write an introspective exploration of living with OCD, as Teitelbaum does on the explosive “Toy,” and sneak in a withering line like, “I’ve been running this ship like the Navy/But it’s more like a Wendy’s”?

Subsequent releases saw the band incorporate elements of hip-hop, soul, and even opera into their sound, managing to both hold on to their original, trilby-sporting fanbase and attract an entirely new generation of fans. For their seventh album, however, the band wanted to shake off the expectations of a two-decade career and approach it in much the same way as their first.\n\nWhile <i>Never/Know</i> recaptures that carefree, bushy-tailed spirit, it’s a far cry from scruffy, early-2000s indie rock. Also serving as the album’s producer, singer/guitarist Luke Pritchard embraces an eclectic and inventive palette of styles and sonic tricks—be it the breezy New Wave skank of “Sunny Baby,” “All Over the World”’s collision of breakbeats, Serge Gainsbourg basslines, and Studio 54 swirls, or a sparkling cover of Wings’ 1979 track “Arrow Through Me” (as an indicator of the group’s self-preserving attitude towards notions of “cool,” Wings and The Police are the two most obvious touchstones throughout). Ultimately though, as it was on our first introduction, it’s Pritchard’s winsome melodies that charm the most.","short":"Former indie-pop tyros recapture past spirit while exploring fresh terrain."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8a/e6/2b/8ae62bfc-8211-add9-ac64-0ceac6359945/198704242687_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"500600","textColor4":"6a2f2a","textColor1":"0b0b0b","bgColor":"d2d2d2","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-know/1779151946","playParams":{"id":"1779151946","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ifWQZN7li3ij532LR1l0q"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779151946/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"68448386","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/68448386?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746763511046}}},"1780628866":{"id":"1780628866","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780628866?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tvod/1489892923","name":"Party Time","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"TVOD","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ab/0c/b2/ab0cb27c-c964-da47-5f3b-f4238ee1dc4d/198846847825.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f3c39","textColor2":"181913","textColor4":"464742","textColor1":"100b08","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/party-time/1780628866","playParams":{"id":"1780628866","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7goMU0Lik5tZKdZURQuxEd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780628866/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1489892923","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1489892923?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746765463129}}},"1784720574":{"id":"1784720574","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784720574?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/84/86/958486af-6204-1f34-f97a-15cb431b0216/e7813c2d-ba7c-48cc-95b4-674dc3866f78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"594b41","textColor2":"3b2f26","textColor4":"60564f","textColor1":"322014","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rebecca-vasmant/267369206","name":"Who We Are, Becoming","artistName":"Rebecca Vasmant","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Rebecca Vasmant’s passionate long-term investment in Glasgow’s burgeoning jazz scene pays off on <i>Who We Are, Becoming</i>, the gauzy, dreamlike second studio album from the multihyphenate producer.

That Makes Sense","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Spacey Jane","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I wanted to make a record that was not going to be anything like what we’d done and something we couldn’t make in Australia,” vocalist/guitarist Caleb Harper tells Apple Music about Spacey Jane’s third album. It’s the sound of a band venturing outside their comfort zone. \n\nSuch a goal doesn’t come without a little hardship. Relocating to Los Angeles to make the album, some of the issues the West Australian four-piece faced were practical, like figuring out how to get a rental without credit history. Others were artistic, with Harper learning how to work with outside writers such as Sarah Aarons (“Whateverrrr,” “How to Kill Houseplants”) for the first time. “All of those things felt new and foreign and scary,” he says. “I hear it lyrically. I feel this vulnerability and some confusion.”\n\nShepherding the band through the process was producer Mike Crossey (The 1975, Arctic Monkeys), with whom Spacey Jane spent 12 weeks tracking the record. Given that they dedicated 18 months to writing the LP—which incorporates synths (“Falling Apart”) and even a piano-led ballad (“Ily the Most”) into their indie-guitar arsenal—<i>If That Makes Sense</i> accounts for roughly two years of the band’s life. “It’s the most work we’ve put into a record,” says Harper.\n\nThe singer’s upbringing is a recurring lyrical theme and the album’s title is a response to the emotional complexity. “It’s the last line on the last song of the record,” he offers. “It’s representative of this idea of saying all these things and then discounting it with ‘if that makes sense.’” Here, Harper takes Apple Music through <i>If That Makes Sense</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Intro”</b>\n“On ‘Through My Teeth’ there are all these little peddling arpeggio guitars and synths, and we had 20 of them that we whittled down to four or five. Mike was playing around with them one day, just in isolation, and I filmed it with my phone. A month later, I said to Mike, ‘Listen to this, how cool was this on its own?’ So the intro is actually that audio ripped from the iPhone video and then it blends into all those voice memos of me writing the music over the preceding two years.”\n\n<b>“Through My Teeth”</b>\n“It’s about the identity crisis I felt when I was 17, 18, and just being a mess and feeling like people don’t know who I am anymore. I’m this person to this new group of people I’ve met and I’m unrecognizable to the people I’m leaving behind, and it’s all through the lens of this fucked-up little kid running around getting drunk, which was essentially me.”\n\n<b>“Whateverrrr”</b>\n“Sarah [Aarons] and I [wrote the title] like that when we were texting back and forth. It’s just stupid, how a kid might write it or say it. That ties into the song—it’s a kid being like, ‘Whatever, but I’ll think of you forever.’ It’s this awful sense of, there’s things that you can’t control that are so far away from you now as an adult that are like the foundation of who you are as a person. It’s like a reflection on family life, and it’s this juxtaposition of running through the sprinklers but something’s dark, something feels fucked up, and when you look back on it you can’t quite balance the two experiences.”\n\n<b>“All the Noise”</b>\n“It’s an attempt at [reflecting on my parents’ split] without putting any extra research into it. It’s what I’ve heard about what happened and what that may be. This was quite an angry sounding song, but it’s anger at not knowing. It’s not directed at anyone.”\n\n<b>“Impossible to Say”</b>\n“Sonically, we were thinking about Beck a bit. None of us are really Beck fans, but Mike was like, ‘Listen to a couple of these songs, that’s a cool direction.’ Having Ashton [Hardman-Le Cornu, guitarist] on the acoustic guitar is a rarity, in fact it’s the first time. He might have played a few bits on acoustic [in the past] that made their way into songs, but he’s on acoustic that whole song, which feels pretty different, and it’s a really exciting dynamic for us.”\n\n<b>“How to Kill Houseplants”</b>\n“It’s the idea that you try and give everything to this plant, this relationship—the right amount of love or sunlight or water or not enough—and it seems like you just keep fucking killing it despite your best intentions.”\n\n<b>“I Can’t Afford to Lose You”</b>\n“It’s a pretty simple love song, and [it’s about] trying not to screw something up. I wrote it on a tour bus in Denver and basically finished it in a couple of hours when the band were out doing some stuff. There’s not much to unpack there. It is what it is on face value.”\n\n<b>“So Much Taller”</b>\n“I’m lucky to be in a place of much better self-love than I was when I was still figuring out life. It’s about that. That kind of sums up the song in a lot of ways, and feeling like you’re constantly succumbing to a darkness and a cloud that is just there.”\n\n<b>“The More That it Hurts”</b>\n“I wrote it with Jackson Phillips, who goes by Day Wave, and he loves weird tunings. The guitars are so detuned. We just really liked that chorus. It goes chorus, verse, chorus, and then bridge and chorus, and so the goal was really to make the rest of the song work around those three choruses. Which was really fun.” \n\n<b>“Estimated Delivery”</b>\n“That song had a splice sample of what is essentially a breakbeat groove, and then we recreated the drums through 30 different layers. Kieran [Lama, drummer] plays a simplified version of it acoustically, and we have two drum machines running two separate loops. Then you slam all that together and run it through a tape machine. It took two days to make that drum beat. That’s the kind of shit you get up to when you have three months.”\n\n<b>“Falling Apart”</b>\n“Sometimes there’s a propensity to blame who you are and what you do on things that happened to you in the past, and I hate when people do that. But it’s basically what I’m doing in this song.”\n\n<b>“Ily the Most”</b>\n“Way out of my comfort zone. It’s a piano ballad, which we’ve never done before. It’s a hard song for me to sing, it’s pushing my range a lot of the time, and it’s a really raw, pop vocal right at the front. It’s just a love song, tied in with the fear of losing someone. That’s an important part of it. I love you, but fuck, I’m probably going to lose you.”\n\n<b>“August”</b>\n“That song is like the closing of a chapter in my life. I started writing it in September 2022, and I didn’t finish the lyrics until March 2024. It spans essentially the whole process of making the record and took on new meanings, from a letter to my family, to then a partner, all these chapters. I was also moving out of my house in LA, I’d packed everything up, I was surrounded by boxes, it was the last day of vocals, of any tracking, and I was just crying in the studio finishing those last lines. It all culminated in this quite emotional moment.”","short":"“It’s the most work we’ve put into a record,” says Caleb

life-goes-on resilience that has been the bedrock of hip-hop from the beginning. That said, <i>GOLLIWOG</i> is probably the most out-and-out unsettling album he’s made yet, a smear of synth rumbles, creaky pianos, and horror-movie strings whose dissonances amplify scenes of otherwise ordinary dread, whether it’s the Black artist trying to charm the boardroom of white executives on “Cold Sweat” or prolonged eviction scene of “BLK XMAS.” Now in his mid-forties, woods is confident enough in his critique to make you squirm in it and has a rolodex of some of the best producers in underground rap to back him up, including Kenny Segal, El-P, Conductor Williams, and DJ Haram.

Recorded with his band Upendo (including players Woody has known since middle school), <i>For the Love of It All</i> wraps the collective intensity of early ’70s post-bop into pieces that feel both driving and remarkably smooth (“Beyond the Reach of Our Eyes”), rhythmically dense but melodically appealing (“Real Love Pt. 1,” “Perseverance”), funky and polyrhythmic and inclusive of influences beyond traditional jazz while still retaining jazz’s grounding origins as music of (and about) everyday life (“Wisdom; Terrace on St. Paul St.”). The eclecticism is refreshingly gimmick-free. And he makes vulnerability sound like power, which it is.","short":"A fiery, joyful debut from a highly touted trumpet player and his band."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/59/34/4f/59344f47-d433-72ee-0d44-ef4ec12c56da/24UM1IM43090.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"beb9b3","textColor2":"aadbe2","textColor4":"91b1b5","textColor1":"e3e5df","bgColor":"2e0a05","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-the-love-of-it-all/1794692929","playParams":{"id":"1794692929","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Ug4LyNXrVc7W1B4qZlKG4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794692929/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1797607397","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1797607397?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746786318489}}},"1794827304":{"id":"1794827304","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794827304?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laibach/19515616","name":"Alamut","artistName":"Laibach","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9c/73/2d/9c732dd5-ad5e-0de3-b3b9-db62ef0c9338/5400863142766.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"d4d774","textColor2":"fcdc6c","textColor4":"dec161","textColor1":"f0f883","bgColor":"675538","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alamut/1794827304","playParams":{"id":"1794827304","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7pWTtRA801TLiHv35E54Oq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794827304/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"19515616","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/19515616?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746764810656}}},"1795051777":{"id":"1795051777","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795051777?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alien-boy/1110500741","name":"You Wanna Fade?","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Alien Boy","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/03/f9/d4/03f9d4f1-dd6b-daa6-feec-88c0a72f0c35/112886.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"303340","textColor2":"09313f","textColor4":"2e505e","textColor1":"0c0d1b","bgColor":"c3cdd7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-wanna-fade/1795051777","playParams":{"id":"1795051777","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5U51CwRUXkYgYjeIaWUaGb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795051777/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1110500741","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1110500741?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746767402841}}},"1795140211":{"id":"1795140211","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795140211?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2d/e2/ff/2de2ff86-7ff9-bdfb-389a-5da32d4dc95f/Jobf5c8e586-817f-4356-9516-1cdeaa34f444-185508174-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362977454_2049131904-Time1739201517596.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","a3c7e0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"aababe","textColor2":"a3c7e0","textColor4":"85a1b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/70/12/82/701282a4-713e-de8e-6f1c-6416dd76a4ea/7c17e9a0-57f3-4735-a1a5-008516d848ef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ad9988","textColor2":"d4b393","textColor4":"aa8f76","textColor1":"d8bfaa","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/50/73/f0/5073f0a9-5015-de55-0262-3d2281dbceb7/Job20ce0052-8e91-4784-829a-5d8575603ba2-185508175-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362977455_2049131905-Time1739202874510.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"97afbc","textColor2":"8cb8d9","textColor4":"7597b0","textColor1":"b7d5e7","bgColor":"1a1710","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-head-and-the-heart/380045979","name":"Aperture","artistName":"The Head and the Heart","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"As it so often does, success scrambled the songwriting process for The Head and The Heart. When they bloomed at the intersection of folk-rock and indie rock 15 years ago, having inked a deal with the powerhouse Sub Pop, they wrote, worked, and recorded as a band, everyone in a room putting pieces together. But major labels, major producers, and major life changes steadily encroached on that approach, sometimes prompting Jonathan Russell to write and arrange in a silo. It worked for a spell, but tension began to show in the seams, leading to records that could occasionally feel forced and band members that sometimes questioned their own roles.\n\nThat all changes on <i>Aperture</i>, which began with a return to that earlier strategy, with assorted members sequestering together for sessions that let them explore new territory as one. Folks who had never written offered material, and still others stepped up to the microphone. They produced the songs themselves, too, an atavism that afforded the songs renewed urgency. “Arrow” sounds like a cascading The Head and The Heart classic that’s always been here, while “Jubilee” swings and shimmers like their old labelmates The Shins.\n\nBut they also suggest a band reborn, from the bounding piano pop of “Fire Escape” to the self-effacing candor of “Cop Car.” The ballads are balletic and astounding, too. “Blue Embers” gathers slowly—indeed, like smoke—as harmonies lift a tune about forgiveness of one’s own faults. And “Finally Free,” the sole tune that Charity Rose Thielen leads, is astounding here, her voice curling like Karen Dalton, forever in search of some new horizon. <i>Aperture</i> ends with its title track, the thesis statement serving as a triumphant final statement of purpose. “Come alive, come alive, come alive,” they sing in unison near the close. “What does it feel like?”","short":"Indie-folk stalwarts, reborn with a new sense of purpose and urgency."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/8c/e5/128ce5f9-097c-3a8b-9e7d-694c0341af8f/25UMGIM03147.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9eb9c1","textColor2":"add7e5","textColor4":"91b1ba","textColor1":"bee1ed","bgColor":"211a10","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aperture/1795140211","playParams":{"id":"1795140211","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5wyhyzvoRACvYCIyYr9vQM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795140211/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"380045979","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/380045979?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746774936791}}},"1795539149":{"id":"1795539149","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795539149?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/counting-crows/35719","name":"Butter Miracle, The Complete Sweets!","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Counting Crows","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“It’s about broken lives becoming something better,” Counting Crows founder Adam Duritz has said of “Spaceman in Tulsa,” the seesaw between despair and aspiration that arrives early on his band’s first album in a decade, <i>Butter Miracle, the Complete Sweets!</i>. Duritz has undergone a personal transformation of his own during the interim. Not only did he lop off his trademark dreadlocks, but several years into his fifties, he also started the longest romantic relationship of his life. He’s managing lifelong mental illness perhaps better than he ever has too. And so, <i>Butter Miracle</i> radiates urgency and vibrancy, as if Duritz has returned to his mid-’90s prime with the wisdom of a renewed perspective.\n\nDuritz composed <i>Butter Miracle</i> during separate stints on a friend’s remote farm in the English countryside. After flirting with long-form composition on 2014’s “Palisades Park,” he submitted to that ambition by building four interconnected pieces that feel like a summary of the band’s enduring strengths. Where the heroic climax of “The Tall Grass” summons the power and yearning of 1996’s <i>Recovering the Satellites</i>, “Bobby and the Rat-Kings” has the summertime essence of 2002’s <i>Hard Candy</i>. These are, like the best Crows songs, statements of possibility and belief, of peering out of darkness. \n\nThe band originally released that material in 2021 as an EP but remixed it to match Duritz’s next batch, which includes his most direct and winning songs in decades. Opener “With Love, from A-Z” is an intellectually sprawling celebration of his new romance, while the moody piano epic “Virginia Through the Rain” documents the soft sting of lingering regret, even as broken lives indeed become something better. “We are evolving/In night to morning,” Duritz opines during “Under the Aurora,” the sort of emotional epic that’s forever been this band’s calling card. “And I want to believe in something/Spun out of darkness/Somewhere under the aurora.”","short":"The band’s first album in a decade shows off some hard-earned

vs. The Machine","artistName":"Eric Church","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Though its tracklist is compact in comparison, Eric Church’s follow-up to his ambitious 2021 triple album <i>Heart & Soul</i> is no less potent than its predecessor. <i>Evangeline vs. The Machine</i>, produced by longtime collaborator Jay Joyce, finds country music’s favorite Chief fearlessly commenting on current events and sharing vulnerable moments, doing so with all the style and swagger that fans have come to love and expect. Church tells Apple Music he believes <i>Evangeline vs. The Machine</i> is “the most creative album” he’s ever made, thanks in part to his decision to bring an orchestra into the recording studio. The resulting sound is rich and often surprising, with an expansive nature that mimics the big, complex themes Church explores in his lyrics.\n\n“There’s a tension that strings and vocals provide that you can’t get from a guitar, you can’t get from a keyboard, just because of the mechanism of the way they’re moving their arms,” he says. “There’s a tension. They can create drama. And a lot of this record has drama. I think that it almost sounds like a soundtrack. It sounds like a movie soundtrack.”\n\nOpening track “Hands of Time,” an ode to the healing power of music and a rebuke of outgrowing youthful abandon, takes that cinematic feel and infuses it with the kind of crunchy heartland sound that made songs like “Drink in My Hand” and “Springsteen” smash hits. “Johnny” refers not to Cash but to the hell-fighting hero of Charlie Daniels’ classic “The Devil Went Down to Georgia,” with Church pleading for the fictional fiddler to grab his bow and “send him to hell again.” Church wrote the emotional ballad, which makes the most of Church’s orchestra, after the 2023 Covenant School shooting in Nashville, which claimed the lives of three children and three adults. “Darkest Hour” also finds Church responding to recent events, as he released the poignant song ahead of the album to raise funds for victims of Hurricane Helene in 2024. And “Evangeline” is Church’s personification of the creative muse, who is ever at odds with the machine of capitalism. Below, Church shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Bleed on Paper”</b>\n“‘Bleed on paper,’ that is selling your soul. You’re never going to get that back. A lot of young artists, they don’t know that. They don’t have a choice. And I think that that’s what gets hard. Staying true to [yourself] is the biggest challenge, I think for not just country music, but for music as we go forward in this river that is just so flooded with crap. How do you swim in that? And I think that that’s the hardest thing. If I was a young artist right now, that would be a challenge.”\n\n<b>“Johnny”</b>\n“The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life as a parent was dropping my kids off the day after the shooting. They went to school and everybody thought it was good to go back to school and get the kids. And I understood that, but that’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. And I sat in the parking lot a while. I was about to drive back home, and ‘The Devil Went Down to Georgia’ came on. There’s that line, ‘Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard/Hell’s broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards/And if you win, you get a shiny fiddle made of gold/If you lose, the devil gets your soul.’ And I remember that line hit and I was like, ‘God, we need Johnny, because the devil’s not in Georgia, he’s here. He’s everywhere and he’s winning.’”\n\n<b>“Darkest Hour”</b>\n“In ‘Darkest Hour,’ first time we went through it, in the back half of that song, there’s a flute. And it’s a flute that sounds like a baby elephant is throwing his trunk from the right to the left. The track was going really well, and all of a sudden that came in and I lost it. I stopped the entire orchestra. I said, ‘Was that a flute?’ And then there’s a girl that was playing and I said, ‘No, that’s great.’ I said, ‘I didn’t see that coming.’ And so it’s just one of those things where you have these moments that I would never have conceived, I would never have thought about, but you’re actually going to these people who are really talented people and you’re playing the song and you’re going, ‘Okay, now you paint on this picture.’”\n\n<b>“Evangeline”</b>\n“Evangeline, to me, in this record represents creativity, and the machine is the things we deal with now that push against or round off that creativity. Evangeline is the muse for creativity in this album. And everything in our world right now is going to push against that.

A decade later, the 26-year-old singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist has amassed a die-hard fanbase for his vibey, lo-fi pop in which he draws from doo-wop, psych rock, and norteño and often lapses into Spanglish (as on his breakout single, 2017’s “Lo Que Siento”). “When I was first putting out music, I was always just trying to release—I didn’t necessarily have a timeline or an idea of what I wanted to do,” Cuco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But as everything became a little more established, I feel like taking the time to put together projects that felt cohesive would be worth taking the time.”\n\nHis third album, <i>Ridin’</i>, is a love letter to his hometown of Los Angeles—specifically, its Mexican American car culture. It’s also a callback to the old Chicano soul music he’s loved since he was little. “ICNBYH” feels beamed in from an AM radio broadcast circa the early ’70s, with its easygoing swirl of brass and woodwinds. Far from the Ableton experiments of his teenage bedroom, here he’s joined by a team of first-rate instrumentalists, from The Roots’ trumpeter Dave Guy (who appears on “My Old Friend”) to producer Thomas Brenneck, who’s worked with everyone from Amy Winehouse to Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. “It could be riding with the whips, riding for your people, riding through the motions of life,” Cuco says of the album’s title. Still, it’s built to be played in the car with the windows down.","short":"A love letter to LA’s car culture, built to be played with the windows

Recreational Use Only","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Blake Shelton","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The Oklahoma native was arguably the most visible country musician of the 2010s, thanks to a record-breaking string of Billboard Country Airplay No. 1s and a 12-year stint as a coach on <i>The Voice</i>, during which he met his wife, Gwen Stefani. But as Blake Shelton tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, filming two seasons of <i>The Voice</i> per year left him feeling out of the loop as far as the Nashville scene. “By the time that those 12 years went by, all of a sudden it was like, man, I’ve gotten old now,” the 48-year-old singer admits. “You finally start looking at a chart, and you’re like, who the hell is Morgan Wallen? Who’s Luke Combs? It was like there was this whole new generation of artists who had taken over country music, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m one of the old guys now.’”\n\nNearly 25 years after breaking through with his 2001 debut single, “Austin” (and four years after his last full-length, 2021’s <i>Body Language</i>), Shelton wondered whether there was still room for him on the country charts. “If I do put out a new record, are they going to play it? Are the fans waiting on it?” he recounts thinking. “Those are natural, normal things to think if you’re being honest with yourself, and I try to be.” \n\nOn his 13th studio album, <i>For Recreational Use Only</i>, he puts those feelings into songs that sound like the Blake Shelton you know—a sincere storyteller who prides himself on his performance—but still swings for the fences here and there. Lead single “Texas” is a lost-love number that nods to George Strait’s “All My Ex’s Live in Texas” and channels the minor-key melodrama of Ronnie Milsap’s “Stranger in My House.” And “Let Him in Anyway,” co-written by HARDY, allows Shelton to get existential, grappling with grief, God, and the afterlife.\n\nLooking back at his early career, Shelton remembers being elated and terrified at once, worried his success would disappear overnight. “I loved it so much that I couldn’t be comfortable that it wouldn’t be gone someday,” he says. “It was all I ever wanted to be: one of the guys that I was hearing on the radio. I didn’t even know how to do it, and the fact that it was happening, it was like, I want to hang on to this forever. And here we are, 25 years later.”","short":"A giant of 2010s country reclaims his spot: “I’m one of the old guys

In Arcadia","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sleep Token","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Will you listen?” Sleep Token vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Vessel asks on “Look to Windward,” the opening track from the band’s fourth album. Once again, the masked British phenoms seamlessly blend genres as the song goes from <i>Kid A</i>-era Radiohead to modern R&B to cinematic strings to an explosive metal riff. By now, fans have come to expect these kinds of dramatic shifts from the anonymous group, but <i>Even in Arcadia</i> isn’t just more of the same. It’s an expansion, the widening of an already impressive palette.\n\n“Emergence” offers the gospel refrain “Go ahead and wrap your arms around me” before Vessel raps over a loop of a trilling guitar and then weaves in and out of a beefy nu metal riff. “Dangerous” is probably the closest Sleep Token has come to pure Deftones, a band they’ve referenced, sonically and melodically, on previous albums. “Past Self” takes a more straight-ahead R&B approach, but with a vocal melody that echoes back on itself to create a disorienting stereo effect.\n\nMelancholy single “Damocles” references classic Greek mythology and seems to address Vessel’s personal struggles with fame and staying anonymous: “Nobody told me I’d get tired of myself/When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell.” “Caramel” might have a similar theme (“Wear me out like Prada, devil in my detail,” Vessel sings), but does it with a syncopated xylophone rhythm that drops into another Chino Moreno-like vocal melody over a tsunami of distorted guitars and a purgative nu metal beatdown.\n\n“Provider” channels neo-soul master D’Angelo as Vessel manages to rhyme “ICU” with “I see you” before the full-metal bridge kicks in. Closer “Infinite Baths” unfurls like an extended meditation in the eye of the storm until the inevitable screaming metal barrage—the longest and most ferocious on the album—takes over. And then it fades into the shadows again, just like the band itself.\n","short":"A daring expansion of the mysterious UK band’s already sprawling palette."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/45/76/46/457646e0-7bba-770b-f18c-12f7b479dca6/196872847215.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3b9bf","textColor2":"d5d6db","textColor4":"b8b9bd","textColor1":"e3d6dd","bgColor":"434345","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/even-in-arcadia/1800532611","playParams":{"id":"1800532611","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800532611/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1153723033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1153723033?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746789893386}}},"1801610220":{"id":"1801610220","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801610220?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Indie Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f2/24/07/f22407e3-45c4-2526-e2bb-fc1cf4790713/Job627e61ac-ed96-4c5d-a6c5-05f0bae69063-190822975-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373699220_2131313493-Time1745365614632.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","44a0eb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c9c8c7","textColor2":"44a0eb","textColor4":"3a84c2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ae/32/47/ae3247c7-f5d7-75e0-9eec-394fdd03ff91/192e986e-a4db-43a8-8b7c-95367a728f50.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9ab1c0","textColor2":"97b8c9","textColor4":"7c96a4","textColor1":"bcd9ec","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ba/4f/23/ba4f2371-afb1-9ba7-9968-0268f8655a18/Job095e290d-c3dd-4691-9c38-45744c8aaee7-190822974-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373699221_2131313492-Time1745364714847.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f1d7b6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c4c8cc","textColor2":"f1d7b6","textColor4":"c3af94","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/43/9c/93/439c9359-e44b-8f8b-4d43-52b1f028067a/eaca6571-c894-410c-9f1a-b8fa089dc6a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"312e27","textColor2":"1a1d20","textColor4":"383531","textColor1":"111413","bgColor":"b09875","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/96/09/2e/96092e56-aace-45dc-c368-1113c6c18f60/4e543ca0-4ad2-4554-ac8d-5ddbf5ffb2d8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a493b6","textColor2":"bb96d6","textColor4":"977aad","textColor1":"ccb6e2","bgColor":"080808","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/briston-maroney/418604503","name":"JIMMY","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Briston Maroney","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Briston Maroney has never shied away from the surreal. He titled his 2023 sophomore album <i>Ultrapure</i>, a word he made up to try to articulate the feeling of transcendence that can accompany moments of intense beauty or pain. That record retained the grungy roots of its predecessor, 2021’s <i>Sunflower</i>, while spreading out a bit sonically, making space for some of Maroney’s weirder musical impulses to shine through. On his third full-length, <i>JIMMY</i>, Maroney realizes a fuller artistic vision by reconciling his folkier roots with his more psychedelic inclinations, making for an engaging, often surprising listen. Narratively, the record digs into his split adolescence: After his parents divorced when he was a teenager, he spent half of his time in Knoxville, Tennessee, with his father and half in Florida with his mother, seeming to inhabit two different characters in the process. \n\n<i>JIMMY</i>, named for an eclectic Floridian neighbor, is an attempt at integration, as evinced by the trippy cover art, which finds Maroney’s face literally split down the middle. The record opens with its title track, a noisy and plaintive intro that sounds like the inside of a perpetually buzzing brain. “Tomatoes” pairs a tight pop melody with fuzzed-out guitar and a strange, playful little breakdown about picking out a plot at a graveyard. “Real Good Swimmer” is urgent and hallucinatory in its invocations of rivers and seas, while “Sunsetter” takes similarly natural imagery and dips into existential anxiety. Maroney closes the project with “Be Yourself,” an impassioned garage-rocker whose title also serves as the album’s thesis statement.","short":"His third album integrates his folkier roots with his psychedelic inclinations."},"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0c/38/40/0c384024-0015-379f-62f6-2d04d6ae5905/075679619976.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1424,"textColor3":"c8c3c0","textColor2":"f1d7b7","textColor4":"c2ac92","textColor1":"faf4f0","bgColor":"030000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jimmy/1801610220","playParams":{"id":"1801610220","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6arrf9ns34fhkAgAba64Ml"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801610220/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"418604503","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/418604503?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746783133413}}},"1801611607":{"id":"1801611607","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801611607?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/87/7f/e8/877fe8bc-d3f7-02fc-813e-3be23f2538e6/Job44eb8068-97df-455e-81e1-ee7c291dc5e7-191550971-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375080237_2142604313-Time1746114955836.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","de8f6c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0a0809"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b28d7e","textColor2":"de8f6c","textColor4":"b57559","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0a0809","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/da/e5/01dae562-930e-ceee-4d38-3985be5b8d9e/44871828-56e1-4f65-991d-882c34765caa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9966e","textColor2":"d2b18e","textColor4":"ac9175","textColor1":"e4b786","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d0/51/2e/d0512e9e-64f9-86b8-45d0-64d178cb6c28/Jobe92fed42-a7f0-40b9-8e50-2b7c311f9487-191550972-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375080236_2142604314-Time1746116038556.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","daa07a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0a0809"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bca998","textColor2":"daa07a","textColor4":"b18264","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0a0809","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9a/12/28/9a122839-225d-39bd-7371-8a577b405112/28b1d10b-a14a-4e36-9d31-23728031c17c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c87c56","textColor2":"ef774e","textColor4":"c76745","textColor1":"f09263","bgColor":"262424","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/isaiah-falls/1607911349","name":"LVRS PARADISE (SIDE A)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Isaiah Falls","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“You ever been to paradise, baby?” Isaiah Falls asks on “FOR LVRS ONLY,” the sensual opener to <i>LVRS PARADISE (SIDE A)</i>.

Alongside Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, Daniel Lanois—a fellow Canadian who has applied a near-magical touch to records by U2, Bob Dylan, and Brian Eno for nearly half a century—co-produced the band’s seventh album, speckling it with stereo delays and assorted abstractions. In fact, that opener, “Open Your Heart or Die Trying,” is but one of three instrumentals on this 10-track record. Where “Beyond Salvation” embeds scrambled samples amid a fantastic glissando, “She Cries Diamond Rain” is a celestial hum.\n\nThese wordless pieces from the famously righteous Montreal-based outfit suggest a band trying to reimagine its future in the present, trying to feel its way forward after personnel and personal complications since 2022’s <i>WE</i>. The title track is a web of misgivings, Butler looking at the world and making mental traps of everything he encounters. During first single “Year of the Snake,” Lanois calls back to several of the techniques he used to make <i>The Joshua Tree</i> feel both anxious and epic as Chassagne and Butler deliver a fraught duet about where they head from here. “If you feel strange, it’s probably good,” they repeat, alternately delivering that last line like it soothes or stings. \n\nThey experiment with a handful of new modes here, from the dark dancing of “Circle of Trust” to the arcing acoustic grandeur of “Ride or Die.” But they finally dig into their bygone glory days for closer “Stuck in My Head,” where throbbing bass and unrelenting drums push Butler to deal with his baggage, to figure out what happens next. “Clean up your head/Get the fuck out of bed,” he shouts over and over at the climax, like Springsteen stuck in a punk paroxysm. “Clean up your heart.”\n","short":"With a hand from Daniel Lanois, the Canadian band reimagines its future."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/08/dd/f7/08ddf748-8c27-c083-bebd-f610d33c1b27/196872846362.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"edbdcd","textColor2":"fed9b7","textColor4":"f2b2a2","textColor1":"f8e7ed","bgColor":"c0134f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pink-elephant/1801683602","playParams":{"id":"1801683602","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5qLTlCTZvN24Fm1nqd7XCV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801683602/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"23203991","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/23203991?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746783187238}}},"1801973355":{"id":"1801973355","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801973355?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sami-galbi/1716897614","name":"Ylh Byebye","artistName":"Sami Galbi","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"His debut album is a playful, futuristic North African pop trip."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bb/b1/03/bbb103f9-c1b9-2a7e-e978-e610901ad987/4062548112801.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"85aac0","textColor2":"f9b054","textColor4":"cd9345","textColor1":"9fcced","bgColor":"1f210c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ylh-byebye/1801973355","playParams":{"id":"1801973355","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1OhibtA3cqMeM84WfNTUoW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801973355/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1716897614","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1716897614?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746523394978}}},"1802229588":{"id":"1802229588","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802229588?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anslee-davidson/1581819046","name":"The Dorm Room Sessions -

Since then, the Texas-born singer-songwriter (who moved to Nashville in her twenties at the behest of her pal Kacey Musgraves) has purposefully distanced herself from the Music City machine, mocking the industry’s conservatism on 2023’s “The Tree” and promoting 2024’s <i>Intermission</i> EP explicitly as pop. The five tracks from that EP appear alongside nine new ones on Morris’ fourth album, <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>—an even bolder departure from her country roots.\n\nFor both <i>Intermission</i> and <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>, Morris veered away from Music Row and towards a crack team of pop songwriters (among them Julia Michaels, Tobias Jesso Jr., and MUNA). There’s no mistaking lead single “people still show up” for anything like country; instead, Morris sounds funkier than ever over a slow-simmering Jack Antonoff groove in celebration of the safety net friends provide after a breakup. “I wrote it back in early 2023, before a lot of my personal life stuff was imploding,” Morris tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, referring in part to her 2024 divorce. “So it was almost like this premonition of a song.”\n\nCatharsis comes up often: On the ’80s R&B throwback “cry in the car,” Morris extols the virtues of weeping at the wheel, and on the Julia Michaels duet “cut!” all the therapy and yoga in the world can’t match the release of a good scream session. And though “too good” might be the record’s twangiest moment, it’s also the pettiest: “Bitch, you still owe me rent!” Morris yowls to an ex, hoping that the couch they’re crashing on these days is comfy. “I don’t want perfection from my idols,” she tells Lowe. “I want them to be honest, as much as they’re willing to be. I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”\n","short":"A bold step further into pop: “I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9e/fe/a4/9efea436-6758-0c55-b271-b83f28c9aa68/196872746525.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e3a14a","textColor2":"feb039","textColor4":"e39a31","textColor1":"fdb858","bgColor":"794415","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/d-r-e-a-m-s-i-c-l-e/1802250617","playParams":{"id":"1802250617","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5KE34iOewqgS2DNW3fHyih"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802250617/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"262260873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/262260873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746783231871}}},"1802924846":{"id":"1802924846","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802924846?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pencil/1707230833","name":"Bohemian Clutter - EP","artistName":"pencil","artwork":{"width":4096,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/43/21/ee/4321ee99-ddfa-5961-d903-fbf0e587c3a2/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4096,"textColor3":"d8dbce","textColor2":"faf1e5","textColor4":"dcd5c7","textColor1":"f5f9ee","bgColor":"636550","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bohemian-clutter-ep/1802924846","playParams":{"id":"1802924846","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802924846/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1707230833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1707230833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746772740293}}},"1802977773":{"id":"1802977773","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802977773?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Christian","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/israel-new-breed/155653250","name":"Coritos, Vol. 1","artistName":"Israel & New Breed","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Live Album","short":"Latin worship classics get a modern overhaul on the live stage."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/1c/c7/9e1cc79d-00a5-a095-bd86-705f8e807527/0000768985557.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"bab7b8","textColor2":"e7d7db","textColor4":"c1b2b5","textColor1":"dededf","bgColor":"291e1d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/coritos-vol-1/1802977773","playParams":{"id":"1802977773","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4RpmmQce0dfnMpYF7UFbzC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802977773/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"155653250","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/155653250?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746753032852}}},"1803186824":{"id":"1803186824","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803186824?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ea/ac/58/eaac581d-1960-a9c7-10fd-1b52cf82fe88/ae52c40d-7eee-4992-97f3-01bb929bfb50.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c57047","textColor2":"ea795c","textColor4":"bc614b","textColor1":"f68c58","bgColor":"020204","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1253023714-1215471202","name":"Pinball II","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"MIKE & Tony Seltzer","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Like its 2024 predecessor <i>Pinball</i>, part of the appeal of <i>Pinball II</i> is hearing MIKE step out of the fog of his own introspection and do something a little more sociable.

The Colombian American singer-songwriter’s catalog has never felt slight or frivolous, whether in English or in Spanish. Yet this full-length follow-up to her 2024 <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i> dyad presents as something truly unique, arriving roughly a decade after her promising EP debut <i>Por Vida</i>. \n\nThe majority of the songs here began simply as voice notes, fortuitously captured in inspired moments outside of the confines or pressures of a studio setting. “Messages would just feel like they were directly coming through me, and I just had to get them out,” she says. Given such natural creative origins, it should come as little surprise that the actual process behind the album eschewed industry norms altogether, favoring home recording and unconventional settings. And despite the demonstrated level of guest vocal talent at her fingertips, she opted out of features, too. “When you’re making emotional music, you have to actually dig into difficult subjects,” she says, marking a clear distinction between this piece and its star-powered predecessor.\n\nAs a result, <i>Sincerely,</i> feels disarmingly intimate for what is ostensibly a pop album, even one from as consistently adventurous an artist as Uchis. The evocative moments of opener “Heaven Is a Home…” and closer “ILYSMIH” speak on love in grand and sweeping gestures, the passing of her mother and the birth of her son making understandably profound impacts on the work. \n\nInfluences like Cocteau Twins and Fiona Apple can be felt in all that comes between those bookends. “There’s a lot of grief, but there’s a lot of joy,” she says, describing what seeps through the veil of “Silk Lingerie,” or the vamps of “Territorial.” Excess punctuation on titles like “Lose My Cool,” and “For: You” hint at the flowing prose of her lyrics as it contributes to an even greater whole. “I think it is a celebration of life in its own way,” she says, “in the sense of finding beauty in the pain and taking the good.”\n","short":"Kali Uchis gets intimate: “I made the album I needed to heal myself.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/cb/cd/32cbcd1f-ca12-df86-e3ed-8ef0f7ac09e9/25UMGIM43974.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e1f1a","textColor2":"1e1519","textColor4":"382928","textColor1":"120807","bgColor":"a27c67","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sincerely/1804747038","playParams":{"id":"1804747038","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2XhNukk6jDysbSRL7VsqYb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804747038/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"894731301","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/894731301?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746803770472}}},"1805187844":{"id":"1805187844","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805187844?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/40/5e/6a/405e6a8b-0093-f839-f9cd-4d69fd4c907f/b3776a84-ae32-4d16-8db6-264caff044d3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c5bf","textColor2":"d89e6c","textColor4":"b08159","textColor1":"f2f3eb","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/10/36/1e/10361e1e-75db-92a5-9ae6-f5412eb3cb5c/05372770-cea6-4827-acbf-683473e41218.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"272726","textColor2":"0a0a09","textColor4":"272726","textColor1":"0a0a09","bgColor":"9b9b98","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hardy/1438874739","name":"COUNTRY! - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"HARDY","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The singer-songwriter born Michael Hardy grew up in Mississippi, living life like a country song; then he moved to Nashville to pen hits for the likes of Florida Georgia Line and Morgan Wallen before branching out as an artist in his own right.

Hence the buck on the wall of his grandpa’s hunting cabin, the girlfriends with guns, the cold ones cracked at 5 pm sharp.

With her EP <i>The Only Love We Know</i>, Sharon aims to exceed them, diving into the emotional complexity of moving on from experiences that no longer serve your happiness. Jordan Ullman (of R&B duo Majid Jordan fame) helms production with assists from talent such as Alex Lustig (Drake, Lil Wayne) and hitmaker Justin Tranter—who applies their polished pop pen to “Can We Do This Over”—crafting a solid base of intricate but spacious instrumentals for Sharon’s spotless vocals to build on. \n\n“Bittersweet” calls for her to echo and boom with rich reverb; with “Soft Like Dawn” she allows it to float and drift over a haunting bassline sweetened by soothing guitar riffs. Sharon saves the best for last, powering the dynamic energy of the title track with stacked choral harmonies that soar above the steady, linear percussion of the otherwise unobtrusive beat. <i>The Only Love We Know</i> may deal in the language of letting go, but Sharon’s arresting performances compel the listener to stick around for more.\n","short":"Peerless vocals, dramatic neo-soul

That","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"PinkPantheress","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since blowing up on TikTok in 2021, the English singer-producer has balanced polished pop ambitions with DIY experimentation. On one hand, dreamy wisps of drum and bass and garage that clocked in at under two minutes; on the other, runaway megahits like “Boy’s a liar” and its subsequent Ice Spice remix. It’s a line PinkPantheress has trod deftly between her debut mixtape, 2021’s <i>to hell with it</i>, and her first studio album, 2023’s <i>Heaven knows</i>. “Half of me really wants to be a very recognized and one day iconic musician,” she tells Apple Music. “And then part of me is also like, being an unsung hero seems cool, too.”\n\nShe maintains the balance on her sophomore mixtape, <i>Fancy That</i>—at once slick and eccentric, nostalgic and new, crisp but not too clean. Here she channels the euphoria of ’90s big-beat heavy-hitters like Fatboy Slim or Basement Jaxx, the latter of whom she samples frequently throughout (most pointedly on “Romeo,” a nod to the UK duo’s 2001 hit of the same name). \n\nBasement Jaxx’s first album, <i>Remedy</i>, was a major source of inspiration. “It blew me away, and I felt things that I hadn’t felt before,” she says. She’s honed her knack for reinterpretation since. “Stars” features her second sample of Just Jack’s “Starz in Their Eyes” (she previously used it on 2021’s “Attracted to You”), and on “Tonight,” she flips a 2008 Panic! At the Disco cut into a swooning house number. Tying it together are her ethereal vocals, cooing sweet nothings across the pond over a bassline from The Dare on “Stateside”: “Never met a British girl, you say?”\n\nAs for where she stands on the superstar/unsung hero spectrum, she’s willing to tilt in favor of the latter at the moment. “I’m very happy to have an album that is way more pensive and less appealing to virality,” she says. “The first project was underdeveloped, but hype and hard and cool. Second project was well done, cohesive. I’ve proved I can do both. Now I can go and do exactly what I want.”\n","short":"The TikTok sensation wrestles with her own ambition on her second mixtape."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/db/5a/12db5a38-94c1-42bc-b36b-7204b7aa4eac/5021732768650.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d9c9c9","textColor2":"e8e2c1","textColor4":"cfbaa0","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"6b1b1c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fancy-that/1806614239","playParams":{"id":"1806614239","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3o81FH5FTYVtoBQOZr3T7y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806614239/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552521489","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552521489?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746803160445}}},"1806728878":{"id":"1806728878","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806728878?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-06","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gable-price-and-friends/1441378212","name":"Post Credits Scenes -

Among those youthful yet skilled modern day practitioners of the dancefloor-primed style is Luis Figueroa, a Marc Anthony mentee who clearly understands how to balance the classic with the contemporary. Some four years after his impressive full-length <i>Canciones del Alma</i>, the singer shares an EP-length effort that artfully epitomizes what the sound has to offer listeners today.\n\nWell-crafted songs like “No Se Van (Ganas)” employ anticipatory openings that would otherwise invite a dembow thump, but instead unleash irresistible island polyrhythms. Naturally, he leans into the romantic bona fides of his chosen genre, making the yearning behind “Más Que Un Beso” all but tangible. The sole feature here comes from Figueroa’s fellow salsa sensation Christian Alicea, who adds his own undeniable flair to the standout duet “Si Llamas.”","short":"A glimpse of the modern salsa

FLORIDA'S FINEST","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"SAILORR","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"SAILORR, aka Jacksonville, Florida-raised Kayla Le, has built a world that is equal parts vulnerable and protected—sacred but open for visitors. On her full-length debut, she bridges these conflicting tendencies with ease, placing her diaristic songwriting and hilarious social commentary against a backdrop of smooth R&B and alt-pop. She moves from delicate croons that touch on her refusal to shave her legs for a bum partner to a Florida-inspired rap flow about soft-girl summers. Highs, lows, and seemingly every emotion in between: SAILORR owns them all on <i>FROM FLORIDA’S FINEST</i>.\n\nHer ability to convey these feelings so honestly and relatably comes from her unique perspective as a cultural commentator. “I think that, in general, memes play a large role in how we communicate with others,” she tells Apple Music. “It's a very universal thing. I really, really love just being able to be vulnerable with what I’m saying, but also kind of mask it with comedy.” Many of the lowest points of the album find SAILORR employing this “laugh to keep from crying” mentality. “That’s just how I deal with my own emotions. And so, if I can find a fun way to say something, I’ll do that,” she explains. \n\nSAILORR is never one to wallow in her despair, though, even on tracks like “DOWN BAD.” “I feel like genuinely that song just perfectly encapsulates what real love will do to a person,” she says. Despite the ecstasy of love, it was a real challenge for her to embody this mindset, which helps illustrate just how much SAILORR has grown since her emergence in 2023: “It’s actually so much easier to write a heartbreak song over a love song. I feel like it’s so much harder to be vulnerable in that way, to be like, ‘Oh, I’m in love, and I’m happy now.’”","short":"Her debut mixes vulnerability, humor: “That’s how I deal with my emotions.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5b/8d/67/5b8d67e1-f763-4f4d-5be5-0133b88c2bc8/810129978162.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"28213b","textColor2":"3f1308","textColor4":"543139","textColor1":"08000a","bgColor":"a7a9fe","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-floridas-finest/1809267067","playParams":{"id":"1809267067","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4KUlLprpCrNpRDsXC4MOAV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809267067/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1741604584","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1741604584?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746801269756}}},"1809282679":{"id":"1809282679","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809282679?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ad/74/31/ad74319b-5d98-bd8c-20f6-a93cf78abfaf/Jobce4d46a3-4adf-4354-89e7-184122070942-191473860-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374918104_2141372395-Time1746029328602.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fa5127"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c8411f","textColor2":"fa5127","textColor4":"c8411f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8d/d4/7b/8dd47b55-5fb7-b851-5217-f4f4c3af9087/Jobb9c0e480-f2d3-42bf-b5f7-34c03be5cfda-191473861-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374918103_2141372394-Time1746030679278.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ec4c23"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c9411e","textColor2":"ec4c23","textColor4":"bd3d1c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pierce-the-veil/258668501","name":"The Jaws Of Life (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Pierce the Veil","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/db/b0/70/dbb0700d-9916-48ef-d8a7-a29fec6e9f1f/24CRGIM43167.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c53c1d","textColor2":"ed4229","textColor4":"be3521","textColor1":"f64b24","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-jaws-of-life-deluxe/1809282679","playParams":{"id":"1809282679","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3pXReKEtUVjzaXLY6nissS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809282679/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"258668501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/258668501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746784221764}}},"1809453485":{"id":"1809453485","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809453485?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5e/9b/a0/5e9ba059-5f96-c7ec-9a37-b2a45814a0df/9b906a5a-ae74-4982-9b3c-305713222e4f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3f424a","textColor2":"23211f","textColor4":"4e4d4c","textColor1":"0f141e","bgColor":"fcfcfd","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grupo-firme/1086320682","name":"Evolución","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Grupo Firme","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"More than a decade into their storied career, Tijuana’s own Grupo Firme stand out for their innovative and, at times, unconventional takes on banda, norteño, and other música mexicana styles. Their propensity for collaboration, both within and beyond their presumed genre bounds, makes each single drop or guest appearance worth hearing. That said, <i>Evolución</i> finds Eduin Caz’s ensemble less concerned with features and cameos, instead focused on showcasing the oft boisterous sound of the band itself.\n\nThe lush arrangements of “Cero Sentimientos” almost mask the rage of its scorned protagonist, while “Quiere Llorar Y No Puede” sways to the oh-so-satisfied musings of its singer. There’s an arena-rock energy to “Luna,” its urgent lovelorn lyricism backed by big bluesy licks. Sinaloa songwriter Joss Favela lends his pen to a number of the tracks presented here, including “Alégale Al Umpire,” the bombastic yet tender “Hubiéramos,” and the co-headlined highlight “La Vida Es

REXDALE (DELUXE)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"NAV","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Rexdale is a neighborhood in Toronto, situated in the Etobicoke district, where NAV, the son of Punjabi parents, was born and raised. On the rap star’s fifth album, <i>OMW2 REXDALE</i>, the prodigal child returns to the place that gave him his grit, determination, and hustle. It marks his first project since <i>Demons Protected by Angels</i> in 2022 and finds NAV tapped into the subjects and production styles he introduced on his early projects. In that sense, these heartbroken and love-hungry songs are a return to NAV’s origins too. On opener “SINKING,” he finds himself trapped and alone, rapping, “No one hears my cries for help/My heart is slowly sinking, I’m all alone in this world.” Elsewhere, though, things get better as NAV outlines his rise from scrappy Toronto upstart to one of the biggest rappers in North America. On “BURBS,” he puts it simply enough, rapping, “Walk in the store, I spend a lot, what I’m makin’ is absurd.” The cash is all the sweeter because success was so hard-earned. He adds, “Used to spend all day in the projects, now I’m tucked up in the burbs.”","short":"The Toronto rapper reconnects with the spirit of his early work."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/04/1b/55/041b5509-482d-4376-b9e8-5e352f510985/25UMGIM59884.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdbab0","textColor2":"e2ddd0","textColor4":"b4b1a6","textColor1":"ede9dc","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/omw2-rexdale-deluxe/1810289467","playParams":{"id":"1810289467","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5E7Q6PZEvJQIGMYADlFra9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810289467/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1200089113","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1200089113?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746766809432}}},"1810331292":{"id":"1810331292","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810331292?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zoe-ko/1115846230","name":"still not ur girlfriend","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Zoe Ko","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b1/a7/66/b1a766fc-cdfc-dd7c-f9cf-8d9dc8973e3e/25UMGIM59470.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfc0ca","textColor2":"f6d1b8","textColor4":"c8a995","textColor1":"ebedfa","bgColor":"110c09","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-not-ur-girlfriend/1810331292","playParams":{"id":"1810331292","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3SxhS51jQH7FewYY5BY3CT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810331292/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1115846230","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1115846230?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746765048808}}},"1810341021":{"id":"1810341021","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810341021?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/48/f9/5a/48f95ac1-7488-5f62-4d24-c4d88af96017/Job8b9ad17c-f02c-458a-826e-e7d94f4a1ad6-191801140-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375583887_2147518429-Time1746463682057.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e5d29d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d2d0d0","textColor2":"e5d29d","textColor4":"beac81","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/3b/f4/303bf426-5841-a4b0-c630-ec1dc132e3f2/8e273bb5-5c09-4705-a70a-201749a4f926.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4b592","textColor2":"deb083","textColor4":"be946e","textColor1":"e6d8b0","bgColor":"3e2719","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/64/e4/2d/64e42db0-8fcf-26c7-d7b5-494a7bf5f189/Job1aa7ace8-e7a2-4ddb-bf3a-fbbbfc492ff2-191801141-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375583616_2147518430-Time1746464621500.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e4d3a6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d3cfce","textColor2":"e4d3a6","textColor4":"beac87","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/thomas-rhett/502541718","name":"About A Woman (From A Small Town)","artistName":"Thomas Rhett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Seven albums into his career, Thomas Rhett is in a comfortable place. The country superstar has more No. 1 hits than he can count on two hands, and also found happiness offstage with his wife and children, who serve as a primary inspiration for this follow-up to 2022’s <i>Where We Started</i>. Comfort doesn’t mean complacency, though, and on <i>About a Woman</i> Rhett digs more deeply into his personal experiences, sharing intimate stories about marriage, parenthood, and nostalgia for one’s youth.\n\n“What Could Go Right” is a tender portrait of friendship growing into love, inspired by Rhett’s own marriage. “Church” taps into Rhett’s longtime love of fellow singer-songwriter Eric Church, connecting the Chief’s music to youthful romance. “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman” is a slinky groove with twangy flourishes, reminiscent of earlier Rhett tracks like “It Goes Like This” and “Craving You.” The thematic and musical centerpiece of the record is “I Could Spend Forever Loving You,” a spare and sincere love song that’s sure to show up on wedding playlists. \n\nOn this expanded <i>From a Small Town</i> edition of the album, Rhett shakes up the original tracklist and adds five new tunes. The new music kicks off with the Tucker Wetmore collaboration “Small Town Girls,” a loose and groovy ode to women living the simple life. Lanie Gardner joins Rhett on an updated version of “What Could Go Right,” upping the romance with a duet-style performance. Rounding out the mix of new collaborations is Teddy Swims, who lends his powerful, soulful voice to an alternate take of fan favorite “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman.” Below, Rhett talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Overdrive”</b>\n“A song like ‘Overdrive’ would be directly centered towards high school kids—and then people that even, maybe, were high school sweethearts or got back together later in life—to go to reminisce on how innocent that time was. And how just because you’re kind of young, dumb, and reckless at 16 doesn’t mean that you can’t also still be there when you’re 35 or 55.”\n\n<b>“Gone Country”</b>\n“I wish I could say that I had this crazy story of dating this girl that flew in from Chicago and all these things, but I don’t have that story. For me, that song came about, and I’ve shared this story a couple of times, but just being at [Nashville’s] BNA [airport] and realizing how massive our genre has become. For me, it’s always been massive, because it’s what I’ve done for a living and what I’ve been so inundated with. Even people that did not grow up country, they’re just like, ‘I really like this way of living.’ You know what I mean? And that’s sort of where the inspiration from that song came from.”\n\n<b>“Church”</b>\n“The first two Eric Church records—I remember getting my first truck at 16, and Eric Church then was [like] listening to Zach Bryan now. It was kind of underground. He was the outlaw. He would sing about words that you couldn’t say on mainstream radio, all this stuff. So, me and all my buddies, that was our favorite. So, the original way this song got pitched to me was, it ended in heartbreak, like the guy and the girl never saw each other again, but he always reminisced over that time that they bonded over Eric Church. And so I came in on the back half and just rewrote the bridge and the last chorus, because [my story with my wife] ended differently.”\n\n<b>“What Could Go Right”</b>\n“I’ve tried to write that song a million different times, and it has always come out extremely corny and extremely cheesy. And a couple of the guys in the group are dating. One’s married and has kids and all this kind of stuff. And I was telling them about this night that I had with [my wife] Lauren when I was like 21 years old. [We] both were in long relationships with other people, and both kind of ended our relationship with other people at the same time. But there was always, in the back of my mind, this wonder of, like, ‘I wonder if we could ever date again.’ You know what I mean? Because we dated a little bit in high school. That whole song, I was telling the guys on the bus this story, and my buddy John is just writing, taking notes, soaking it all in. And I went to go get some food, and I came back, and they had written the verse and the chorus, and they were like, ‘Does this do it for you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s amazing.’”\n\n<b>“I Could Spend Forever Loving You”</b>\n“I think when I dream of what me and Lauren are going to look like and be doing at 70 years old, all I see is a front porch and a river and a cup of coffee. You know what I’m saying? So, I think it’s always good to dream in your marriage. It’s always good to kind of dream about the future. It’s OK to regret the past. Don’t harp on it, but also, it’s fun to reminisce on the past. Your youth doesn’t have to die because you have kids. Your youth doesn’t have to die just because you’ve been married for 10 years. And it really is a testament to knowing how much love can grow if you’ll allow it.”\n","short":"The 2024 album adds collabs with Tucker Wetmore and Teddy

Not More? (Extended)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Coco Jones","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Coco Jones’ debut album <i>Why Not More?</i> is a hard-fought culmination of years of work with her talents on full display since childhood. However, her transition from Disney teen actor to singer during the 2010s was rocky, with a robust discography of singles and EPs under her belt before she eventually parted ways with her first label. “I got signed when I was 14 and dropped when I was 16, and it was disappointing because I had this feeling that as soon as I get that one opportunity, it’ll all grow like rapid fire,” Jones tells Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis. “It did not go that way. I think that was when, inwardly, there was a shift in me, and it went from certain to foggy and unsure what I was going to get in return for all of this effort.” \n\nDespite navigating an often turbulent industry, Jones has laid the groundwork over the last couple of years, starting with the success of her 2023 breakout EP <i>What I Didn’t Tell You</i>, which introduced fans—old and new—to a grown-up Coco and not only cemented a Grammy for her somber track “ICU,” but solidified her as a rising star and one of the faces of the new generation in R&B. Those accolades, along with headlining her first solo tour in 2023, all readied her for this moment.\n\n<i>Why Not More?</i> finds the South Carolina native more comfortable trusting her instincts than on its predecessor, and showing the different sides to her musicality. “I’ve been asking myself this during the album: ‘Should I do this? Can I? Is this allowed? What do people think if I do that?’ And I really loved the theme of ‘why not more?’” she explains. “Why can’t I just lean into all the things? Really, what is the answer to the ‘why not more,’ and is that enough, that answer? No, because it’s all rooted in fear. I can’t live like that. I got to jump.” And she does. She isn’t afraid to push boundaries across the album’s 14 tracks, traversing a spectrum of genres seamlessly while keeping R&B at the center. \n\nJones samples Britney Spears’ hit song “Toxic” on the seductive “Taste,” continues the pop energy on the acoustic track “Hit You Where It Hurts,” and delves into the trap-soul soundscape with an assist from Future on “Most Beautiful Design,” while the title track has Jones teaming up with YG Marley to deliver a reggae-influenced song. “I don’t even feel like there is a formula at this stage of music. It’s just whatever catches catches. And that’s outside of all of us,” she says. “So you might as well, in the meantime, do what you love to do instead of trying to always be doing what you think is going to work.” \n\nHer growth isn’t just reflected in the music but in the themes and storytelling as well. While love and relationships are a core part of <i>Why Not More?</i>, Jones also brings empowerment and self-love to the forefront (“By Myself”), embraces her sexuality and sensuality (“AEOMG,” “On

And You Said It Back","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Selena Gomez & benny blanco","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The fourth album from Selena Gomez—the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate who needs no introduction, having been famous for approximately two-thirds of her life—doubles as her first album with her fiancé, benny blanco, who has produced and written more hit singles than you’ve had hot dinners. (It’s blanco’s third album, following 2018’s feature-happy <i>Friends Keep Secrets</i> and its 2021 sequel.) The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\n\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”","short":"The pop power couple tack eight extra tracks onto their joint debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/bb/1a/0dbb1a31-f7cd-0b3d-28d3-cfadce384184/25UMGIM56425.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4891b","textColor2":"f19d0a","textColor4":"c27e09","textColor1":"f4aa21","bgColor":"060405","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-said-i-love-you-first-and-you-said-it-back/1811201060","playParams":{"id":"1811201060","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Gb94494MtenpCCWoNX0e5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811201060/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280215834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280215834?l=en-US"},{"id":"1410841257","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1410841257?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746789367632}}},"1811474664":{"id":"1811474664","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811474664?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Christian"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1181697119-1170684499","name":"SEOUL BROTHER -

This month’s mix, designed for running, was put together by Kaskade (born Ryan Raddon), a longtime fixture in North America’s EDM scene who considers himself a bit of a health nut. “[Health] is on par with sleeping and breathing,” he tells Apple Music. “Without it, life becomes very uncomfortable.”\n\nRaddon used to be an avid runner, and he crafted this mix to be a partner on the road. “Pounding my feet to the beat always helped me push my pace,” he says. “We all want to have a decent runway up to our high point, and we all want to have that feel-good letdown as we’re nearing the end. The middle? That’s all apex energy, hopefully carrying the listener past any barrier they’ve been looking to cross. Maybe today is the day you get your personal best.” \n\nThese days, Raddon, now based in Los Angeles, is more drawn to surfing and yoga, but says he still relies on playlists to help him level up. “Music can make or break any type of session,” he says. “I’m hoping to encourage people who are using this mix to keep going, whether it’s day one or they’re a lifer.

Take the R&B-leaning “what i prefer,” which finds the Michigan-born rapper pining for a woman who values in-person experience over the virtual facade that dominates so much of the world. “I need a stay-at-home girl, yeah/Not-always-in-her-phone girl,” he croons, showcasing a knack for turning each line of his verses into catchy melodies. Elsewhere, he moves towards Jersey club and pluggnb on “man on a mission,” teaming up with Kyle Richh of 41 and NLE Choppa for a bass-heavy banger. Despite prolonged sections of maturation throughout the project, DDG is still inclined to let material goods do the heavy lifting when he raps: “I spent a bag when I barely had knew you.” Love is nice, but money talks.

Empowered by the success of their prior Marshmello team-up “HARLEY QUINN,” group leader Jesus Ortiz Paz (aka JOP) and his cohorts embraced the opportunity to infuse their style with seemingly disparate genres like Jersey club, resulting in a risk-taking album that will forever stand out in their high-quality discography. Yet not long thereafter came <i>MALA MÍA</i>, a surprise joint-EP release with Grupo Frontera that inherently hinted at a potential pivot away from the dance-floor thump. By the time the riveting corrido “Por Esos Ojos” arrived a couple months later, it became clear that JOP intended for their next project to change course once more.\n\nThat said, anyone who’d dare presume that <i>111XPANTIA</i> is somehow backtracking or retreating from the boldness of <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i> simply fails to understand the breadth of Fuerza Regida’s artistry. While the self-described Jersey corridos side of their work is conspicuously absent here, what remains are a dozen tracks that burst and blossom with fearless lyricism and intricate arrangements. Evoking the iconically cinematic Nino Rota score, opener “GodFather” distills mafioso-epic intensity into an unapologetically sordid account of luxe hedonism. JOP sounds arguably more profane than ever on the riveting crime-story corrido “ayy weyy” and the sexually explicit “peliculiando.” Electronic elements play a subtler role than before, present as a warming drone at the start of “caperuza” and via synth bass swells underneath the lush “Nocturno.”","short":"JOP steps off the dance floor refreshed and ready for corridos glory."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/8a/7b/848a7b8e-c817-97ae-1f43-1b11d9a23530/196873013855.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"330000","textColor2":"040000","textColor4":"360000","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe0000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/111xpantia-deluxe/1811903274","playParams":{"id":"1811903274","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5h9OPxhByc4FaeqeNM6rCT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811903274/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1275690475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1275690475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746788264632}}},"1812105315":{"id":"1812105315","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812105315?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-05","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1b/71/fd/1b71fdc4-1d51-60c4-451e-73407fe3575d/8bcce3bc-6629-4169-98d5-fef93f5d0b39.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0bcb6","textColor2":"d4d1ce","textColor4":"b3b1af","textColor1":"e4dfd7","bgColor":"2f2f31","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/andr%C3%A9-3000/3869739","name":"7 piano sketches","artistName":"André 3000","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"May 5, 2025, will stand now as a historic benchmark for André 3000.

The night represented not only the surprising relaunch of his erstwhile fashion line, Benji Bixby, but also the surprising release of <i>7 piano sketches</i>, his first full project since his surprise 2023 entry into serene spiritual jazz, <i>New Blue Sun</i>.\n\n<i>7 piano sketches</i> began to take shape a decade ago, when André and his son temporarily lived in a Houston house with spartan furnishings—some TVs, some beds, a piano. Around the time of the final shows of the most-recent Outkast reunion, he began recording little piano pieces and even pondered releasing several as <i>The Best Worst Rap Album in History</i>. The liner notes were set to read, “It’s the free-est emotionally and best I’ve felt personally.” But he shelved them, leading first to lingering questions about when he would return to music and, ultimately, to <i>New Blue Sun</i>, a stunning break with expectations for one of hip-hop’s best-ever minds. \n\nThese little pieces—seven tracks, 16 total minutes—perpetuate that break. After a voice offers the track number and title, André feels his way through a theme and variations. Where opener “bluffing in the snow” is a refracted and pensive blues, “hotel lobby pianos” drifts into a confident midtempo stride as voices drift in the background. The record ultimately points toward new directions. After he dances through a smiling melody for a while, “off rhythm laughter” blooms into an exquisite drone. And on closer “i spend all day waiting for the night,” he improvises around a drum machine’s languid march, his sunken-world piano rising to meet the rhythm in the middle. André 3000 continues to push hip-hop expectations off his back, this time with the actual piano strapped to it.","short":"Three Stacks’ break from rap continues with 16 minutes of piano exploration."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/5a/da/955ada82-1629-3cd5-1cb3-e1f74d9be705/196873119144.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbdfed","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"b9cddb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0063aa","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/7-piano-sketches/1812105315","playParams":{"id":"1812105315","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3u952Zxzx60qhCoohKSf5k"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812105315/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3869739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3869739?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746789859822}}},"1812587739":{"id":"1812587739","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812587739?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-08","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/los-dareyes-de-la-sierra/1475990231","name":"Redención","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Los Dareyes De La Sierra","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The rise of Double P Records as a proverbial force to be reckoned with in música mexicana continues upwards with Los Dareyes De La Sierra’s first full-length for the Peso Pluma-helmed label. Led as always by singer/accordionist José Darey Castro, the corridos-centric group makes their latest outing an entirely collaborative one, linking with established and rising stars alike in the wider genre, including LEGADO 7 and Santa Fe Klan. Hedonistic self-indulgence and outsize luxury characterize their internal team-ups with Tito Double P and the aforementioned Peso Pluma on “Vita Fer” and “Supreme,” respectively. Yet there’s a range and depth to <i>Redención</i> and its themes that further bolster the undeniable artistry. Heartbreak and heartache make for some of the album’s most meaningful lyrical moments, drowning sorrows alongside Grupo Firme on the downtrodden “Según” and numbing oneself with superficial pleasures with Neton Vega on “Boneless.” Self-pity flips to righteous anger as needed, too, as evidenced by the embittered Gabito Ballesteros team-up “Te Engañe.”","short":"José Darey Castro leads his crew on a
