Album","standard":"On her fourth album, <i>Plæygirl</i>, MØ is finally having fun again. When making her 2014 debut, <i>No Mythologies to Follow</i>, the Danish singer-songwriter was creating purely for herself. After a breakout feature on Major Lazer’s global smash “Lean On,” she continued to chase pop highs through high-profile collaborations and chart hits. In trying to keep up with the industry hamster wheel, she eventually lost sight of what grounded her, and the resulting burnout spawned 2022’s <i>Motordrome</i>. As MØ spent the next two years writing, seeing artists like Charli xcx and Chappell Roan be applauded for their fearless authenticity did more than inspire her—it helped her heal. <i>Plæygirl</i> is what happens when she tunes everything else out, follows her instincts, and just goes for it. \n\nMØ worked with producer Nick Sylvester (Yaeji, Channel Tres) to create <i>Plæygirl</i>’s sound, mixing her Scandi-pop roots with colorful electronic production that feels youthful and, at times, defiant. It’s a fitting backdrop for her unflinching storytelling. She embraces her outsider status on the fizzy “SWEET” (“I don’t go to clubs/I go to Comic-Cons and thrash metal shows”) and mocks societal pressures with a resounding “BUAH!” over punkish disco on “Keep Møving.” But beneath the playful surface are adult emotions. They’re messy, intense, and soul-wrenching, such as when she wrestles with her fear of commitment (“Who Said”), treats heartbreak with club therapy (“Knife”), or realizes she’s in a codependent relationship (“Without You”).

Album","standard":"Having spent five years signposting the direction of her musical journey with a consistent flow of subtly evolving EP releases, LA-based singer-songwriter Claire Chicha—aka spill tab—has arrived at her destination: her debut album, <i>ANGIE</i>. “I think I’ve always had this goal where I’m trying to represent myself the fullest of my ability in a two-minute song, and I think I’ve been realizing through the process of EPs that that’s not possible,” Chicha told Apple Music 1’s Hanuman Welch. “I do feel like this album, as much as I possibly could, represents not only where I’m from, but where I want to go and the music that I’m listening to now, the music that I’ve been listening to for the past 10 years.” \n\nChicha’s work draws inspiration from myriad sources, blending her appreciation for R&B, electropop, rock, jazz, and more into a unique wash of dreamlike alt-pop, roughened round the edges with unexpected synth embellishments as showcased on tracks like “Athlete” or the bold distortion that scuffs through “De Guerre.” “It speaks to the conversation between the digital and organic and the destruction and the rebuilding that comes with just feeding a sound back and forth, from an analog synth into a computer back into a pedal,” said Chicha, who co-wrote and produced the bulk of the record with John Hill (FKA twigs, Charli xcx) and Solomonophonic (SZA, Remi Wolf). “Those conversations, musically, are what make me the most excited about musicmaking. So to me, this album is that conversation in action, but also shows my evolution with that music and production, and being able to work with all these incredible collaborators has just made me a better artist.”","short":"The rising alt-pop star debuts with an album that “shows my evolution.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/angie/1792447165","playParams":{"id":"1792447165","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ilxlp4HEx8G4T1enJ2iSr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792447165/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1440467280","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1440467280?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008496939,"RTCI":0}}},"1793746885":{"id":"1793746885","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793746885?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/c8/d2/a4c8d25e-526c-5128-2e56-8cbb228ccc9c/Job581f4150-5c51-4ead-badd-1c31b0949b9a-188282000-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368708726_2091543986-Time1742405499943.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","232224"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2e2e36","textColor2":"232224","textColor4":"3f424a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/39/90/85/3990850f-25b6-a454-8e30-a2a70fc4c5ec/e5909b2a-4172-4654-8cb2-d05f9581b69b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8b9bd8","textColor2":"95aefa","textColor4":"7d94e4","textColor1":"a8b7ec","bgColor":"192c89","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ea/09/8e/ea098e69-ad9f-3048-7a5b-1d35bba14ee9/Job0af2f66b-4ea3-4d36-8edc-6ed7eee69881-188281999-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368708967_2091543985-Time1742397880999.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2c2e34","textColor2":"1d1e21","textColor4":"3b3f48","textColor1":"0b0909","bgColor":"b2c2e4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sparks/218206","name":"MAD!","artistName":"Sparks","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5c/1c/de/5c1cdea9-0a5d-dc5e-aea8-a8ca14872859/8721253577645.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"282a43","textColor2":"31282c","textColor4":"4b4754","textColor1":"060317","bgColor":"b0c3f6","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Listening to <i>MAD!</i>—the 28th studio album by Sparks, the fraternal duo of Ron and Russell Mael—it can be difficult to remember that they have been a band for more than half a century, with both brothers now on the doorstep of 80. Pairing aggressive programming and vivid electronic textures with sharp rock-band backing, these 12 songs are edgy, canny, and electrifying, eternal trademarks of Sparks’ music that have only sharpened with time. \n\nAnd that has been intentional, confirms Russell. “When you’ve had 28 albums, you want to impress yourself, that you can still do things that are modern-sounding, not like a band with a 28-album history,” he tells Apple Music. “We work hard at trying to do things that are provocative, lyrically and sonically.” The Maels talk about the process behind and inspiration for each track.\n\n<b>“Do Things My Own Way”</b>\nRussell Mael: “‘Do Things My Own Way’ is probably the mantra that Sparks has pursued for our entire career, from day one, when Todd Rundgren was the only person to acknowledge Sparks’ capabilities. We were turned down by a million labels, but he said you should always do things your own way. He said that, even on our very first album, we’d created our own universe, and we should continue on that way.”\nRon Mael: “This is really the first song written for the album. We don’t carry over older, unused material onto a new album, so we start from scratch. After we recorded all these songs, it seemed fitting that it be in first place, because it is an overall statement of the album and Sparks.”\n\n<b>“JanSport Backpack”</b>\nRon Mael: “We realize the practical uses of a JanSport, but we were in Tokyo and saw quite a few fashionable young ladies who were wearing JanSport backpacks. That isn’t a luxury brand, but they were wearing it as a style statement. That image stuck with us, and we tried to work backward to see how we could use it in a song. So, there’s a girl who’s breaking up with a guy, and the image he has is her walking away with a JanSport backpack. We have much confidence that, on Apple Music, you won’t find another song about JanSport backpacks.”\n\n<b>“Hit Me, Baby”</b>\nRussell Mael: “This is someone hoping it’s a nightmare, but the reality is that they are living this nightmare that we all are. We’re in Paris now, so it’s refreshing to not have “that man” in your face all the time, like when you’re in the States. The song obliquely references the hopelessness of the situation all around, but we didn’t want to be so blatant as to spell it out exactly. It can be about anyone else’s own situation, where they’re having a bad time that they hope goes away.”\nRon Mael: “It was written in a more general sense before the election, but it became obvious that, even subconsciously, it had a more specific meaning. We like details in songs, but it’s important for us to have lyrics that don’t only reflect a particular subject, that they have a broader subtext. But it still took on a more specific meaning after the election.”\n\n<b>“Running Up a Tab at the Hotel for the Fab”</b>\nRussell Mael: “It’s a guy who is trying to impress his partner by taking her to this fine hotel and running a tab in hopes of swaying her. But the guy doesn’t have the means to pay for the extravagant tastes, so he gets thrown into prison at Rikers Island. But he says it’s all worth it, because he’s hoping she’ll come to visit him there.”\nRon Mael: “In the distant past, we only wrote a song, then brought it in to record. We still work that way, but we also have the luxury, since Russell has a studio at his place, of just going into the studio and starting without any kind of preconception. We get a more varied approach, and this is one song that was done from the studio standpoint, then working backwards to figure out a melody and lyrics.”\n\n<b>“My Devotion”</b>\nRussell Mael: “Some people have tried to look deeper into it and say, ‘Well, surely it can’t just be a really nice love song.’ But, no, it’s just a really nice love song. We hope that, lyrically, it’s charming, with the guy’s devotion being so strong that he’s written her name on his shoe and is even thinking of getting a tattoo. It’s one of my favorite lines on the album.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Dog It”</b>\nRon Mael: “With the line ‘Shake it thusly and you’ll see the light,’ we like having words from two different worlds. ‘Shake it’ is a cliché in a million songs, but ‘thusly’ is such a formal word. They are in conflict as far as the tone, but it’s a formal way to suggest something carnal. We like butting up together, so to speak, words. It’s a Shakespeare thing applied to hip-hop expression. We’re also encouraging movement as a way to fight. The person is seeking help, and the advice that they’re given isn’t something deep and intellectual. It’s ‘shake it thusly.’”\n\n<b>“In Daylight”</b>\nRon Mael: “For most of us, darkness is more advantageous to our opportunities for romantic advancement, let’s say. In so many of our songs, the instrumentation and singing are very direct, even if it’s musically complex. We often attempt to make songs aggressive, but this one was a little more diffuse. There’s an atmosphere here, and it feels blurred, which is the feeling of being between daylight and darkness.”\n\n<b>“I-405 Rules”</b>\nRussell Mael: “There’s some sincerity to the image of the I-405 having a beauty in its own way, especially if you look at it at night, when thousands of cars are bumper to bumper, and you see the red taillights. It’s a sea of red, especially if you’re above the freeway, say, at the Getty Center. Lots of other major cities in the world have this beautiful river—the Seine, the Thames, the Sumida. But we don’t have that, except when, once a year, it rains in LA, when it even starts to look like a river. The I-405 is our contribution to the great rivers of the world. This song is also so sonically in your face that it’s overly dramatic for the subject matter, and we like that it goes counter to what we’re singing about.”\n\n<b>“A Long Red Light”</b>\nRussell Mael: “We like this song a lot, because it’s not a typical song structure. It’s a piece that evolves over time with a simple subject—waiting for a red light to hopefully turn green someday. Over time, it shifts musically, and, toward the end of it, you can sense the frustration that the light is still red. It turns into this big chorale, with a lot of voices and orchestral drums coming in. The situation becomes really urgent, and we like that in a song that deals with a small situation, a red light that everyone’s been to. That was challenging for us in a positive way.”\n\n<b>“Drowned in a Sea of Tears”</b>\nRussell Mael: “It is a devastating relationship breakup song. There’s been pop songs throughout history that have had the theme of drowning. We wanted to find another way of doing that. This one is really melodic, and, in contrast to ‘A Long Red Light,’ it’s a verse and a chorus kicking in a big way.”\n\n<b>“A Little Bit of Light Banter”</b>\nRon Mael: “We see it as this couple that feels that they’re different from other couples that do need all these in-depth discussions. This couple is happy to do something that’s the opposite of that, and they feel a closeness because they just share this love of light banter. They don’t care what the neighbors think, and hopefully it comes across as charming, for a couple that feels they’re outside of the world of heavy-duty discussions. The advice that we’re given is that we’re supposed to read and discuss Kafka at night, but it’s not always wise advice.”\n\n<b>“Lord Have Mercy”</b> \nRussell Mael: “It is another take on a relationship. While this woman is asleep, her partner hears her singing this melody, and it’s so beautiful for him to hear. He’s heard melodies from buskers on the street that were OK. He’s heard melodies from various times and periods. But this melody he’s overhearing from this woman in her sleep becomes something so striking and profound for him.”\nRon Mael: “He’s not necessarily a believer, but the beauty of her singing while she’s half-asleep has captivated him so much. He hears what she’s singing not in a lyrical sense about religion and being converted, but he just finds beauty in what she’s singing and hopes it continues forever.”","short":"Russell Mael: “When

Album","standard":"When Rico Nasty proclaims, “I don’t sound like anyone, these bitches sound like me” on <i>LETHAL</i> highlight “BUTTERFLY KISSES,” she has a point. She’s one of the earliest luminaries of the rap-meets-metal marriage that has surfaced over the last decade-plus, and she’s arguably the best at merging those worlds too. The Prince George’s County, Maryland, native has blended a unique variety of chaotic rage-rap since her entry into the music industry in the mid-2010s, and she backs it up with mosh-heavy live shows, mercurial hairdos, and eccentric fashion sense. \n\nBut since feeling restricted by her persona after the release of 2022’s <i>Las Ruinas</i>, she switched things up: She left the major-label system, signed to indie outfit Fueled by Ramen (the label that exalted bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! At the Disco), and enlisted Imad Royal (The Chainsmokers, Panic! At the Disco) as the executive producer for her next record. \n\nMany of her fans already associate her with creating on her own terms, but <i>LETHAL</i><> is even more freewheeling than usual. “SOUL SNATCHER” finds her mutating between a half-dozen rap voices while boasting about her sexual prowess, “SMOKE BREAK” is full of guttural metal screams, “PINK” glows with bubbly femininity, and “CRASH” is a catchy pop-rock cut. The album is sonically unpredictable, but her unbridled confidence and chameleonic versatility hold everything together. \n\nRico Nasty takes time for reflection as well: “SMILE” is a tender ode to her teenage son, and “YOU COULD NEVER” is a career retrospective that shows her earnestly proud of all she’s persevered. “When I reflect back, I know I’m blessed/I’ma be myself, you could be the rest,” she says on the latter. It’s an approach that’s proven effective for Rico, time and time again.","short":"Sonic unpredictability held together by unbridled

His 2025 album <i>The Hours (Morning)</i> finds the artist born Joshua Karpeh trying to sonically encapsulate the morning hours of the day, expanding his palette to include indie rock, soul, and electronic music. “Traffic (7am)” features Karpeh trying his hand at alt-pop, crooning over jangly percussion and soaring guitar solos. Elsewhere, on “Father Time (10am)” he again favors an uptempo rhythm, placing his confident vocals against pulsing drums and synths that fly above his words. Cautious Clay’s mood, perspective, and disposition change with each tick of the clock, offering the perfect platform for his constantly shifting approach to songwriting.

Bach’s English Suites form the thrillingly majestic second volume in pianist Francesco Tristano’s journey to record all the Baroque composer’s keyboard works. Probably dating from around 1714 while Bach was living and working in Weimar, the suites are collections of dance movements, and in that sense are akin in structure to his keyboard partitas and French Suites. Musically, however, they seem to tower above. “They’re unique,” Tristano tells Apple Music Classical. “For a start, each suite has an extravagant opening movement that’s virtuosic and extremely hard to play.” And then there are the closing gigues that Tristano describes as “beautifully complex, extravagant, and totally engrossing”.\n\n“The opening ‘Prelude’ of the Second Suite in A Minor really is Bach at his most groovy,” adds Tristano. “It's super clear the way he plays with the voice leading and how each hand imitates the other. It’s total equality of hands, and it’s quite amazing.” For an example of a gigue, Tristano points to the final movement from Suite No. 6, an extraordinary final statement that concludes the set in an unexpectedly brisk manner. “It’s quite extravagant, the way he plays with the chromatics and trills and jumps and accents and dissonances. It’s kind of a wild Bach—it’s visionary.”\n\nIn between are movements that, on the surface, seem as if they might give the player a moment to breathe. Not at all, says Tristano. “A couple of years ago, I played the English Suite No. 6, with its incredible opening, probably one of the most intricate and difficult keyboard movements written by Bach. I would get to the ‘Allemande’ after the ‘Prelude’ and say, ‘OK, now I can relax a little bit.’ But this Allemande is actually very detailed and subtle with surprising harmonies and harmonic twists, so you can’t relax at all. Every movement demands total dedication and concentration.”\n\nThere’s an unmistakable, almost forensic clarity to Tristano’s playing, mostly due to his steering clear of the sustain pedal (a device that lifts the dampers from the strings, helping pianists achieve a legato sound). “I know pianists who use the pedal quite well, but for me, it gets in the way of polyphony,” says Tristano; “when I play live, though, sometimes if I play a repeat, I might use the soft pedal to simulate a change of manual on a harpsichord.”\n\nTristano’s use of a brightly toned Yamaha CFX concert grand piano also contributes to the transparency of the sound, helping him achieve a certain percussive texture that again bridges the space between piano and harpsichord. “I think for me, the most important aspect of any piano is how reliable the action is,” reveals Tristano, “so that I can really control the instrument. Because especially in Bach, there’s no pedal, and every voice is equally important. I just need total control over how the instrument is going to react to the tips of my fingers. The keyboard is a machine anyway, so let's make it sparkle and make it groove.”","short":"Francesco Tristano on Bach’s “complex and engrossing”

Album and Interview","standard":"“Italian pop drama” is how Damiano David describes <i>FUNNY little FEARS</i>—with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. As you’d expect from Måneskin’s lead singer, David hasn’t done things by half for his solo debut album, collaborating with Labrinth, Suki Waterhouse, and d4vd to create an imposing sound. <i>FUNNY little FEARS</i> swings from stadium-ready swaggers like “Next Summer” to angst wrapped in the happy melody of “Tango.” But those fears, however funny and little, are never far from the surface.\n\n“I think my biggest fear is loneliness,” David tells Apple Music’s Travis Mills. “I really don’t cope well when I’m traveling too much, and I’m never going back home or have my girlfriend or my close friends around. I start overthinking and hurting myself with my own thoughts.”\n\nDavid’s main purpose with the album is to get over the things that hold him back. “I’m still the frontman of Måneskin, and it’s a big part of myself, but it’s not my 100%,” he says. “And for me, it’s very important that people understand that. I’ve found myself very stuck in my dynamics, fears, and habits, and this album was a way to break it down. At the end of it all, I consider myself healed for most of it. It’s like, ‘Yes, you’re scared, but everybody’s scared. It’s not a big deal. You can fight through it.’”\n\nDespite the instant crowd-pleasing appeal of tracks like “Next Summer,” David reveals he has a spontaneous approach to songwriting and doesn’t fall into the trap of chasing hits. “I consider it a stadium ballad. Lighters up,” he says. “It’s weird for me because I am never really aware of what I’m doing, where I’m going, and what I’m talking about. I discover it later when I have the song in front of me. I never go in the studio with the idea: ‘Today, we have to make a ballad. Today, we have to make a hit.’ For me, it's like a big game. Let’s write a song. If we do it, it’s already a miracle because we got into a room where there’s nothing and we get out with a song. It’s already magic. It doesn't have to be a hit.”\n\nThere’s a definite energy shift throughout the album where David goes from self-doubt to contentment with the beautiful love song “Angel.” It’s something he acknowledges, too. “I’m a way happier person,” he says. “If you compare myself with myself one year ago, I smile way more.”","short":"Måneskin’s charismatic lead singer finds “pop drama” on his solo debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/funny-little-fears/1800504135","playParams":{"id":"1800504135","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4xc5MKpCUw1LREm6cnBtOa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800504135/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1767322404","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1767322404?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008624972,"RTCI":0}}},"1800522033":{"id":"1800522033","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800522033?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5c/0e/e4/5c0ee4a4-70e1-07f3-1ea0-0f529b7a4ed8/515c1b80-6d51-400f-bb23-25786bc01e6f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6c4ca","textColor2":"a3bbe8","textColor4":"8699c2","textColor1":"f3f1f3","bgColor":"111127","hasP3":true}},"name":"Borga Revolution!

Recorded with bassist Max Ridley and harpist Charles Overton and co-produced by the ambient-ish/neoclassical artist Nils Frahm, <i>Nilam</i> (taken from the Tamil word for “land”) is one of those albums that feels both breathy and sophisticated but quietly intense, a new iteration of the ’80s and ’90s “crossover” albums of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or the devotional music of Alice Coltrane.

Album","standard":"He may be the biggest star in country music at a time when country music’s bigger than it’s been this century, but Morgan Wallen remembers when he was the underdog. “Once you get to know me, I’m a coyote in a field of wolves,” he sings in his raspy twang on “I’m a Little Crazy,” a tale of moonshine runs and late-night paranoia that closes out his fourth album, <i>I’m the Problem</i>. Speaking to Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, the 32-year-old Tennessee native singled out the line as his favorite. “At times in my life, I haven’t felt like I was invited,” he admits. “To me, that's what that line says: ‘Hey, I know I wasn’t invited, but I’m still eating, and I’m still fed.’”\n\nSince his sophomore album, 2021’s 30-track <i>Dangerous: The Double Album</i>, Wallen’s hyper-prolific bent has become a winning strategy. His 36-track follow-up, 2023’s <i>One Thing at a Time</i>, spawned eight singles (including the inescapable “Last Night”) and broke Garth Brooks’ Billboard record for most weeks at No. 1 by a country album. Not to be outdone, <i>I’m the Problem</i> clocks in at 37 tracks and nearly two hours long. But those hours fly by like a summer evening on the porch with a cooler of cold ones: No one crafts hooky, aerodynamic country anthems like Wallen and his longtime crew of co-writers and producers (HARDY, Ernest Keith Smith, Charlie Handsome, Ashley Gorley, Joey Moi).\n\nThere are the requisite odes to whiskey, women, bucks, and trucks, and Wallen’s in his sweet spot when he’s probing his own conscience, which he does with surprising nuance on songs like “Kick Myself,” a roots-rock exploration of vice and accountability: “Nothing’s changed/In a way it’s getting way, way worse,” he concludes after kicking his bad habits and realizing his problems remain. Themes of addiction and temptation continue through “Genesis,” which Wallen wrote from the top down; rather than starting with the hook like usual, he relished the challenge of flipping the first book of the Bible into something catchy and cool: “I’m like, ‘How would you write a Genesis song? What would it mean? How do you do that without sounding cheesy?’”\n\nYou’d expect the crossover country star of the 2020s to be running a victory lap, but the prevailing mood on <i>I’m the Problem</i> is heartbreak—served up with extra salt on the breakup banger “I Got Better,” but more often with whiskey-soaked regret on singles like “Lies Lies Lies” and “Just in Case.” (“I think there’s a lot of feelings on this album,” he says. “Happy is not the one I do best, normally.”) But the emotional centerpiece is “Superman,” the first song he’s written for his young son, on which Wallen admits his imperfections to the little guy: “I don’t always save the day,” he sings, “but you know for you, I’ll always try.” \n\n“There’s a lot of different things that I felt like I was trying to do,” he says of the deeply personal track. “Not only let him know where I fall short, but also give him advice, let him know I’m protecting him.” Generation-defining country juggernauts have feelings, too, y’know.\n","short":"The king of 2020s country\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d on his next opus: “There’s a lot of feelings.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/im-the-problem/1802103958","playParams":{"id":"1802103958","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IZ8sY5FjtL9hloXpv0XbD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802103958/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829142092","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829142092?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748009116131,"RTCI":0}}},"1802636797":{"id":"1802636797","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802636797?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c1/de/dc/c1dedc6e-75a6-0a4b-d49d-6bb2b2ac36ef/ba9ca5d7-9770-4ad0-aea7-fed67112b4e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3bd80","textColor2":"f5a662","textColor4":"c68750","textColor1":"f2eb9f","bgColor":"080808","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stereolab/162658","name":"Instant Holograms On Metal Film","artistName":"Stereolab","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/74/63/55746324-ab20-5e89-26a8-1e152254c514/5056818800993.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3107","textColor2":"332508","textColor4":"5b4606","textColor1":"0b0b09","bgColor":"fac900","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Each Stereolab album functions as a portal to a future we once imagined but never achieved: a world of flying cars, egg chairs, and space-age bachelor pads where the coolest Franco-pop, German psychedelic, and Brazilian jazz records are spinning 24/7. And so it remains on the indie icons’ first new album in 15 years, which begins with a minute-long flourish of oscillating synths that sounds like an old mainframe being rebooted back to life. <i>Instant Holograms on Metal Film</i> finds the Stereolab machine in perfect working order after an extended period of inactivity, and, if anything, the group sounds eager to make up for lost time with gloriously overstuffed songs that key in on familiar pleasure points while introducing all manner of shapeshifting surprises. \n\n“Immortal Hands” eases you into a laidback loungey groove before hitching itself to a funky drum-machine beat and coasting through a dizzying swirl of brass and flutes; “Electrified Teenybop!” plays like the theme music to some alternate-universe dance show where the kids get down to a frenetic fusion of ping-ponging Kraftwerkian electronics and lustrous disco orchestrations. But, as ever, Stereolab’s splendorous soundworld is built atop a foundation of pointed political commentary addressing our present-day struggles and inequalities: Embedded within the breezy kaleidoscopic pop of “Melodie Is a Wound” is a scathing indictment of social media disinformation and the oppressive elites that manipulate it to their advantage. And yet, when the band returns to their motorik hypno-rock roots for the song’s exhilarating second act, they reassure us that utopia is still within our reach. \n","short":"The first album in 15 years updates their utopian psych-pop for dystopian times."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/instant-holograms-on-metal-film/1802636797","playParams":{"id":"1802636797","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nS7jRCPubnZF0OsXEM0D7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802636797/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"162658","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/162658?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008529586,"RTCI":0}}},"1803188661":{"id":"1803188661","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803188661?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b5/eb/7f/b5eb7fad-8e2e-50c3-501e-0ef378ceea20/Job5b185d62-90bc-4c66-b95f-e73b63696b34-193084934-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_378246941_2172990707-Time1747929069084.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d8d1bc"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f2212"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c9cac4","textColor2":"d8d1bc","textColor4":"b0ac97","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f2212","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e7/5e/f6/e75ef6f7-6e08-0237-ce19-ce6de786032b/Job96a47276-20dc-43b7-ae48-971c03f3ef42-193084935-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_378246790_2172990708-Time1747930595614.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c8c8c2","textColor2":"e2d5c1","textColor4":"b8af9b","textColor1":"f6f3f2","bgColor":"141903","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zach-john-king/1671037314","name":"Slow Down - EP","artistName":"Zach John King","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3f/0c/aa/3f0caae5-adde-f22d-a8d2-7403d99619d5/196872999679.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c2cac4","textColor2":"e5dcc1","textColor4":"bab49b","textColor1":"eef8f5","bgColor":"101403","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Zach John King struck gold with his song “Slow Down.” The small-town Georgia-born singer-songwriter found viral success with the confessional track, which takes narrative cues from the raw, emotional songwriting of Zach Bryan and sonically resembles the summery country pop of Kane Brown or Riley Green. That melody-forward, heart-on-his-sleeve vibe permeates this six-song collection, like on another fan-favorite track, “I Deserve a Heartbreak.” That song approaches power ballad territory as King considers his own role in a relationship gone south, with a fiery guitar solo at the track’s crescendo. Other highlights on the EP, helmed by Atlanta-based producer Ryan Wilson (Maverick City Music, Casting Crowns), include “She Didn’t Have To,” another vulnerable cut with a clever melodic structure, and closing track “Cold Shoulder,” which finds King’s aching voice at its breaking point as he sinks into romantic regret.","short":"A melody-forward, heart-on-his-sleeve vibe permeates this six-song

Album","standard":"The spark for Joe Jonas’ first solo album since 2011 arrived on the road. While driving from Los Angeles to Houston in advance of Jonas Brothers playing the Houston Rodeo in 2024, he stopped by national parks like Joshua Tree, and his trip’s soundtrack involved him getting back in touch with his musical roots. “Driving through on that road trip, [I was] inspired by what I was seeing and what I was hearing,” he tells Apple Music. Jonas’ listening on that long drive included a lot of country music and the alt-rock that he grew up on, and when he got back to Los Angeles, he was ready to turn the music in his head into actual songs.\n\n<i>Music for People Who Believe in Love</i> stands apart from Jonas’ chart-topping work with his brothers and the party-playlist funk pop he makes as leader of DNCE because of its genre fluidity and its feeling. On the live-wire cut “Work It Out,” he dives inside his head in an effort to make sense of it, mulling over why “some days, I wanna float away” as a peppy beat echoes the fast-paced world he’s immersed in. “You Got the Right” is a loose-limbed, country-tinged offering with chiming guitars, Jonas sounding almost bashful as he lets someone know that he loves them enough to potentially let them go, while the pensive closing cut, “Constellation,” pairs its ruminating with glittery guitars and charging drums. \n\nJonas also brought in guests for <i>Music</i>—his brother Franklin appears on the punky “Velvet Sunshine,” while others reflect his widening musical palette: Brazilian pop supernova Luisa Sonza faces off with him on the simmering flirtation “What We Are,” and Americana alchemist Sierra Ferrell is his foil on the twangy “Sip Your Wine.” There, Jonas adopts a curled-lip drawl that adds a low-level thrill to open-road romance lyrics like “Thousand miles left till Reno, let’s sit back and waste some time.”\n\nDigging into his deepest feelings while exploring new musical avenues was, Jonas said, a way for him to express gratitude over how far he’s come. “I’m really happy, and I’m grateful,” he says. “I’ve got amazing family and friends around me, and I get to do something that makes other people feel really good. How lucky am I? This is a reflection of hope and love—meeting me where I’m at now and sharing that with the world.”","short":"The middle Jonas Brother channels a road trip on his loose second solo LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/music-for-people-who-believe-in-love/1803502410","playParams":{"id":"1803502410","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZuXKlQ48SrFaJU9KDrIkE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803502410/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"162092469","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/162092469?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008642319,"RTCI":0}}},"1803733232":{"id":"1803733232","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803733232?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/41/fa/1941fa68-dfef-00f5-593c-fd46d93e4070/Job2a0b598d-5993-4549-93d1-e0bd10237a99-192525696-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377092617_2161348168-Time1747254020478.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2d2422"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"494540"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f3c3e","textColor2":"2d2422","textColor4":"4e4646","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"494540","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a0/8e/8e/a08e8ecb-8f74-5630-59a6-588611fcc76f/0b916aa5-e811-4917-83d3-74f4406dfd85.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"363c29","textColor2":"161611","textColor4":"3f3a2a","textColor1":"0b180f","bgColor":"e2cc92","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/5b/b9/07/5bb90731-5257-363d-ff5b-7cf72eac8ee8/Job8eb44479-a8ec-4371-aeff-633c99931339-192525698-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377092616_2161348167-Time1747255975704.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3b3939","textColor2":"312922","textColor4":"514942","textColor1":"151516","bgColor":"d2cac5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7b/a8/48/7ba848f4-0f64-e93a-41d2-131e0e085ddf/dbb46e5f-6fdc-4354-bd2f-574a01bc2ace.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"262525","textColor2":"080608","textColor4":"282627","textColor1":"060505","bgColor":"a8a7a6","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amin%C3%A9/1097595072","name":"13 Months of Sunshine","artistName":"Aminé","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/e4/53/2de453a8-3721-d972-378c-68b2b64154d0/810129980011.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3a3a","textColor2":"161617","textColor4":"3a3a39","textColor1":"161618","bgColor":"cdcac3","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"The Portland rapper broke through in 2016 with the carefree “Caroline” as an eager student of André 3000 and Tyler, The Creator, then spent the next almost-decade finding his own voice: witty but searching, with a penchant for bright, bubbly beats. Now 31, Aminé is ready for a long, five-star vacation on his third studio album, <i>13 Months of Sunshine</i>, his first since 2020’s existential <i>Limbo</i>. (In the years between, he dabbled in hyperpop on 2021’s <i>TWOPOINTFIVE</i> and collaborated with KAYTRANADA on 2023’s <i>KAYTRAMINÉ</i>.) \n\nHe’s in his deep-house bag on “Familiar” and “Vacay,” on which he finds himself two spritzes deep, “out of office” email in effect, draped in a hotel robe, “on my Dua Lipa.” He jets across the pond on “Arc de Triomphe,” skating over a UK garage shuffle that samples The Streets. But it’s not all affogatos and plunge pools: On Leon Thomas duet “New Flower!” he recalls his days as an intern for Complex and Def Jam, remembering being sent to fetch sandwiches for Big Sean. And after a beat switch on Afrobeats bop “13MOS,” he dives deep into his Ethiopian and Eritrean family legacy: “I was named after my grandfather/So, I can’t put shame to the name I’m proud of.”","short":"The Portland rapper is ready for a long vacation on his third studio

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Arriving 20 years after the open political ire of <i>American Idiot</i>, Green Day’s 14th album sees the veteran California punk trio energized by a new wave of worrying trends. Now in his early fifties, singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong retains the snotty defiance that has always been his calling card, whether the stakes are high or low. He doesn’t mince words on opener and lead single “The American Dream Is Killing Me,” calling out the nation’s boom in conspiracy theories and reimagining the classic patriotic lyric “my country, ’tis of thee” as “my country under siege.” \n\nWhile less of a concept album than the rock opera turned stage musical <i>American Idiot</i>, <i>Saviors</i> still latches on to some recurring themes in the name of getting a point across, such as updating 1950s-era rock ’n’ roll tropes: “Bobby Sox” swaps the aw-shucks question “Do you wanna be my girlfriend?” with “Do you wanna be my boyfriend?” while the timeless-sounding romantic ballad “Suzie Chapstick” is timestamped with a reference to absently scrolling Instagram. And “Living in the ’20s” may flash a guitar solo ripped straight from rock’s earliest days, but it also cites the more modern markers of mass shootings and pleasure robots.\n\nArmstrong’s urgent venting is delivered within some of Green Day’s catchiest songs since the 1990s, and longtime producer Rob Cavallo proves just as crucial to the album’s punchy, uncrowded sound as bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer Tré Cool. After all, Cavallo helmed the band’s 1994 smash <i>Dookie</i>, and <i>Saviors</i> sneaks in a few nods to that ripe era too. The sheer simplicity of the chugging chords opening “Strange Days Are Here to Stay” evokes the former album’s hit single “Basket Case,” while the mortality-minded closer “Fancy Sauce” borrows Nirvana’s coupling of “stupid and contagious.” The bubblegum anthem “Look Ma, No Brains!” harks back even further to Green Day’s DIY roots (and before that, pop-punk godfathers the Ramones), further cementing the idea that righteous anger goes down easier smuggled inside a pop song.","short":"The 2024 album gets seven additional tracks, including two acoustic

Even as the Colombian singer saw his profile soar in the wake of his <i>Encanto</i> contribution “Dos Oruguitas,” that genuine nature behind his pop-music stylings proved inextricable on 2022’s ambitious and exploratory <i>Dharma</i>. \n\nHis proper follow-up to that album, <i>Milagro</i> concerns itself with the notion of everyday miracles, starting with the romantic probing of its title track and continuing through the broadly faith-based “Amen” and the “El final que soñábamos.” Obviously, matters of the heart remain a fixture of his songcraft, evident on the yearning pair “La Pelirroja” and “Disco Rayado.” On “Energía Bacana,” he describes a natural emotional high over a slowly paced thump, with handclaps and cheers cropping up intermittently. And while there’s no shortage of ballads here, Yatra concurrently pushes himself sonically further than before, the synth-rock surges of “París” and “Una Noche Sin Pensar” being the most obvious examples. Other shifts come more subtly, by way of the country-infused “La Pelirroja” and the subdued gospel choir of “La Primera Vez.” \n\nThough not wholly central to the album’s personal aims, some meaningful collaborations arise here and there. Sentiments swell with the florid poetry of “Templo de Piceas” opposite HUMBE and amid the tropical extravaganza of single “Vagabundo” with Manuel Turizo and Beéle. Yet it might be the simpler pleasures of a skillful interpolation like the reggaetón rework “2AM” with Bad Gyal that keeps his listeners returning for more.","short":"Miracles of love emerge across the Colombian singer’s latest."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/milagro/1806742507","playParams":{"id":"1806742507","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5yMYOAgxWplaESIY4hZdsR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806742507/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"722264654","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/722264654?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747974553208,"RTCI":0}}},"1806751140":{"id":"1806751140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806751140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3d/78/c7/3d78c7ee-d554-59e0-04c7-449a28d27c9d/Job6b623c9f-ca1a-4dc9-a9a2-8b7dd6fc3ea2-189886610-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371790999_2115965946-Time1744156605567.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f67808"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b0703"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b16f05","textColor2":"f67808","textColor4":"c76007","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b0703","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/45/4b/ed/454bedb3-0181-1dae-c68b-f85d6254f5ba/0242cca8-036a-47ac-be2a-e1f965a51a24.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"523053","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5f404a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ceb6cc","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/7f/d7/01/7fd701aa-9b8e-1cc7-c133-2cb42be822e3/Job7c7740bb-3f01-41ca-9460-f10ebde8cd9e-189886609-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371791000_2115965947-Time1744155462969.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cf7615","textColor2":"e27408","textColor4":"bf6209","textColor1":"f78e17","bgColor":"31180e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/08/a4/86/08a486b2-d884-a135-1173-a5b1940a30c9/4fd2ac4b-b16b-4cff-aa8f-bcd13c681b4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"a9ab88","textColor2":"eb8c41","textColor4":"c2763a","textColor1":"cbcea2","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/22/e1/fc/22e1fc2b-d495-a6b7-2722-4785309cda91/26563c64-67a9-4e70-9386-35ef43cba1e2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e0bfec","textColor2":"fbbef8","textColor4":"e4a4e8","textColor1":"f6dffd","bgColor":"863fa9","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tee-grizzley/1177271472","name":"Forever My Moment","artistName":"Tee Grizzley","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/91/92/0b/91920b16-b793-29d6-bfb2-38c6714619e7/075679613691.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"d07318","textColor2":"e07900","textColor4":"bb6300","textColor1":"fa8d1d","bgColor":"290d02","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“First Day Out” may have thrust Tee Grizzley into breakout rap stardom, but his subsequent eight years of work and dedication have kept him in the conversation. A key and respected part of the contemporary Detroit hip-hop vanguard with some commercial hits under his belt, he brings both confidence and gravity to <i>Forever My Moment</i>. As the opening title track shifts from him spitting raw and a cappella to going in on a bone-chilling Helluva beat, he begins reflecting on how fresh money changed his situation and relationships. \n\nThis lay-of-the-land purview pervades much of the project’s runtime, with Grizzley shaking his head at both the state of the game and its players on “Jalen Hurtski” and “Rick Jameski.” On the provocatively titled (though in no way political) “They Shot at Trump,” he cautions bros and opps alike that anybody can get touched in these streets. Should anyone unaware question Grizzley’s credibility, real moments like “Stash-house in Dearborn” and “Robbery 9” will quell any and all dissent. \n","short":"The Detroit rapper unapologetically assesses the state of the game."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-my-moment/1806751140","playParams":{"id":"1806751140","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6D2Olfcbdp07vl4RwPkPRg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806751140/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1177271472","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1177271472?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008985006,"RTCI":0}}},"1807134886":{"id":"1807134886","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807134886?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Pop Latino","Music","Latin","Música tropical"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/aa/e0/2e/aae02e44-033f-5fd7-f634-b8b915c5b370/Job0d009040-29d5-4fc4-919f-dbbb281bbc6a-191549456-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375077475_2142578220-Time1746113622905.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","001a20"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0f5366"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"031e26","textColor2":"001a20","textColor4":"00323f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0f5366","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/22/48/e1/2248e189-ca43-f415-c231-749304b23675/cd9d9177-e673-4f3d-912b-efd03fcb8f4c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9893a2","textColor2":"d6a493","textColor4":"ae8679","textColor1":"bab4c6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9c/7c/86/9c7c8672-d1c6-f267-717a-355b0cbde24f/Jobd57688ac-a520-4dcc-974f-f215e3c6f619-191549457-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375077476_2142578221-Time1746114740019.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ca8d6d","textColor2":"00cde5","textColor4":"01a7bb","textColor1":"fbad83","bgColor":"091115","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d8/f6/63/d8f6632a-5405-5188-1f62-6cfe8f586fce/9ce2efd1-f716-4f29-9bac-0cb5e72c2f5b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3cbce","textColor2":"fcbe98","textColor4":"d3a98f","textColor1":"e9e9e8","bgColor":"2d5369","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/prince-royce/333299061","name":"ETERNO","artistName":"Prince Royce","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c6/79/af/c679af4a-85c3-26a7-5ad4-c9611303fcee/196872839012.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1d1d5","textColor2":"05c4e4","textColor4":"09a3bf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1a1d2e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"From at least as far back as the days when boogaloo reigned, Latin artists have been inventively covering English-language hits in their own style. Bronx-born star Prince Royce kept that informal tradition going, opening his eponymous 2010 debut with a bachata-fied take on Ben E. King’s “Stand by Me.” Following 2024’s genre-affirming album <i>LLAMADA PERDIDA</i>, his <i>ETERNO</i> revisits the not-so-secret formula behind that early hit, offering tropical interpretations from a predominantly 20th-century songbook. \n\nAs expected, he takes certain bilingual liberties with the material almost immediately, the opening pair of “Dancing in the Moonlight” and “How Deep Is Your Love” made malleable through his approach. His preceding catalog of romantic works, and that silky smooth voice, makes every tweak and quirk a gratifying one, his versions never overstepping the original ubiquitous smashes from Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Stevie Wonder, among others. Though his takes on stone-cold classics certainly shine, Royce’s plays on relatively more modern cuts, like Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way,” stand out in the best way.","short":"The bachata

Release","standard":"The EDM era unofficially began with 2011’s “Levels,” the euphoric breakthrough hit from a then-unknown Swedish DJ that would become something of a Rosetta stone for a generation of bedroom beatsmiths and aspiring party-rockers. With its chipper synth melody and sweet Etta James sample, the song brought dance music to a new stratosphere of mainstream appeal and launched the career of the musician born Tim Bergling, better known as Avicii. He’d spend the next seven years as one of the world’s biggest DJs and a producer known to bridge the gap between electronic music and just about anything else—particularly country, as he pulled off on “Wake Me Up” and “Hey Brother”—before his tragic death in April 2018. \n\n<i>Avicii Forever</i> is the second compilation project dedicated to his legacy, fleshing out 2021’s six-track <i>Live a Life You Will Remember</i> EP into a 20-track selection from his vast discography, including the previously unreleased “Let’s Ride Away,” a song Bergling wrote with Kacey Musgraves before his death that now features vocals from country singer Elle King.","short":"A 20-track selection from the late Swedish DJ’s vast

EP","standard":"Six months after his solo EP debut and roughly a year following his return from mandatory military service, BTS vocalist Jin returned with <i>Echo</i>, a seven-track reflection on life, love, and not worrying too much. Lead single “Don’t Say You Love Me” opens the album with a heart-wrenching tale of lingering love that Jin tells Apple Music “anyone who’s experienced heartbreak will find something deeply relatable [in].”\n\nLike 2024 EP <i>Happy</i>, <i>Echo</i> leans into both Jin’s pop-rock sensibilities (“Loser,” “With the Clouds”) and his penchant for soaring ballads (“Nothing Without Your Love,” “Background,” To Me, Today”). Jin’s goofy charm, previously exemplified by the fishing-focused single “Super Tuna,” is back with “Rope It,” a country-rock track that opens and ends with a horse’s whinny. Jin personally shared his comments on each track to give us an exclusive deeper look into the album.\n\n<b>“Don’t Say You Love Me”</b>\n“It’s a pop song with a simple arrangement and a contrasting blend of emotional, melancholic energy. It tells the story of a painful love—two people who can’t let go, even after their relationship has ended. Anyone who’s experienced heartbreak will find something deeply relatable here. It’s also the first time I took on a romantic role in a music video, so this song holds a special place in my heart and will stay with me for a long time.”\n\n<b>“Nothing Without Your Love”</b>\n“This is my personal favorite from the album. It carries a heartfelt message that ‘you’ are my everything—my reason for being—and without your love, I’m nothing. The song blends a hopeful yet overwhelming surge of emotion, and I hope many of you will feel that and love it as much as I do!”\n\n<b>“Loser”</b>\n“‘Loser’ features YENA, and I’m so grateful she joined me on this track—thank you again! It’s a pop-punk song with a lively yet raw edge, and I think the catchy guitar riff will really stay with you!”\n\n<b>“Rope It”</b>\n“‘Rope It’ is my first time trying out the country rock genre. The lyrics are bold and witty, with a message that regrets won’t help you reach your goals.”\n\n<b>“With the Clouds”</b>\n“Just like its title, ‘With the Clouds’ is a lyrical, fairy-tale-like song. The more you listen, the more its unique charm comes through—I hope you’ll enjoy soaking in that atmosphere.”\n\n<b>“Background”</b>\n“This one’s a ballad pop song that highlights emotional and lyrical depth. My vocals take on a deeper, more mature tone in this song, blending with the full emotional texture of the band’s sound.”\n\n<b>“To Me, Today”</b>\n“I worked on this song with the thought that instead of worrying too much about the future, maybe we should focus on who we are today—a version of ourselves that won’t come again. I hope you savor the happiness of today and spend each day meaningfully with the people you love.”\n","short":"Just six months after his solo debut, the BTS singer is back."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/echo/1808005214","playParams":{"id":"1808005214","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3DmDoHxAeEiDFNWrHSKAdQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808005214/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1191850724","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1191850724?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747989126524,"RTCI":0}}},"1809026285":{"id":"1809026285","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809026285?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/35/fb/3e/35fb3e0a-5465-138d-4c02-2200ec44594e/f7c16214-ac1b-493b-98d6-dbdc66347dfe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cccdd2","textColor2":"dee9e9","textColor4":"c1cacb","textColor1":"ededf2","bgColor":"4a4c52","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dannylux/1523636464","name":"LEYENDA","artistName":"DannyLux","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/82/db/1082db80-1dc0-bb4c-af10-e107a9b25983/5021732777393.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfb0b8","textColor2":"f2dac2","textColor4":"c7b3a2","textColor1":"fbd6dd","bgColor":"1e1824","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"One of the artists at the forefront of the so-called sad sierreño scene, DannyLux cemented his star status with albums like <i>Limerencia</i> and <i>DLUX</i> as well as the occasional Eslabon Armado team-up. Roughly a year after 2024’s extensive <i>EVOLUXION</i> dropped, the California native’s robust follow-up <i>LEYENDA</i> finds the now 21-year-old singer-songwriter augmenting and, at times, intensifying his signature sound. Those eager for more of his lush, moody compositions have plenty to revel and/or wallow in, including “SIRENA” and “MELANCOLÍA:(.” \n\nHe makes heartbreak so deeply relatable on the crushing “YA NO ESTÁS” yet makes a hopeful cast for the promise of true love on the Jasiel Nuñez team-up “Cielo Eterno.” In line with the emotional messiness of crashing out, some of the titles suggest incomplete status or otherwise intentional rawness, with potent yet spare cuts like “no_pasa_nada_demo.wav” and “instinto_natural_demo.wav” conveying a certain intimacy. More fleshed-out takes like “TEN PIEDAD” and the trip-hop-inflected “2025” demonstrate just how large he can make these personal pieces.\n","short":"The sad sierreño star augments and intensifies his sound."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/leyenda/1809026285","playParams":{"id":"1809026285","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1wsPO4l5EFeVpmZESwYWnY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809026285/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1523636464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1523636464?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747974563573,"RTCI":0}}},"1809360938":{"id":"1809360938","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809360938?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Adult Contemporary","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hannah-grace/890939355","name":"Softer -

However, the six-track EP <i>We are</i>, released a few weeks after <i>We are i-dle</i>, marked the five-member group’s first new music as i-dle. \n\nWhile the group may have changed their name in 2025, their sound stayed consistent. After their debut under Cube Entertainment in 2018, i-dle became known as a modern girl group that channels the bold, brash delivery of second-generation K-pop, especially “girl crush” pioneers 2NE1. <i>We are</i>’s lead single “Good Thing” builds on this legacy, pairing retro electropop with Auto-Tune kitsch to evoke the Korean dance pop of the naughts. Like “Good Thing,” pop-rock track “Girlfriend” leans into tongue-in-cheek tackiness to deliver its album-defining statement: “I don't give a fuck about love/’Cause we are i-dle, uh.”\n\nWhile i-dle has written most of their own music, leader SOYEON has historically led those efforts. <i>We are</i> continues a shift towards other members taking a more active part in the songwriting process as both lyricists and composers. On the EP, SOYEON led production on “Good Thing” and “Girlfriend,” with YUQI working on “Tease,” MINNIE on “Chain,” and SHUHUA on “If You Want.” While member MIYEON had previously written lyrics for (G)I-DLE songs, “Unstoppable” marks the first time she composed for the group.\n","short":"The group formerly known as (G)I-DLE changed their name but not their sound."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-are-ep/1810452962","playParams":{"id":"1810452962","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810452962/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1378887586","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1378887586?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008411167,"RTCI":0}}},"1810457254":{"id":"1810457254","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810457254?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/49/49/db/4949db2e-8d35-3cde-4f20-ffd7ab0eec0c/7c74a8af-aefc-4396-acc1-3887a2edb28d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cab696","textColor2":"f5d5ad","textColor4":"ccb393","textColor1":"f3d9b1","bgColor":"262c2b","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a6/cc/3c/a6cc3cad-f8ba-4e33-43c6-2fa6cfffb333/13f76a05-ab2a-416e-8697-1f2c2d3c8272.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3bca0","textColor2":"d39855","textColor4":"b2834d","textColor1":"e8e0bc","bgColor":"30302f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/63/a2/97/63a29723-e931-094d-e89f-2c642a7f9685/c1425227-901c-45d7-994a-db95ce0537e4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c29f","textColor2":"e9c58c","textColor4":"c5a87a","textColor1":"ede5bb","bgColor":"373531","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/myles-smith/1249499491","name":"A Minute, A Moment...","artistName":"Myles Smith","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/76/7b/68767b7b-5f27-8bfa-8f30-d4e886c9d986/196873114255.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"414037","textColor2":"282624","textColor4":"4b483f","textColor1":"1c1c1a","bgColor":"d4d2ac","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Myles Smith bares his soul on his third EP, <i>A Minute, A Moment…</i>, with songs about love, heartbreak, and finding himself. It features six fresh tracks, bundled together with Smith's 2024 EP <i>A Minute...</i>, which features his breakthrough hit, “Stargazing.” The UK singer-songwriter has gone from playing Ed Sheeran covers when he was 11 to supporting his idol on his European tour—and he found time to pick up the Rising Star Award at the 2025 BRITs. The love Smith sings about isn’t always straightforward: He pleads with an ex to get back together on “Made for Me” and finds summer romance on the handclap-heavy “Gold,” but “My First Heartbreak” sees him at his most personal as he shares his feelings about his father leaving the family home: “They say blood’s thicker than water, but I’m closer to the ocean than to you.”\n\nEach of the six new tracks showcases a confident and distinctive sound that mixes pop and country with his trademark vocals, which can easily turn from sweet to powerful. The songs never need to beg for a sing-along, so it’s no surprise he’s attracted collaborators including James Bay and Lainey Wilson, who brings a new perspective to his megahit “Nice to Meet You.” Smith, meanwhile, is keeping his feet firmly on the ground as international success builds. “Ten years ago I thought Luton was the edge of the earth, last year I thought it was England, and now it’s the world,” he tells Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd. “I just want to continue to make music that connects and keep doing what I’m doing.” \n","short":"The singer-songwriter pauses to take stock on his third EP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-minute-a-moment/1810457254","playParams":{"id":"1810457254","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02Im7TTPFgjVmXc3HpIkUj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810457254/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1249499491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249499491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008547626,"RTCI":0}}},"1810587060":{"id":"1810587060","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810587060?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/07/6a/6e/076a6e5b-c4f5-22e2-fca0-0ab43e61ab3d/Job02686b2b-e02e-408e-94fe-07fac5801287-191359524-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374683338_2139345206-Time1745913217689.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","151413"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"85b0aa"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"212d2f","textColor2":"151413","textColor4":"2c3334","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"85b0aa","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6b/4d/7b/6b4d7bc2-0146-c619-d0fd-6399e5812357/Job587e4d0d-3c5a-4a42-b756-669cdbcd7f85-191359523-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374683339_2139345207-Time1745911569188.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","100804"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"85b0aa"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3d342c","textColor2":"100804","textColor4":"3c352e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"85b0aa","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blessing-offor/274532732","name":"The Morning -

I’m going to make reggaetón until I die or retire,” Mora tells Apple Music. “People complain and say Mora is putting out the same thing as always. It sounds the same because this is the music I make. But then, the sarcasm kicks in: I also cover various genres, so it’s not really the same all the time.” After nearly two years without releasing music on his own—following an extensive tour and the birth of his first daughter—the San Juan native didn’t return looking to reinvent the wheel. He committed confidently to his style and, from there, moved into a new artistic era. “If you keep perfecting that personal stamp, you won’t even realize how much you’re innovating.”\n\nThe Puerto Rican artist pushed and permeated genre boundaries repeatedly on albums like <i>MICRODOSIS</i> and <i>ESTRELLA</i>, operating on a cutting edge while drawing upon electronic music nostalgia to fuel his creative aims. With <i>LO MISMO DE SIEMPRE</i>, he’s lost none of that ambitious drive, crafting an ultramodern set of tracks that, once again, position him in a rare class. Whether channeling Eurodance energy on “OTRA NOCHE SIN DORMIR,” reviving 2-step garage for “DE INMEDIATO,” or suffusing synthwave into the Ryan Castro collab “MIL VIDAS,” he’s thriving on what frequently feels like an entirely different wave than other Latin acts. And when he does reach into his reggaetonero bag, the results never disappoint, reveling in the liminal spaces around the dembow drops of “BANDIDA” and celebrating perreo’s past on the referential “DE PAQUETE” with Jory Boy.\n\n“Over time, I’ve learned to create a hybrid in which I can please my fans and, at the same time, preserve my peace of mind,” he explains. As for the collaborations, the list includes names that naturally pique curiosity—like C. Tangana and Ryan Castro—as well as voices from the new Puerto Rican wave, such as Omar Courtz, De La Rose, and Dei V. We spoke with Mora to learn more about some standout tracks on this release.\n\n<b>“TOA” (feat. Young Miko)</b>\u000b\n“I had wanted to work with Young Miko for a long time. I think she brings a fresh vibe, different from what I’ve been doing—she seems super talented. I get along great with her. We’d been saying for a while that we were going to record something, but it hadn’t happened until now that we made it work. Blessings to her and may she keep breaking through.”\n\n<b>“DROGA” (feat. C. Tangana)</b>\u000b\n“The day we recorded this song was a rather peculiar process, because I already had a large part of the track done—maybe about 50 percent, you could say the demo, the idea. And I’ve been in touch with Pucho for several years, but we’d never been able to get into a studio together. Mainly because I spent two or three years in my life barely getting off a plane, doing tours and shows. Only now could I finally take a break, and so could he. He stepped away from music a bit, got more into film, and we hadn’t had that moment to sit down and create. In those conversations, he told me to send him stuff. I sent him this idea, he liked it, and we met during some days he had free in Madrid. That’s where we met and the magic happened.”\n\n<b>“CUANDO ME VAYA”</b>\u000b\n“Obviously, it’s a very intimate song, but I believe that closeness is preserved by me being myself. It’s a very personal track, and for that very reason, people will feel identified with it, because I’m revealing parts of myself that maybe I hadn’t shown before.”\n\n<b>“AURORA” (feat. De La Rose)</b>\u000b\n“I had this track kept in a little glass box because I really wanted it, but I hadn’t had the time or the break. One day, I said, ‘Damn, I’m going to finish it.’ I set out to make the song and completed it—obviously without De La Rose’s verse, which we added when I called her to come to the studio. I loved working with her. I feel she has an incredible voice. And I think she’s just getting started—she still has a long journey ahead. I believe that in a couple of years, she could become one of the best voices in the genre, if she isn’t already. She has so much talent. She knows what she wants to do in the studio. I help in any way I can, but I really didn’t have to do much. She’s always open to feedback, which is also a plus. I can only say I give her infinite thanks for making the time. I hope people love this song, because it’s one of my favorites.”","short":"Another progressive genre journey from the Puerto Rican artist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lo-mismo-de-siempre/1811396930","playParams":{"id":"1811396930","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3beZ5DRcWVTpXaU3ViLIF6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811396930/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1329561467","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1329561467?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748006347913,"RTCI":0}}},"1811421162":{"id":"1811421162","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811421162?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap","Alternative Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/erick-the-architect/1206058507","name":"ARCSTRUMENTALS 3 - Single","artistName":"Erick the Architect","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/57/b5/f7/57b5f7e7-1174-63a4-1eb3-dcef983098ca/3663729378774_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4500,"textColor3":"cf405c","textColor2":"f5394f","textColor4":"c82e40","textColor1":"fe4f72","bgColor":"130304","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/arcstrumentals-3-single/1811421162","playParams":{"id":"1811421162","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811421162/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1206058507","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1206058507?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747951972296,"RTCI":0}}},"1811559961":{"id":"1811559961","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811559961?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/k-camp/280021267","name":"Built Different (Deluxe)","artistName":"K CAMP","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4f/4f/47/4f4f4733-7c38-a86c-d543-a74bc406ea09/198704489945_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"e6c1c2","textColor2":"f4e5e5","textColor4":"e2b7b7","textColor1":"f9f2f2","bgColor":"980001","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"To survive like Atlanta’s K CAMP has, you have to be Teflon-tough. Enter his 2025 album, <i>Built Different</i>, a collection of cuts equal parts introspective and club-ready that find the middle ground between his melodic tendencies and ATL roots. On “Consequences,” he spits over a rubbery bass groove and a soul sample that gives a jolt to the song’s minimalist edge. He laments the times he’s succumbed to weakness, knowing that he’ll do better next time he’s faced with similar challenges. It’s all part of being built differently. He raps, “Give it all to God, please forgive me for my sins/I lost family, I lost friends.” There’s a duality on the album that helps illustrate K CAMP’s humanity, like how he can go from sadly

DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. This month’s mix, designed for running, was put together by Kaskade (born Ryan Raddon), a longtime fixture in North America’s EDM scene who considers himself a bit of a health nut. “[Health] is on par with sleeping and breathing,” he tells Apple Music. “Without it, life becomes very uncomfortable.”\n\nRaddon used to be an avid runner, and he crafted this mix to be a partner on the road. “Pounding my feet to the beat always helped me push my pace,” he says. “We all want to have a decent runway up to our high point, and we all want to have that feel-good letdown as we’re nearing the end. The middle? That’s all apex energy, hopefully carrying the listener past any barrier they’ve been looking to cross. Maybe today is the day you get your personal best.” \n\nThese days, Raddon, now based in Los Angeles, is more drawn to surfing and yoga, but says he still relies on playlists to help him level up. “Music can make or break any type of session,” he says. “I’m hoping to encourage people who are using this mix to keep going, whether it’s day one or they’re a lifer. Follow the beat, find your groove, get one more rep, one more step.” \n","short":"The EDM trailblazer and self-described health nut crafts a custom running mix."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-may-2025-dj-mix/1811699394","playParams":{"id":"1811699394","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811699394/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2827464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2827464?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747348237803,"RTCI":0}}},"1811714494":{"id":"1811714494","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811714494?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/50/4b/ff/504bff78-6ec9-ef34-e4ba-1b6504261716/ce8e12c8-dc47-4086-b719-c7665762d756.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e19e84","textColor2":"fb8c8f","textColor4":"e37a7d","textColor1":"f8b998","bgColor":"843234","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/estelle/27060010","name":"Stay Alta","artistName":"Estelle","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7b/03/ee/7b03eefc-fe62-bd2f-3c43-ffaa3fd2b8c9/1963623224453_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1a2623","textColor2":"100f0f","textColor4":"1f2927","textColor1":"090a0a","bgColor":"5e9487","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I’m the girl with crystals in her hair,” begins “Outside,” the opening track of <i>Stay Alta</i>, the first Estelle album since 2018’s <i>Lovers Rock</i>. “Diamond is the life that’s in her head/Everything is just a little rare,” she continues. “Outside” is a declaration of the overwhelming joy and self-assurance the singer is hoping to spread with the album. She dabbles mostly in disco, house, and funk, effectively throwing a dance party in the name of hope and perseverance.\n\nAnd what good is a party without a few guests? <i>Stay Alta</i>’s title track features Compton producer and MC Channel Tres, while Cleveland-hailing singer Durand Bernarr brings a bit of ballroom flair to “Let It Drop.” In a nod to the pandemic-defining DJ sets that kept the world sane, legendary producer and DJ D-Nice brings his master of ceremonies ability to “Love on Love,” proclaiming “Now’s the time to celebrate each other”—which is all Estelle is really asking, for us to appreciate one another.

Album","standard":"While Latin stars now regularly dabble in Afrobeats as a pop music cheat code, Beéle was one of a rare few Spanish-language artists to commit to exploring that sound. With an ear for global polyrhythms and a penchant for romantic lyricism, the Colombian singer became reliably known for his singles in a distinct style that commingled with concurrent tropical music trends. On <i>BORONDO</i>, his long-awaited debut album, he shares an even broader sonic vision that both builds on that reputation and expands upon it. \n\nExpected expressions of his West African influences—“mad koknut” and “i miss you”—arrive alongside less anticipated artistic explorations like the warbling, ambient post-rock of “una vez al mes” and the surreally swirling “hotel east.” His knack for the laidback comes through on tracks like “si te pillara” and “top diesel,” but he’s experienced enough now to change it up for “una curita por favor” or the dance-floor-primed “no tiene sentido.” Topically, he’s as amorous as ever on the somewhat idiosyncratic “sobelove” and perhaps at his most sensitive on the descriptive “frente al mar.”\n\nThroughout <i>BORONDO</i>, Beéle reinforces his worldwide connections, linking with hitmaking Nigerian producer Thisizlondon for “si mañana me muero” and salsa superstar Marc Anthony for “Dios me oyó.” Esteemed Mexican singer Carla Morrison proves an ideal duet partner on “arena,” yet some of the most gratifying collaborations here are wholly homegrown ones, with Nanpa Básico sharing his heartache on “hasta aquí llegué” and no less than Ovy On the Drums co-headlining the balmy yet energetic “mi refe.”","short":"The Colombian singer’s debut exceeds Afrobeats expectations."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/borondo/1812536829","playParams":{"id":"1812536829","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4xMNn5AFdmBIYiXRbt5YH4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812536829/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1470139605","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1470139605?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008919705,"RTCI":0}}},"1813003804":{"id":"1813003804","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813003804?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/treaty-oak-revival/1493691515","name":"The Talco Tapes","artistName":"Treaty Oak Revival","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9a/b9/17/9ab917a8-1474-7c69-a84c-57582ec1947d/198704397448_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"1b1e1d","textColor2":"060406","textColor4":"1d1e1e","textColor1":"040405","bgColor":"7a847c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Treaty Oak Revival revisits some of their best-loved tracks on this stripped-down acoustic collection, which pulls material from the Odessa, Texas, act’s first two full-length albums, 2021’s <i>No Vacancy</i> and 2023’s <i>Have a Nice Day</i> and tosses in a cover for good measure. Known for their rough and rowdy approach to country rock, the band still sounds raw and potent with these toned-down arrangements, which offer a little more space for lead vocalist Sam Canty to wrench emotion out of the songs’ often narrative lyrics. \n\nRecorded at the SoundBank Studios in Talco, Texas, <i>The Talco Tapes</i> kicks off with “I’m the Worst,” a fan favorite that, in this incarnation, sounds twangier than its sludgy studio counterpart. “Boomtown” swaps the Tom Petty influence of the original for a more Red Dirt sound, with pristine pedal steel cutting through acoustic guitar. “Ode to Bourbon” dials up the harmonies, and “Fishnets” gets a touch of tenderness that suits the song’s complicated story. The band rounds out the project with a cover of The Goo Goo Dolls’ 1995 smash “Name,” turning in a faithful performance that retains the emotional intensity of the original.\n","short":"The rough and rowdy Texas act strips down some fan favorites."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-talco-tapes/1813003804","playParams":{"id":"1813003804","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4EEXpOAW6fuB8zB8yPfVFj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813003804/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1493691515","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1493691515?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748009206479,"RTCI":0}}},"1813018117":{"id":"1813018117","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813018117?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":30,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-22","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/michael-abels/351805285","name":"Sirens (Soundtrack from the Netflix Series)","artistName":"Michael Abels","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/dc/be/aedcbe3f-953c-87c0-0f26-6a7d954abf03/810123166572.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4e4c4b","textColor2":"32313b","textColor4":"53525a","textColor1":"2d2928","bgColor":"d6dad9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sirens-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-series/1813018117","playParams":{"id":"1813018117","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/78AH21pHM7VP1Xuu8KzuHE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813018117/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"351805285","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/351805285?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747974660691,"RTCI":0}}},"1813340934":{"id":"1813340934","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813340934?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jeff-russo/61738994","name":"The Last Rodeo (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Jeff Russo","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c5/da/23/c5da239a-b250-0e92-fc3e-2ec623a6436e/780163672527.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363431","textColor2":"412a1c","textColor4":"645044","textColor1":"070705","bgColor":"f1eae4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-rodeo-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1813340934","playParams":{"id":"1813340934","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Ky0ZedQ0PSjj8Dsm7i0TV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813340934/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"61738994","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/61738994?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747974510687,"RTCI":0}}},"1813421501":{"id":"1813421501","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813421501?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b7/ff/eb/b7ffebcc-aab9-0aa9-1bcd-3de0407edd5d/ea49bf99-3cfa-4dc4-a125-76185decca96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3e3e","textColor2":"2c2c2c","textColor4":"545454","textColor1":"101010","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7a/2f/56/7a2f56e5-e110-7981-2496-e7e1bd9bb764/c180f8f8-63bf-4fc4-a2b7-25ced2cf1cd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"f0d2b2","textColor4":"c8b096","textColor1":"eeeeee","bgColor":"282828","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ad/d4/f8/add4f8ba-cffc-4914-6be0-7b7b2209a925/cde2a5de-a5c7-4e37-a4ab-48fd6f279a26.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"434343","textColor2":"313131","textColor4":"585858","textColor1":"161616","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/snoop-dogg/21769","name":"Iz It a Crime?","artistName":"Snoop Dogg","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/fe/32/1efe3246-7f09-2940-18ba-1658bc739de2/764656318406_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b19d82","textColor2":"d2a87e","textColor4":"ab8968","textColor1":"dbc1a0","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I can write the words, but the music has to match the energy,” Snoop Dogg tells Apple Music. “And it just feels like when we own that shit on the West, we great at that shit.” Since his 2022 acquisition of Death Row Records, he has wasted little time in repositioning the infamous record label that propelled him to stardom. From bringing on new R&B signees JANE HANDCOCK and October London to facilitating the returns of Tha Eastsidaz and Tha Dogg Pound, as well as seemingly riskier moves like blockchain drops and a gospel compilation, Snoop’s updated model benefits from having him at the center. “I was on this label when it was started and I seen all the pluses and the things that worked,” he says. “I seen the things that hadn’t been tapped into. So as I hold it as the owner, it’s my job to give it life, to give it love.”\n\nFollowing last December’s long-awaited Dr. Dre reunion <i>Missionary</i>, the ever-entrepreneurial Long Beach native drops a sizable solo album that merges West Coast rap nostalgia with the modern touches expected from an industry impresario. <i>Iz It a Crime?</i> not only nods to the Sade classic liberally sampled on its probing title track, but more broadly addresses a worldview that comes from lived experience, as a man and as an artist. “I’ve never been afraid to try different things when it comes to music, because that’s what music is,” he says. “It’s a universal language of all people. And once you’ve mastered a craft of your voice and who you are, you should be able to do any style of music when you want.”\n\nFurthermore, his latest comes at a time of existential triumph for Los Angeles hip-hop, a scene for which he serves as a long-standing load-bearing pillar. “The original West Coast sound was drug-related gang-bang music that made you act ignorant,” he says. “It was that sound of representation, like wherever you was from, what part of the city, what gang you was from.”\n\nOne can hear Snoop’s proud ownership of that history on “Joy,” a bombastic series of slickly executed references, and on “Sophisticated Crippin’,” a laidback throwback teeming with success-story energy. As he emphasizes that elder-statesman swag, he also brings in fresher faces like LaRussell (“Can’t Wait”) and Sexyy Red (“Me N OG Snoop”), both to share the spotlight and to double down on his legacy-building enterprise. Yet <i>Iz It a Crime?</i> feels truly special when he’s reconnecting with older hitmaking pals, vibing luxuriously with Wiz Khalifa on “Just the Way It Iz” and retooling the funk on “Spot” with Pharrell Williams, a longtime collaborator. “I love music,” Snoop says. “I don’t feel like I am just a slouch or a pushover. I feel like I’m a great musician and a great voice.”\n","short":"The Doggfather mixes modernity and nostalgia on his solo

Album","standard":"If RIIZE’s first full-length album is meant to be a culmination of the moments they experienced in their first 20 months as a K-pop group, then “Fly Up” is a fitting lead single. The feel-good dance track channels a similar energy to RIIZE’s debut hit “Get a Guitar,” which also leaned into an unabashedly cheesy 1950s rock ’n’ roll sound when it was released in September 2023. While “Get a Guitar” chose a retro guitar riff as its signature sound, “Fly Up” uses choral vocals to hook listeners.\n\nThe group’s “emotional pop” concept is musically flexible, and <i>ODYSSEY</i> taps into different genres to tell its story of youth as a joyful time full of moments worth remembering. Instrumental interlude “Passage” separates the more upbeat first half of the album (UK garage track “Odyssey,” hip-hop banger “Bag Bad Back,” anthemic pop song “Ember to Solar,” “Fly Up,” and pop-rock bop ”Show Me Love”) from the slower, more sentimental second half (the dreamy, bass-driven “Midnight Mirage,” fan ballads “The End of the Day” and “Inside My Love,” and soaring album ender “Another Life”). \n\nBehind-the-scenes music-makers on <i>ODYSSEY</i> include K-pop hitmakers Jacob Aaron (“Fly Up” and “Bag Bad Back”), KENZIE (“Ember to Solar” and “Inside My Love”), and danke (“Midnight Mirage”) and Korean rapper BIGONE (“Bag Bad Back”). “What if we could go back/To another life?” Korean lyricist Moon Seolree writes for RIIZE on “Another Life,” granting members Shotaro, Eunseok, Sungchan, Wonbin, Sohee, and Anton a musical opportunity to reflect on their journey from trainees to K-pop idols. “If the me of that time looked at me now/What would I say?”\n","short":"The group’s

Album","standard":"If New Orleans MC Rob49’s <i>Let Me Fly</i> was an IRL coming-out party, it’s likely one you wouldn’t be able to get into. Just look at who showed up to pay homage: The album has features from Lil Wayne, Cardi B, Fridayy, Meek Mill, Sexyy Red, Quavo, G Herbo, YTB Fatt, and Polo G, and an increasingly rare appearance from Cash Money Records impresario Bryan “Birdman” Williams, who pops up just to talk shit between a few Rob49 verses (“Get the Picture,” “JetWifi”). Artists—as well as fans—love Rob49, and not just for his impossible-to-see-coming runaway smash “WTHELLY.” \n\nThe MC has plenty to offer, and he offers plenty of it across <i>Let Me Fly</i>’s 22 tracks. There are songs for war (“Get the Picture,” “Supposedly,” “On Sight”), for celebrating (“BLOUSIN,” “High or What”), for repenting (“Hear Me Momma”), for those in need of motivation (“Pick Your Poison,” “Widebody”), for women who think he’s sexy (“So Sexyy,” “I Swear to God,” “Tell Nobody”), for the dawgs locked away (“Where I’m From”), and a few for day-one Rob49 fans (“Wassam Baby,” “Off Dat Drank”). He’s got an authentic New Orleans accent and a voice with the kind of bass young men used to emulate when they wanted to sound cool over the phone. And to be fair, Rob49 does sound cool. And unbothered. And like someone you wouldn’t want to piss off. Basically, he is the rap superstar archetype. \n","short":"Twenty-two tracks to let us know exactly “WTHELLY” talking about."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-me-fly/1814504205","playParams":{"id":"1814504205","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3woBbUgNffkEWibKKIBXJT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814504205/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1503242655","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1503242655?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008642643,"RTCI":0}}},"1814696886":{"id":"1814696886","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814696886?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":33,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=316069-73713567-1736630828-3293014","name":"Hell's Kitchen (Original Broadway Cast Recording) [Deluxe Edition]","artistName":"Alicia Keys, Shoshana Bean, Maleah Joi Moon & Tank","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/65/c3/a065c392-a9ce-6d6d-62d7-b9f4743582bb/198704397387_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c6d6ef","textColor2":"e6c816","textColor4":"baaf37","textColor1":"f5fafd","bgColor":"094ab8","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hells-kitchen-original-broadway-cast-recording-deluxe/1814696886","playParams":{"id":"1814696886","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5TDxRscOcJrzODjFfP2i9W"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814696886/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"316069","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/316069?l=en-US"},{"id":"73713567","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/73713567?l=en-US"},{"id":"1736630828","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1736630828?l=en-US"},{"id":"3293014","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3293014?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747975437282,"RTCI":0}}},"1814697919":{"id":"1814697919","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814697919?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance","Breakbeat"],"releaseDate":"1998-07-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1f/1f/73/1f1f7353-89ed-3570-41f4-53e8c14d6664/e6611198-f778-4e8b-ad40-ac660eb960eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c8c8","textColor2":"d2d3d3","textColor4":"abacac","textColor1":"f4f6f6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/josh-wink/999424","name":"Josh Wink presents Found Sounds at Twilo, NYC, Jul 24, 1998 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Josh Wink","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/78/d8/9b/78d89bb8-7255-14b4-b3ca-86377d33bd9a/bc743842-a3f6-4823-b885-cad937f80b22.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dbb981","textColor2":"ffc66d","textColor4":"dcac73","textColor1":"fed67f","bgColor":"50468b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/josh-wink-presents-found-sounds-at-twilo-nyc-jul-24/1814697919","playParams":{"id":"1814697919","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814697919/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"999424","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/999424?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747971089749,"RTCI":0}}},"1814708056":{"id":"1814708056","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814708056?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-21","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/babydrill/1611221118","name":"Cry For Help","artistName":"BabyDrill","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/46/cc/11/46cc115e-dc67-241b-dba3-2b514090a817/196873107523.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"383737","textColor2":"2d2b2a","textColor4":"525151","textColor1":"0c0a09","bgColor":"eaeaec","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Atlanta MC BabyDrill is a straight shooter with very little patience for anyone who isn’t. “N***a, I’m ski’d up in the winter/N***a, I’m ski’d up in the summer/I spin shit ’bout my gang, n***a/I kill shit ’bout my mama,” he raps on <i>Cry for Help</i> standout “Murk Sum.” “He went from catching doors to slanging poles/Boy, that boy a ho/Why the fuck you acting like you a shooter?/Know you never scored.” \n\nKeeping it gutter is paramount across the project, an endeavor fortified by the company the MC keeps.

He’s joined by New York rap royalty on two occasions here—first by Bronx drill princess Ice Spice on the mellowed “Pillsbury Dlow” and then by Coke Boys don French Montana for the effortlessly swaggering “Mo Chicken.” Elsewhere, he trades off with Lil Baby and NoCap on “PJ” and “What You Need,” respectively, reminding that the South still has something to say.","short":"The Florida rap phenom shoots a game-winning buzzer-beater from deep."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dlow-curry-deluxe/1814729208","playParams":{"id":"1814729208","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6GuthNCWjSFsAFoKsnIBR7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814729208/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1474308236","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1474308236?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748009124479,"RTCI":0}}},"1814735585":{"id":"1814735585","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814735585?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-22","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f0/33/e6/f033e6d4-1b45-3701-b073-b4987080ec00/fb8609f0-d83c-48a0-ad03-5c40cfe7c9dd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c59e7e","textColor2":"dbb48b","textColor4":"b29070","textColor1":"f3c69c","bgColor":"0f0104","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/32/56/ef32567f-1b49-c451-52cb-b995166a8229/43b00545-7dfd-43c8-9636-661a3dae732a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b09996","textColor2":"f4b591","textColor4":"c59174","textColor1":"dabfbb","bgColor":"090100","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/car%C3%ADn-le%C3%B3n/1370196486","name":"Palabra De To's (Seca)","artistName":"Carín León","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ef/06/7a/ef067a8a-35ea-56e1-8179-c411d98ff65c/00198704515392_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"b6b3a7","textColor2":"c6c9c4","textColor4":"a4a3a0","textColor1":"dcdccd","bgColor":"1d0f0f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"For Carín León, música mexicana is more than just the chosen genre that brought him fame and fortune. That should be obvious to anyone familiar with the Sonoran singer’s growing catalog of work, the genuine love for these sounds and the traditions that guide them evident on his studio recordings as well as some rousing live albums. Meant as a heartfelt return to genre roots following 2024’s hour-long <i>Boca Chueca, Vol. 1</i>, this album brought him back to his hometown of Hermosillo to record. With some curatorial guidance from hitmaking figure Edgar Barrera, <i>Palabra De To’s</i> primarily favors Mexican songwriters to pay overt homage while perpetuating his country’s musical legacy.\n\nDespite the Last Supper theme conjured by the cover art, these 16 tracks are largely devoid of collaborations, with the welcome exception of Luis Mexia on the self-aware “Ocupo Una Limpia.” As such, León’s performances take on a certain intimacy, unhurried by obligations and unencumbered by distractions. On opener “Enséñame,” his reliably robust voice shakes under the sheer weight of sentiments as it beauteously approaches falsetto. Though he regains his strength on the powerful “Lado Frágil,” vulnerable moments nonetheless abound. Throughout the album, he shows off different aspects of his range: a rakish romantic on “Modo Zombie,” a heartbroken hero on “El Amor De Mi Herida,” a dour drinker on “El Curioso.” The longing suffused through closer “Eres Y Serás” grows in size during its instrumental break, the harmonica saying more than even he could sing.\n","short":"Hermosillo’s finest adds four more to this homegrown affair."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palabra-de-tos-seca/1814735585","playParams":{"id":"1814735585","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/37R1JCesvIct4jBsS4bW8P"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814735585/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1370196486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1370196486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748008671592,"RTCI":0}}},"1814735619":{"id":"1814735619","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814735619?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-21","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ac/99/7c/ac997cfa-a570-6a7e-ef8e-7328efc192cb/Job89654799-8341-4ce5-bea4-40fc308f0fd6-192944345-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377969948_2170509883-Time1747787334816.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1f232d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"101010"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"1f232d","textColor4":"4c4f57","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"101010","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a7/a7/97/a7a797ec-9940-7dcb-9c08-033c8dc98aed/e2361ebf-cce6-432e-ab06-7cce0cab3cf4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6c6bb","textColor2":"dce4f2","textColor4":"b4bbc7","textColor1":"f3f3e3","bgColor":"12151a","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/fd/51/7f/fd517f5c-7efd-c9f0-60be-a76dffc0c460/Job72637794-e168-4ffd-9146-8a1d44a907e5-192944346-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377969947_2170509884-Time1747788447433.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"222222","textColor4":"4e4e4e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=6870108-1538757364-294290841","name":"Lilo & Stitch (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu, Iam Tongi & Dan Romer","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/65/7b/a8/657ba834-b841-f421-64b9-144bc5d56d44/25UMGIM68227.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"262d3c","textColor4":"515763","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","short":"The live-action remake gets a glorious and exciting score—plus an Elvis tune!"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lilo-stitch-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1814735619","playParams":{"id":"1814735619","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814735619/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6870108","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6870108?l=en-US"},{"id":"1538757364","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1538757364?l=en-US"},{"id":"294290841","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/294290841?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1747977628151,"RTCI":0}}},"1815055196":{"id":"1815055196","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815055196?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/voice-of-baceprot/1379069961","name":"TRANSISI -

Springsteen’s impassioned intro to “Land of Hope and Dreams”—a late-’90s fan-favorite that eventually appeared on 2012’s <i>Wrecking Ball</i>—invoked America’s “incompetent and treasonous” administration, which did not escape the attention of said administration’s leader. The band and crowd respond in kind, audibly gassed up, and the song ends with an interpolation of Curtis Mayfield’s “People Get Ready” that feels as inspirational as it does ominous.\n\nOf course, the nexus of inspirational and ominous has been Springsteen’s home turf for over 50 years, just as much as New Jersey has, and he is clearly galvanized by his easy access to a microphone and tens of thousands of rapt listeners when the stakes are so high. His speech preceding the post-9/11 elegy “My City of Ruins” runs three and a half minutes, doubling down on the sentiment of his opening remarks by quoting James Baldwin and reckoning with the difference between the “real” America he’s written about for five decades and the one he now condemns. Ending with a rousing version of Bob Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom,” this EP’s mere existence less than a week after the show itself is no doubt meant both to amplify the message and further agitate its subject, a canny move that reasserts that Springsteen is at his best when there is a moment to meet.","short":"Come for the four live tracks, stay for the defiant between-song
