Album","standard":"For more than a decade, the musician born Nat Ćmiel has been exploring what it means to be a 21st-century human (or post-human): On 2022’s <i>Glitch Princess</i>, yeule probed the limits of the flesh by way of modulated vocals and decaying Danny L Harle beats; on 2023’s <i>softscars</i>, the artist who once identified as a cyborg tiptoed into the corporeal world, inspired by the fuzzy rock music of the late ’90s. Their fourth album, <i>Evangelic Girl Is a Gun</i>, takes their glitchy avant-pop even further out of the matrix, eschewing Auto-Tune entirely to showcase their vocals at their rawest and most visceral. \n\nEnchantingly abject vignettes about doomed love and ego death play out over sexy-sad soundscapes that draw from ’90s trip-hop and alt-rock, with production from Mura Masa, A. G. Cook, and Clams Casino. Imagine the most morose possible version of a Charli xcx song and you’ve got the title track, on which yeule purrs dispassionately: “Nosebleed on the Sunset Strip/He picks me up in a fast whip/He laces up my leather boots/He wears a blood-stained velvet suit.”\n","short":"Enchantingly abject vignettes about doomed love and ego death."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evangelic-girl-is-a-gun/1790541064","playParams":{"id":"1790541064","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YYPOxN7WrWD3ygAP5KB50"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790541064/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1145023145","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1145023145?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748613091393,"RTCI":0}}},"1792042033":{"id":"1792042033","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792042033?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/92/e2/ee/92e2eeb4-1857-61bc-7e92-cf010ce396f4/Job1b9c7c64-5af2-492a-b5fc-854478617373-189252083-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370541483_2106083040-Time1743446165036.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"e16a00","textColor4":"b45500","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/97/ff/1f/97ff1f50-2822-7dc5-419b-aa698b18d16c/Job57abd063-5ac2-41c1-a730-84f9a58eee93-189252084-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370541482_2106083039-Time1743448314114.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"a88a78","textColor2":"f86300","textColor4":"ca5202","textColor1":"cda994","bgColor":"140e0a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aesop-rock/3858833","name":"Black Hole Superette","artistName":"Aesop Rock","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/52/e0/23/52e0231a-ea4e-fe32-a681-610482d30ac7/51795.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a88b74","textColor2":"f06000","textColor4":"c45002","textColor1":"cdaa8e","bgColor":"13100b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Aesop Rock does not talk or tour. He has not been on a stage since 2017 or been interviewed since 2020. Instead, what one of his generation’s most recognizable and masterful voices continues to do as he enters the back half of his forties is rap—four albums since 2020 alone, each filled with his most harrowing or humorous experiences and a seemingly dauntless supply of esoteric or obvious enthusiasms. When he barks, “Anomaly in the algorithm, do the algebralculus/I’m all of Alexandria’s information in aggregate” at the start of “Checkers,” from his sprawling <i>Black Hole Superette</i>, it feels like he’s supplying a thesis statement of one—to be one of rap’s great outsiders, his rhymes free to do whatever they want.\n\nWould anyone else dare, after all, to spend three minutes chronicling the exponential growth curve of the snail population inside the aquarium he bought for his girlfriend, as he does on the dazzling “Snail Zero”? Or to use his dog’s mutt status and his cat’s tumescence to form a sort of superhero posse, as on “Movie Night”? Aesop Rock gets from Francis Bacon to H Mart, from EPMD to shaving cream and Nautica parkas, from the escape of his childhood hamster to the survival of Lahaina’s banyan tree in a matter of a few rhythmically intricate verses over spring-loaded beats. “Whole worth wrapped in what you can make with your bare hands/When sitting independent of the greater square dance,” he offers at one point, as if sneering at the music industry from the perfect privacy of his own studio. Indeed, no one else sounds or moves like Aesop Rock; on <i>Black Hole Superette</i>, he’s perhaps never sounded more like himself. \n\nThe landmark track here might be “John Something,” where Aesop relays a story from his college days in Massachusetts above a hard-edged piano cut between percolating hand drums. It’s the tale of a visiting artist, possibly named John, who shows up to class to share slides of his photos but mostly just extols the Foreman-versus-Ali documentary <i>When We Were Kings</i>. Aesop rushed out to see the film and then felt its rush of excitement for himself, as he understood how vivid and compelling good storytelling might be. The gift of that artist was not his own work, but the enthusiasm he passed along for great work. It is clear that Aesop Rock—who counts Lupe Fiasco, Armand Hammer, and Open Mike Eagle as guests here—has passed that energy along to his successors and peers, even as he has remained on the industry’s outskirts. Thing is, he happens to remain one of the best rappers working too.","short":"One of rap’s great outsiders has never sounded more like himself."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-hole-superette/1792042033","playParams":{"id":"1792042033","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/63y5mkLctupacSr20e0O6j"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792042033/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3858833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3858833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748581031701,"RTCI":0}}},"1793295050":{"id":"1793295050","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793295050?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/indifferent-engine/1196693755","name":"Speculative Fiction","artistName":"Indifferent Engine","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/55/bb/39/55bb394e-36b7-1c0d-de21-e64d1fca2e6a/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9647a","textColor2":"f371a7","textColor4":"c25a86","textColor1":"fb7d99","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/speculative-fiction/1793295050","playParams":{"id":"1793295050","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/32hjfQjmve1w0hIvuRNZSJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1793295050/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1196693755","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1196693755?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748579650523,"RTCI":0}}},"1796268058":{"id":"1796268058","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796268058?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/be/b9/69beb9a3-1080-8005-b78a-54d67f34e039/2b8621e3-ab0f-4a01-9361-a1d490bfd9e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a59595","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b2918d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/quantic/5054367","name":"DJ - Kicks: Quantic (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Quantic","artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/97/a5/06/97a506d1-46fe-34e2-a972-6b8d0bf6f0fa/4062548111514.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2000,"textColor3":"cecdca","textColor2":"f6dbbb","textColor4":"cab69e","textColor1":"faf7f2","bgColor":"1f2229","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","short":"Globally minded funk, soul, cumbia, and more from the UK DJ/producer."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dj-kicks-quantic-dj-mix/1796268058","playParams":{"id":"1796268058","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796268058/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5054367","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5054367?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748559352497,"RTCI":0}}},"1796272680":{"id":"1796272680","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796272680?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/matt-oakley/1614926512","name":"Outside Looking In","artistName":"Matt Oakley","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/67/0c/ff/670cff53-e694-b765-31c3-61caaf928d37/199066682234.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c98d53","textColor2":"e0994e","textColor4":"ba8041","textColor1":"f4a965","bgColor":"211f0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/outside-looking-in/1796272680","playParams":{"id":"1796272680","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2zndTekq5KiyTAvBgagYg6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796272680/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1614926512","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1614926512?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748381941536,"RTCI":0}}},"1796622545":{"id":"1796622545","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796622545?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/swans/5580746","name":"Birthing","artistName":"Swans","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/18/5a/e2/185ae266-b299-4e1f-c08b-eac5592996f4/658457066867_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"29231c","textColor2":"1e1612","textColor4":"403429","textColor1":"000102","bgColor":"cbaa84","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Two hours of unrelenting dread and dynamics.

Yet, on their third album <i>Open</i>, they decided to break their sonic mold, and create something unexpectedly new.\n\nThe result is 14 journeying, deeply expressive tracks traversing everything from the melodic ambience of opener “Home” to the UK grime textures of the title track, uptempo house beats of “I Need You,” and dub-laden explorations of “Closer.” Throughout, the pair also extend their list of collaborators to include British rapper Samson, Ethiopian singer Haile Supreme, and Dutch composer Joep Beving.\n\n“We’re in our forties now and this record is a personal journey expressing not only being open to other music but also to new people and opinions,” Smeets says. “That’s a message we want people to take away when they listen, to be open to each other.” Read on for Dam Swindle’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Home”</b>\nLars Dales: “This track started out as a kind of sonic exploration led by Maarten and hasn’t changed that much overall. We felt like there needed to be a moment to elevate it though, and so we took inspiration from having Tom Misch solo on our previous song, ‘Yes, No, Maybe’ [from 2018’s <i>High Life</i>], which really changed the tone of it. We got in touch with our friend Valentijn Bannier, who’s an incredible guitarist, and he delivered a great solo, all recorded in the first take. It transforms the song.”\n\n<b>“Not Enough” (feat. Haile Supreme)</b>\nMaarten Smeets: “We started this one with a really cool loop from a soul track and built it to be sample-heavy, until we discovered Haile Supreme’s music through his work with Nightmares On Wax and realized that his falsetto would be so nice over the instrumental. We got in touch with him, took out the samples, and recorded the whole thing again with live keys, trumpet, and flutes. I cried when he sent his demo over since it was completely perfect.”\n\n<b>“The Present Is Always Perfect”</b>\nLD: “This one was on the shelf for a very long time because we had a bunch of tracks that felt too floaty and atmospheric, and while we both loved them, it seemed like they would never fit in anywhere. We eventually decided it needed to be on the album because it’s the perfect house track that’s still us but with an added dreaminess and atmosphere to it. It sets up the rest of the record really well.”\n\n<b>“Girl” (feat. Faye Meana)</b>\nMS: “‘Girl’ has the most classic Dam Swindle percussion and groove on the album. We initially used vocal samples chopped in, but the longer we worked on it, the more it felt like it would be better as a stripped-back beat for a vocal. I had listened to one of Faye Meana’s tracks and realized that if I pitched it down, her pre-existing vocal would work perfectly over this beat. We ended up sending it to her and asked if she could do something similar and she was cool. We recorded it in two hours in London.”\n\n<b>“Run, Run, Run”</b>\nMS: “This track is our electronic exploration with Detroit keys, mainly using the Prophet-6 synth. We worked with Boye Ingwersen, who makes music in our studio complex, and he’s jazz trained on the keys so that means he really elevates every track he’s on with his chops—he takes the atmosphere to the next level. On ‘Run, Run, Run,’ his playing sucks you into a new microcosm.”\n\n<b>“Only Ever Now”</b>\nLD: “‘Only Ever Now’ feels like new territory for us since it’s a synth-heavy, upbeat track—something that feels like a Daphni tune or the UK in summer. We came up with it when we were in Vancouver gigging and Maarten showed me the track during some downtime between shows. I ended up creating the chord progression, and then we sped the whole thing up to be super club-ready while keeping the groove very ‘us.’”\n\n<b>“Open” (feat. Samson)</b>\nLD: “We had the instrumental for this down from the very beginning but then we ended up trying so many different vocals on it that it became the last track we finished. People kept picking up on the softness of the track but we thought it had more of a grimy underbelly and, at some point, I realized we needed a UK rapper to convey that. Maarten got in touch with Samson, who really liked the instrumental but said it was a difficult tempo to rap over. His approach is what we needed and it’s since become one of my favorite tracks on the album.”\n\n<b>“I Need You”</b>\nMS: “When I showed this track to Lars, he immediately picked out the synth arpeggio arp as the element that the entire track needed to be centered on. We changed the arrangement to get the delivery of that moment hitting just right and now, every time we play this live and that sound comes in, it’s a warm bath of synth energy which feels so unexpected for our sound and a club setting.”\n\n<b>“Bloom” (feat. Joep Beving)</b>\nMS: “Lars was having a random studio jam on the keys and came up with this really nice piano loop. It felt like it could use another player on it though and since I know Joep Beving, I thought he would be perfect. He’s super busy and successful so I wasn’t sure he would say yes to a collaboration but, within a day, he decided to do it. He records everything on his grandmother’s piano in his studio, and to be present with him and see him play on that was incredible.”\n\n<b>“Some Day” (feat. Ric Wilson)</b>\nLD: “This was one of the hardest tracks to make on the album. It’s a demo I came up with a long time ago and, while recording with Ric was really easy, since he’s such a ball of energy and wrote the lyrics in one afternoon, the mix took something like 70 versions to get right. It’s sonically different from the rest of the tracks on the album but it gets stuck in your head and elevates from melodramatic to upbeat so well.”\n\n<b>“Kiki” (feat. LYMA)</b>\nMS: “‘Kiki’ started out as a house track and then it became electro and, finally, we asked a band we know in San Francisco, Hablot Brown, to record some live instrumentation on it and that eventually made it work. Their recordings were lo-fi but it’s nice because the tiny mistakes give it character and make sure that the record doesn’t sound overproduced. LYMA’s vocal also sucks you straight in since the lyrics are so emotional and heartwarming.”\n\n<b>“Is This Love?”</b>\nMS: “At this point in the album, we were having a bit of an identity crisis about what the album is and who we are as producers and a group now. We decided that we needed one more house track and this is what emerged in a couple of hours, creating a synth-heavy, bouncy, and upbeat number that feels very much like us.”\n\n<b>“It’s Okay, I Can Wait”</b>\nLD: “For the last two tracks on the album, we’re gradually winding down and this slows things immediately with a perfect vocal sample vibe and a great synth solo that brings to mind a warm hazy day where you don’t want to do anything but chill and lie in the sun.”\n\n<b>“Closer”</b>\nMS: “‘Closer’ came about when we were having a bit of a dubby exploration and this is pretty much the first, unchanged version we recorded. The track has a raw energy to it because it feels so close to the demo. Our friend Bo Floor came in to play trumpet because we felt it needed a longer arc like ‘Home’ and he always delivers—you can really hear how his distinct way of using harmonies makes this track.”","short":"The duo on their third album: “We want people to be open to each other.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/open/1796866672","playParams":{"id":"1796866672","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/14LybCLgQLN86HTfDKK8rQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796866672/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"516390097","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/516390097?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748594124257,"RTCI":0}}},"1796896102":{"id":"1796896102","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796896102?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2c/e7/cb/2ce7cbff-a636-6437-ac12-fe5296323e32/39a713da-4b82-453c-bd10-6133a7bb710d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a7ac94","textColor2":"afbfc3","textColor4":"919fa0","textColor1":"cbd0b3","bgColor":"191c15","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wormrot/363581845","name":"TNT","artistName":"Wormrot","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/5c/1b/805c1b62-6ed2-b972-388d-8dbeebe30715/5055006571516.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"cecece","textColor4":"aaaaaa","textColor1":"f9f9f9","bgColor":"191919","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tnt/1796896102","playParams":{"id":"1796896102","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6qJb2du3Pkq2qyGr9yjnR7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796896102/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"363581845","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/363581845?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748579688194,"RTCI":0}}},"1797151118":{"id":"1797151118","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797151118?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/22/33/2a/22332ae9-80f1-b356-c763-860b15a5cf68/c9c1058e-7f23-47dc-b405-fa60820bcf79.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3a87c","textColor2":"ddb17b","textColor4":"b49166","textColor1":"efce96","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mt-joy/1156713197","name":"Hope We Have Fun","artistName":"Mt.

After two decades as one of indie rock’s most magnetic lyricists and vocalists, he was trapped inside writer’s block, stuck in a cycle where anything that resembled work or even input induced despair. That trap slowly broke as he and his band began work on 2023’s <i>First Two Pages of Frankenstein</i> and its surprise follow-up, <i>Laugh Track</i>; their rebuilt rapport slowly revived his lexicon. That same year, Berninger and his family left Los Angeles after a decade, with their country escape to Connecticut recalling scenes of his Ohio childhood. He settled into new rhythms and modes, writing lyrics between the seams of baseballs. <i>Get Sunk</i>—a reference to that earlier depressive period and, implicitly, springing out of it—steadily took shape.\n\nTo make <i>Get Sunk</i>, Berninger and longtime engineering partner and producer Sean O’Brien bounced around a Los Angeles studio, building beats and sequences for six hours at a time until Berninger finally found the words that fit. They recruited a sterling support cast, including Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy, session ace Booker T. Jones, and Ronboy leader Julia Laws. They called their dozen or so helpers the “Saturday Musicians.”\n\nBerninger’s voice has always been The National’s calling card, the athletic baritone at its center. Wouldn’t a solo album, especially a second, just feel redundant or reductive, an imitation of its more famous setting? But <i>Get Sunk</i> is marked by an unexpected versatility. Where he cannily mumbles his way through the textural maze of “Nowhere Special,” he becomes ultimately approachable on “Junk,” a gorgeous and gothic love song that suggests Nick Cave. Where “Frozen Oranges” is a Middle American fever dream about searching for contentment, “No Love” documents the end of personal chemistry, of a relationship that once held meaning now corroding into, at best, niceties. \n\nThe linchpin, though, is closer “Times of Difficulty,” where that whole big band gathers together to offer an anthem for interdependence, to reaching out for a lift when you get sunk. “Feels like we missed another summer/If we’re not dying, then what are we?” he moans. Getting on, best we can.\n","short":"The National singer brings unexpected versatility to his second solo

Album","standard":"Ben Kweller’s seventh studio album is marked by an unimaginable tragedy: the death of his teenage son Dorian in a car crash in 2023. “The last two years have been the hardest times in my life,” Kweller tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I replay that night over and over again in my head, and I’ve had to relearn how to live.” A month after Dorian’s passing, Kweller discovered a digital trove of music that his late son had been working on, which lit the spark that created <i>Cover the Mirrors</i>; the aching ballad “Trapped” draws from a melody Dorian had been working on. “I remember hearing him in his bedroom singing this amazing chorus, and I walked in and I’m like, ‘Dude, this is awesome, keep going,’” Kweller recalls.\n\nEven as some of <i>Cover the Mirrors</i>—especially the stream-of-consciousness piano-led opener “Going Insane”—emerged from the solitude of grief, the record finds Kweller embracing the warmth of collaboration more than at any previous point in his career, with contributions from Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield (“Dollar Store”), MJ Lenderman (the rollicking and elegiac closer “Oh Dorian”), Jason Schwartzman’s Coconut Records alias (“Depression”), and The Flaming Lips (“Killer Bee”). “The one thing that’s kept me together through this is community,” Kweller says. “I’m usually so protective of my music, and I think most artists are—but I’ve been so cracked open that I’ve really enjoyed and embraced it.”\n","short":"“I had to relearn how to live”: The indie vet turns tragedy into

Album","standard":"At 34, Dylan Scott has a lot figured out. The “Can’t Have Mine (Find You a Girl)” hitmaker is married with children and has found his stride and his voice as an artist, too—so much so that he tells Apple Music he feels like he can take a laidback approach to making music. “The backbone of this whole deal is my family and my wife and my kids and my friends, and I don’t let too much stuff get to my head,” Scott says. “At this point of my career, it makes you more grateful for the wins and for what’s happening, so I don’t get too discouraged by things. The new album is called <i>Easy Does It</i> for a reason.”\n\nOf course, “easy” doesn’t mean lazy, and <i>Easy Does It</i> is Scott’s most ambitious project yet, digging into difficult themes like marriage and mortality while maintaining a spirit of love and hard-earned joy. The record opens with one of the bigger songs of Scott’s career thus far, the emotional and surprising “What He’ll Never Have.” An especially vulnerable song, the track finds Scott imagining what would happen to his family should he die unexpectedly, and hoping that someone who is at least “half the man” that he is would step in to care for his wife and children should the worst ever happen.\n\nElsewhere, Scott dips back into lifelong love on the sweet and breezy “Till I Can’t, I Will” and pays tribute to small-town living on the nostalgic “This Town’s Been Too Good to Us.” Sonically, the record sounds almost timeless in its approach toward radio-friendly country pop, eschewing the hard-rock-influenced sound that’s so prevalent on current country charts in favor of sturdy songwriting, ironclad hooks, and relatable narratives. \n","short":"Title and laidback vibes aside, his most ambitious album to date."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/easy-does-it/1801558755","playParams":{"id":"1801558755","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/328tuPAI8AlyW6AC51ud4R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801558755/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"521811408","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/521811408?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748594117700,"RTCI":0}}},"1801596489":{"id":"1801596489","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801596489?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grace-potter/112137839","name":"Medicine","artistName":"Grace Potter","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4c/c0/8e/4cc08ef6-aa96-0706-fa13-5c728f8626f5/25UMGIM43499.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3c4bf","textColor2":"d7a382","textColor4":"ac8368","textColor1":"f3f4ee","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Her 2008 blues-rock burner, unearthed 17 years after its recording."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/medicine/1801596489","playParams":{"id":"1801596489","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6PThYC8a8wgGPkdtTBjTsn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801596489/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"112137839","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/112137839?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748585338249,"RTCI":0}}},"1802291982":{"id":"1802291982","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802291982?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/illuminati-hotties/1264905232","name":"Nickel on the Fountain Floor -

Arriving over two and a half decades since their era-defining self-titled debut, 2021’s thrilling <i>No Gods No Masters</i> was the sound of a band in the midst of a late-career purple patch.\n\nThey keep the momentum rolling on this eighth album. Where <i>No Gods No Masters</i> surveyed the wreckage of a world mired in chaos, <i>Let All That We Imagine Be the Light</i> is an album determined to muster hope and optimism. That’s not to say it still doesn’t go hard at certain points. Opener “There’s No Future in Optimism” sounds like New Order-gone-glam, “Chinese Fire Horse” is an amped-up, barbed-wire reworking of Cameo-style future-funk and there’s a curled-lip swagger to cascading electro-rock anthem “R U Happy Now.” These are songs that erupt with some of Garbage’s brightest hooks yet, an airy pop euphoria elevating the synth grooves of “Sisyphus” and “Radical”’s dreamy soundscapes.\n\nComing together as Manson recovered from a second hip operation, with her three bandmates writing music and sending her demos, it’s a record that finds the singer in defiantly uplifting form and a reminder of what a strange and brilliant band Garbage is. They’re a group who can put together a record by working separately but still evoke the communal jubilance of a band in a room, who can craft seething anthems but summon rallying encouragement. Garbage always sound like they’re already leaning into their next move. <i>Let All That We Imagine Be The Light</i> is the vital sound of the four-piece putting their best foot forward.","short":"Thirty years after their debut, the four-piece keep pushing rock forwards."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-all-that-we-imagine-be-the-light/1803176505","playParams":{"id":"1803176505","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3SVwtqCeeVLPdnxipKxgIj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803176505/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"109997","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/109997?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748580503127,"RTCI":0}}},"1803502410":{"id":"1803502410","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803502410?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5e/53/c1/5e53c1cc-0101-f951-15f8-30cef85dc36b/Job1417210f-39d1-4781-8062-ab7d83d631dc-190582113-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373227394_2127772751-Time1745012255208.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","adc7e5"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"201413"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c5b2a7","textColor2":"adc7e5","textColor4":"8fa6be","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"201413","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8f/4b/9d/8f4b9dc2-f1f0-dcd7-b1e0-592e4c657c6b/b40abd2b-cd45-4b3d-b249-3733928bc00c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7ca5c6","textColor2":"88afcf","textColor4":"7292ab","textColor1":"94c7f0","bgColor":"1c1e1c","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f6/f7/cb/f6f7cb2b-b21a-bf33-5f41-0c6ccf3761b5/Jobb887ed00-1b89-47e1-9b39-265556d981f9-190582114-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373227395_2127772752-Time1745013710508.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"b8bdb8","textColor2":"f2ded3","textColor4":"c5b5ad","textColor1":"e3e8e2","bgColor":"0f1313","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/9b/5f/4b/9b5f4b05-bc18-f6b7-5984-8347276570ce/d756f6a2-fc6d-49a3-a083-e96c0fdffa5c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"76a1c1","textColor2":"76ace6","textColor4":"648fbe","textColor1":"8dc1eb","bgColor":"1c1e1c","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joe-jonas/162092469","name":"Music For People Who Believe In Love","artistName":"Joe Jonas","artwork":{"width":3059,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/46/f3/be46f34c-c6d8-4261-4085-4fe6a8d80279/24UMGIM74910.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3059,"textColor3":"c9b6b3","textColor2":"e8deb2","textColor4":"bdb794","textColor1":"f6ddd9","bgColor":"15181c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The spark for Joe Jonas’ first solo album since 2011 arrived on the road. While driving from Los Angeles to Houston in advance of Jonas Brothers playing the Houston Rodeo in 2024, he stopped by national parks like Joshua Tree, and his trip’s soundtrack involved him getting back in touch with his musical roots. “Driving through on that road trip, [I was] inspired by what I was seeing and what I was hearing,” he tells Apple Music. Jonas’ listening on that long drive included a lot of country music and the alt-rock that he grew up on, and when he got back to Los Angeles, he was ready to turn the music in his head into actual songs.\n\n<i>Music for People Who Believe in Love</i> stands apart from Jonas’ chart-topping work with his brothers and the party-playlist funk pop he makes as leader of DNCE because of its genre fluidity and its feeling. On the live-wire cut “Work It Out,” he dives inside his head in an effort to make sense of it, mulling over why “some days, I wanna float away” as a peppy beat echoes the fast-paced world he’s immersed in. “You Got the Right” is a loose-limbed, country-tinged offering with chiming guitars, Jonas sounding almost bashful as he lets someone know that he loves them enough to potentially let them go, while the pensive closing cut, “Constellation,” pairs its ruminating with glittery guitars and charging drums. \n\nJonas also brought in guests for <i>Music</i>—his brother Franklin appears on the punky “Velvet Sunshine,” while others reflect his widening musical palette: Brazilian pop supernova Luisa Sonza faces off with him on the simmering flirtation “What We Are,” and Americana alchemist Sierra Ferrell is his foil on the twangy “Sip Your Wine.” There, Jonas adopts a curled-lip drawl that adds a low-level thrill to open-road romance lyrics like “Thousand miles left till Reno, let’s sit back and waste some time.”\n\nDigging into his deepest feelings while exploring new musical avenues was, Jonas said, a way for him to express gratitude over how far he’s come. “I’m really happy, and I’m grateful,” he says. “I’ve got amazing family and friends around me, and I get to do something that makes other people feel really good. How lucky am I? This is a reflection of hope and love—meeting me where I’m at now and sharing that with the world.”","short":"The middle Jonas Brother channels a road trip on his loose second solo

Album","standard":"When Miley Cyrus won her first Grammys in 2024 (Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers” from 2023’s <i>Endless Summer Vacation</i>), something shifted. “I think somewhere inside of me, I needed to hold a trophy and just feel for a moment that I have something that I can hold in my hands that feels like a true achievement,” the 32-year-old child star turned pop icon tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “After every album, I’ve been able to say, ‘Well, I made the album I set out to make, and that’s enough.’ Somewhere, I was avoiding the fact that it did matter to me.”\n\nHaving finally achieved the validation she’d been longing to feel since childhood, Cyrus says she “felt free to make the album that I’ve really been craving my whole adult career to create.” The name of the resulting album, her ninth, emerged out of the ether while riffing in the studio with producer Max Taylor-Sheppard and Cyrus’ boyfriend/collaborator, Liily drummer Maxx Morando. “As soon as [Taylor-Sheppard] played the first chord, I just said, ‘Tell me something beautiful tonight.’ It was so easy, but I have no idea where it came from. The chord he played was so beautiful that what needed to be said had to be beautiful.”\n\nIn the title track, a Sunday morning soul jam erupts with a “flash, bang, spark” into post-apocalyptic prog-rock distortion. That clash of sensuality and chaos extends through <i>Something Beautiful</i>, whose ’80s-inspired melodrama swings for the fences in sound and theme. The deceptively sparkly-sounding “End of the World” celebrates one last blowout bash before the sky falls. “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form,” Cyrus says. “Pop gets given a bad name by manufactured label creations, and that’s just not what it is.” She’s thinking of legendary pop innovators who evolved with the times: David Bowie, Madonna, Elton John.\n\nThe ultra-funky “Easy Lover” was intended for another such icon: Cyrus originally wrote it circa 2020’s <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, then refurbished it for placement on Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. When Bey went with “II MOST WANTED” instead, Cyrus kept the slinky number for herself, recruiting Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard to play electric guitar—though the “Tell ’em, B!” ad-lib stays.\n\nCyrus’ inimitable voice has never sounded more soulful, though that has not come without a price. She tells Apple Music she has Reinke’s edema, a rare condition which causes fluid to build up in the outer layer of the vocal folds—hence her trademark rasp. “So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am,” she says. “But it’s extremely difficult to perform with, because it’s like running a marathon with ankle weights on.” It could be removed surgically, but for Cyrus, the benefit isn’t worth the risk, “because the chance of waking up from surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability.”\n\nThroughout a career that’s spanned two-thirds of her life, Cyrus has felt lost in the static. “White noise is essentially everything happening all at the same time, and I feel like that was what the last 20 years of my career felt like,” she says. But while recording <i>Something Beautiful</i>, she found herself coming to terms with everything that’s come before. Over the heavy disco groove of “Reborn,” she delivers a mission statement: “If heaven exists/I’ve been there before/Kill my ego/Let’s be reborn.”\n","short":"Miley swings for the fences: “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/something-beautiful/1804974240","playParams":{"id":"1804974240","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7h7smPzBYx8LOLI3ncM3vQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804974240/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"137057909","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137057909?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748610201592,"RTCI":0}}},"1805279978":{"id":"1805279978","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805279978?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ee/64/fb/ee64fb4f-d0c3-7e8e-dc2b-aee7627708b0/Jobe4c77752-f53c-4068-9fef-50b2830a5467-189454613-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370968371_2109388042-Time1743638892422.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"cbc8c5","textColor4":"a6a4a1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"141414","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/74/d8/38/74d83851-d622-899c-d030-019273f12fb2/30e0f742-2ef3-4c90-b8d4-26b1b6da09ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e251e","textColor2":"19110d","textColor4":"352920","textColor1":"100d0b","bgColor":"a6876c","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ad/34/06/ad3406a0-cb2c-a0dd-671b-8361f295d2cd/Job9285a46a-4658-4f27-86a3-e17afb59a947-189454612-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370968372_2109388043-Time1743637862415.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cdcdce","textColor2":"d8d7d7","textColor4":"b2b1b1","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"191a1c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/green-day/954266","name":"Saviors (édition de luxe)","artistName":"Green Day","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a0/c7/56/a0c7564e-d1ab-c61c-396f-0c4c47cbf49c/093624830887.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"e0e0e0","textColor4":"b8b8b8","textColor1":"fcfcfc","bgColor":"171717","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Arriving 20 years after the open political ire of <i>American Idiot</i>, Green Day’s 14th album sees the veteran California punk trio energized by a new wave of worrying trends. Now in his early fifties, singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong retains the snotty defiance that has always been his calling card, whether the stakes are high or low. He doesn’t mince words on opener and lead single “The American Dream Is Killing Me,” calling out the nation’s boom in conspiracy theories and reimagining the classic patriotic lyric “my country, ’tis of thee” as “my country under siege.” \n\nWhile less of a concept album than the rock opera turned stage musical <i>American Idiot</i>, <i>Saviors</i> still latches on to some recurring themes in the name of getting a point across, such as updating 1950s-era rock ’n’ roll tropes: “Bobby Sox” swaps the aw-shucks question “Do you wanna be my girlfriend?” with “Do you wanna be my boyfriend?” while the timeless-sounding romantic ballad “Suzie Chapstick” is timestamped with a reference to absently scrolling Instagram. And “Living in the ’20s” may flash a guitar solo ripped straight from rock’s earliest days, but it also cites the more modern markers of mass shootings and pleasure robots.\n\nArmstrong’s urgent venting is delivered within some of Green Day’s catchiest songs since the 1990s, and longtime producer Rob Cavallo proves just as crucial to the album’s punchy, uncrowded sound as bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer Tré Cool. After all, Cavallo helmed the band’s 1994 smash <i>Dookie</i>, and <i>Saviors</i> sneaks in a few nods to that ripe era too. The sheer simplicity of the chugging chords opening “Strange Days Are Here to Stay” evokes the former album’s hit single “Basket Case,” while the mortality-minded closer “Fancy Sauce” borrows Nirvana’s coupling of “stupid and contagious.” The bubblegum anthem “Look Ma, No Brains!” harks back even further to Green Day’s DIY roots (and before that, pop-punk godfathers the Ramones), further cementing the idea that righteous anger goes down easier smuggled inside a pop song.","short":"The 2024 album gets seven additional tracks, including two acoustic

But what was once deemed a generational flop would gain a cult following in the 15 years that followed, like similarly misunderstood classics of the messy late aughts (Britney Spears’ 2007 <i>Blackout</i>, or Paris Hilton’s 2006 <i>Paris</i>). When a sped-up version of album cut “I’ll Do It” went viral on TikTok in late 2023, the Heidissance kicked into gear. And when the catastrophic fires of January 2025 burned Montag and husband Spencer Pratt’s home to the ground, fans responded by streaming <i>Superficial</i> so much that it hit No. 1 on iTunes and re-entered the Billboard albums chart.\n\nFifteen years after its predecessor, Montag’s sophomore album, <i>Heidiwood</i>, ditches the bubbly late-aughts recession-pop and taps into the edgy, clubby sounds of hyperpop and Slayyyter-esque slut-pop. That means vocals processed to the far edge of the uncanny valley over glitchy house beats, as on the campy title track featuring buzzing SoCal star Chase Icon. On winking bangers like “Prototype,” Montag nods cheekily to her much-discussed relationship with plastic surgery (“I’m the reason all you bitches wanna get filled!”), and on “America’s Sweetheart,” she pledges allegiance to the bad bitches of America. And on the sneakily sweet “Flash,” she dreamily recalls her 2006 nightclub meet-cute with Pratt: “I saw our whole life flash before my eyes.”","short":"The self-styled reality TV villain gets glitchy on her first album in 15 years."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heidiwood/1808087606","playParams":{"id":"1808087606","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5AapqqowoF8thc7CmlazBz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808087606/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"271636652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/271636652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748579549335,"RTCI":0}}},"1808507440":{"id":"1808507440","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808507440?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-28","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8b/b5/7b/8bb57b8e-8a3e-216b-6146-fc3cdd46881a/164d1b3c-2872-4e60-96c4-f4d61ccce531.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b19f8a","textColor2":"d8a988","textColor4":"b78d70","textColor1":"d1c1a8","bgColor":"301a10","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ec/85/91/ec85912e-d077-5bcf-4e16-3045416b2bd7/fc355396-47d7-4f19-a9ed-6e462a16e5a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b7a47e","textColor2":"d2b681","textColor4":"ae986e","textColor1":"dcc596","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%C3%A1ngela-aguilar/565880444","name":"Nadie Se Va Como Llegó","artistName":"Ángela Aguilar","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/c5/5d/aac55d9d-e990-541a-7f74-af0ab4554f54/198704464218_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"2b221a","textColor2":"200801","textColor4":"392111","textColor1":"0f0a0c","bgColor":"9d8352","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"At just 21 years old, Ángela Aguilar already boasts an ample, noteworthy discography that reflects both talent and growth. Though young stardom has the potential to dissipate over time, her commitment to música mexicana now positions her as a vital voice in the wider genre. That couldn’t be more evident on <i>Nadie Se Va Como Llegó</i>, an album where arguably disparate sounds like mariachi, cumbia, and corridos tumbados not only meet in harmony, but downright flourish in her dynamic presence. The traditional styles evoked by “Corazón De Piedra” and the title track nod to dynasty, while her contemporary artistic ambitions burst through on “Libre Corazón” and the devastating closer, “Lágrimas En Mi Garganta.” Regardless of genre expression, there’s a timeless quality to “A Dos De Borrarte,” a proud declaration of victorious womanhood. Though the album centers her as a soloist by design, she sneaks Marc Anthony onto the moving, mutually conciliatory duet “No Quiero Hablar.”","short":"A timeless album from a vital young voice in

Album","standard":"Throughout her storied career, Gloria Estefan broke ground and crossed borders in pursuit of her musical passions. Undeterred by perceived language barriers, her discography ranges from the powerful pop of her Miami Sound Machine era through more recent material like the inventive <i>BRAZIL305</i>. Among her legions of fans, 1993’s Spanish-language <i>Mi Tierra</i> remains one of her most beloved albums, its celebration of classic Cuban sounds laid out like a love letter to the past. On <i>Raices</i>, she returns once more to those titular roots, albeit with another few decades of artistry under her proverbial belt. \n\nThe title track serves as its raison d’être, invoking both heritage and timelessness as core characteristics. With so many contemporary Latin artists looking to the Caribbean for inspiration, Estefan’s knowing yet exploratory expressions offer an expansive vision of what many would call tropical music. A seminal salsa spirit carries “La Vecina (No Sé Na’),” while “Cómo Pasó” reminds of her bolero mastery. Yet what might be the album’s most affecting moment is “Mi Niño Bello (Para Sasha),” a veritable lullaby for her grandson suitably presented in both English and Spanish.","short":"A Spanish-language return for the Cuban American icon."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ra%C3%ADces/1810062120","playParams":{"id":"1810062120","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7v0by35dP3weA7eMfpCRCQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810062120/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"485022","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/485022?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748593287698,"RTCI":0}}},"1810455908":{"id":"1810455908","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810455908?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1439879921-986751499","name":"Robot Salsa Remix - EP","artistName":"Sam Ruffillo & Kapote","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ce/e9/9f/cee99f85-4933-19ae-05a0-ead9dcf6dcdb/0880655518293.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"353535","textColor2":"103a13","textColor4":"3f6142","textColor1":"020202","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/robot-salsa-remix-ep/1810455908","playParams":{"id":"1810455908","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2UZWO2DF156zQAcTjnpHCM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810455908/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1439879921","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1439879921?l=en-US"},{"id":"986751499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/986751499?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748560739649,"RTCI":0}}},"1810457254":{"id":"1810457254","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810457254?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/49/49/db/4949db2e-8d35-3cde-4f20-ffd7ab0eec0c/7c74a8af-aefc-4396-acc1-3887a2edb28d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cab696","textColor2":"f5d5ad","textColor4":"ccb393","textColor1":"f3d9b1","bgColor":"262c2b","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a6/cc/3c/a6cc3cad-f8ba-4e33-43c6-2fa6cfffb333/13f76a05-ab2a-416e-8697-1f2c2d3c8272.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3bca0","textColor2":"d39855","textColor4":"b2834d","textColor1":"e8e0bc","bgColor":"30302f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/63/a2/97/63a29723-e931-094d-e89f-2c642a7f9685/c1425227-901c-45d7-994a-db95ce0537e4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c29f","textColor2":"e9c58c","textColor4":"c5a87a","textColor1":"ede5bb","bgColor":"373531","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/myles-smith/1249499491","name":"A Minute, A Moment...","artistName":"Myles Smith","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/76/7b/68767b7b-5f27-8bfa-8f30-d4e886c9d986/196873114255.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"414037","textColor2":"282624","textColor4":"4b483f","textColor1":"1c1c1a","bgColor":"d4d2ac","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Myles Smith bares his soul on his third EP, <i>A Minute, A Moment…</i>, with songs about love, heartbreak, and finding himself. It features six fresh tracks, bundled together with Smith's 2024 EP <i>A Minute...</i>, which features his breakthrough hit, “Stargazing.” The UK singer-songwriter has gone from playing Ed Sheeran covers when he was 11 to supporting his idol on his European tour—and he found time to pick up the Rising Star Award at the 2025 BRITs. The love Smith sings about isn’t always straightforward: He pleads with an ex to get back together on “Made for Me” and finds summer romance on the handclap-heavy “Gold,” but “My First Heartbreak” sees him at his most personal as he shares his feelings about his father leaving the family home: “They say blood’s thicker than water, but I’m closer to the ocean than to you.”\n\nEach of the six new tracks showcases a confident and distinctive sound that mixes pop and country with his trademark vocals, which can easily turn from sweet to powerful. The songs never need to beg for a sing-along, so it’s no surprise he’s attracted collaborators including James Bay and Lainey Wilson, who brings a new perspective to his megahit “Nice to Meet You.” Smith, meanwhile, is keeping his feet firmly on the ground as international success builds. “Ten years ago I thought Luton was the edge of the earth, last year I thought it was England, and now it’s the world,” he tells Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd. “I just want to continue to make music that connects and keep doing what I’m doing.” \n","short":"The singer-songwriter pauses to take stock on his third EP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-minute-a-moment/1810457254","playParams":{"id":"1810457254","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02Im7TTPFgjVmXc3HpIkUj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810457254/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1249499491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249499491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748594223723,"RTCI":0}}},"1811155702":{"id":"1811155702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811155702?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1639500718-865557920","name":"The Two Houses -

She dabbles mostly in disco, house, and funk, effectively throwing a dance party in the name of hope and perseverance.\n\nAnd what good is a party without a few guests? <i>Stay Alta</i>’s title track features Compton producer and MC Channel Tres, while Cleveland-hailing singer Durand Bernarr brings a bit of ballroom flair to “Let It Drop.” In a nod to the pandemic-defining DJ sets that kept the world sane, legendary producer and DJ D-Nice brings his master of ceremonies ability to “Love on Love,” proclaiming “Now’s the time to celebrate each other”—which is all Estelle is really asking, for us to appreciate one another. That, and as she instructs on the Teedra Moses and LaRussell collab “Grateful,” to “just stay grateful.”","short":"The British singer wants us to dance the pain away."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stay-alta/1811714494","playParams":{"id":"1811714494","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4PMJGgrOKvjAD9ci1PHMpE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811714494/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"27060010","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/27060010?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748594097772,"RTCI":0}}},"1811805324":{"id":"1811805324","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811805324?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jillian-jacqueline/584087995","name":"Bright Eyed Baby -

Despite being spread thin in a million different directions, he manages to excel in all these fields. After years of dedicating his talent to acting and writing songs for other artists, he emerged in 2023 with his solo debut, <i>Electric Dusk</i>, via Ty Dolla $ign’s EZMNY imprint. A year later, he released its follow-up, <i>MUTT</i>, a convincing sign that Thomas is all in on this latest endeavor.\n\n<i>MUTT</i> finds Thomas showcasing his vocal prowess and lyrical talent alike, telling stories of love lost and betrayal, staggering his way through empty relationships as he looks for his soulmate. On “SAFE PLACE,” he sings over screeching guitars and the persistent beat of a ride cymbal bell, admitting, “I see the glass half empty.” On “FAR FETCHED,” which features his label boss, Thomas takes issue with a love interest who is more interested in handouts than a deep relationship. “Paid for my mistakes in Benzes and diamonds,” he fumes, before adding, “250 fronted like you was my artist.” Leon Thomas has conquered everything he’s set his mind to, and yet, on <i>MUTT</i>, love eludes him.","short":"The R&B visionary expands his second album with nine new tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mutt-deluxe-heel/1812987941","playParams":{"id":"1812987941","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5m3rVDTPrTRwSgkKsvSYEL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812987941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"267251475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/267251475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748609960008,"RTCI":0}}},"1813003804":{"id":"1813003804","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813003804?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/treaty-oak-revival/1493691515","name":"The Talco Tapes","artistName":"Treaty Oak Revival","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9a/b9/17/9ab917a8-1474-7c69-a84c-57582ec1947d/198704397448_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"1b1e1d","textColor2":"060406","textColor4":"1d1e1e","textColor1":"040405","bgColor":"7a847c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Treaty Oak Revival revisits some of their best-loved tracks on this stripped-down acoustic collection, which pulls material from the Odessa, Texas, act’s first two full-length albums, 2021’s <i>No Vacancy</i> and 2023’s <i>Have a Nice Day</i> and tosses in a cover for good measure. Known for their rough and rowdy approach to country rock, the band still sounds raw and potent with these toned-down arrangements, which offer a little more space for lead vocalist Sam Canty to wrench emotion out of the songs’ often narrative lyrics. \n\nRecorded at the SoundBank Studios in Talco, Texas, <i>The Talco Tapes</i> kicks off with “I’m the Worst,” a fan favorite that, in this incarnation, sounds twangier than its sludgy studio counterpart. “Boomtown” swaps the Tom Petty influence of the original for a more Red Dirt sound, with pristine pedal steel cutting through acoustic guitar. “Ode to Bourbon” dials up the harmonies, and “Fishnets” gets a touch of tenderness that suits the song’s complicated story. The band rounds out the project with a cover of The Goo Goo Dolls’ 1995 smash “Name,” turning in a faithful performance that retains the emotional intensity of the original.\n","short":"The rough and

Album","standard":"If RIIZE’s first full-length album is meant to be a culmination of the moments they experienced in their first 20 months as a K-pop group, then “Fly Up” is a fitting lead single. The feel-good dance track channels a similar energy to RIIZE’s debut hit “Get a Guitar,” which also leaned into an unabashedly cheesy 1950s rock ’n’ roll sound when it was released in September 2023. While “Get a Guitar” chose a retro guitar riff as its signature sound, “Fly Up” uses choral vocals to hook listeners.\n\nThe group’s “emotional pop” concept is musically flexible, and <i>ODYSSEY</i> taps into different genres to tell its story of youth as a joyful time full of moments worth remembering. Instrumental interlude “Passage” separates the more upbeat first half of the album (UK garage track “Odyssey,” hip-hop banger “Bag Bad Back,” anthemic pop song “Ember to Solar,” “Fly Up,” and pop-rock bop ”Show Me Love”) from the slower, more sentimental second half (the dreamy, bass-driven “Midnight Mirage,” fan ballads “The End of the Day” and “Inside My Love,” and soaring album ender “Another Life”). \n\nBehind-the-scenes music-makers on <i>ODYSSEY</i> include K-pop hitmakers Jacob Aaron (“Fly Up” and “Bag Bad Back”), KENZIE (“Ember to Solar” and “Inside My Love”), and danke (“Midnight Mirage”) and Korean rapper BIGONE (“Bag Bad Back”). “What if we could go back/To another life?” Korean lyricist Moon Seolree writes for RIIZE on “Another Life,” granting members Shotaro, Eunseok, Sungchan, Wonbin, Sohee, and Anton a musical opportunity to reflect on their journey from trainees to K-pop idols. “If the me of that time looked at me now/What would I say?”\n","short":"The group’s

Album","standard":"Long after reggaetón went from regional to international, any attempt to divorce the genre from its dancehall reggae origins remains altogether futile if downright impossible. Indeed, the savviest Latin artists operating today know this all too well, regularly paying homage or otherwise returning to the original Jamaican source for inspiration. Those who tapped in for Ryan Castro’s 2024 album, <i>EL CANTANTE DEL GHETTO</i>, know the Colombian star ranks among this class of reverent talents, demonstrating as much on tracks like “FENDI” and “MODELITO.”\n\nHis follow-up <i>SENDÉ</i>, however, is front-loaded with a respectful reggae familiarity as the soundsystem start-up of the throwback-informed title track leads into the hybridized “REBECCA.” While other reggatoneros in this space favor ’90s fare for their interpolative tributes, something he does on the referential “BOMBASTIK<3,” he shows a love for subsequent dancehall evolutions through original expressions like “GL” and “LOBA.” The latter of those features both Jombriel and Konshens, two artists who’ve made their respective marks in the genre and who lend Castro more credibility. \n\nNot wedded to one specific sound, his broader affection towards Caribbean music crops up on the interlude “pa q vuelva,” while a penchant for Afrobeats also emerges via tracks like “dejate ver” and the thematically melancholic “Ojalá.” Arguably like-minded in showing love to island-bred styles, Manuel Turizo lends his approach to the dance-floor-primed “MENOS EL CORA.” Castro’s mindfulness regarding collaborators leads to moments both unexpected and instantly gratifying, tapping Curaçaoan rapper Dongo for the dembow fusion “SANKA” and regrouping with his “QUEMA” collaborators Peso Pluma and SOG for the thumping “UN TRIO.” Still, it’s pretty incredible when no less than Shaggy himself shows up for the penultimate “EXCLUSIVA.”","short":"Dancehall reggae and island vibes inspire the Colombian star."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/send%C3%A9/1814163356","playParams":{"id":"1814163356","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/31y7z1FuIhCugObdlkkN0c"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814163356/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1263552447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1263552447?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748591787306,"RTCI":0}}},"1814339905":{"id":"1814339905","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814339905?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/al-wootton/1449222187","name":"Rhythm Archives","artistName":"Al Wootton","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/54/67/e7/5467e79b-6337-0409-5c51-d60a73d426e4/5056467396434_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"4b546f","textColor2":"263050","textColor4":"515973","textColor1":"1e2a4c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rhythm-archives/1814339905","playParams":{"id":"1814339905","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5hBXbmE5k1djPEFss3HnO6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814339905/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1449222187","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1449222187?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748592478629,"RTCI":0}}},"1814340229":{"id":"1814340229","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814340229?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/louie-vega/153848","name":"Seven Mile (feat.

Just look at who showed up to pay homage: The album has features from Lil Wayne, Cardi B, Fridayy, Meek Mill, Sexyy Red, Quavo, G Herbo, YTB Fatt, and Polo G, and an increasingly rare appearance from Cash Money Records impresario Bryan “Birdman” Williams, who pops up just to talk shit between a few Rob49 verses (“Get the Picture,” “JetWifi”). Artists—as well as fans—love Rob49, and not just for his impossible-to-see-coming runaway smash “WTHELLY.” \n\nThe MC has plenty to offer, and he offers plenty of it across <i>Let Me Fly</i>’s 22 tracks. There are songs for war (“Get the Picture,” “Supposedly,” “On Sight”), for celebrating (“BLOUSIN,” “High or What”), for repenting (“Hear Me Momma”), for those in need of motivation (“Pick Your Poison,” “Widebody”), for women who think he’s sexy (“So Sexyy,” “I Swear to God,” “Tell Nobody”), for the dawgs locked away (“Where I’m From”), and a few for day-one Rob49 fans (“Wassam Baby,” “Off Dat Drank”). He’s got an authentic New Orleans accent and a voice with the kind of bass young men used to emulate when they wanted to sound cool over the phone. And to be fair, Rob49 does sound cool. And unbothered. And like someone you wouldn’t want to piss off. Basically, he is the rap superstar archetype. \n","short":"Twenty-two tracks to let us know exactly “WTHELLY” talking about."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-me-fly/1814504205","playParams":{"id":"1814504205","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5bPJWz3z4NWjOaRYBRZBED"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814504205/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1503242655","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1503242655?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748592601275,"RTCI":0}}},"1814513477":{"id":"1814513477","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814513477?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8f/9e/4d/8f9e4dea-85ff-3132-ee58-d50175763b99/c2a51694-11fe-424e-b4bb-dc3f62f63baf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"403537","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"505274","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ececec","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/88/c0/1888c0f3-dbaf-64c8-2f21-213c79a2391d/2712692e-013c-4d81-a026-613ad24727de.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"3e3334","textColor2":"2c2e58","textColor4":"525475","textColor1":"120406","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/67/cb/b367cbda-0faf-9f85-acab-256386cf3861/a15e7be7-e767-4869-b42d-1d2a9999e981.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"42373a","textColor2":"282642","textColor4":"4f4d64","textColor1":"17090e","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/87/de/3d87de48-48fb-a83b-e91d-f93bf1852c65/e4465e5d-e417-4ec3-b580-139413a4b26e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"403538","textColor2":"3b2c46","textColor4":"5e5367","textColor1":"15070a","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tim-sweeney/1104126348","name":"Beats In Space 163: Tim Sweeney (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Tim Sweeney","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/df/14/2c/df142c6a-ce61-2081-fea2-8c8d4efa8cf4/6e323458-3819-481f-a9ed-3dc2b7d8b8bb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"291c2b","textColor2":"171717","textColor4":"3b2f3e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ce90db","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","short":"The BiS host toasts a German legend with an all-Robag Wruhme set."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beats-in-space-163-tim-sweeney-dj-mix/1814513477","playParams":{"id":"1814513477","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814513477/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1104126348","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1104126348?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748480960388,"RTCI":0}}},"1814709929":{"id":"1814709929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814709929?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6a/b1/b2/6ab1b21a-7246-00b5-464a-0e2a72fecc25/60def6a3-12a9-48d3-ae45-1cf73baa19eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"8ba9b6","textColor2":"8cbbd4","textColor4":"789fb3","textColor1":"a3c8d8","bgColor":"2c302e","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luh-tyler/1638445286","name":"Florida Boy","artistName":"Luh Tyler","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9f/93/99/9f939930-4faf-bfec-fcf6-1654e4b42c37/075679615114.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"7aa3af","textColor2":"7ebad0","textColor4":"6899aa","textColor1":"95c7d5","bgColor":"101616","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Tallahassee teenager went viral at the tender age of 16 with his 2022 single “Law & Order,” where he threatened in a laidback drawl to escort your girl to Waffle House.

That should be obvious to anyone familiar with the Sonoran singer’s growing catalog of work, the genuine love for these sounds and the traditions that guide them evident on his studio recordings as well as some rousing live albums. Meant as a heartfelt return to genre roots following 2024’s hour-long <i>Boca Chueca, Vol. 1</i>, this album brought him back to his hometown of Hermosillo to record. With some curatorial guidance from hitmaking figure Edgar Barrera, <i>Palabra De To’s</i> primarily favors Mexican songwriters to pay overt homage while perpetuating his country’s musical legacy.\n\nDespite the Last Supper theme conjured by the cover art, these 16 tracks are largely devoid of collaborations, with the welcome exception of Luis Mexia on the self-aware “Ocupo Una Limpia.” As such, León’s performances take on a certain intimacy, unhurried by obligations and unencumbered by distractions. On opener “Enséñame,” his reliably robust voice shakes under the sheer weight of sentiments as it beauteously approaches falsetto. Though he regains his strength on the powerful “Lado Frágil,” vulnerable moments nonetheless abound. Throughout the album, he shows off different aspects of his range: a rakish romantic on “Modo Zombie,” a heartbroken hero on “El Amor De Mi Herida,” a dour drinker on “El Curioso.” The longing suffused through closer “Eres Y Serás” grows in size during its instrumental break, the harmonica saying more than even he could sing.\n","short":"Hermosillo’s finest adds four more to this homegrown affair."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palabra-de-tos-seca/1814735585","playParams":{"id":"1814735585","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/37R1JCesvIct4jBsS4bW8P"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814735585/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1370196486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1370196486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748592477825,"RTCI":0}}},"1814759362":{"id":"1814759362","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814759362?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-29","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/molen/660483209","name":"Machine Dreams - EP","artistName":"Molen","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a9/3f/07/a93f0776-47a2-4ade-7379-c1fc33c89c15/8718723288620.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9297a1","textColor2":"e18670","textColor4":"b46b5a","textColor1":"b7bdca","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/machine-dreams-ep/1814759362","playParams":{"id":"1814759362","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6iD0sY7TIaZ6Buy7jWIiWH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814759362/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"660483209","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/660483209?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748578514837,"RTCI":0}}},"1814941577":{"id":"1814941577","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814941577?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f1/37/f0/f137f03b-31ab-4e09-f8f3-4fbbabf205ea/aca6a428-c342-44f9-af0e-841fb9a0fa0e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1b1b1b","textColor2":"020202","textColor4":"1b1b1b","textColor1":"020202","bgColor":"7e7e7e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kizz-daniel/981220084","name":"Uncle K: Lemon Chase","artistName":"Kizz Daniel","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/50/58/80505885-6bd7-8305-d43d-45c0ebe13613/199316101515_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdb752","textColor2":"e9d579","textColor4":"c2b061","textColor1":"f7df66","bgColor":"241a00","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since his 2014 debut, Kizz Daniel has continuously shown an astute understanding of his audience. He gives them what he knows they’ll enjoy even when it calls for him to slightly color outside the lines of trending sensibilities in Nigerian music. And the result? Fun, unlikely chart-toppers like 2023’s “Buga (Lo Lo Lo)” or 2024’s funky North African-inspired “Marhaba.” On <i>Uncle K: Lemon Chase</i>, we see his efforts take on a more refined form.\n\nThis EP, like many offerings in Kizz Daniel’s discography, is lighthearted and fun, yet somber when it needs to be. Project opener “Black Girl Magic” is a warm love song packed with the one-liners Kizz Daniel’s become known for. Who else would possibly think up a quippy line like “Make I be your Joseph knack you like carpenter”? \n\nBy the time we get to the Zlatan-assisted “Secure,” we enter an edgy, thumping world where money rules everything, especially on a Friday night. “Al-Jannah” takes a detour from the formulaic tropes of love and money as Bella Shmurda and ODUMODUBLVCK soliloquize on their experiences with grief and loss. The soulful “Police,” with its humorous lyrics and engaging melodies, taps the legendary Angélique Kidjo and is produced by M.O.G Beatz, BlaiseBeatz, and Johnny Drille.","short":"The singer refines his eclectic, fun sound."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/uncle-k-lemon-chase/1814941577","playParams":{"id":"1814941577","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0nydN3qx0FP0T241UBQZPF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814941577/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"981220084","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/981220084?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748610991548,"RTCI":0}}},"1815198123":{"id":"1815198123","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815198123?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-26","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/olsvang%C3%A8r/1260656511","name":"The Core -

Red Velvet’s group concept explores two sides: their pop-oriented, bubbly “red” side and a more mature, R&B-ready “velvet” side. Sensual, smooth, and thumping with synth, IRENE & SEULGI’s six-track second album is velvet, through and through. \n\nDance-pop lead single “TILT” opens with hazy piano ornamentation and vocal ad-libs before coming closer, building to its hypnotic “tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt” hook of a chorus. Its thematic focus on companionship as powerfully symbiotic rather than cutthroat embodies the duo’s public persona, first firmed up with the dubstep duality of 2020’s “Monster.” <i>TILT</i>’s tracks—including the ’90s-inspired R&B song “What’s Your Problem?,” which briefly invites KISS OF LIFE rapper JULIE to the team—continue to center the assured, playful vocal interplay IRENE and SEULGI have established after more than a decade as K-pop co-members.\n","short":"The K-pop duo explores their pop side and their R&B side."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tilt-the-2nd-mini-album-ep/1815570886","playParams":{"id":"1815570886","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815570886/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1521791555","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1521791555?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748563758324,"RTCI":0}}},"1815784342":{"id":"1815784342","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815784342?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wraz/1239652463","name":"Pieces - EP","artistName":"Wraz.","artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ab/9a/22/ab9a2294-254b-77a0-a502-639dfd0ca10f/8721215488781.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2000,"textColor3":"2a373e","textColor2":"1d242b","textColor4":"3e4a52","textColor1":"040b12","bgColor":"c4e5ee","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pieces-ep/1815784342","playParams":{"id":"1815784342","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815784342/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1239652463","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1239652463?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1748579443811,"RTCI":0}}},"1815788343":{"id":"1815788343","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815788343?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-29","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/9d/58/0c9d58dc-5577-f42f-00f2-3300d346e80c/44f939c9-64a0-4e58-97b4-dc596f476df4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ca9984","textColor2":"d6c0ae","textColor4":"b19d8e","textColor1":"f5baa1","bgColor":"1e1311","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pepe-aguilar/21421637","name":"Mi Suerte Es Ser Mexicano","artistName":"Pepe Aguilar","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/11/1d/d0/111dd0cd-4f7b-fa08-9c1f-712d892de610/198704513589_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"d6bbac","textColor2":"edc9b3","textColor4":"d2aa96","textColor1":"f2dfcf","bgColor":"692f24","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Decades deep into his solo catalog, Pepe Aguilar continues to represent his homeland’s music with pride and an exacting set of self-imposed standards. Where 2024’s <i>Que Llueva Tequila</i> willfully brought righteous rock energy to mariachi and ranchera forms, his follow-up <i>Mi Suerte Es Ser Mexicano</i> maneuvers instead toward relatively more traditional renditions of the styles he’s long operated within. That’s certainly not to suggest he’s resting on his laurels here, though that would be within his rights at this stage in his acclaimed career. Instead, he reaches excitedly into the música mexicana songbook to present favorites like “El Gavilancillo” and “Mis Dos Vicios.” His seasoned voice can carry the emotional weight of longing that necessitates the romantic pleas of “Vamos Tarde.” That evident familiarity makes even more frequently covered fare like “Caminos De Michoacán” and “Ni El Dinero Ni Nada” more pliable and powerful by way of his renditions.","short":"The mariachi maestro reaches for the Mexican

But imagine for a moment the perspective of someone like Mannie Fresh, accomplished DJ and producer, engine of the late-’90s/early-2000s Cash Money Records hit parade, and the man whose beats helped Wayne realize his potential as an MC. “I always start Wayne projects or songs like it’s my last day on earth,” Fresh tells Apple Music. “Because he is so important to rap, plus he is a real rap-rock star.”\n\nTheir latest collaboration, Fresh’s <i>Lil Wayne: The Mix Before Tha VI</i>, is an Apple Music-exclusive DJ mix celebrating the impending arrival of Wayne’s <i>Carter VI</i> album. In true Mannie Fresh fashion, the set features a wealth of Wayne classics artfully arranged alongside the music that inspired some of those songs, spliced with a few curveballs Fresh threw in to keep even diehard Wayne stans engaged. “I try to listen to the records from a DJ point of view as well as a fan, [because] I want to make you feel good about new music,” he says. “I never, ever feel like [I’m] finished, because he always make me want to go harder every project.” \n","short":"Hear Wayne through the ears of the man he sang about on “Go
