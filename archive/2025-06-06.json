Album","standard":"For more than a decade, the musician born Nat Ćmiel has been exploring what it means to be a 21st-century human (or post-human): On 2022’s <i>Glitch Princess</i>, yeule probed the limits of the flesh by way of modulated vocals and decaying Danny L Harle beats; on 2023’s <i>softscars</i>, the artist who once identified as a cyborg tiptoed into the corporeal world, inspired by the fuzzy rock music of the late ’90s. Their fourth album, <i>Evangelic Girl Is a Gun</i>, takes their glitchy avant-pop even further out of the matrix, eschewing Auto-Tune entirely to showcase their vocals at their rawest and most visceral. \n\nEnchantingly abject vignettes about doomed love and ego death play out over sexy-sad soundscapes that draw from ’90s trip-hop and alt-rock, with production from Mura Masa, A. G. Cook, and Clams Casino.

Album","standard":"In the two and a half years since 2022’s <i>NO THANK YOU</i>, Little Simz attempted to write its follow-up four times, to no avail. From the outside, the London native was at the top of her game. Since 2021’s game-changing fourth album, <i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</i>, she’d won a Mercury Prize, owned the Glastonbury stage, and earned a spot among the power players of UK rap. But privately, her personal life was imploding. In 2025, word spread of the lawsuit Simz had filed against Inflo, the childhood friend and longtime collaborator who’d produced her last three albums, for allegedly failing to repay a 1.7-million-pound loan. The betrayal left the rapper at a loss, as she recounts on “Lonely”: “Sitting in the studio with my head in my hands/Thinking what am I to do with this music I can’t write?”\n\nFrom this turmoil, the 31-year-old musician arrived at a breakthrough that manifests on her sixth album, <i>Lotus</i>—named for the flower that thrives in muddy waters. Here Simz pulls no punches on the topic of her former friend, snarling her way through the bluesy opener “Thief” (“This person I’ve known my whole life, coming like the devil in disguise”) and the eerie “Flood,” produced by Miles Clinton James with cameos from Nigerian British pop star Obongjayar and South Africa’s Moonchild Sanelly. \n\nBut the mood lifts on tracks like “Young,” a bit of post-punk method rapping on being dumb, broke, and alive (“A bottle of Rio and some chicken and chips/In my fuck-me-up pumps and my Winehouse quiff”), and on “Free,” a jazzy boom-bap meditation on love versus fear, on which Simz reaches a cathartic conclusion: “Love is every time I put pen to the page.”","short":"On her sixth album, personal betrayal leads, eventually, to catharsis."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lotus/1794880972","playParams":{"id":"1794880972","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0ofdTvYtx4LpsVjemJt71X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794880972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"627674564","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/627674564?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749209588306}}},"1797156533":{"id":"1797156533","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797156533?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/matt-berninger/220281495","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/73/26/75/73267592-81c5-e6a4-41c1-7810c5200796/Job9f82d570-2650-4f4b-b513-91204e9a6ddc-193665217-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379385166_2183950054-Time1748553458351.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","10304f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ffffff"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"33556f","textColor2":"10304f","textColor4":"405972","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e8/d8/64/e8d864cb-49ab-4669-bda6-ef16f1618e81/cbbb0cba-3182-41b0-9ec4-b80b2afe9ac5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcafa4","textColor2":"edc3ac","textColor4":"c3a897","textColor1":"e5cdbc","bgColor":"1b3a42","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/47/cc/13/47cc1328-0b50-7e78-70cf-fbf1d769626a/Job05121237-454a-4e17-92ae-8791db51990b-193665218-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379385165_2183950053-Time1748555303736.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","123451"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ffffff"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3e566a","textColor2":"123451","textColor4":"425c73","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2a/d9/b3/2ad9b33d-c7a4-bc94-16f4-07b4d6c3257e/efe58207-a1d7-4f45-a21c-bc8d9e03c93a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"282c30","textColor2":"070b10","textColor4":"2a2d31","textColor1":"04090e","bgColor":"b8b5b5","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4a/d0/83/4ad083f2-dbc4-1d38-ee31-4df6c4c6ac4a/8c3bc583-3ca4-46a4-8608-322a1576e1e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a3c3e","textColor2":"0a0e11","textColor4":"393c3e","textColor1":"0b0d10","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true}},"name":"Get Sunk","artistName":"Matt Berninger","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/82/c0/be/82c0be1a-af63-a50a-b86f-4083d987529f/24CRGIM47165.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"344e61","textColor2":"06364f","textColor4":"385e72","textColor1":"022239","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Soon after The National singer Matt Berninger released his solo debut, <i>Serpentine Prison</i>, in the fall of 2020, its name seemed to backfire. After two decades as one of indie rock’s most magnetic lyricists and vocalists, he was trapped inside writer’s block, stuck in a cycle where anything that resembled work or even input induced despair. That trap slowly broke as he and his band began work on 2023’s <i>First Two Pages of Frankenstein</i> and its surprise follow-up, <i>Laugh Track</i>; their rebuilt rapport slowly revived his lexicon. That same year, Berninger and his family left Los Angeles after a decade, with their country escape to Connecticut recalling scenes of his Ohio childhood. He settled into new rhythms and modes, writing lyrics between the seams of baseballs. <i>Get Sunk</i>—a reference to that earlier depressive period and, implicitly, springing out of it—steadily took shape.\n\nTo make <i>Get Sunk</i>, Berninger and longtime engineering partner and producer Sean O’Brien bounced around a Los Angeles studio, building beats and sequences for six hours at a time until Berninger finally found the words that fit. They recruited a sterling support cast, including Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy, session ace Booker T. Jones, and Ronboy leader Julia Laws. They called their dozen or so helpers the “Saturday Musicians.”\n\nBerninger’s voice has always been The National’s calling card, the athletic baritone at its center. Wouldn’t a solo album, especially a second, just feel redundant or reductive, an imitation of its more famous setting? But <i>Get Sunk</i> is marked by an unexpected versatility. Where he cannily mumbles his way through the textural maze of “Nowhere Special,” he becomes ultimately approachable on “Junk,” a gorgeous and gothic love song that suggests Nick Cave. Where “Frozen Oranges” is a Middle American fever dream about searching for contentment, “No Love” documents the end of personal chemistry, of a relationship that once held meaning now corroding into, at best, niceties. \n\nThe linchpin, though, is closer “Times of Difficulty,” where that whole big band gathers together to offer an anthem for interdependence, to reaching out for a lift when you get sunk. “Feels like we missed another summer/If we’re not dying, then what are we?” he moans. Getting on, best we can.\n","short":"The National singer brings unexpected versatility to his second solo

Album","standard":"At 34, Dylan Scott has a lot figured out. The “Can’t Have Mine (Find You a Girl)” hitmaker is married with children and has found his stride and his voice as an artist, too—so much so that he tells Apple Music he feels like he can take a laidback approach to making music. “The backbone of this whole deal is my family and my wife and my kids and my friends, and I don’t let too much stuff get to my head,” Scott says. “At this point of my career, it makes you more grateful for the wins and for what’s happening, so I don’t get too discouraged by things. The new album is called <i>Easy Does It</i> for a reason.”\n\nOf course, “easy” doesn’t mean lazy, and <i>Easy Does It</i> is Scott’s most ambitious project yet, digging into difficult themes like marriage and mortality while maintaining a spirit of love and hard-earned joy. The record opens with one of the bigger songs of Scott’s career thus far, the emotional and surprising “What He’ll Never Have.” An especially vulnerable song, the track finds Scott imagining what would happen to his family should he die unexpectedly, and hoping that someone who is at least “half the man” that he is would step in to care for his wife and children should the worst ever happen.\n\nElsewhere, Scott dips back into lifelong love on the sweet and breezy “Till I Can’t, I Will” and pays tribute to small-town living on the nostalgic “This Town’s Been Too Good to Us.” Sonically, the record sounds almost timeless in its approach toward radio-friendly country pop, eschewing the hard-rock-influenced sound that’s so prevalent on current country charts in favor of sturdy songwriting, ironclad hooks, and relatable narratives. \n","short":"Title and laidback vibes aside, his most ambitious album to date."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/easy-does-it/1801558755","playParams":{"id":"1801558755","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/328tuPAI8AlyW6AC51ud4R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801558755/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"521811408","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/521811408?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749205513455}}},"1801988655":{"id":"1801988655","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801988655?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pulp/312518","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/66/2a/01/662a0123-6640-2e4d-d7ca-165672766bbe/Job68edbfec-b9f3-4474-95da-7a92032d7da8-190494712-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373053701_2126421628-Time1744908958101.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","050404"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2e211b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"021d25","textColor2":"050404","textColor4":"041f27","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e211b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/e6/58/b2e65846-868a-aeb6-ffe4-698df3aa7a80/2223aa90-b218-476d-9dd6-1aa2f22695b2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e5cace","textColor2":"f9e4db","textColor4":"e5c5b6","textColor1":"f9ebf9","bgColor":"944620","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2d/99/a1/2d99a149-91a7-d387-aefd-98f9b947afca/Job2ffd74c1-ec78-468c-b1db-b5df3d6935a8-190494713-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373053700_2126421629-Time1744909948912.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2c100d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2e211b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"151f27","textColor2":"2c100d","textColor4":"252a2f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e211b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e0/82/e9/e082e9fd-c253-9716-acbd-11cfda0a577f/b64145a5-bd95-4c5a-b3ef-290af463a279.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"a6d0de","textColor2":"9ce3fa","textColor4":"87c9e0","textColor1":"c3ecf8","bgColor":"346278","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/77/6b/37/776b3799-a67e-75cf-aa20-0d94d7405913/023c41b4-9ba4-41a1-ad6b-eb077d31a22c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"23292d","textColor2":"20140d","textColor4":"282e31","textColor1":"1a0d08","bgColor":"4697c1","hasP3":true}},"name":"More","artistName":"Pulp","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/c8/b4/7bc8b4b1-d320-7f37-58be-c6ae66796dc5/191402054170.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"022028","textColor2":"110c0c","textColor4":"0e2830","textColor1":"030202","bgColor":"0099c0","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Certainly, any Pulp fan who caught the long-dormant Britpop legends on their 2024 reunion tour would’ve been completely satisfied with just hearing the ’90s classics we never thought we’d get to hear performed live again. But the surprise inclusion of some new tunes on the set list made it clear Jarvis Cocker and co. were not interested in being a mere nostalgia act. And now, less than a year later, Pulp has gifted us with a new album—and while it arrives 24 years after their last one, <i>More</i> actually came together with unprecedented expedience. “The previous two Pulp records [2001’s <i>We Love Life</i> and 1998’s <i>This Is Hardcore</i>] had a bit of a concept for them, and that slowed everything down,” Cocker tells Apple Music. “And this time I just thought, let’s not think about it. Let’s do it. And then you’ve got a lot of time to think about it later. Like the rest of your life, for instance.”\n\nWith <i>More</i>, Pulp carries on as if the first two decades of the 21st century never happened, restoring their singular balance of disco decadence (“Spike Island,” “Got to Have Love”) and string-swept elegance (“Tina,” “Farmers Market”). As the elder black sheep of Britpop, Pulp always possessed a self-deprecating wit and lived-in wisdom that distinguished them from their more brash, lager-swilling peers, and as such, they were always less interested in glorifying youthful hedonism than probing adult relationships. So they can effortlessly reclaim their role as Britain’s shrewdest observers of social manners and misbehavior even as Cocker has crossed the threshold into his sixties. \n\n<i>More</i> is imbued with the simmering anxieties of a singer who knows he’s not getting any younger: Echoing the streetwise strut of Iggy Pop’s “The Passenger,” the urgent “Grown Ups” finds the guy who once sang “Help the Aged” starting to “stress about wrinkles instead of acne” himself, while the Spector-esque splendor of “Background Noise” closes the curtain on a long-term coupling where familiary has curdled into contempt. But even by the group’s sophisticated standards, piano ballad “The Hymn of the North” (featuring Chilly Gonzales) is a breathtaking display of melancholy and majesty that affirms Pulp is still in a different class all their own.\n","short":"The Britpop legends are still in a different class all their

Album","standard":"As one of rock’s most forward-thinking bands, it’s entirely fitting that Garbage—totemic vocalist Shirley Manson, multi-instrumentalists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker, and drummer Butch Vig—haven’t looked back since they reunited in 2011. Arriving over two and a half decades since their era-defining self-titled debut, 2021’s thrilling <i>No Gods No Masters</i> was the sound of a band in the midst of a late-career purple patch.\n\nThey keep the momentum rolling on this eighth album. Where <i>No Gods No Masters</i> surveyed the wreckage of a world mired in chaos, <i>Let All That We Imagine Be the Light</i> is an album determined to muster hope and optimism. That’s not to say it still doesn’t go hard at certain points. Opener “There’s No Future in Optimism” sounds like New Order-gone-glam, “Chinese Fire Horse” is an amped-up, barbed-wire reworking of Cameo-style future-funk and there’s a curled-lip swagger to cascading electro-rock anthem “R U Happy Now.” These are songs that erupt with some of Garbage’s brightest hooks yet, an airy pop euphoria elevating the synth grooves of “Sisyphus” and “Radical”’s dreamy soundscapes.\n\nComing together as Manson recovered from a second hip operation, with her three bandmates writing music and sending her demos, it’s a record that finds the singer in defiantly uplifting form and a reminder of what a strange and brilliant band Garbage is. They’re a group who can put together a record by working separately but still evoke the communal jubilance of a band in a room, who can craft seething anthems but summon rallying encouragement. Garbage always sound like they’re already leaning into their next move. <i>Let All That We Imagine Be The Light</i> is the vital sound of the four-piece putting their best foot forward.","short":"Thirty years after their debut, the four-piece keep pushing rock forwards."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-all-that-we-imagine-be-the-light/1803176505","playParams":{"id":"1803176505","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3SVwtqCeeVLPdnxipKxgIj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803176505/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"109997","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/109997?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195126036}}},"1803424138":{"id":"1803424138","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803424138?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ouzo-bazooka/949315214","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/04/e9/5a/04e95abf-245f-d46b-9338-ee1acbc6e82e/f6be089b-0a73-48a2-94bc-93567aa7f47a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"423639","textColor2":"2e2224","textColor4":"524247","textColor1":"1a1313","bgColor":"e3c4d3","hasP3":true}},"name":"Kapaim","artistName":"Ouzo Bazooka","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2f/3e/8a/2f3e8ac3-e6cb-4fdc-a455-2f0efa5e15bd/4062548114355.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d1621","textColor2":"1a172f","textColor4":"422646","textColor1":"000301","bgColor":"e163a3","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Slick, psychedelic rock with a vibrant Middle Eastern twist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kapaim/1803424138","playParams":{"id":"1803424138","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6yvXRQJm8ls2asdTHEC28L"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803424138/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"949315214","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/949315214?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749132376626}}},"1803631960":{"id":"1803631960","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803631960?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hailey-whitters/553410914","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/84/0d/04/840d0437-32e1-30e9-2b20-98906ae73496/fafefe03-52bb-42d6-a1e6-b57e66398c8c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"503737","textColor2":"39100e","textColor4":"5e3d3b","textColor1":"280908","bgColor":"f2f0ef","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b5/7a/82/b57a82bf-7c0a-fa87-f1c6-5609cbf4394f/d12e0266-107a-44e6-8a37-60e760fdb271.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e1bc8e","textColor2":"e4a56c","textColor4":"ce8e5f","textColor1":"fbdfa6","bgColor":"78302d","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ae/3c/12/ae3c12a4-bc44-7b74-fa7f-f35b08f96c15/29a3d278-b705-4ece-b913-a16041b6dde6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"6d140e","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"6d140e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"66100c","hasP3":true}},"name":"Corn Queen","artistName":"Hailey Whitters","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ba/6c/5b/ba6c5b38-a953-bf08-d83d-2ca50d77feb1/25UMGIM47923.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"56291c","textColor2":"460002","textColor4":"6b2a1d","textColor1":"2c0001","bgColor":"fdd18a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The cover of this fourth studio album from Hailey Whitters is high kitsch. Featuring a bust of the critically beloved singer-songwriter carved meticulously out of butter, the image encapsulates Whitters’ brand of country music, which filters precise craftsmanship through a left-of-center, often playful lens. Produced by longtime collaborator and husband Jake Gear, <i>Corn Queen</i> is an all-killer, no-filler collection of no-frills country, with flourishes of pop and bluegrass woven in for good measure. <i>Corn Queen</i> opens with “High on the Hog,” a delightful and twangy origin story that puts a more laidback, devil-may-care spin on the weary perseverance at the heart of “Ten Year Town,” a standout off 2020’s <i>The Dream</i>. \n\nHighlights include “High on a Heartbreak,” which recalls <i>Golden Hour</i>-era Kacey Musgraves with its gauzy production and emphasis on melody, and “Casseroles,” a wrenching account of living through grief after “the casseroles stop comin’.” Whitters taps a stellar roster of guests to join her on the album, including bluegrass guitar virtuoso Molly Tuttle on the buoyant and rootsy “Prodigal Daughter.” Acclaimed singer-songwriter Charles Wesley Godwin lends an assist on “I Don’t Want You,” a tender and nuanced duet about a relationship that won’t stick but can’t quite quit, either. Whitters closes the project with a collaboration with Texas country-rock band The Wilder Blue, “DanceMor,” a hopeful reminder to keep on keeping on in the face of adversity.\n","short":"An all-killer, no-filler collection of no-frills country."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/corn-queen/1803631960","playParams":{"id":"1803631960","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5X4svYK600xTcLxv5mvrYb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803631960/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"553410914","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/553410914?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749190727461}}},"1804443756":{"id":"1804443756","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804443756?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tracy-bonham/254810","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Sky Too Wide","artistName":"Tracy Bonham","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d1/df/c0/d1dfc084-df29-191e-8e02-6fd1b93e40eb/199350160493.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a6d8db","textColor2":"91dfea","textColor4":"7cc6d5","textColor1":"c5f5f1","bgColor":"286481","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sky-too-wide/1804443756","playParams":{"id":"1804443756","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2qgO3QtzdBxlC3wfdeHE7J"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804443756/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"254810","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/254810?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749184177834}}},"1804698891":{"id":"1804698891","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804698891?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/isaiah-j-thompson/1046617803","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5b/98/41/5b984197-6dc9-b781-6c05-c64aac26da27/4f4c6ab5-b57a-42ab-b859-f8a5694babb8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2b2118","textColor2":"110f0b","textColor4":"32291d","textColor1":"080605","bgColor":"b88f63","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Book of Isaiah: Modern Jazz Ministry","artistName":"Isaiah J.

The chord he played was so beautiful that what needed to be said had to be beautiful.”\n\nIn the title track, a Sunday morning soul jam erupts with a “flash, bang, spark” into post-apocalyptic prog-rock distortion. That clash of sensuality and chaos extends through <i>Something Beautiful</i>, whose ’80s-inspired melodrama swings for the fences in sound and theme. The deceptively sparkly-sounding “End of the World” celebrates one last blowout bash before the sky falls. “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form,” Cyrus says. “Pop gets given a bad name by manufactured label creations, and that’s just not what it is.” She’s thinking of legendary pop innovators who evolved with the times: David Bowie, Madonna, Elton John.\n\nThe ultra-funky “Easy Lover” was intended for another such icon: Cyrus originally wrote it circa 2020’s <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, then refurbished it for placement on Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. When Bey went with “II MOST WANTED” instead, Cyrus kept the slinky number for herself, recruiting Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard to play electric guitar—though the “Tell ’em, B!” ad-lib stays.\n\nCyrus’ inimitable voice has never sounded more soulful, though that has not come without a price. She tells Apple Music she has Reinke’s edema, a rare condition which causes fluid to build up in the outer layer of the vocal folds—hence her trademark rasp. “So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am,” she says. “But it’s extremely difficult to perform with, because it’s like running a marathon with ankle weights on.” It could be removed surgically, but for Cyrus, the benefit isn’t worth the risk, “because the chance of waking up from surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability.”\n\nThroughout a career that’s spanned two-thirds of her life, Cyrus has felt lost in the static. “White noise is essentially everything happening all at the same time, and I feel like that was what the last 20 years of my career felt like,” she says. But while recording <i>Something Beautiful</i>, she found herself coming to terms with everything that’s come before. Over the heavy disco groove of “Reborn,” she delivers a mission statement: “If heaven exists/I’ve been there before/Kill my ego/Let’s be reborn.”\n","short":"Miley swings for the fences: “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/something-beautiful/1804974240","playParams":{"id":"1804974240","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7h7smPzBYx8LOLI3ncM3vQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804974240/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"137057909","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137057909?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749213574263}}},"1805010644":{"id":"1805010644","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805010644?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/caamp/1090637188","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/2c/06/b52c065c-76b9-b40b-b25b-f696c1410b1f/33588551-513f-4be3-9047-06d587eedef5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7a37e","textColor2":"d9aa81","textColor4":"b58d6e","textColor1":"dac695","bgColor":"291a23","hasP3":true}},"name":"Copper Changes Color","artistName":"Caamp","artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6e/84/d2/6e84d255-f21a-1a7e-a0ae-4f2ac81e392e/810090096919.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"c5be8a","textColor2":"f3dec4","textColor4":"c9b7a6","textColor1":"efe6a2","bgColor":"211d2c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After the hearth-warm country-folk of 2022’s <i>Lavender Days</i>, Caamp sounds like a band reborn on their fifth album, <i>Copper Changes Color</i>. From the ragged edges of Taylor Meier’s swaggering vocals on opening track “Millions,” you can hear that this is a looser affair than what you might expect from this Ohio-hailing band—strongly recalling <i>Youth and Young Manhood</i>-era Kings of Leon, with less guitar squall and more easygoing jangle. The sonic shift was partially influenced by Meier spending more of his time in NYC’s Lower East Side neighborhood, a locale that bears sonic fruit on songs like the strummy, last-call rocker “Mistakes.”\n\nBut despite the metropolitan trappings, Caamp is still as reflective and intimate as ever on zoomed-in ballads like “Fairview Feeling,” accompanied by luscious co-production from indie-folk production wizards Beatriz Artola (Fleet Foxes) and Tucker Martine (The Decemberists, My Morning Jacket). Far from completely changing their stripes, Caamp has evolved into a new version of themselves that’s shaggier and more confident, without forgetting what led to their incredible rise in the first

Album","standard":"Turnstile is hardly the first band raised in a tight-knit DIY hardcore punk scene to graduate to big-tent popularity and grapple with what that success should look like. For the Baltimore-based five-piece, a stint opening for blink-182’s 2023 reunion tour served as a hands-on apprenticeship. “That summer was definitely a master class of existing in that space,” Turnstile bassist Franz Lyons tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Riding with blink, they’re great people, but also their supporting cast—everything they do behind the scenes is very sharp, and it was cool to be in a situation where you have to learn how to mend your creative way to a different lens.” \n\nThese lessons all came in handy in the making of their fourth album, <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, which doubles down on the genre-expanding—and, subsequently, audience-expanding—twists of 2021’s breakthrough <i>GLOW ON</i> and throws in an ambitious visual-album component that ties all 14 songs together. Among those songs are not just the tuneful, heavy midtempo anthems like the title track and “DULL” and hopped-up hardcore like “BIRDS” and “SUNSHOWER” that made <i>GLOW ON</i> stand out, but even bolder stylistic gambits like “I CARE” and “SEEIN’ STARS,” which channel The Smiths and The Police, respectively. The nearly seven-minute centerpiece “LOOK OUT FOR ME” somehow seems to incorporate bits of all of these at once.\n\nFor singer Brendan Yates, who also produced the album, this is all part of a more thoughtful, confident, and collaborative approach to songwriting that was certainly helped by the luxury of having more time—and more resources—to let ideas evolve. “If there is a song that’s just very simple and you’re like, ‘This doesn’t sound like anything we’ve ever done, and maybe people are going to hate this, but the intangible is really there for me right now,’” he says. “So it’s like embracing that.” And sometimes trying new and more daring things also means throwing all those away in the end. Yates cites the album-closing “MAGIC MAN” as a song that began as a demo with just himself and a synth, expanded and contracted through many more iterations, and ultimately wound up as…just himself and a synth. \n\nTurnstile credits their versatility and trust in one another to having spent half their lives in Baltimore’s punk scene learning instruments on the fly, playing in multiple bands at once, and innately understanding the importance of community. These lessons, too, come in handy as the band begins to find themselves headlining the kinds of venues—possibly with pit-unfriendly seats—where they very recently were guests.

What are we trying to say?’ And the words ‘I forgive you’ came out. For the heartbreaks, for the hearts we have broken, for the hard things we’ve had to say and the hard things we’ve had to hear.”\n\nAs she touches on the end of a relationship in powerful heartbreaker “Worst of Me” and finds joy in passion on “She Said,” Erivo found it was important for her to use female pronouns in her love songs. “I wanted to share more of me as a queer woman in there,” she says. “There are songs like ‘She Said’ and ‘Play the Woman’ that have the word ‘she’ in it instead of ‘he’ on purpose, because I also want to let people know that I’m proud of that part of myself. And I think sometimes we don’t hear it very often.”\n\nThe album wraps with “Grace,” Erivo’s tribute to a very special young fan who was terminally ill and wanted to see <i>Wicked</i> while she still had time. After striking up a friendship and FaceTiming her, Erivo headed straight to the studio. “I thought, what if I write something about the goodbyes that can feel untimely, but they still leave you with a little bit of joy because of the person? And they leave you with something that you can pass on to someone else.”","short":"“I want people to know I’m human”: The star on her vulnerable second outing."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-forgive-you/1806542353","playParams":{"id":"1806542353","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4FpWxfojxH2a3S5OBrMYoj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806542353/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"306141506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/306141506?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749214662678}}},"1806624367":{"id":"1806624367","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806624367?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jon-bellion/659289673","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8b/f4/e1/8bf4e1e2-0d84-9e55-e95a-2db53c8201b2/bc3c97aa-cdac-4f54-a315-bc186e4223a7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383630","textColor2":"131718","textColor4":"383832","textColor1":"131515","bgColor":"cdbc9c","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c3/58/44/c3584436-70bf-2109-ba76-e344b3073d4b/6de47608-7ec3-4c88-9fb6-7b19373dbcea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3b9ac","textColor2":"d3ba9e","textColor4":"b6a089","textColor1":"e4dacb","bgColor":"403733","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4d/28/43/4d28437f-cb70-3edb-cc38-573db115186d/d524b10c-f059-4206-b9cb-9eb6957b725a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ab9178","textColor2":"d2a984","textColor4":"ab876a","textColor1":"d2b596","bgColor":"0f0000","hasP3":true}},"name":"FATHER FIGURE","artistName":"Jon Bellion","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/88/35/ac/8835ac9e-dcae-4c2f-c4b8-afa168563d23/198704450051_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"241c17","textColor2":"040302","textColor4":"241d17","textColor1":"040302","bgColor":"a4846b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After 2018’s <i>Glory Sound Prep</i>, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Jon Bellion stepped back from releasing music of his own. He still wrote and produced for other artists like Justin Bieber, Maroon 5, and Jonas Brothers, and headed up his label Beautiful Mind Records, which has released albums by the likes of Tori Kelly. He also became a dad—an experience, he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, that sparked a realization. “You start to realize, ‘The father is wildly important in the home,’” he says. “You hear that, you believe that—and then you have children, and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God.’”\n\nAcross <i>FATHER FIGURE</i>—Bellion’s first full-length in seven years—the Long Island-born pop alchemist comes to grips with fatherhood’s enormity while also appreciating the way that living life apart from the day-to-day artist grind has opened up his creativity. Now fully independent (<i>FATHER FIGURE</i> is his first album on his own label), Bellion is striking out in directions that, he feels, he wouldn’t have even found if he hadn’t gone on hiatus from performing. “My music has grown and matured in a way that would have never happened if I didn’t walk away from the artistry for a little bit,” he says.\n\nThe massive task of nurturing young humans in a chaotic world hangs over the album, giving urgency to Bellion’s innovatively constructed, genre-fluid compositions. On the jittery “MODERN TIMES,” a reggae-tinged collaboration with jazz savant Jon Batiste, Bellion laments those who “got some money and lost [their] sense of mind.” The stripped-down “WHY,” a collaboration with Luke Combs, questions love’s existential purpose—“If the higher I fly is the further I fall/Then why love anything at all?” they wail on the chorus. The sinewy “RICH AND BROKE” brings the listener inside Bellion’s mind during an earthquake’s immediate aftermath. It combines breakbeats, sirens, and fractured choirs, creating a maelstrom that underscores what feels like the album’s statement of purpose: “Had a big chain ’round my neck/That I worked for my whole life/But the first thought was my kids.”\n\nWhile most of the album operates with what Bellion calls a “very gorilla energy of the masculine,” its last track, the luminous lullaby “MY BOY,” punctures that concept. “Fit inside these arms forever, ’cause the world’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he croons to the child he’s holding, and the racing thoughts he confesses to God expand on that: “I hate the weakness of showin’ my son what makes me sad,” he raps. But with that vulnerability, he notes, a stronger bond is formed: “He said a present father is worth way more than a perfect dad.” <i>FATHER FIGURE</i> wrestles with masculinity, fatherhood, and culture bravely and with gusto, with Bellion’s ever-evolving artistry and hunger for the truth fueling his desire to get even more real.","short":"The pop multi-hyphenate returns with a meditation on fatherhood."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/father-figure/1806624367","playParams":{"id":"1806624367","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5xKTTHKTTFyNxtOLGtznaR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806624367/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"659289673","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/659289673?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749205559623}}},"1807308262":{"id":"1807308262","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807308262?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marina/1451242169","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/51/92/9a/51929a53-4bf8-8501-b7d8-ca25e0dc5ee1/Job7296fc45-afe8-49cd-8ea9-b89632a8206a-189920761-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371857413_2116475414-Time1744199862998.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","69cfc1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"6dbdb0","textColor2":"69cfc1","textColor4":"59aba2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/a0/7b/a5a07bf7-a2bf-6a97-547d-2cd8192af89c/40e93f4a-741f-4a4b-99e8-b6a15a4ad15f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2b280d","textColor2":"111d1f","textColor4":"303722","textColor1":"0a0b05","bgColor":"af9d2e","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a4/ee/9f/a4ee9f76-180c-044c-937c-58f2b95532f2/Jobcd9eb09b-1a11-417b-8c1c-f8df03cbbe8d-189835247-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371700587_2115167123-Time1744117087961.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"203c3d","textColor2":"11231f","textColor4":"22433d","textColor1":"0e1b1f","bgColor":"69c2b3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f2/2f/e3/f22fe357-12cc-3cc8-128e-b4ef95707850/ee5ca6ab-e995-4b9a-832c-71fed2545fff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"85c2b9","textColor2":"a5d4cd","textColor4":"8eb5b0","textColor1":"9be4d8","bgColor":"30393c","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/33/e2/ef33e2b3-cf2a-28b0-cab1-f29529e5fbd4/1e9c049f-5031-44f5-843c-046f46ed4c5f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7aa9a5","textColor2":"7fc7c1","textColor4":"69a39e","textColor1":"94cfcb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"PRINCESS OF POWER","artistName":"MARINA","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3999,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a5/c6/67/a5c667cc-c8ac-cec4-ef32-146488dbcede/4099964156188.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3999,"textColor3":"213a39","textColor2":"0d1c21","textColor4":"203d3f","textColor1":"0e191b","bgColor":"6cc2b5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I feel like a new artist. It’s definitely a new chapter for me,” MARINA tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe as she steps into her <i>PRINCESS OF POWER</i> era. In April 2025, almost four years after 2021’s <i>Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land</i>, the Welsh pop maverick dropped the calling card “CUNTISSIMO,” the album’s third single, evoking the spirit of Salma Hayek, Thelma and Louise, and letting nobody dull your shine.\n\nMARINA took her time with the album, revitalizing herself to produce a glossy collection of tracks that reflect where she is in her post-Diamonds life. The vibrations are high, whether she’s embracing Europop on “DIGITAL FANTASY,” serving big emotion on “METALLIC STALLION,” or taking control of love on electro stomper “CUPID’S GIRL.”\n\n“I’ve never been worried about being away for a certain amount of time,” she says. “I actually like the periods away, and it’s always really refreshing. I’ve never felt any pressure to come back quickly.” Her timeline, she says, is her business. “I didn’t release my first record until I was 24, which was comparatively a little late, and I think certain people are ready to receive things at different times to other people.”\n\n<i>PRINCESS OF POWER</i> comes 15 years after MARINA’s debut album, <i>The Family Jewels</i>, and she’s aware that it finds both the singer-songwriter and the world in a different place. “A lot of this album has been powered by a feeling of reclaiming parts of myself. And also really thinking deeply about what power means,” she says. “We live in a very inflammatory political climate and, on a personal level for me now, power is about your ability to love. It feels really refreshing and energizing and very different to how I might have felt like 15 years ago.”","short":"The pop maverick on her sixth album: “I thought about what power means.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/princess-of-power/1807308262","playParams":{"id":"1807308262","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2rjfRdmVDBMFT5mamSsVeU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807308262/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1451242169","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1451242169?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749213178247}}},"1807912418":{"id":"1807912418","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807912418?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/seth-macfarlane/59544626","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/10/bb/96/10bb96f6-c246-9a18-72fe-72911c531753/Job3532b308-d628-4860-842e-aa0327eb133a-190769168-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373583190_2130475901-Time1745313030052.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","eef2e9"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"3f4658"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d5d8d0","textColor2":"eef2e9","textColor4":"d0d6d3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"3f4658","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/61/ef/74/61ef74f9-5df3-1cfb-9f5d-faba277664d5/Job07b210df-b682-41aa-9e0a-3301ecbaf06a-190769167-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373583189_2130475900-Time1745311978250.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d4d4d6","textColor2":"f6f0dd","textColor4":"d5d4c9","textColor1":"f4f1ed","bgColor":"566278","hasP3":false}},"name":"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements","artistName":"Seth MacFarlane","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/58/a6/a058a6a3-0638-8c5e-9318-8eed1250cc76/25UMGIM34560.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1e2329","textColor2":"1e1617","textColor4":"2e2c33","textColor1":"0a0a0b","bgColor":"6f87a3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lush-life-the-lost-sinatra-arrangements/1807912418","playParams":{"id":"1807912418","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Hyb1z0NtNaSrXYAw0jR5U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807912418/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"59544626","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/59544626?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749178211058}}},"1808507440":{"id":"1808507440","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808507440?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%C3%A1ngela-aguilar/565880444","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8b/b5/7b/8bb57b8e-8a3e-216b-6146-fc3cdd46881a/164d1b3c-2872-4e60-96c4-f4d61ccce531.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b19f8a","textColor2":"d8a988","textColor4":"b78d70","textColor1":"d1c1a8","bgColor":"301a10","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ec/85/91/ec85912e-d077-5bcf-4e16-3045416b2bd7/fc355396-47d7-4f19-a9ed-6e462a16e5a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b7a47e","textColor2":"d2b681","textColor4":"ae986e","textColor1":"dcc596","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":true}},"name":"Nadie Se Va Como Llegó","artistName":"Ángela Aguilar","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/c5/5d/aac55d9d-e990-541a-7f74-af0ab4554f54/198704464218_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"2b221a","textColor2":"200801","textColor4":"392111","textColor1":"0f0a0c","bgColor":"9d8352","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"At just 21 years old, Ángela Aguilar already boasts an ample, noteworthy discography that reflects both talent and growth. Though young stardom has the potential to dissipate over time, her commitment to música mexicana now positions her as a vital voice in the wider genre. That couldn’t be more evident on <i>Nadie Se Va Como Llegó</i>, an album where arguably disparate sounds like mariachi, cumbia, and corridos tumbados not only meet in harmony, but downright flourish in her dynamic presence. The traditional styles evoked by “Corazón De Piedra” and the title track nod to dynasty, while her contemporary artistic ambitions burst through on “Libre Corazón” and the devastating closer, “Lágrimas En Mi Garganta.” Regardless of genre expression, there’s a timeless quality to “A Dos De Borrarte,” a proud declaration of victorious womanhood. Though the album centers her as a soloist by design, she sneaks Marc Anthony onto the moving, mutually conciliatory duet “No Quiero Hablar.”","short":"A timeless album from a vital young voice in música mexicana."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nadie-se-va-como-lleg%C3%B3/1808507440","playParams":{"id":"1808507440","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ODLqXINKLL2qIRUe2AH35"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808507440/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"565880444","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/565880444?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749184425992}}},"1809015416":{"id":"1809015416","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809015416?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/addison-rae/1513956049","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b8/fe/dc/b8fedc6a-774a-358e-47ee-b92aba1dc723/Jobd01e18b5-8d3a-48ce-8050-0c8b37d1b65b-190962687-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373986702_2133489091-Time1745512423167.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","191306"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"6d0010"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"351d09","textColor2":"191306","textColor4":"44280c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"6d0010","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/70/7e/a5/707ea592-779c-a668-7990-dff19552dd37/bcbd3b26-0ca3-4711-8b3d-e34bc1de5fee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ba9a58","textColor2":"d8a84a","textColor4":"b0883c","textColor1":"e4bf6d","bgColor":"0f0805","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/65/a4/c8/65a4c85b-ed36-e1b9-79dc-70cab539cc7c/Jobb82c0a3e-1dc3-43bc-8525-7e05e4838d37-190963048-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373986703_2133489090-Time1745513600904.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2b2222"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"6d0010"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"583312","textColor2":"2b2222","textColor4":"543c28","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"6d0010","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/07/90/fe/0790fe92-171f-bceb-e31c-fee0327c8d50/fff72f6b-7055-4aa6-be7e-45d191c68c58.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e5bb7f","textColor2":"fbcf6c","textColor4":"e5b360","textColor1":"fcd892","bgColor":"8b4331","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/28/0c/69280c93-1632-54ad-52f6-3ed3b9f87e56/d739c734-26e7-4790-8365-4d4348216d92.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2867c","textColor2":"df9867","textColor4":"b3805f","textColor1":"f1a08b","bgColor":"031e41","hasP3":true}},"name":"Addison","artistName":"Addison Rae","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3715,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/4a/e3/cf4ae3c9-3420-6021-f059-cc6c87cf11b2/196872958249.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3715,"textColor3":"38200d","textColor2":"0c0602","textColor4":"3b200d","textColor1":"090502","bgColor":"f58a38","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Introduced to the world as a bubbly TikTok influencer, the singer/dancer/actor spent 2024 pulling off what looked like a total reinvention—screaming over the remix of mentor Charli xcx’s “Von dutch” remix, then releasing the steamy “Diet Pepsi,” a single charming enough to seduce even the doubters. In fact, Addison Rae was just reintroducing herself. “I always knew that I wanted to make music, I knew I wanted to perform,” Rae tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “That was something that was really obvious to me since I was a little girl.” And TikTok was the best way for a teenager from Lafayette, Louisiana, to catapult herself into the seemingly inaccessible world of showbiz.\n\nPursuing her pop-star dreams in LA studio sessions to write the songs that would become her first EP (2023’s polarizing <i>AR</i>), Rae found herself deferring to the professionals. “When I moved here and started doing sessions, I was like, ‘I need as much guidance as possible,’” she says. “Then, over time, I really started to lean on myself. I really started to lean on my abilities.” In February 2024, Rae met songwriter/producers Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser (both part of the publishing camp of Swedish pop powerhouse Max Martin) and wrote the effervescent hook of “Diet Pepsi” that same day. “[‘Diet Pepsi’] was such a natural beginning to all of this,” says Rae. “I think it was a perfect introduction in so many ways.”\n\nCue a string of curveball singles, each one presenting an unexpected new facet, from the moody, minor-key “High Fashion” to the Björk-inspired “Headphones On.” It feels apt, then, that her debut album drops the “Rae” and simply goes by <i>Addison</i>—a collection of dreamy, intense pop songs that sound like self-discovery, tied together less by genre than by mood. Tracks like “Fame Is a Gun” and “Money Is Everything” expertly straddle camp and sincerity: “You’ve got a front-row seat, and I/I got a taste of the glamorous life!” she winks on the former, a dizzy synth-pop number on the perils of hitting the big time.\n\nThe songs on <i>Addison</i> are not exactly club bangers, though they’re informed by Rae’s childhood as a dancer; nor are any of them obvious hits. But Rae relished the opportunity to let her creative instincts run wild. “Once you start playing it safe, feeling like, ‘Okay, I’m going to respond with what people want,’ you lose all your freedom,” she says. “You lose all desire for the whole purpose of starting it, and feeling like it’s a form of expression and a reflection. It’s more scary to let that go and give people exactly what they think they want.”\n\nAs for what Rae learned in the process of writing the album? “Let yourself play. Let yourself have fun, let yourself mess up,” she says. “I’m not saying, ‘All right, this is the real me now.’ No—it’s always been the real me, and those experiences have completely guided and shaped me to where I am now. It is about arrival—arrival to who I feel like I’ve become, and who has experienced all these ups and downs, to now land here, in this person that I am now.”\n","short":"“It is about arrival”: The influencer reintroduces herself on her debut LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/addison/1809015416","playParams":{"id":"1809015416","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ffVa2UhHUDwMHnr685zJ4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809015416/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1513956049","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1513956049?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749213256223}}},"1810062120":{"id":"1810062120","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810062120?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Música tropical","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gloria-estefan/485022","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5c/01/e9/5c01e9c5-a9f9-2ec3-906f-1d56156db7b8/2e2813ab-b5b7-4a4f-9981-13b83c353195.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"332a28","textColor2":"271b13","textColor4":"443931","textColor1":"110908","bgColor":"b7afa8","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6c/87/97/6c879752-4b96-54b1-02d4-e93969825cf0/5b69fd9c-946b-4567-80e1-20c5d09fad65.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"362e2b","textColor2":"1a1b28","textColor4":"3a3b46","textColor1":"140a07","bgColor":"bcbcbb","hasP3":true}},"name":"Raíces","artistName":"Gloria Estefan","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2c/22/04/2c2204b3-95cf-939f-2e6e-0d11d72443a0/196873051789.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"aeaeab","textColor2":"c5bfc0","textColor4":"9e999a","textColor1":"d8d8d6","bgColor":"050402","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Throughout her storied career, Gloria Estefan broke ground and crossed borders in pursuit of her musical passions. Undeterred by perceived language barriers, her discography ranges from the powerful pop of her Miami Sound Machine era through more recent material like the inventive <i>BRAZIL305</i>. Among her legions of fans, 1993’s Spanish-language <i>Mi Tierra</i> remains one of her most beloved albums, its celebration of classic Cuban sounds laid out like a love letter to the past. On <i>Raices</i>, she returns once more to those titular roots, albeit with another few decades of artistry under her proverbial belt. \n\nThe title track serves as its raison d’être, invoking both heritage and timelessness as core characteristics. With so many contemporary Latin artists looking to the Caribbean for inspiration, Estefan’s knowing yet exploratory expressions offer an expansive vision of what many would call tropical music. A seminal salsa spirit carries “La Vecina (No Sé Na’),” while “Cómo Pasó” reminds of her bolero mastery. Yet what might be the album’s most affecting moment is “Mi Niño Bello (Para Sasha),” a veritable lullaby for her grandson suitably presented in both English and Spanish.","short":"A Spanish-language

Album","standard":"On her fifth studio album, Sabrina Claudio is her freest yet. After leaving her previous label in 2023, the R&B singer-songwriter asked herself if she wanted to continue as a recording artist; she still loved making music, but not the promotional weight that came with it. Stepping back and writing for other artists (including Beyoncé’s “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA”) gave her that space to create without pressure. Meanwhile, collaborating across genres and workflows reshaped her sense of what was possible in her own sound. \n\nThat widened scope is core to <i>Fall in Love with Her</i>. Claudio’s signature introspective ballads remain, but the production is cinematic and soaked in reverb, her breathy voice suspended over a stripped-back mix of soft acoustic drums, dreamy piano, fuzzed-out guitar, and sweeping harp. (In a behind-the-scenes video, her producers named acts like alt-rockers Radiohead and dream-pop bands Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star as sonic touchpoints.) \n\nClaudio peels back lyrically, too: After years of telling other people’s stories in her songs, she’s finally ready to share her own. <i>Fall in Love with Her</i> traces her journey in love, from yearning to be desired (“Need U to Need Me”) to grieving deception (“Tall Tales”) to navigating healing (“Detoxing”). On final track “Memory Foam,” Claudio leaves things open-ended but hopeful: “Don’t know if I’ll meet the one/But I’ll try till then.”\n","short":"The R&B songwriter broadens her scope on her fifth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fall-in-love-with-her/1811427333","playParams":{"id":"1811427333","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5FLWW34mtPlu7S691mEQQ9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811427333/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1128029190","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1128029190?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749214151571}}},"1811582320":{"id":"1811582320","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811582320?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock","Alternative","EMO"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alchemize/1727114123","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Cold Fire","artistName":"Alchemize","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a6/64/43/a6644306-d3ee-7351-34bc-188d9725be56/5053760132257_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"babfc3","textColor2":"f07b11","textColor4":"c36612","textColor1":"e5ebee","bgColor":"0f1216","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cold-fire/1811582320","playParams":{"id":"1811582320","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4VHmmAgoCwYwk1AYggugad"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811582320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1727114123","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1727114123?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749183820958}}},"1811856920":{"id":"1811856920","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811856920?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/julia-michaels/378430797","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cc/b0/67/ccb06716-1ec9-a3ad-1371-714fcc2fc7a8/Job9b92877e-a18d-4239-9c2c-58995eb45ba9-191841671-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375659117_2148147204-Time1746501603455.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dda483"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"131313"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c7cbcb","textColor2":"dda483","textColor4":"b2866a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c0/29/de/c029deb0-bf1c-0370-f330-bc4d4405f347/Job77574149-d550-44a4-87f9-1c0a628180ee-191841672-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375659118_2148147205-Time1746502550957.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dbbc99"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"131313"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c9cac9","textColor2":"dbbc99","textColor4":"b39b7e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c9/f8/59/c9f85980-c8c0-6203-8337-d850232f74b4/066ad8cd-fb36-47c3-9d23-f8e98934bc6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5bab2","textColor2":"d6b8a3","textColor4":"b39c8a","textColor1":"d8ded4","bgColor":"2b2c2a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Second Self -

Despite being spread thin in a million different directions, he manages to excel in all these fields. After years of dedicating his talent to acting and writing songs for other artists, he emerged in 2023 with his solo debut, <i>Electric Dusk</i>, via Ty Dolla $ign’s EZMNY imprint. A year later, he released its follow-up, <i>MUTT</i>, a convincing sign that Thomas is all in on this latest endeavor.\n\n<i>MUTT</i> finds Thomas showcasing his vocal prowess and lyrical talent alike, telling stories of love lost and betrayal, staggering his way through empty relationships as he looks for his soulmate. On “SAFE PLACE,” he sings over screeching guitars and the persistent beat of a ride cymbal bell, admitting, “I see the glass half empty.” On “FAR FETCHED,” which features his label boss, Thomas takes issue with a love interest who is more interested in handouts than a deep relationship. “Paid for my mistakes in Benzes and diamonds,” he fumes, before adding, “250 fronted like you was my artist.” Leon Thomas has conquered everything he’s set his mind to, and yet, on <i>MUTT</i>, love eludes him.","short":"The R&B visionary expands his second album with nine new tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mutt-deluxe-heel/1812987941","playParams":{"id":"1812987941","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5m3rVDTPrTRwSgkKsvSYEL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812987941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"267251475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/267251475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749214716920}}},"1813477895":{"id":"1813477895","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813477895?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carsex/1302589140","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"HUMAN INTEREST","artistName":"Carsex","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c8/6b/36/c86b3645-d935-98fc-17a5-e053614272ae/artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"e2e2e2","textColor4":"b5b5b5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/human-interest/1813477895","playParams":{"id":"1813477895","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2lQhN30x7K6q6ZlgNf94nM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813477895/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1302589140","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1302589140?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749194978074}}},"1813502231":{"id":"1813502231","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813502231?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dennis-free/1672420809","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/99/59/30/995930a2-6cb7-0ca1-2dd7-3a3db98cc670/81b819d7-c5cf-47fe-98d0-791af0631868.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"b2b9b7","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a3aaa9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f3438","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/ab/a6/8aaba61d-1da7-6a87-89b2-41e39914d23e/cbea0825-9e5c-461a-b808-617cb057b98e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"afafaf","textColor1":"ececec","bgColor":"222222","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fe/d7/0f/fed70fb0-f3f7-fe6c-623c-5d4e46f3f1af/a9dfb6cc-4385-4941-b59f-c6aa92749c65.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"d4d6d5","textColor2":"eff6f3","textColor4":"cad1cd","textColor1":"fcfcfc","bgColor":"353d38","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/94/b5/b1/94b5b1de-a572-a39f-970a-91daa98f7104/f5c968b9-239e-4db6-adf7-7962e02531d9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cfd1cf","textColor2":"eff5f2","textColor4":"cad0cd","textColor1":"f5f6f5","bgColor":"353d38","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/50/5b/e0/505be09b-355e-707d-a422-7ff5fadfe263/caf748a7-d0a7-40a9-9cfc-855438c9839a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"c1c6c6","textColor2":"cdd2cf","textColor4":"aab2b1","textColor1":"eaebea","bgColor":"213437","hasP3":true}},"name":"Dennis Free at the Miami Grand Prix 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Dennis Free","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a7/ab/48/a7ab483b-9788-383b-92f4-0cb713987c02/df1bb6c2-515b-4acd-8339-116f28e27766.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3b9b7","textColor2":"bcc3be","textColor4":"9da5a1","textColor1":"d8dbd9","bgColor":"213130","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"The Miami Grand Prix 2025 was more than just a race, and off-track entertainment included killer sets from world-class DJs.

The 16-track studio album includes three group songs (celebratory rock track “HBD,” lead single “THUNDER,” and the Pharrell Williams-produced “Bad Influence”) and 13 original solo songs—one for each member. The result is an eclectic collection that allows each member time in the spotlight without losing track of its anniversary framing.\n\nFor the album’s lead single, SEVENTEEN chose the whistle-hook-driven track “THUNDER.” Written by members WOOZI and S. COUPS alongside so-called “14th member” producer BUMZU, the EDM thumper <i>almost</i> works as well as a hype-up song for an ordinary group of rowdy friends (“Gather around, let’s all go wild/’Cause our night’s getting hotter”) as it does as a hype-up song for one of the most successful K-pop groups of all time (“We don’t chase shadows when we drive, don’t worry/Let’s mark the exact time, 17:17”).\n\nThe solo songs run the gamut from sentimental ballads for a rainy day (SEUNGKWAN’s “Raindrops,” WOOZI’s “Destiny”) to slinky, club-ready expressions of swagger (MINGYU’s “Shake It Off”) to pop-rock offers of comfort (VERNON’s “Shining Star,” DK’s “Happy Virus”). THE 8’s hypnotic, electronic “Skyfall” artfully slips between the thematic and sonic boundaries, “a flying bird [that] leaves no trace.”\n\nHOSHI recruits American rapper-producer Timbaland to feature on “Damage,” his rhythmic exploration of desire, while BTS producer Pdogg leads production on DINO’s pop-R&B track “Trigger.” The infinitely relatable subject of love takes center stage for JOSHUA in “Fortunate Change” and WONWOO in “99.9%,” while love turns sour for JEONGHAN in “Coincidence” and for JUN in “Gemini.” \n\nSEVENTEEN leader S. COUPS wraps things up with the gritty and defiant “Jungle,” a bold hip-hop ode to all that the group has accomplished so far: “Fact, fact, fact, I’m the living proof in this industry, check, check/Game, game, game, third-gen that’s been rising for the 10th year.”\n","short":"An eclectic collection marks the K-pop group’s 10th anniversary."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/seventeen-5th-album-happy-burstday/1813894182","playParams":{"id":"1813894182","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0xlyof8BowaJtYPsxWYmkN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813894182/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"999644772","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/999644772?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749205547292}}},"1814004737":{"id":"1814004737","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814004737?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-violent-hour/1802068825","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Hell Or Hollywood (feat.

own evolution to those who came before. “My learning as a DJ was explicitly led by queer people, and a set that takes you through a sonic journey full of surprises is my favorite way to approach sets, all full of humor, unseriousness, and thumping bass,” she says. “The majority of these remixes were made by legendary underground queer and trans DJs across the world.

The septet’s “concept” (used in K-pop to define a fixed aesthetic and/or narrative theme) had been supernatural since their debut in 2020, but they made their vampirism explicit with 2023’s “Bite Me,” a Y2K-inspired pop track that beckons listeners closer (“Just come kiss me and bite me, yeah”)—at their own risk.\n\nTwo years later, by <i>DESIRE : UNLEASH</i>, members Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki have become masters at evoking a sense of dangerous desire with a vocal flourish or turn of phrase. “Out in the world, you’re just an angel/But here in the dark, my sacrifice,” they sing in dance-pop lead single “Bad Desire (With or Without You),” which sees “Bite Me” producer Cirkut returning to work with the group.\n\nWhile the album’s theme may stick tight to the titular unleashed desire, the mode of expression shifts: future bass (“Flashover”), hip-hop trap (“Outside”), pop-rock (“Helium”), and piano-led pop (“Too Close”). <i>DESIRE : UNLEASH</i> also includes the album release of “Loose,” the funky, mid-tempo pop track ENHYPEN originally released in preparation for their first Coachella performance in spring 2025. The track trades supernatural lore for something softer, but keeps the seductive focus: “I don’t wanna waste another second tonight/So in five, four, three, two, one, let’s let it.”","short":"The K-pop boy group’s sixth EP continues their vampiric theme."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/desire-unleash/1814718475","playParams":{"id":"1814718475","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nskZ8CFMrSNiOrceMHr4B"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814718475/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1541011620","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1541011620?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749205471910}}},"1814736319":{"id":"1814736319","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814736319?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%C3%B3scar-maydon/1524147696","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/d8/14/d1/d814d158-ea28-5ec6-ed76-6e40c2586ea5/Jobf30ca437-6824-41f7-9e18-5ec2b5db7f18-194196342-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380424545_2193995362-Time1749154399808.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f7893f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"100f0f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c7baac","textColor2":"f7893f","textColor4":"c97033","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"100f0f","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/66/c5/1b/66c51bbd-d2a1-af59-2b4f-2eda688e376f/210505f2-4150-4e4c-ba6f-98a9b18d2f87.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292d35","textColor2":"2b2221","textColor4":"413e43","textColor1":"0d0d10","bgColor":"9aaecb","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fa/f5/96/faf5967f-aea3-47bd-716e-8ee4d674c0a1/Job5277fcad-9256-4cb9-b206-ae542f280d85-194196343-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380424544_2193995363-Time1749156271884.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ce6c42","textColor2":"ef7148","textColor4":"c3623d","textColor1":"fd7e4e","bgColor":"122410","hasP3":false}},"name":"Rico o Muerto, Vol. 1","artistName":"Óscar Maydon","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/98/cd/bc/98cdbccc-335e-ead7-739a-0bba28b9b6af/196873187563.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cc7139","textColor2":"f61221","textColor4":"c91120","textColor1":"f98b41","bgColor":"160b1b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s hard not to see this first installment in Óscar Maydon’s intended <i>Rico o Muerto</i> series as an existential ultimatum.

Heavy hitters in the contemporary corridos scene, such as Junior H, Neton Vega, and Tito Double P, actively build with him here. \n\nWhether resigned to the prospect of immeasurable loss with Fuerza Regida on “Tu Boda” or playing as brash Clydes in search of baddie Bonnies with Peso Pluma on “Asquerosamente Rico,” he demonstrates an ability to both excel and lead. Elsewhere, he erodes intra-genre boundaries by hosting both Gabito Ballesteros and Luis R Conriquez for the evocative “Fina Con Los Valentinos” and reaches further than that by bringing Latin trap star Anuel AA into the fold for the beat-switching “Tuxxxi.” That latter vibe resurfaces toward the end, with “Mejores Jordans” rapper Victor Mendivil in tow for “ZAZA.”","short":"Get rich or die

This endless unfurling outward and reinvention is the perfect microcosm of the queer community.”","short":"A mix for the “liminal intimate spaces between the landing moments.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1815616265","playParams":{"id":"1815616265","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815616265/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1599336502","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1599336502?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195126184}}},"1815804383":{"id":"1815804383","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815804383?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bashkka/1667966257","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2c/8f/a6/2c8fa6bd-ff08-23a3-3776-ab18710ef568/e3891991-0bd7-47be-8d96-9185f27d944c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"474543","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"515758","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ececec","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/99/f3/6a/99f36a04-9f43-36e6-2bd2-28d1addd1aa1/895e76a1-9997-4cee-864b-90878cdd7833.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"413637","textColor2":"302a2c","textColor4":"555152","textColor1":"16080a","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/59/f2/fa/59f2fa69-e1d6-2a24-2763-a29dabb2e462/89fb3a8c-646b-43bc-9232-2d2572820a4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"444c4e","textColor2":"202d32","textColor4":"495457","textColor1":"1a2426","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/53/86/5d/53865d47-b147-fd91-444d-347edc8518e2/63b22366-c401-4f0e-bef8-a56c36b005d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"3f3536","textColor2":"180d10","textColor4":"433a3c","textColor1":"130708","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true}},"name":"Beats In Space 164: BASHKKA (DJ Mix)","artistName":"BASHKKA","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/34/a4/e0/34a4e093-2d15-ea3a-c809-56623fbb2af6/1eca76b1-6581-4c98-9e9b-d8996d6ced5f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3637","textColor2":"221615","textColor4":"49403e","textColor1":"13090d","bgColor":"e6ece3","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","short":"A set of lush deep house from the Munich-born DJ."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beats-in-space-164-bashkka-dj-mix/1815804383","playParams":{"id":"1815804383","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815804383/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1667966257","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1667966257?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749194927079}}},"1815806719":{"id":"1815806719","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815806719?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":26,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/knut-avenstroup-haugen/280989939","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dune: Awakening (Original Video Game Soundtrack)","artistName":"Knut Avenstroup Haugen","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cf/c7/af/cfc7afc2-5172-bd15-c096-32e0a28ce514/196873177977.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c7a37d","textColor2":"71b7e5","textColor4":"6597bc","textColor1":"ecc696","bgColor":"351818","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dune-awakening-original-video-game-soundtrack/1815806719","playParams":{"id":"1815806719","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7ywGD6818xlYT3tawU95Hi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815806719/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280989939","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280989939?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749196137335}}},"1815947236":{"id":"1815947236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815947236?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","R&B/Soul","Funk"],"releaseDate":"1977","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=294794187-332229148","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Tidiani Koné et le T.P.

DJ Mix","standard":"“Queer spaces like nightclubs have always meant so much to me,” Amanda Lepore tells Apple Music. “They were where I first found freedom, safety, and a real sense of belonging. For someone like me, coming up in a world that didn’t always understand or embrace difference, clubs were where I found my people. You form bonds in those spaces that go beyond friendship—they become your chosen family,” says the pop culture figure, performance artist, and DJ. \n\nThose spaces—and the people she met there—are reflected and honored in her Pride DJ mix. “[They] gave me the freedom to express myself fully, and it connected me with some of the most incredible, creative, and resilient people I know,” she says, explaining that her mix is a “celebration not just of the music, but of the community behind it.” Diving in a little further, Lepore shares that her mix is about “joy, resilience, glamour, the beauty of being seen—and most of all, pride. My set is sexy, decadent, queer, and above all, it’s fun. Just like me.”\n","short":"A dance-floor-ready mix from the singer and performance artist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1816337129","playParams":{"id":"1816337129","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816337129/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"108312848","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/108312848?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195129632}}},"1816353046":{"id":"1816353046","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816353046?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/waylon-wyatt/1713519329","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Out Of The Blue - EP","artistName":"Waylon Wyatt","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4d/27/5a/4d275aa2-dbeb-3795-0d6f-29174b164723/25UMGIM75964.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cad2c0","textColor2":"d6ecdb","textColor4":"bdd2c5","textColor1":"e7ecd4","bgColor":"56696c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/out-of-the-blue-ep/1816353046","playParams":{"id":"1816353046","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816353046/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1713519329","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1713519329?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749205709839}}},"1816459140":{"id":"1816459140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816459140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/la-roux/292533375","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/3a/13/693a13d2-0997-21bd-d634-2c417859cc30/99a6e486-b608-42ba-9bbe-565f8c6b50b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"34162b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"35172b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7f/90/14/7f901445-d0dc-123b-a70e-0c7eb4859499/8866d213-7f85-4299-870d-21227cef8ccf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"472a3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4a/b4/b5/4ab4b5b2-065b-575f-e0a3-779065c03c35/cc3cec46-ca7d-4954-b5fe-34c740663bf6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4e2942","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2d/4a/00/2d4a00b7-d2a2-1f30-f0c2-a6822ad8f7e1/7be5b932-7b22-4f4b-bb16-f9599b1a5df1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"49263c","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47273b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ff67cf","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/a0/d2/a1a0d27a-dbfd-9d48-3261-4fab03033f2a/4389135d-afff-4526-91a9-dbee255486ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"45263a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b283f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96cce","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/67/8f/0f/678f0f09-2bda-0609-b17d-09b35e0fcfe3/912aca23-93d2-4acd-959d-5146068a9e33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"472a3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"La Roux","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/48/7d/68/487d6803-a39d-a7a7-bab7-b89b69446dfb/65635dfb-c459-47a0-8502-0d7c465cc584.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"46283b","textColor2":"261f22","textColor4":"502e45","textColor1":"191616","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“I’ve always been lucky in that I never really had to come out or change anything about my lifestyle,” says La Roux’s Elly Jackson. “I kept going to the spaces I had already been going to which weren’t queer specifically, but I’ve always been around people and scenes where anything is possible and anything goes with total acceptance. That’s so important for young people finding themselves.” The synth-pop act’s biggest hits have been mainstays of LGBTQ+ dance floors since 2009 hit, “In for the Kill.” So it’s only fitting for Jackson to craft her own DJ mix in honor of Pride. “It’s mostly an old-school selection of ’90s house and groove moments,” she says, “with some modern electronica and two of my favorite La Roux remixes thrown in. Definitely reminiscent of going out around 2007 and discovering ’90s house, ’80s music, and electronica at the same time.”","short":"Elly Jackson of La Roux’s mix is about “’90s house and groove moments.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1816459140","playParams":{"id":"1816459140","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816459140/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"292533375","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/292533375?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749194967517}}},"1816777470":{"id":"1816777470","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816777470?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cassian/332261342","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Experts Only Radio #030: Cassian Takeover (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Cassian","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/28/b3/a7/28b3a716-3123-5344-c2cc-e6272ebfe02a/10ebf9e6-3c06-4b68-8bce-a2d1b45d5008.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d2d3","textColor2":"e4e5da","textColor4":"c6c7bf","textColor1":"f1f2f4","bgColor":"4e4f51","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/experts-only-radio-030-cassian-takeover-dj-mix/1816777470","playParams":{"id":"1816777470","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816777470/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"332261342","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/332261342?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195060787}}},"1816779023":{"id":"1816779023","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816779023?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":33,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Breakbeat"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/berrakka/1816777061","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/61/35/3c/61353c4a-898c-7157-537a-c6850867d8bf/38766b2c-20b4-4e2c-8161-1220f5a11635.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bca293","textColor2":"e2b792","textColor4":"bb9d80","textColor1":"e4bdaa","bgColor":"1f3438","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/04/bf/05/04bf050f-e264-50a0-c97b-f4a3bce45747/9d1b5157-1a56-467f-b22a-11852a2b12ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"c2b864","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"be9a78","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"282f2a","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6a/5b/23/6a5b2363-30c2-31a8-0b58-62bdaaeaf6c0/d7d8ebef-87d1-4690-8f4b-a7d349417fcb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"d4d6d5","textColor2":"efccba","textColor4":"cab0a0","textColor1":"fcfcfc","bgColor":"353d38","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/92/d4/62/92d46255-72f9-ab27-ef16-e30a6b73fce3/85875f14-9d93-4760-8f5c-6a9c06b5b5e7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"adb3b0","textColor2":"e4bea8","textColor4":"c1a491","textColor1":"cbd1ce","bgColor":"353d38","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0f/c7/60/0fc76070-36f1-d5f6-6e69-260ab0fc600d/0ee30b9f-3eb8-40c0-bf2e-410028765d3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"9fa6a2","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b59480","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"282f2a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Berrakka at the Miami Grand Prix 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"BERRAKKA","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2a/ad/9e/2aad9ec4-27e5-cc05-f1f7-e1c2a8a08d51/6ed05aac-ab1c-44e1-9133-e8ac5bd35613.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6a897","textColor2":"e0b5a0","textColor4":"bc9b89","textColor1":"edc6b2","bgColor":"2b312d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Bask in the high-octane beats.","standard":"The Miami Grand Prix 2025 was more than just a race, and off-track entertainment included killer sets from world-class DJs.
