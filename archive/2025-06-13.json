Album","standard":"In the two and a half years since 2022’s <i>NO THANK YOU</i>, Little Simz attempted to write its follow-up four times, to no avail. From the outside, the London native was at the top of her game. Since 2021’s game-changing fourth album, <i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</i>, she’d won a Mercury Prize, owned the Glastonbury stage, and earned a spot among the power players of UK rap. But privately, her personal life was imploding. In 2025, word spread of the lawsuit Simz had filed against Inflo, the childhood friend and longtime collaborator who’d produced her last three albums. The split left the rapper at a loss, as she recounts on “Lonely”: “Sitting in the studio with my head in my hands/Thinking what am I to do with this music I can’t write?”\n\nFrom this turmoil, the 31-year-old musician arrived at a breakthrough that manifests on her sixth album, <i>Lotus</i>—named for the flower that thrives in muddy waters. Here Simz pulls no punches on the topic of her former friend, snarling her way through the bluesy opener “Thief” (“This person I’ve known my whole life, coming like the devil in disguise”) and the eerie “Flood,” produced by Miles Clinton James with cameos from Nigerian British pop star Obongjayar and South Africa’s Moonchild Sanelly. \n\nBut the mood lifts on tracks like “Young,” a bit of post-punk method rapping on being dumb, broke, and alive (“A bottle of Rio and some chicken and chips/In my fuck-me-up pumps and my Winehouse quiff”), and on “Free,” a jazzy boom-bap meditation on love versus fear, on which Simz reaches a cathartic conclusion: “Love is every time I put pen to the page.”","short":"On her sixth album, personal turmoil leads, eventually, to catharsis."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lotus/1794880972","playParams":{"id":"1794880972","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0ofdTvYtx4LpsVjemJt71X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794880972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"627674564","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/627674564?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749806512160}}},"1795987832":{"id":"1795987832","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795987832?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Electronica"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/faltydl/264118511","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Neurotica","artistName":"FaltyDL","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f1/aa/38/f1aa38b6-38d9-e736-023b-44644863005e/112957.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"335571","textColor2":"1d2f4e","textColor4":"4a5871","textColor1":"002b4d","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/neurotica/1795987832","playParams":{"id":"1795987832","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4FRudhfet3pyi471dfZRWd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795987832/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"264118511","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/264118511?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749770446763}}},"1796292217":{"id":"1796292217","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796292217?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/440629621","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e5/0f/e8/e50fe8db-ad5a-4f3a-a1a4-b760d1574adc/3e6a270a-0337-4e92-a563-ebc064aa8011.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a4aeb0","textColor2":"cbbca6","textColor4":"a69785","textColor1":"c7d9dc","bgColor":"150201","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e7/12/a6/e712a697-1ff6-2f78-6b62-e77c94656db9/95e51aea-6e11-4470-926c-ed519733c51e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d2ab5c","textColor2":"f8b960","textColor4":"d4a35c","textColor1":"f5c260","bgColor":"444e4f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f7/8a/cc/f78accde-7ecd-6242-1b67-28cf0991b2f2/9f6489f5-b662-4323-8c0a-d7b742f2d569.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8a859","textColor2":"d8ba9a","textColor4":"af9880","textColor1":"d0cd69","bgColor":"09141a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Phantom Island","artistName":"King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/46/c1/6d/46c16da0-2e9b-4373-f54f-f85e09eac3c5/25UMGIM32804.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4500,"textColor3":"93ada6","textColor2":"f3a32e","textColor4":"c9882a","textColor1":"b0d2c9","bgColor":"221d19","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Strings and other orchestral elements add a soaring sense of adventure to prolific Melbourne ensemble King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard’s 27th studio album. Recorded concurrently with 2024’s <i>Flight b741</i>, <i>Phantom Island</i> was made in collaboration with composer Chad Kelly and a full orchestra. Yet, there’s plenty of room for loving forays into psych, boogie rock, and other fertile territory. The opening title track even flirts with cinematic jazz in the manner of Quincy Jones or David Axelrod, before “Deadstick” leans into the interplay between guitars and horns as singer Stu Mackenzie nails some particularly pleasing falsetto. Taking flight is a recurring theme on the album, as heard on “Aerodynamic” and “Grow Wings and Fly.” Layered vocals make “Eternal Return” especially lush, with the lyrics saluting the touring life while still longing for the gum leaves and unpredictable weather of Melbourne. And between warm hand drums and funky guitar flourishes, “Panpsych” feels like the sonic equivalent of comfort food. Having played together across so many albums and tours, it’s only natural that the band members are beautifully in harmony as Kelly’s agile arrangements guide these jammy songs skyward.","short":"Their harmonious psych rock now features a full orchestra."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/phantom-island/1796292217","playParams":{"id":"1796292217","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3koVdFrXznL2PQ8WxTYjt7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796292217/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"440629621","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/440629621?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749826982048}}},"1797418266":{"id":"1797418266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797418266?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/finn-wolfhard/1275324142","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/49/69/01/49690156-7be5-f171-ce16-36c45679df0e/Job677e9983-a88e-4b2e-bef3-8df1fa8e336d-188952451-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_369982671_2101542748-Time1743078117747.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","10cfa4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0e11"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c7c7ca","textColor2":"10cfa4","textColor4":"11aa88","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0e11","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/50/ed/dd/50eddd62-a979-72fb-86f1-824b0c37a29c/ee4bacdc-75e7-4a27-9db7-e66f52a60d33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3bcb2","textColor2":"d9cdbf","textColor4":"b5ab9d","textColor1":"eae4d9","bgColor":"252014","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/11/d2/14/11d214cb-28ca-5eba-27c7-c9cb3d1486c5/Job31b62b7b-87b8-4f9e-a1f8-d7b8d8de93b0-188952452-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_369982670_2101542747-Time1743079338393.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cccccd","textColor2":"07ddba","textColor4":"0ab59a","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"15161b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4e/7e/ac/4e7eac79-d578-fc0f-7713-96878a2cecab/e1d16c14-dc73-4b13-a7d7-3828bb5787c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2e2e30","textColor2":"221b1b","textColor4":"3a3535","textColor1":"121316","bgColor":"9b9d9c","hasP3":true}},"name":"Happy Birthday","artistName":"Finn Wolfhard","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7f/1f/89/7f1f89a1-dd12-ae9f-da1d-b8b681475a34/199066932827.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"cccccd","textColor2":"0bdcb9","textColor4":"0db599","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"16171b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In 2022, Finn Wolfhard—the Canadian actor and musician who’s balanced his high-profile gigs on <i>Stranger Things</i> and the <i>Ghostbusters</i> franchise by making noise in ramshackle indie rock groups like Calpurnia and The Aubreys—set himself a goal to write 50 songs by year’s end. The result is partially captured in the nine-song punch of his self-titled debut solo record, which is heavily reminiscent of Guided by Voices rock hero Robert Pollard as well as the clattering intimacy of early Car Seat Headrest. Kai Slater of buzzy indie acts Lifeguard and Sharp Pins throws in on production here, and the resulting vibe is so DIY that you can literally hear a teakettle whistling in the background of closing track “Wait.” Elsewhere, the beaming power pop of “Choose the latter” was inspired by current indie rock titans Alvvays, but as with the entirety of <i>Happy Birthday</i>, mere mimicry is far from what’s on order here; the tunes flow free as if they were piped in from the ultimate suburban garage jam session, making for a debut outing that’s effortlessly satisfying.","short":"More gems from the

Album and Interview","standard":"“This album means so much to me,” Calum Hood tells Apple Music. “It’s all these vignettes of stories I’ve waited to tell until I got to a place where I could articulate them in a way I was really proud of.”\n\nOn <i>ORDER chaos ORDER</i>, the debut solo album from the 5 Seconds of Summer bassist/vocalist, those vignettes alternate between frank observations on life and poetic, more ambiguous musings. They also find Hood at his most confessional, as is clear from the first lines of opener “Don’t Forget You Love Me”: “12am on Taco Tuesday/I’m crying out my eyes/And I’m sitting there wondering/If I want to be alive.”\n\nThat the song starts with a robotic, Joy Division-esque beat over which Hood sings in a deep register also sets the tone for the record, one in which the Australian songwriter leaves behind 5SOS’ more commercially focused pop leanings to investigate worlds such as shoegaze (“Three of Swords”), dream pop (“All My Affection,” “Sweetdreams”), and indie electronica (“Call Me When You Know Better”). Working closely with producer Jackson Phillips (aka Day Wave), Hood’s musical touchstones were, he says, “a lot of European alt bands, like Teddybears, The Radio Dept., Phoenix, and then towards the end of the project, it leant more towards American influences like The Magnetic Fields and Interpol.”\n\nThe album’s title reflects Hood’s journey making the record. “Those words really resonate with how I feel as an artist sometimes,” he offers. “The words are actually very complementary, they just kind of co-exist, and that’s how I wanted to approach this.” Here, Hood takes Apple Music through his debut solo album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Don’t Forget You Love Me”</b>\n“That song is very conversational in terms of me talking to myself, with a huge mantra of don’t forget you love me. It’s the most naked in terms of how vulnerable I feel singing or performing it. It was really important to go with my most truthful song first. It’s something that I say to myself, it’s something I [said] to my family as I [was] leaving 12 years ago. It just plays on these deep insecurities within myself. It’s almost a reminder to not lose that initial purity.”\n\n<b>“Call Me When You Know Better”</b>\n“There’s a thread of sadness within this album. In my head, this one plays out over one or two days and it’s just describing the feeling I’m going through. Essentially, these first two songs are conversations I had with my last partner, observing those feelings and touching on them postmortem. Sonically, I took heavy influence from Phoenix and even LCD Soundsystem.”\n\n<b>“Sweetdreams”</b>\n“This is probably the most pop-oriented song on the album. It’s built around this world where you’re aimlessly driving at night on a highway and the world is just passing around you, and you’re not really feeling like you’re coexisting with it. You’re by yourself, and the car crashes and everyone keeps on going. It touches on addiction—addiction to depression, to substance abuse, and also observing people that have lived that life, and what it’s like for them to experience that.”\n\n<b>“I Wanted to Stay”</b>\n“I wasn’t fully connecting with the song and thought we just needed another part. I thought of my dog who passed away a couple of years before, about all these beautiful times we had together and how much he taught me about myself and about unconditional love. And this melody started playing in my head which ended up being the chorus, and then these lyrics came to me. I think it was a little gift from him. Here’s the rest of your song. So it became an ode to the conversations that people still have with passed ones and a conversation with him.”\n\n<b>“Sunsetter”</b>\n“I’ve always loved the chords in the bridge and have tried to put them somewhere, but it was never really right. Then I played them after the second chorus and was like, ‘This is exactly what it needs to be.’ The lyrics up until then, there’s a mutual understanding between two people, and then the bridge signifies how quickly that can be turned on its head and how quickly your perception of things can change over time. It’s an ode to like, if things are great, really appreciate that they are great because maybe one day they won’t look the same. That’s where the chaos of that whole bridge comes from.”\n\n<b>“All My Affection”</b>\n“I was listening to a lot of Sufjan Stevens and how he treated his vocal, and Elliott Smith as well. Tripling the vocal makes it sound almost surreal, like you’re in someone’s head. It’s another one where the lyrics are very personal and a bit more esoteric. [It’s about] giving yourself to something or someone and having that being reciprocated and how that’s one of life’s greatest feelings.”\n\n<b>“Endless Ways”</b>\n“Me and Elijah Noll and Jackson Phillips wrote this one. David Bowie and Brian Eno used to do this thing where they went into two separate rooms and [wrote music] then came back and put the ideas together. We kind of did the same, except me and Elijah did lyrics and melody and Jackson did track, and, at the end of the day, we put it together and it became this beautiful song by chance. This one’s a lighthearted love song about finding yourself within another person.”\n\n<b>“Streetwise”</b>\n“There’s a documentary called <i>Streetwise</i> about these young Seattle kids who are about 12 who went rogue and off-grid and lived their lives on the streets. There’s this beautiful scene where a girl is professing her love for this kid and the kid’s not that fussed about it. I just thought that was amazing that these kids had a knowing of themselves so deeply, there wasn’t any second-guessing going on in the back of their mind. It’s the one song that isn’t totally based off my life. I found great inspiration in it.”\n\n<b>“Dark Circles”</b>\n“This one’s actually about a fantasy world where the band I’m in [5 Seconds of Summer] doesn’t exist anymore. It’s my love letter to the band where, if the band wasn’t to exist, a large part of myself would be wayward. So this is my love song to the boys.”\n\n<b>“Three of Swords”</b>\n“I really like that ‘Three of Swords’ is ending the project, ’cause it seems like it opens another door for me. The writing style feels a little more mature than the other songs, and it talks about a couple of different things—my childhood, growing up, and the house I live in now. It’s all about acceptance and over-nostalgia and how that can be a little bit toxic.

Featuring a bust of the critically beloved singer-songwriter carved meticulously out of butter, the image encapsulates Whitters’ brand of country music, which filters precise craftsmanship through a left-of-center, often playful lens. Produced by longtime collaborator and husband Jake Gear, <i>Corn Queen</i> is an all-killer, no-filler collection of no-frills country, with flourishes of pop and bluegrass woven in for good measure. <i>Corn Queen</i> opens with “High on the Hog,” a delightful and twangy origin story that puts a more laidback, devil-may-care spin on the weary perseverance at the heart of “Ten Year Town,” a standout off 2020’s <i>The Dream</i>. \n\nHighlights include “High on a Heartbreak,” which recalls <i>Golden Hour</i>-era Kacey Musgraves with its gauzy production and emphasis on melody, and “Casseroles,” a wrenching account of living through grief after “the casseroles stop comin’.” Whitters taps a stellar roster of guests to join her on the album, including bluegrass guitar virtuoso Molly Tuttle on the buoyant and rootsy “Prodigal Daughter.” Acclaimed singer-songwriter Charles Wesley Godwin lends an assist on “I Don’t Want You,” a tender and nuanced duet about a relationship that won’t stick but can’t quite quit, either. Whitters closes the project with a collaboration with Texas country-rock band The Wilder Blue, “DanceMor,” a hopeful reminder to keep on keeping on in the face of adversity.\n","short":"An all-killer,

Album","standard":"Turnstile is hardly the first band raised in a tight-knit DIY hardcore punk scene to graduate to big-tent popularity and grapple with what that success should look like. For the Baltimore-based five-piece, a stint opening for blink-182’s 2023 reunion tour served as a hands-on apprenticeship. “That summer was definitely a master class of existing in that space,” Turnstile bassist Franz Lyons tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Riding with blink, they’re great people, but also their supporting cast—everything they do behind the scenes is very sharp, and it was cool to be in a situation where you have to learn how to mend your creative way to a different lens.” \n\nThese lessons all came in handy in the making of their fourth album, <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, which doubles down on the genre-expanding—and, subsequently, audience-expanding—twists of 2021’s breakthrough <i>GLOW ON</i> and throws in an ambitious visual-album component that ties all 14 songs together. Among those songs are not just the tuneful, heavy midtempo anthems like the title track and “DULL” and hopped-up hardcore like “BIRDS” and “SUNSHOWER” that made <i>GLOW ON</i> stand out, but even bolder stylistic gambits like “I CARE” and “SEEIN’ STARS,” which channel The Smiths and The Police, respectively. The nearly seven-minute centerpiece “LOOK OUT FOR ME” somehow seems to incorporate bits of all of these at once.\n\nFor singer Brendan Yates, who also produced the album, this is all part of a more thoughtful, confident, and collaborative approach to songwriting that was certainly helped by the luxury of having more time—and more resources—to let ideas evolve. “If there is a song that’s just very simple and you’re like, ‘This doesn’t sound like anything we’ve ever done, and maybe people are going to hate this, but the intangible is really there for me right now,’” he says. “So it’s like embracing that.” And sometimes trying new and more daring things also means throwing all those away in the end. Yates cites the album-closing “MAGIC MAN” as a song that began as a demo with just himself and a synth, expanded and contracted through many more iterations, and ultimately wound up as…just himself and a synth. \n\nTurnstile credits their versatility and trust in one another to having spent half their lives in Baltimore’s punk scene learning instruments on the fly, playing in multiple bands at once, and innately understanding the importance of community. These lessons, too, come in handy as the band begins to find themselves headlining the kinds of venues—possibly with pit-unfriendly seats—where they very recently were guests. What looks from the outside like complex ambition really is, from the band’s vantage point, little more than close friends with shared history indulging one another’s biggest swings.\n\n“When trust is your really big element that makes things function easily, that involves people’s happiness, too,” says Yates. “And being able to just be happy to do what you’re doing and be happy looking forward to what you’re about to do, it requires a certain amount of willingness to throw yourself into the deep end.”\n","short":"The Baltimore hardcore act’s biggest, boldest swing."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-enough/1805820903","playParams":{"id":"1805820903","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52yD51X7yDinwlg6tbCtpP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805820903/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4472006","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4472006?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749827109907}}},"1806087713":{"id":"1806087713","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806087713?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/madalitso-band/1452793652","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Ma Gitala","artistName":"Madalitso Band","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fb/cb/2c/fbcb2c2a-0de8-6f84-0a24-a93fec0cfa8f/4062548115666.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1a312e","textColor2":"110f0d","textColor4":"1d3532","textColor1":"0c0a08","bgColor":"50ccc4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ma-gitala/1806087713","playParams":{"id":"1806087713","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64yL6dWj3yqCMKJ6sRC48d"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806087713/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1452793652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1452793652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1745817410448}}},"1806394350":{"id":"1806394350","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806394350?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dierks-bentley/3088872","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/19/71/c6/1971c65e-1644-cf09-4be8-80327924b874/47834512-5d3d-4f3a-aa8c-5d61db12c7f8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2b2e2e","textColor2":"152328","textColor4":"3b4241","textColor1":"020a10","bgColor":"d1bea8","hasP3":true}},"name":"Broken Branches","artistName":"Dierks Bentley","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/22/b6/b2/22b6b2d8-0880-5708-2bc2-0dd4ef727b3a/25UMGIM47844.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c6c1","textColor2":"b7c7c1","textColor4":"929f9b","textColor1":"f5f8f1","bgColor":"000004","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Dierks Bentley’s 11th studio album finds the longtime country hitmaker in a reflective place. The superstar tells Apple Music that the title <i>Broken Branches</i> represents, in part, the tight-knit music community he’s become part of since beginning his career, and how that interconnectedness is essential to his artistry and to his personal wellbeing. “We’re all broken branches out of the family tree,” he says. “We’ve created our little community here in Nashville of singers and songwriters and dreamers and schemers, and it can take a toll on you when you don’t have that family support around.” (In tandem with the record, Bentley launched the Broken Branches Fund, a partnership with Music Health Alliance that provides artists and other music industry professionals with mental health resources.)\n\n<i>Broken Branches</i> opens with “Cold Beer Can,” a lighthearted but tender collaboration with Stephen Wilson Jr. that uses wordplay to illustrate how sharing a drink can create connection. “Jesus Loves Me” interpolates the classic hymn of the same name to anchor a breakup song about finding redemption after heartbreak. That’s a far cry from the inspiration for “She Hates Me,” another breakup song with unexpected roots—the 2001 Puddle of Mudd post-grunge hit “She Hates Me,” whose unmistakable opening riff is repurposed here on Bentley’s more PG tale of love lost. Other highlights include the Miranda Lambert collaboration “Never You,” a long-awaited duet from the pair that makes the most of her singular voice, and the title track, a fun and freewheeling collaboration with living legend John Anderson and relative newcomer Riley Green. Below, Bentley shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“She Hates Me”</b>\n“I was writing with Stephen Wilson Jr. and just wrote a serious song, and we were doing a little thing in Nashville. We’re all getting together writing for a couple days. I was getting ready to go work with some other guys on another song, and that popped up in between, when we were taking a little break. Someone started playing that chord progression and someone said, ‘She hates me.’ Next thing you know, we’re working on this song. It was done relatively quickly, and it’s just one of those songs, like a ‘5-1-5-0’ or something, that just stuck around. And then, it comes time to pick a single. It’s like, ‘Well, this song’s pretty fun.’ I think I’m pretty good at recognizing that humor is important sometimes, and having fun is OK.”\n\n<b>“Broken Branches” (feat. John Anderson and Riley Green)</b>\n“There’s never any sort of plotting or planning, for better or for worse, when it comes to collaborations and strategy and all that stuff. The song dictates everything. And I heard that song. I love the song. I love the idea that we’re all broken branches off the family tree, and we’re little misfits here in Nashville where you make your own friend group. I heard it as a duet right away.”\n\n<b>“Never You” (feat. Miranda Lambert)</b>\n“I learned a lot from Miranda just through how she makes records. And maybe I’ve helped her along the way, too—maybe showed her things not to do in your career. But having her on this record, it was great. We finally got a proper duet. We did a thing with her and Jamey Johnson on my <i>Up on the Ridge</i> album. But this is the first time we’ve had just the two of us together. I sent her that song, and there’s a line that says, ‘Your long black hair falling off your shoulder.’ And I meant to change it to ‘blond’ before I sent it to her, but I forgot. So, the song came back to me, and she’s singing, ‘That long black hair falling off your shoulder,’ and I called her up. I’m like, ‘Hey, I’m so sorry. I meant to change the line to blond.’ She goes, ‘Oh, I just thought we were both singing about [your wife] Cass.’ I was like, ‘Well, we could do that. It’d change the idea of the song a little bit. I don’t know if they’re ready for that. Let’s make just a love song between you and me. Leave my wife out of it.’”\n\n<b>“For as Long as I Can Remember”</b>\n“We do everything together as a family. We’ve had times where we just all slept in one room, like the wolf pack, we used to call it, because we like being together. I’ll remember our family for just those dumb moments. And there’s certainly times on the road, too, all the kiddie pools and chalk and putt-putt golf courses and trips to Target we’ve made on the road together. Cheering on sports together. I try to be present for all that stuff. I do a lot of dishes. I do a lot of laundry. We all do that together. It’s all hands on deck. We’ve got three kids. But hopefully, just being their goofy dad is what they’ll remember me for.”","short":"On his 11th album, the longtime hitmaker celebrates his community."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/broken-branches/1806394350","playParams":{"id":"1806394350","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/28VlYkYjNd6Bs8bIl69BW8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806394350/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3088872","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3088872?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749826153657}}},"1806542353":{"id":"1806542353","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806542353?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cynthia-erivo/306141506","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/43/18/54/4318545c-04de-b7a5-4b8b-4ec3a0558b16/Job08aa6427-26ae-4c5c-a414-8df5cfb63dcb-192056528-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376106889_2152005770-Time1746723851743.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","0a0a0a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"fbfbfb"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"242424","textColor2":"0a0a0a","textColor4":"262626","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fbfbfb","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/de/8c/6e/de8c6ef6-1e12-94e2-4514-07653edf9879/73cf6e11-1cb2-489a-a53c-066cc7693f86.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"282828","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor4":"393939","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"b5b5b5","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e5/38/05/e53805e3-0621-ed13-9c4c-deac8f243041/Jobb71c7a2e-a036-4bfe-a93a-82e4f770c17c-192056529-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376106888_2152005771-Time1746724779371.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"313131","textColor2":"272727","textColor4":"444444","textColor1":"101010","bgColor":"b9b9b9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d2/41/ea/d241ea5e-3c16-a8c4-c2dc-2664975da74f/4578cb29-8b77-4399-b722-c658a4626e74.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bebebe","textColor2":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"ababab","textColor1":"e3e3e3","bgColor":"2c2c2c","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a3/bd/5b/a3bd5bd8-ec5d-682c-a7b1-f543822a49d3/f0027e9b-f968-4af3-a21a-7f9b862101f7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afb0b0","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor4":"a1a1a1","textColor1":"d6d7d7","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"I Forgive You","artistName":"Cynthia Erivo","artwork":{"width":3900,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/21/d6/42/21d64277-2748-7201-6dd8-fef24c808c47/25UMGIM52335.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3900,"textColor3":"313131","textColor2":"2b2b2b","textColor4":"484848","textColor1":"0e0e0e","bgColor":"bebebe","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Singer, songwriter, movie star, and multiple award winner Cynthia Erivo recorded her second solo album <i>I Forgive You</i> around the time she finished filming <i>Wicked</i> and it’s allowed her to step out of Elphaba’s magical shoes with 20 personal tracks that range from tender to sexy.\n\nFollowing up 2021’s <i>Ch. 1 Vs. 1</i>, the first track she dropped was “Replay,” a stripped-down R&B-meets-Britpop song that shows her in a new light. “It’s very different to the way a lot of people have heard me sing previously, it’s like a palate cleanser and it’s kind of a reintroduction to who I am,” she tells Apple Music’s Hattie Collins.\n\nOne of the album’s themes sees Erivo admitting her flaws through her unashamedly vulnerable songwriting. “I think people see a picture of me and expect no imperfections, but I wanted people to know that I’m human, that I’ve gone through heartbreak, sometimes caused heartbreak, I’m not perfect and I’m trying to figure things out as well,” she says.\n\nThe title <i>I Forgive You</i> speaks to “people who’ve hurt us and sometimes ourselves.” She originally had a different name lined up, but changed her mind. “I just thought: ‘What’s the overarching message in this? What are we trying to say?’ And the words ‘I forgive you’ came out. For the heartbreaks, for the hearts we have broken, for the hard things we’ve had to say and the hard things we’ve had to hear.”\n\nAs she touches on the end of a relationship in powerful heartbreaker “Worst of Me” and finds joy in passion on “She Said,” Erivo found it was important for her to use female pronouns in her love songs. “I wanted to share more of me as a queer woman in there,” she says. “There are songs like ‘She Said’ and ‘Play the Woman’ that have the word ‘she’ in it instead of ‘he’ on purpose, because I also want to let people know that I’m proud of that part of myself. And I think sometimes we don’t hear it very often.”\n\nThe album wraps with “Grace,” Erivo’s tribute to a very special young fan who was terminally ill and wanted to see <i>Wicked</i> while she still had time. After striking up a friendship and FaceTiming her, Erivo headed straight to the studio. “I thought, what if I write something about the goodbyes that can feel untimely, but they still leave you with a little bit of joy because of the person? And they leave you with something that you can pass on to someone else.”","short":"“I want people to know I’m human”: The star on her vulnerable second LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-forgive-you/1806542353","playParams":{"id":"1806542353","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4FpWxfojxH2a3S5OBrMYoj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806542353/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"306141506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/306141506?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749806709948}}},"1806624367":{"id":"1806624367","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806624367?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jon-bellion/659289673","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8b/f4/e1/8bf4e1e2-0d84-9e55-e95a-2db53c8201b2/bc3c97aa-cdac-4f54-a315-bc186e4223a7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383630","textColor2":"131718","textColor4":"383832","textColor1":"131515","bgColor":"cdbc9c","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c3/58/44/c3584436-70bf-2109-ba76-e344b3073d4b/6de47608-7ec3-4c88-9fb6-7b19373dbcea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3b9ac","textColor2":"d3ba9e","textColor4":"b6a089","textColor1":"e4dacb","bgColor":"403733","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4d/28/43/4d28437f-cb70-3edb-cc38-573db115186d/d524b10c-f059-4206-b9cb-9eb6957b725a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ab9178","textColor2":"d2a984","textColor4":"ab876a","textColor1":"d2b596","bgColor":"0f0000","hasP3":true}},"name":"FATHER FIGURE","artistName":"Jon Bellion","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/88/35/ac/8835ac9e-dcae-4c2f-c4b8-afa168563d23/198704450051_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"241c17","textColor2":"040302","textColor4":"241d17","textColor1":"040302","bgColor":"a4846b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After 2018’s <i>Glory Sound Prep</i>, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Jon Bellion stepped back from releasing music of his own. He still wrote and produced for other artists like Justin Bieber, Maroon 5, and Jonas Brothers, and headed up his label Beautiful Mind Records, which has released albums by the likes of Tori Kelly. He also became a dad—an experience, he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, that sparked a realization. “You start to realize, ‘The father is wildly important in the home,’” he says. “You hear that, you believe that—and then you have children, and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God.’”\n\nAcross <i>FATHER FIGURE</i>—Bellion’s first full-length in seven years—the Long Island-born pop alchemist comes to grips with fatherhood’s enormity while also appreciating the way that living life apart from the day-to-day artist grind has opened up his creativity. Now fully independent (<i>FATHER FIGURE</i> is his first album on his own label), Bellion is striking out in directions that, he feels, he wouldn’t have even found if he hadn’t gone on hiatus from performing. “My music has grown and matured in a way that would have never happened if I didn’t walk away from the artistry for a little bit,” he says.\n\nThe massive task of nurturing young humans in a chaotic world hangs over the album, giving urgency to Bellion’s innovatively constructed, genre-fluid compositions. On the jittery “MODERN TIMES,” a reggae-tinged collaboration with jazz savant Jon Batiste, Bellion laments those who “got some money and lost [their] sense of mind.” The stripped-down “WHY,” a collaboration with Luke Combs, questions love’s existential purpose—“If the higher I fly is the further I fall/Then why love anything at all?” they wail on the chorus. The sinewy “RICH AND BROKE” brings the listener inside Bellion’s mind during an earthquake’s immediate aftermath. It combines breakbeats, sirens, and fractured choirs, creating a maelstrom that underscores what feels like the album’s statement of purpose: “Had a big chain ’round my neck/That I worked for my whole life/But the first thought was my kids.”\n\nWhile most of the album operates with what Bellion calls a “very gorilla energy of the masculine,” its last track, the luminous lullaby “MY BOY,” punctures that concept. “Fit inside these arms forever, ’cause the world’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he croons to the child he’s holding, and the racing thoughts he confesses to God expand on that: “I hate the weakness of showin’ my son what makes me sad,” he raps. But with that vulnerability, he notes, a stronger bond is formed: “He said a present father is worth way more than a perfect dad.” <i>FATHER FIGURE</i> wrestles with masculinity, fatherhood, and

Album","standard":"“I feel like a new artist. It’s definitely a new chapter for me,” MARINA tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe as she steps into her <i>PRINCESS OF POWER</i> era. In April 2025, almost four years after 2021’s <i>Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land</i>, the Welsh pop maverick dropped the calling card “CUNTISSIMO,” the album’s third single, evoking the spirit of Salma Hayek, Thelma and Louise, and letting nobody dull your shine.\n\nMARINA took her time with the album, revitalizing herself to produce a glossy collection of tracks that reflect where she is in her post-Diamonds life. The vibrations are high, whether she’s embracing Europop on “DIGITAL FANTASY,” serving big emotion on “METALLIC STALLION,” or taking control of love on electro stomper “CUPID’S GIRL.”\n\n“I’ve never been worried about being away for a certain amount of time,” she says. “I actually like the periods away, and it’s always really refreshing. I’ve never felt any pressure to come back quickly.” Her timeline, she says, is her business. “I didn’t release my first record until I was 24, which was comparatively a little late, and I think certain people are ready to receive things at different times to other people.”\n\n<i>PRINCESS OF POWER</i> comes 15 years after MARINA’s debut album, <i>The Family Jewels</i>, and she’s aware that it finds both the singer-songwriter and the world in a different place. “A lot of this album has been powered by a feeling of reclaiming parts of myself. And also really thinking deeply about what power means,” she says. “We live in a very inflammatory political climate and, on a personal level for me now, power is about your ability to love. It feels really refreshing and energizing and very different to how I might have felt like 15 years ago.”","short":"The pop maverick on her sixth album: “I thought about what power

Remix Album","standard":"When a rock band releases a remix album, it’s often treated like an afterthought, with execs enlisting high-profile dance producers to slap new beats onto old singles and promoting them to club audiences who wouldn’t typically buy rock albums. This has never been the case for The Cure’s remix albums. Ever since their first—1990’s <i>Mixed Up</i>, which yielded the Balearic classic “Lullaby (Extended Mix)”—the band’s singer and principal songwriter, Robert Smith, has had a close hand in the process, doing many of the mixes himself. The tracks rarely veer into proper club-music territory. Instead, certain motifs are teased out and built upon, and are occasionally augmented with new instruments or lengthened for more languid DJ sets.\n\nThe band’s third remix album generally hews to that ethos. Even a towering name like Paul Oakenfold (who previously remixed “Close to Me” on <i>Mixed Up</i>) treats “I Can Never Say Goodbye” with a light touch, delicately accentuating its majestic vibe, while Orbital gives the downcast “Endsong” just a dab of industrial grit. Daniel Avery seems to even tone down the aggressive guitars and drums of “Drone:Nodrone” for his slightly more propulsive version.\n\nThere is, of course, a lot of variation across these 24 remixes (each of <i>Mixes of a Lost World</i>’s eight tracks gets three), and it comes most notably in the form of more traditional dance remixes. But rather than seeming like a crass attempt to gain favor in other musical spheres, Smith’s list of respected electronic music producers here indicates just how deeply his tastes run. Germans Anja Schneider, Gregor Thresher, and Âme manage to turn Smith’s tunes into restrained and elegant techno and house cuts, while Four Tet gives “Alone\" some of his signature garage-y shuffle.","short":"Oakenfold, Orbital, and more gently reconstruct The Cure’s 14th

Album","standard":"Introduced to the world as a bubbly TikTok influencer, the singer/dancer/actor spent 2024 pulling off what looked like a total reinvention—screaming over the remix of mentor Charli xcx’s “Von dutch” remix, then releasing the steamy “Diet Pepsi,” a single charming enough to seduce even the doubters. In fact, Addison Rae was just reintroducing herself. “I always knew that I wanted to make music, I knew I wanted to perform,” Rae tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “That was something that was really obvious to me since I was a little girl.” And TikTok was the best way for a teenager from Lafayette, Louisiana, to catapult herself into the seemingly inaccessible world of showbiz.\n\nPursuing her pop-star dreams in LA studio sessions to write the songs that would become her first EP (2023’s polarizing <i>AR</i>), Rae found herself deferring to the professionals. “When I moved here and started doing sessions, I was like, ‘I need as much guidance as possible,’” she says. “Then, over time, I really started to lean on myself. I really started to lean on my abilities.” In February 2024, Rae met songwriter/producers Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser (both part of the publishing camp of Swedish pop powerhouse Max Martin) and wrote the effervescent hook of “Diet Pepsi” that same day. “[‘Diet Pepsi’] was such a natural beginning to all of this,” says Rae. “I think it was a perfect introduction in so many ways.”\n\nCue a string of curveball singles, each one presenting an unexpected new facet, from the moody, minor-key “High Fashion” to the Björk-inspired “Headphones On.” It feels apt, then, that her debut album drops the “Rae” and simply goes by <i>Addison</i>—a collection of dreamy, intense pop songs that sound like self-discovery, tied together less by genre than by mood. Tracks like “Fame Is a Gun” and “Money Is Everything” expertly straddle camp and sincerity: “You’ve got a front-row seat, and I/I got a taste of the glamorous life!” she winks on the former, a dizzy synth-pop number on the perils of hitting the big time.\n\nThe songs on <i>Addison</i> are not exactly club bangers, though they’re informed by Rae’s childhood as a dancer; nor are any of them obvious hits. But Rae relished the opportunity to let her creative instincts run wild. “Once you start playing it safe, feeling like, ‘Okay, I’m going to respond with what people want,’ you lose all your freedom,” she says. “You lose all desire for the whole purpose of starting it, and feeling like it’s a form of expression and a reflection. It’s more scary to let that go and give people exactly what they think they want.”\n\nAs for what Rae learned in the process of writing the album? “Let yourself play. Let yourself have fun, let yourself mess up,” she says. “I’m not saying, ‘All right, this is the real me now.’ No—it’s always been the real me, and those experiences have completely guided and shaped me to where I am now. It is about arrival—arrival to who I feel like I’ve become, and who has experienced all these ups and downs, to now land here, in this person that I am now.”\n","short":"“It is about arrival”: The influencer reintroduces herself on her debut LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/addison/1809015416","playParams":{"id":"1809015416","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ffVa2UhHUDwMHnr685zJ4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809015416/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1513956049","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1513956049?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749820537069}}},"1809746675":{"id":"1809746675","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809746675?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luis-flores/1453333962","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Decorated Permutation -

After leaving her previous label in 2023, the R&B singer-songwriter asked herself if she wanted to continue as a recording artist; she still loved making music, but not the promotional weight that came with it. Stepping back and writing for other artists (including Beyoncé’s “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA”) gave her that space to create without pressure. Meanwhile, collaborating across genres and workflows reshaped her sense of what was possible in her own sound. \n\nThat widened scope is core to <i>Fall in Love with Her</i>. Claudio’s signature introspective ballads remain, but the production is cinematic and soaked in reverb, her breathy voice suspended over a stripped-back mix of soft acoustic drums, dreamy piano, fuzzed-out guitar, and sweeping harp. (In a behind-the-scenes video, her producers named acts like alt-rockers Radiohead and dream-pop bands Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star as sonic touchpoints.) \n\nClaudio peels back lyrically, too: After years of telling other people’s stories in her songs, she’s finally ready to share her own. <i>Fall in Love with Her</i> traces her journey in love, from yearning to be desired (“Need U to Need Me”) to grieving deception (“Tall Tales”) to navigating healing (“Detoxing”). On final track “Memory Foam,” Claudio leaves things open-ended but hopeful: “Don’t know if I’ll meet the one/But I’ll try till then.”\n","short":"The R&B songwriter broadens her scope on her fifth

different facets of music that make up what it means to be queer.” The artist, who first found viral fame in the early 2010s, has since re-emerged as a songwriter and DJ who attributes so much of her own evolution to those who came before. “My learning as a DJ was explicitly led by queer people, and a set that takes you through a sonic journey full of surprises is my favorite way to approach sets, all full of humor, unseriousness, and thumping bass,” she says. “The majority of these remixes were made by legendary underground queer and trans DJs across the world. This mix is in honor of the artists and DJs who inspired me, led me through my own artistic discovery.”","short":"A soundtrack for the queer clubs where you can “let yourself be free.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1814237606","playParams":{"id":"1814237606","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814237606/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"426285675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/426285675?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195182455}}},"1814372225":{"id":"1814372225","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814372225?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chippy-nonstop/465339138","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/91/ab/41/91ab41ae-268e-8d9b-7ab1-8f661fdfbdb3/6c18074b-0cee-4d57-b673-35f2c77651e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"44343d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e4354","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2b5df","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/63/c0/21/63c021d8-cfed-e8c4-ccb6-9bf5b3055ba1/458ee4fc-6407-4b0a-9459-a89cd51c6417.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f8/ff/71/f8ff713f-9d07-812c-d7a5-bdda2f5aaa4b/6677f71c-d86b-481e-b455-2bc2eef2a2e1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5a3e4f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/96/6d/b3966d3d-f3e5-65c5-6bd2-9dd831c67446/58adc579-218c-4244-8738-13ea124c358d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"483842","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"513c49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffbfeb","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e6/29/70/e6297057-a4fb-356d-befa-0d5796ab59c2/625a54c2-1c55-42de-bf4b-ae2ee60119d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"4b3542","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/7b/2f/137b2f0d-3b49-4a9f-ec1d-75f470efe4d3/3a292c5b-eb39-47e3-a4dd-58761055384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Chippy Nonstop","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ae/c5/65/aec5652d-c20e-9d13-e793-4e3c9c242218/7d1610e7-4194-44fb-95b8-e2355e47c7d2.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4b3441","textColor2":"35262e","textColor4":"5c3f51","textColor1":"1f191b","bgColor":"f9a3dc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“This mix is for the weirdos, the club kids, the children of the underground,” producer Chippy Nonstop tells Apple Music about her Pride DJ mix. “The girls that know the parties are always better in the bathroom stall.

EP","standard":"ENHYPEN continues their vampiric agenda with <i>DESIRE : UNLEASH</i>, the K-pop boy group’s sixth EP. The septet’s “concept” (used in K-pop to define a fixed aesthetic and/or narrative theme) had been supernatural since their debut in 2020, but they made their vampirism explicit with 2023’s “Bite Me,” a Y2K-inspired pop track that beckons listeners closer (“Just come kiss me and bite me, yeah”)—at their own risk.\n\nTwo years later, by <i>DESIRE : UNLEASH</i>, members Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki have become masters at evoking a sense of dangerous desire with a vocal flourish or turn of phrase. “Out in the world, you’re just an angel/But here in the dark, my sacrifice,” they sing in dance-pop lead single “Bad Desire (With or Without You),” which sees “Bite Me” producer Cirkut returning to work with the group.\n\nWhile the album’s theme may stick tight to the titular unleashed desire, the mode of expression shifts: future bass (“Flashover”), hip-hop trap (“Outside”), pop-rock (“Helium”), and piano-led pop (“Too Close”). <i>DESIRE : UNLEASH</i> also includes the album release of “Loose,” the funky, mid-tempo pop track ENHYPEN originally released in preparation for their first Coachella performance in spring 2025. The track trades supernatural lore for something softer, but keeps the seductive focus: “I don’t wanna waste another second tonight/So in five, four, three, two, one, let’s let it.”","short":"The K-pop boy group’s sixth EP continues their vampiric theme."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/desire-unleash/1814718475","playParams":{"id":"1814718475","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nskZ8CFMrSNiOrceMHr4B"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814718475/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1541011620","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1541011620?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749806396983}}},"1814908497":{"id":"1814908497","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814908497?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nxdia/1436208329","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I Promise No One's Watching","artistName":"Nxdia","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/34/a2/a2/34a2a265-1831-d544-398a-029f2f1b500f/074843751856.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9eb9bc","textColor2":"e9a16f","textColor4":"bc825a","textColor1":"c4e5e9","bgColor":"080808","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-promise-no-ones-watching/1814908497","playParams":{"id":"1814908497","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IVW9XdJ8w9MFB6VO66AXZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814908497/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436208329","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436208329?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749827243952}}},"1814944431":{"id":"1814944431","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814944431?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":39,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African","Amapiano"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-4kerty/1452941929","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cb/82/2f/cb822f96-c98e-2923-5303-b9a5e595b89d/6a685389-ece6-4f23-9795-89d943b9481a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"494530","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"684b2f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ddd379","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5e/17/fe/5e17feb1-b2b7-bd88-5a2e-b106e0e92551/bf96b5ae-4db2-4782-8cc3-bbfb6deb946d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"353525","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4e3b24","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"d9ca74","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d0/dd/41/d0dd4150-368d-f40f-9c9d-c9eb61968209/1aa4a844-ea90-4e6a-bfeb-7b467f6377e5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"37180f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"512313","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe4e19","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/1a/ec/b81aecdc-3f41-7faa-0fe1-e783e41c0aed/c42e0958-e157-4dab-98d8-60bd083b64fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"392d18","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"42402e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"d9ce77","hasP3":true}},"name":"Africa Now: June 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Dj 4kerty","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1f/0a/ce/1f0ace2e-2149-117d-4954-df2bd1283f48/2af8e434-26de-4d78-9dfd-bf0e240f0ff8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"bfb568","textColor2":"fe4f1c","textColor4":"cb3f16","textColor1":"efe382","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"For June 2025, Nigerian producer and entertainer Dj 4kerty spins up a cross-generational mix featuring some of the country’s biggest stars, including FOLA, Wizkid, Olamide, Ayra Starr, Asake, Tml Vibez, Adekunle Gold, Kashcoming, and more. “I started my DJ work from the streets of Lagos, and I still rep as a street DJ because the street motivates me,” he tells Apple Music. “This mix celebrates a range of growing and established voices.

From the alt vanguard to modern vets, straightforward to left-field, the tracks on the R&B Now DJ mix capture where R&B is now and point the way to where it’s going. This summer, the mix was put together by Bryan-Michael Cox, a man whose hitmaking résumé spans decades and whose name is synonymous with formative moments for people like Mariah Carey, USHER, and Jagged Edge. \n\n“As a producer, I love to hear new R&B blend with the classics,” Cox says. “My approach to this mix was pure feeling; all of my mixes are based on that. I am a person that lives in the spontaneity of creativity, [and] I was excited to include some of the newer records like Leon Thomas’ ‘Mutt,’ Jack Freeman’s ‘MVP,’ and USHER’s ‘On the Side.’” The R&B Now DJ mix is a window into the heart of R&B’s most innovative creators, so enjoy this set and check back for more one-of-a-kind mixes.\n","short":"The legendary songwriter and producer is putting you on to what’s next."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/r-b-now-summer-2025-dj-mix/1815358301","playParams":{"id":"1815358301","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815358301/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"472410","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/472410?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749629665164}}},"1815557208":{"id":"1815557208","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815557208?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/slim-soledad/1666937057","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bd/51/45/bd514541-9fef-f370-c592-8c1fa6df7c9b/4ca54f6a-b6e6-40d8-a7d6-d352b2a3ec24.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"34162b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"36182d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8f/5a/f1/8f5af13d-8b75-899e-8732-467442f846e1/ed764106-fb8f-460c-a2d9-a4482a5f5d74.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"562c48","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/28/d9/a1/28d9a182-0adb-0c1c-f4cf-eedc60621f26/53a7a589-895c-45ef-8eaf-e8f3eee53d05.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"482b3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9a/4b/0e/9a4b0e98-96c0-aa0c-24ee-e0d748075128/b2ce2ca5-6093-48fd-b506-36039495c757.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"48263c","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"532d46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ff67cf","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/04/71/160471fa-bbb5-c25c-2084-8d89d40adc5a/9a47447b-2d86-4655-899d-abb22eed0936.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"45263a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c2f42","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96cce","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4f/3c/1d/4f3c1dea-45f0-a29a-4d28-cdcb59d6f600/c6307608-7793-463a-9886-94e6ea6f136b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"482a3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Slim Soledad","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/86/ea/5e/86ea5ef1-1ddf-5b41-699a-ab82b979712a/74a955b9-d701-4ca6-9146-6c05eb2d3ad5.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"45253a","textColor2":"22201f","textColor4":"4d2f42","textColor1":"191415","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“For me, queer spaces, especially dance floors and underground parties, have always been more than just nightlife,” says Brazilian-born, Paris-based artist Slim Soledad. “They’re places of collective healing, protection, and resistance. Creating a sense of safety becomes instinctive because we don’t often find that in the outside world. These spaces, built by us and for us, are where we can breathe, exist fully, and remember we’re not alone.” Soledad’s Pride mix reflects her consideration of nightclubs as “temporary homes where chosen family forms, where bodies speak in rhythm and care,” she says. “In the queer world, we know we don’t get anywhere alone. Everything is built in collaboration, in mutual care. It’s not just a party, it’s a pulse that keeps us going.”","short":"Honoring queer nightclubs: “temporary homes where chosen family forms.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1815557208","playParams":{"id":"1815557208","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815557208/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666937057","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666937057?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749195083532}}},"1815611193":{"id":"1815611193","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815611193?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":38,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mj-nebreda/1545092542","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2f/b4/50/2fb45051-3605-5de3-2339-f472147c0016/0b9f9cdc-71b5-4e2a-a87f-a5d14d8d7a7c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"4a3a43","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"503d49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2b5df","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f6/41/d7/f641d744-35b4-45d6-90d1-111cb98b6c69/eec7d59a-e05d-402a-9294-da65fd9ff8bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48343f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d7/ec/e9/d7ece9f1-f843-b938-d021-05d93b5a2334/c9248e0f-8bc4-4be7-ae45-3064900690d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"4d3844","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d4153","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6d/97/ca/6d97caa2-5e3a-467c-2a10-c6d384abc541/4c43175f-76ed-4ee9-8317-4e138d44d4ee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"493842","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"513c49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffbfeb","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fa/de/ea/fadeea37-3b6b-cca3-9e0b-d7da18901042/5af783de-e979-4ee7-a94e-bc11953d2241.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"47343e","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b3542","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/85/2e/6c/852e6c50-7f57-d7bb-7352-11b910e2c16a/a9fabfce-a765-4393-ad5e-b2b28fe24b3f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48343f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"MJ Nebreda","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/09/3a/9f/093a9f3d-19e5-e7c8-e8c0-1f9061ce012c/11d4067a-eb13-4bfd-bedb-29ed9945e44c.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"47343f","textColor2":"1f191b","textColor4":"4b3441","textColor1":"1a1817","bgColor":"f9a3dc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“This mix is made in honor of all queer Latin Americans who dance to relieve themselves of the stress of their daily lives,” says Venezuelan-born, Miami-based artist MJ Nebreda. “It’s for those who show up to these spaces with love and support, regardless of how hard it is for them at home or in their communities.

For someone like me, coming up in a world that didn’t always understand or embrace difference, clubs were where I found my people. You form bonds in those spaces that go beyond friendship—they become your chosen family,” says the pop culture figure, performance artist, and DJ. \n\nThose spaces—and the people she met there—are reflected and honored in her Pride DJ mix. “[They] gave me the freedom to express myself fully, and it connected me with some of the most incredible, creative, and resilient people I know,” she says, explaining that her mix is a “celebration not just of the music, but of the community behind it.” Diving in a little further, Lepore shares that her mix is about “joy, resilience, glamour, the beauty of being seen—and most of all, pride. My set is sexy, decadent, queer, and above all, it’s fun.

EP","standard":"Following the release of their 2024 EP <i>GOLDEN HOUR : Part.2</i>, ATEEZ returns with the third installment in the series. From the fresh sounds of opening number “Lemon Drop” to the distinct vocal colors from all eight members on “Masterpiece” to the comforting lyrics of “Now this house ain’t a home” and “Castle,” the album is a showcase of ATEEZ’s signature charisma, brightness, and emotional depth. To mark the release, the members share their thoughts on each track with Apple Music.\n\n<b>“Lemon Drop”</b>\nSEONGHWA: “I think it might feel like the boys who sang ‘Wave’ six years ago have all grown up and returned to that same season. It’s ATEEZ’s first summer track in a while.”\nMINGI: “You’ll probably notice the refreshing sweetness of a lemon drop cocktail in this track, but I think you’ll also feel a summer that’s more than just blue. It’s ATEEZ exploring R&B and hip-hop in a fresh new way, so I hope you enjoy it with a cool breeze.”\n\n<b>“Masterpiece”</b>\nWOOYOUNG: “ATEEZ is the product of eight unique individuals coming together, and we’re on this incredible journey as one. That’s what this song represents. As you listen closely to our distinct vocal tones, you’ll notice how each distinct color blends into a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.”\n\n<b>“Now this house ain’t a home”</b>\nHONGJOONG: “This song reflects the emotional distance that exists between a house and a home. When you’re chasing your goals, there can be moments when your reality suddenly feels very strange. This song holds a message of encouragement to keep running until you find a place that truly feels like home.”\nYUNHO: “It’s a song that can offer comfort during those lonely times we all go through. Its charm lies in the hopeful yet bittersweet melody and vivid, relatable lyrics like ‘the TV we sat around on Sunday nights.’”\n\n<b>“Castle”</b>\nJONGHO: “This track offers a different kind of comfort from ‘Now this house ain’t a home.’ It’s about finding a space where we feel safe—to take a breath and give ourselves time to heal.”\nYEOSANG: “Just as there are no absolutes in life, there’s no such thing as pain we’re destined to endure forever. Through this song, we wanted to tell our fans, and ourselves, that it’s okay to not always push through. The beautiful lyrics express that message, which makes the song very special to me.”\n\n<b>“Bridge : The Edge of Reality”</b>\nSAN: “If you listen to the album in order, I think you’ll be surprised by how dramatically the mood shifts at this point. As you focus on the atmosphere and structure of the song, you might discover something completely unexpected and fun.”\n","short":"The members of the K-pop group detail the songs on this five-track EP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/golden-hour-part-3-ep/1816843869","playParams":{"id":"1816843869","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816843869/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1439301205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1439301205?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749806416202}}},"1816892055":{"id":"1816892055","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816892055?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pearson-sound/324306080","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Zoomies - Single","artistName":"Pearson Sound","artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/70/ba/62/70ba621f-b0dd-5b1a-62e3-41088996717d/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1440,"textColor3":"252525","textColor2":"021d00","textColor4":"22361e","textColor1":"060908","bgColor":"a3989a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/zoomies-single/1816892055","playParams":{"id":"1816892055","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816892055/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"324306080","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/324306080?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749788754419}}},"1816893735":{"id":"1816893735","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816893735?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/manti/152393494","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Numa EP - EP","artistName":"MANTi","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/79/23/1a/79231aee-2b72-0343-bd97-e3d56efbe0cf/4251804173551_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdcfe6","textColor2":"47cef9","textColor4":"3db6e8","textColor1":"e7eef6","bgColor":"1656a7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/numa-ep-ep/1816893735","playParams":{"id":"1816893735","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6taYWBL7C7vVJhSjLDEHsM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816893735/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"152393494","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/152393494?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749762487783}}},"1816982441":{"id":"1816982441","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816982441?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tom-rowlands/165809340","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"We Are Nothing / All Night - Single","artistName":"Tom Rowlands","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7a/4d/11/7a4d11d3-c4c4-c82e-f7b2-78b069167dc5/199350763724.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1c1e26","textColor2":"111010","textColor4":"26272b","textColor1":"040509","bgColor":"7d8298","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-are-nothing-all-night-single/1816982441","playParams":{"id":"1816982441","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816982441/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"165809340","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/165809340?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749788712880}}},"1817009690":{"id":"1817009690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817009690?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wisin/49252346","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/df/ba/12/dfba122b-97c3-ec5a-ffaa-96653a769042/ea034187-1c33-493d-a932-86ca859bdbce.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7b19d","textColor2":"f4d4b6","textColor4":"c9b099","textColor1":"f2d6bb","bgColor":"1b2126","hasP3":true}},"name":"EL SOBREVIVIENTE WWW","artistName":"Wisin","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/67/26/7c/67267c00-01b1-3545-e403-0f82d51157a5/199350358302.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a4a1ac","textColor2":"c3c6d4","textColor4":"9ea1b2","textColor1":"cbc6cd","bgColor":"0c0d28","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Given his decades in the game, Wisin might technically qualify for elder-statesman status among reggaetoneros, yet he continues to be one of the more reliable reps for his generation and beyond. As should be expected, his latest album <i>EL SOBREVIVIENTE WWW</i> includes the polished reggaetón that characterizes some of his biggest hits, with cuts like “Laguna” and “De Antes” closely resembling fan favorites. Yet his tenure in the genre means his range includes room for homage, executed faithfully on “Duro Pal Piso” and especially “Quiere Perreo” with fellow genre vet Sir Speedy. \n\nHis collaborative powers remain strong as well, building with Zion on “Carita” and flexing with Jory Boy and Brray on the throwback-laden “Dale Baby.” Naturally, he’s inclined to experiment with other styles as well, something his guests are all too happy to assist with. Beéle brings tropical fusion to their breezy “¿Qué Pasó Bebe?,” while an energized Farruko lets his dancehall reggae flag fly on “Sí o No.” Proudly on the Latin Afrobeats wave, Wisin links with Kapo for the lustrous “Luna.”\n","short":"The esteemed reggaetón veteran does what he does best."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-sobreviviente-www/1817009690","playParams":{"id":"1817009690","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1GczTJTAoJSPILp7gEMEfS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817009690/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"49252346","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/49252346?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749823962973}}},"1817237280":{"id":"1817237280","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817237280?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trust-d/1554453488","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Hypno Groove -

Whether they’re teaming with genre contemporaries like Fuerza Regida and Tito Double P or branching out with the likes of Bad Bunny and Romeo Santos, the Texas-based band’s ability to bring other artists into the sonic space—and vice versa—assuredly helped bring them in front of larger and larger audiences. For the EP-length <i>Y Lo Que Viene</i>, they proceed to hone that proven formula further, teaming up with old friends and new ones alike. One of their most frequent studio partners, Carín León, revives the bold energy of their prior joint cuts with the embittered, heartbroken opener “Mutuo.” Substantially more sorrowful is “La Buena Eras Tú,” which adds Neton Vega to amplify the boozy longing for a onetime love. On “¿Qué Haces Por Acá?” Tamaulipas’ own Mister Chivo helps to celebrate the victory of a new romance in the face of an ex, while Manuel Turizo shares in romantic regrets on \"La Del

DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. This month, supertalented DJ/producers Coco & Breezy have made the perfect motivational mix for your next cycle ride.\n\n“We made this mix to take riders on a full journey—from grounding into the ride to rising into your power,” Coco & Breezy (born Corianna and Brianna Dotson) tell Apple Music. “It’s not just about moving your body—it’s about shifting your mindset. We wove in affirmations and intentional energy to keep you motivated, locked in, and lifted the whole way through.”\n\nThe twins really know their stuff when it comes to what works for a cycle ride or spin class as they love a pedal-powered workout. “Cycling is one of our favorite ways to move and stay grounded,” Coco & Breezy say. “We love how it builds endurance, clears the mind, and lets the music carry you. That’s exactly how we built this mix—to support a full ride, from warmup through sprints and climbs, all the way to that final push.” \n\nBut none of this would be possible without a motivational soundtrack, including their own energy boost “Home” and the perfect cooldown anthem “I Am Free.” “Music is everything to us—it’s how we stay present and push through,” say Coco & Breezy. “The right beat or affirmation can flip your whole mindset mid-workout. It’s like a coach, a hype team, and a spiritual guide all in one. And at the end, we close it out with a motivational track that leaves you on a high—mentally and emotionally. It’s that final breath where you’ve pushed through and now you’re coasting with inspiration.”","short":"Feel the motivation with C&B’s bouncy “mix to take riders on a full journey.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-ride-june-2025-dj-mix/1818910286","playParams":{"id":"1818910286","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818910286/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1346395864","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1346395864?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749752733234}}},"1819101379":{"id":"1819101379","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819101379?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-tecca/1366503504","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ff/46/d1/ff46d126-70f6-26c1-d6be-9880e0a69744/56345562-7ef4-4d4b-9c17-d34122fcf032.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d2cfd4","textColor2":"e6d8f8","textColor4":"cbbedc","textColor1":"eeedef","bgColor":"5f5569","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/46/ea/ed/46eaed5f-0dcd-37a6-3c7b-fa83aa6ffb67/ba1dcf4e-6d8c-464d-94f6-488ef5c1a716.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"dadada","textColor4":"b1b1b1","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"DOPAMINE","artistName":"Lil Tecca","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/74/74/7e/74747e67-30a5-7ccd-eff5-42464758bc1f/25UMGIM81029.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c0c0c0","textColor2":"f1f1f1","textColor4":"c0c0c0","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The Queens-hailing rapper drops his second studio album in nine months."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dopamine/1819101379","playParams":{"id":"1819101379","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0CLqdKIh14TmKqLZCs9dml"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819101379/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1366503504","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1366503504?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749827095072}}},"1819251013":{"id":"1819251013","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819251013?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/feid/194502100","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2b/bf/78/2bbf78da-b7a6-5deb-f815-920fa807a1e4/1ca34f42-07cc-4b5e-9e46-2bdd02b783a4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5ab5f","textColor2":"77d2a3","textColor4":"64ad8c","textColor1":"c8d16b","bgColor":"191630","hasP3":true}},"name":"FERXXO VOL X: Sagrado","artistName":"Feid","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0e/dc/d4/0edcd462-1abe-7b66-08f3-453fe8dab49b/25UMGIM78108.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"31281e","textColor2":"060604","textColor4":"33281c","textColor1":"030706","bgColor":"e7ad7f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Medellín’s own continues to move reggaetón further forward.","standard":"A lot has changed for Feid in the five years since 2020’s <i>FERXXO (VOL 1: M.O.R)</i>, during which time he’s catapulted to international fame as one of the biggest reggaetoneros around. Going from Colombian club fave to global arena/stadium headliner was no small feat, yet the Medellín artist’s success can be easily understood off the strength of albums like <i>FERXXOCALIPSIS</i> and his collaborative <i>LOS 9 DE FERXXO Y SKY ROMPIENDO</i>, to say nothing of his features alongside fellow hitmakers Bad Bunny, KAROL G, and Rauw Alejandro.\n\nFor <i>FERXXO (VOL X: Sagrado)</i>, Feid persists in his efforts to move reggaetón forward, yielding instantly gratifying results and potential future classics. He brings a wary sentimentality to “KELOIDE” and the comparatively brighter “I MIXX U,” unable to fully extract himself from the emotional clutches of an evidently problematic baddie. Unafraid to reconfigure the familiar, he nimbly transforms the prior single “SORRY 4 THAT MUCH”—presented here as a bonus track—into a slowed and reverb remix.\n\nPerreo pop moments like “DALLAX” with Ty Dolla $ign and the Wisin-featuring “hypnotixx” mingle with much more experimental expressions of the sound. In particular, “NOS DESCONOXIMOS” affixes it to an atmospheric house structure, something that resurfaces toward the end on the deceptively straightforward “Priority.” Still, as progressive as Feid’s style can get, he still shows love and knowledge for his chosen genre’s island origins, throwing it all the way back to its dancehall reggae beginnings on “NO ME DEJO XXIMBIAR.” Similarly, “ANDO XXIL” calls back to the overtly hip-hop presence once found on early DJ Playero mixtapes."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ferxxo-vol-x-sagrado/1819251013","playParams":{"id":"1819251013","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3PfMmFVUx9oJUFvnDf76Iz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819251013/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"194502100","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/194502100?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749789100676}}},"1819531699":{"id":"1819531699","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819531699?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/finesse2tymes/1404115336","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Time Will Tell","artistName":"Finesse2tymes","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c0/ab/72/c0ab72a4-f002-7393-2632-0e73c62dc0cb/075679615954.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"f2e7de","textColor4":"c4bcb5","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"101010","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/time-will-tell/1819531699","playParams":{"id":"1819531699","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0eRnPgxYIFjAAmf163fGPe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819531699/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1404115336","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1404115336?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749807469594}}},"1820014344":{"id":"1820014344","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820014344?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jonas-brothers/114342891","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live From The O2 London","artistName":"Jonas Brothers","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b0/08/00/b008004b-edf1-463a-2696-59fa9c4c4d0f/25UMGIM81762.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cecfca","textColor2":"c6c0c5","textColor4":"a49fa3","textColor1":"fafbf5","bgColor":"1d1d1d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-the-o2-london/1820014344","playParams":{"id":"1820014344","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6wy8AUA6Ez3rMuVQNViFEZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820014344/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"114342891","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/114342891?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749823788021}}},"1820093990":{"id":"1820093990","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820093990?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-wayne/5869117","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6f/55/6e/6f556e59-127a-7c04-fa5d-acddd980243c/67de097b-e470-4e25-be66-172f0ef6fc96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c3032","textColor2":"191411","textColor4":"363635","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"aabdc4","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/ce/8e/0cce8ef7-ac10-57fb-9ba4-380b187f86f2/03db68c3-142d-4b09-97be-d931868ddb48.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3c3b","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"494342","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"707e81","hasP3":true}},"name":"Tha Carter VI (Bonus)","artistName":"Lil Wayne","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b9/bd/d1/b9bdd152-47dd-3f66-f950-19c736fec80c/25UMGIM80413.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"393632","textColor2":"20130d","textColor4":"493f3a","textColor1":"0d0804","bgColor":"ececec","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Hip-hop loves a franchise, and arguably none deserves more of that adoration than Lil Wayne’s <i>Tha Carter</i>. Plenty of rappers have gone the sequels route in the hopes of recapturing a vibe or reinvigorating a fanbase, but the first four installments of the Young Money impresario’s album series hit the culture like monumental events. The exhaustive way in which this quartet was discussed, dissected, ranked, and re-ranked by listeners and critics alike almost eclipsed their chart successes, securing Weezy’s spot in the G.O.A.T. debate forever. The seven-year gap between the fourth and fifth volumes felt like an eternity, especially as focus shifted towards fresh stars and new sounds. Yet even that wait came with a massive payoff—not rebooting the saga to suit the times but continuing his story in a way only he could.\n\nAnother seven years may have passed, with a handful of mixtapes in between, yet this sixth volume proves well worth the wait. After the brief albeit maximalist opener “King Carter,” those who’ve missed his powerful punchlines and rich rhyme schemes are immediately rewarded with the triumphant “Welcome to Tha Carter.” As should be expected this deep into his storied career, his proverbial pen prevails on “Banned from NO” and “Peanuts 2 N Elephant,” just two examples of his devotion to the MC craft. Longtime fans will rejoice over the Mannie Fresh team-up “Bein Myself,” while those unsure of how a fortysomething Wayne fits into the contemporary mix will be corrected swiftly on the Wheezy-produced “Rari.”\n\nThough some vocally resisted his literal rock-star tendencies on records like 2010’s <i>Rebirth</i>, he remains committed to that side of his artistry. Starting with the opening moments of “Bells,” he reminds everyone listening that rap and rock share genetic material before wrapping his wordplay around an ’80s-informed flow. Mixing Weezy with Weezer, the inventive interpolation “Island Holiday” starts out like a faithful cover song until he swaps out the “hip hip” with “sip sip” and proceeds to make it his own. After a ruthless two-and-a-half-minute streak of bars, “Loki’s Theme” drops an unexpected swell of guitar soloing, leading directly into the acoustic balladry of “If I Played Guitar.” Considering his guest list includes Bono and Jelly Roll alongside Big Sean and BigXthaPlug, not to mention operatic pop icon Andrea Bocelli, clearly no one genre can contain the force that is Lil Wayne.\n","short":"Weezy F.
