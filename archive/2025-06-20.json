Island","artistName":"King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Strings and other orchestral elements add a soaring sense of adventure to prolific Melbourne ensemble King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard’s 27th studio album. Recorded concurrently with 2024’s <i>Flight b741</i>, <i>Phantom Island</i> was made in collaboration with composer Chad Kelly and a full orchestra. Yet, there’s plenty of room for loving forays into psych, boogie rock, and other fertile territory. The opening title track even flirts with cinematic jazz in the manner of Quincy Jones or David Axelrod, before “Deadstick” leans into the interplay between guitars and horns as singer Stu Mackenzie nails some particularly pleasing falsetto. Taking flight is a recurring theme on the album, as heard on “Aerodynamic” and “Grow Wings and Fly.” Layered vocals make “Eternal Return” especially lush, with the lyrics saluting the touring life while still longing for the gum leaves and unpredictable weather of Melbourne.

Produced by Shooter Jennings (Brandi Carlile, American Aquarium), the LP finds Nelson in a narrative headspace, as the singer-songwriter and son of Willie celebrates life on the road and the very American iconography, like roadside diners and endless stretches of highway, that comes with it. <i>American Romance</i> opens with “Ain’t Done,” a clear-eyed and thoughtful reminder to keep on keepin’ on. Nelson keeps the pace slow and stretches his legs on that one, setting up the introspective vibe that characterizes much of the record.\n\n“Outsmarted” is playful if melancholy, with Nelson name-dropping <i>Mad Men</i>’s Don Draper as he sings of self-sabotage and failed romance. Stephen Wilson Jr. joins Nelson on “Disappearing Light,” a mournful ballad that creates tension between the interplay of Nelson’s raspy warble and the lower end of Wilson’s agile voice. The LP’s other collaboration is “Friend in the End,” a sweet and spare folk song that features multi-hyphenate Sierra Ferrell. <i>American Romance</i>’s penultimate tune is its title track, which boasts some of Nelson’s most poetic, impressionistic lyrics yet. Players on the album include Anderson East, SistaStrings, Matt Chamberlain, and Eleanor Whitmore.","short":"His first studio album without his band finds him in a narrative headspace."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/63/0f/fd/630ffd10-1b61-a1ac-d73f-7234cbd3ba40/196872809749.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"84a1c9","textColor2":"b8b8c4","textColor4":"93939d","textColor1":"a5c9fc","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-romance/1801779647","playParams":{"id":"1801779647","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2rBZC5I5tXgWH2a4mE3L2h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801779647/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1373338047","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1373338047?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393860253,"RTCI":0}}},"1802695820":{"id":"1802695820","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802695820?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/better-love/1320518145","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"a quiet place to go - EP","artistName":"Better Love","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0c/c4/38/0cc438d7-475d-7462-52ea-55bf64120c6e/199350073830.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cec9be","textColor2":"bcd2db","textColor4":"9bacb3","textColor1":"fcf6e8","bgColor":"171516","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-quiet-place-to-go-ep/1802695820","playParams":{"id":"1802695820","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802695820/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1320518145","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1320518145?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393825885,"RTCI":0}}},"1803270156":{"id":"1803270156","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803270156?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/calum-hood/1803357790","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/96/f1/51/96f151e3-4f0f-8c18-498b-934b90471fe3/Jobd5e004ae-26a4-4215-a1b0-d66cdd7590d3-194725735-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381487936_2203322994-Time1749793142703.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b3c6f8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"a5a199","textColor2":"b3c6f8","textColor4":"8f9ec6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/70/b5/29/70b52996-c521-1713-e833-29a5493a06cf/1565143e-1141-4071-9774-f9ed647eca2d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb998c","textColor2":"d6a98e","textColor4":"ab8974","textColor1":"e9beac","bgColor":"02070c","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7d/07/5e/7d075e03-8e40-3ba3-e0e6-103374bd1777/Job0604fdfa-99a3-4753-a1c8-7874f424e273-194725736-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381487937_2203322995-Time1749794520507.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d4d0d0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c8c8c9","textColor2":"d4d0d0","textColor4":"aaa6a6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/13/12/15/131215d9-9986-be97-fc1f-3479aa698e3e/9ad23003-c76b-485d-81a9-6f11fd4444b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5b1a8","textColor2":"adb8df","textColor4":"9199b9","textColor1":"dad5ca","bgColor":"202021","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d0/c8/c3/d0c8c3da-ab63-0993-51b4-9dadb9a9a0f8/3b541d5f-f543-48a0-8d06-e362ee381eed.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a88e8a","textColor2":"c9a9a5","textColor4":"a08784","textColor1":"d2b2ad","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true}},"name":"ORDER chaos ORDER","artistName":"Calum Hood","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“This album means so much to me,” Calum Hood tells Apple Music. “It’s all these vignettes of stories I’ve waited to tell until I got to a place where I could articulate them in a way I was really proud of.”\n\nOn <i>ORDER chaos ORDER</i>, the debut solo album from the 5 Seconds of Summer bassist/vocalist, those vignettes alternate between frank observations on life and poetic, more ambiguous musings. They also find Hood at his most confessional, as is clear from the first lines of opener “Don’t Forget You Love Me”: “12am on Taco Tuesday/I’m crying out my eyes/And I’m sitting there wondering/If I want to be alive.”\n\nThat the song starts with a robotic, Joy Division-esque beat over which Hood sings in a deep register also sets the tone for the record, one in which the Australian songwriter leaves behind 5SOS’ more commercially focused pop leanings to investigate worlds such as shoegaze (“Three of Swords”), dream pop (“All My Affection,” “Sweetdreams”), and indie electronica (“Call Me When You Know Better”). Working closely with producer Jackson Phillips (aka Day Wave), Hood’s musical touchstones were, he says, “a lot of European alt bands, like Teddybears, The Radio Dept., Phoenix, and then towards the end of the project, it leant more towards American influences like The Magnetic Fields and Interpol.”\n\nThe album’s title reflects Hood’s journey making the record. “Those words really resonate with how I feel as an artist sometimes,” he offers. “The words are actually very complementary, they just kind of co-exist, and that’s how I wanted to approach this.” Here, Hood takes Apple Music through his debut solo album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Don’t Forget You Love Me”</b>\n“That song is very conversational in terms of me talking to myself, with a huge mantra of don’t forget you love me. It’s the most naked in terms of how vulnerable I feel singing or performing it. It was really important to go with my most truthful song first. It’s something that I say to myself, it’s something I [said] to my family as I [was] leaving 12 years ago. It just plays on these deep insecurities within myself. It’s almost a reminder to not lose that initial purity.”\n\n<b>“Call Me When You Know Better”</b>\n“There’s a thread of sadness within this album. In my head, this one plays out over one or two days and it’s just describing the feeling I’m going through. Essentially, these first two songs are conversations I had with my last partner, observing those feelings and touching on them postmortem. Sonically, I took heavy influence from Phoenix and even LCD Soundsystem.”\n\n<b>“Sweetdreams”</b>\n“This is probably the most pop-oriented song on the album. It’s built around this world where you’re aimlessly driving at night on a highway and the world is just passing around you, and you’re not really feeling like you’re coexisting with it. You’re by yourself, and the car crashes and everyone keeps on going. It touches on addiction—addiction to depression, to substance abuse, and also observing people that have lived that life, and what it’s like for them to experience that.”\n\n<b>“I Wanted to Stay”</b>\n“I wasn’t fully connecting with the song and thought we just needed another part. I thought of my dog who passed away a couple of years before, about all these beautiful times we had together and how much he taught me about myself and about unconditional love. And this melody started playing in my head which ended up being the chorus, and then these lyrics came to me. I think it was a little gift from him. Here’s the rest of your song. So it became an ode to the conversations that people still have with passed ones and a conversation with him.”\n\n<b>“Sunsetter”</b>\n“I’ve always loved the chords in the bridge and have tried to put them somewhere, but it was never really right. Then I played them after the second chorus and was like, ‘This is exactly what it needs to be.’ The lyrics up until then, there’s a mutual understanding between two people, and then the bridge signifies how quickly that can be turned on its head and how quickly your perception of things can change over time. It’s an ode to like, if things are great, really appreciate that they are great because maybe one day they won’t look the same. That’s where the chaos of that whole bridge comes from.”\n\n<b>“All My Affection”</b>\n“I was listening to a lot of Sufjan Stevens and how he treated his vocal, and Elliott Smith as well. Tripling the vocal makes it sound almost surreal, like you’re in someone’s head. It’s another one where the lyrics are very personal and a bit more esoteric. [It’s about] giving yourself to something or someone and having that being reciprocated and how that’s one of life’s greatest feelings.”\n\n<b>“Endless Ways”</b>\n“Me and Elijah Noll and Jackson Phillips wrote this one. David Bowie and Brian Eno used to do this thing where they went into two separate rooms and [wrote music] then came back and put the ideas together. We kind of did the same, except me and Elijah did lyrics and melody and Jackson did track, and, at the end of the day, we put it together and it became this beautiful song by chance. This one’s a lighthearted love song about finding yourself within another person.”\n\n<b>“Streetwise”</b>\n“There’s a documentary called <i>Streetwise</i> about these young Seattle kids who are about 12 who went rogue and off-grid and lived their lives on the streets. There’s this beautiful scene where a girl is professing her love for this kid and the kid’s not that fussed about it. I just thought that was amazing that these kids had a knowing of themselves so deeply, there wasn’t any second-guessing going on in the back of their mind. It’s the one song that isn’t totally based off my life. I found great inspiration in it.”\n\n<b>“Dark Circles”</b>\n“This one’s actually about a fantasy world where the band I’m in [5 Seconds of Summer] doesn’t exist anymore. It’s my love letter to the band where, if the band wasn’t to exist, a large part of myself would be wayward. So this is my love song to the boys.”\n\n<b>“Three of Swords”</b>\n“I really like that ‘Three of Swords’ is ending the project, ’cause it seems like it opens another door for me. The writing style feels a little more mature than the other songs, and it talks about a couple of different things—my childhood, growing up, and the house I live in now. It’s all about acceptance and over-nostalgia and how that can be a little bit toxic. It’s more about focusing my sights on the future.”","short":"The 5SOS bassist on his debut album: “There’s a thread of sadness.”"},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/64/41/1f/64411f0c-4721-076a-e703-d215efcf2a87/25UMGIM46471.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cbc7c5","textColor2":"d1d0cd","textColor4":"a7a6a4","textColor1":"fffaf7","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/order-chaos-order/1803270156","playParams":{"id":"1803270156","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0O0OCwx5K3WRMrfqwVMR2f"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803270156/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1803357790","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1803357790?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750392584230,"RTCI":0}}},"1803672246":{"id":"1803672246","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803672246?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/badflower/610204704","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/58/3d/bc/583dbc3a-3c09-09d1-aa5c-8e85e25f4cd8/9c3aef96-df31-495a-86c7-57475f709339.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a99d","textColor2":"cebfad","textColor4":"a89c8e","textColor1":"dacfc0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"No Place Like Home","artistName":"Badflower","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Following up 2021’s <i>This Is How the World Ends</i>, alt-rock squad Badflower brings an eclectic mix of sounds and lyrical themes to their third album. Propelled by staccato guitars and an ominous piano line, “Haunting You” climaxes in an anthemic chorus that could be about fealty—or stalking someone. “London” is a romantic fantasy in which singer/guitarist Josh Katz implores his significant other to quit their job so they can start a new life overseas. “Snuff” kicks off with a repeating bassline that recalls—of all things—Little Peggy March’s 1963 teenage smash “I Will Follow Him.” But then Badflower twists it into a Queens of the Stone Age-y dance jam with bondage references and a clever fake sample. The bubbling single “Detroit,” originally released in July 2024, reappears on <i>No Place Like Home</i>. With its crowd-chanted chorus—recorded live at one of the band’s shows not long after the song was written—and lyrics about perpetual unhappiness, it’s already a fan favorite. On a more somber note, the heart-wrenching “Paws” is a salute to Katz’s dearly departed dog, Maggie.","short":"The LA squad’s fourth album brings an eclectic mix of sounds and

where Harrison Patrick Smith (better known as The Dare) has become the figurehead for a revivalist movement of a certain Myspace-era jouissance. The DJ, producer, and one-man electroclash band blew up in 2022 with “Girls,” a raunchy throwback to DFA Records’ heyday in feverish celebration of the ladies of the demimonde: “I like the girls that do drugs/Girls with cigarettes in the back of the club.”\n\nHis first full-length as The Dare refracts the touchstones of the indie-sleaze era: Blog Haus’ sawtooth synths, LCD Soundsystem’s sardonic punk funk, Peaches’ unrepentant horniness, Benny Benassi’s electro scuzz. “I’m in the club while you’re online!” Smith crows on “Good Time,” a Lower East Side jock-jam that doesn’t skimp on cowbell; “Open Up” and “You’re Invited” further extol the healing powers of touching grass. Glimmers of “Guess,” the Dare-produced Charli xcx bonus track, echo through the charmingly louche “Perfume.” Now, throw on your best vintage American Apparel and don’t come home ’til sunrise.","short":"The second-gen NYC indie dance-punk provacateur gives his debut LP a bump."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4b/bb/c3/4bbbc386-1f68-463f-baa4-86145ff0421a/24UMGIM64117.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfb5bc","textColor2":"e2cee4","textColor4":"b4a5b7","textColor1":"efe1eb","bgColor":"000403","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whats-wrong-with-new-york-afters/1806160413","playParams":{"id":"1806160413","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Koz57deVak6xZwiY5rOTK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806160413/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1638797654","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1638797654?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750430393389,"RTCI":0}}},"1806720489":{"id":"1806720489","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806720489?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"1996-06-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/metallica/3996865","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Load (Remastered)","artistName":"Metallica","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3100,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/97/e7/3c/97e73c7c-435b-7c98-f44a-40ee408d7dc7/810083962887.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3100,"textColor3":"c07052","textColor2":"ec674c","textColor4":"bc523d","textColor1":"f08c67","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/load-remastered/1806720489","playParams":{"id":"1806720489","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7ptp5j3zJ5gjxg27OyQKhb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806720489/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3996865","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3996865?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750288202618,"RTCI":0}}},"1807286135":{"id":"1807286135","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807286135?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano","Chamber Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=605494761-1738508742","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/04/17/de/0417de37-c229-d85c-5df9-31ad8eacb5dd/106488be-686a-4d45-8c7b-a366bfd2d24e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5955b","textColor2":"e3a33d","textColor4":"b98733","textColor1":"deb56f","bgColor":"15150c","hasP3":true}},"name":"Stravinsky: Le Sacre du printemps - Ravel: Ma mère l'Oye","artistName":"Pavel Kolesnikov & Samson Tsoy","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The piano-duet version of Stravinsky’s ballet <i>The Rite of Spring</i> was made by the composer himself, and has a focused ferocity which powerfully channels the explosive energy of the more familiar orchestral score. Pianists Pavel Kolesnikov and Samson Tsoy had played the piece together frequently before making this 2025 recording. That is evident in the cutting unanimity of the pair’s motor-rhythms as “Augurs of Spring” launches (Track 2), and in the rumbling momentum generated in the “Dance of the Earth” concluding Part I (Track 8). But there is more to the Tsoy-Kolesnikov partnership than pile-driving ferocity, as the fine-spun textures of Part II’s “Introduction” demonstrates (Track 9). \n\nMore of that delicacy surfaces in the coupling, an exquisitely weighted performance of Ravel’s <i>Ma mère l’Oye</i> (<i>Mother Goose</i>). Here, Tsoy and Kolesnikov exhibit high levels of attunement to one another’s playing, especially in their alluringly poetic account of the suite’s closing movement “Le Jardin féerique” (“The Fairy Garden”).","short":"Power and poetry mingle in a fine exhibition of piano duet playing."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5e/bd/5d/5ebd5de9-2cb2-bf60-d5e7-b6384006a5ee/3149020954201_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cb9446","textColor2":"f1972d","textColor4":"c37a25","textColor1":"fab755","bgColor":"0c0809","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stravinsky-le-sacre-du-printemps-ravel-ma-m%C3%A8re-loye/1807286135","playParams":{"id":"1807286135","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7rtU3qbPCWF6gKZEijyvDi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807286135/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"605494761","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/605494761?l=en-US"},{"id":"1738508742","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1738508742?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1749788029787,"RTCI":0}}},"1807401008":{"id":"1807401008","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807401008?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yaya-bey/1336514926","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ea/73/e3/ea73e34b-bedc-2f1d-1023-ca0f4d589077/Job1ad49db2-0129-4d9f-8a52-6cd9c4edffd7-192583495-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377223318_2162612262-Time1747320803642.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","151515"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"666666"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"393b3a","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"414141","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"666666","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/ab/81/8aab81c3-2bfe-0fab-19a5-977ce10132bf/acb8dd85-743b-43ff-a364-9668ae28a2d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aba6a0","textColor2":"c5bfb7","textColor4":"a39e97","textColor1":"cfcac3","bgColor":"1b1815","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f7/1d/6a/f71d6a24-c9ca-d058-b28c-7b4707232ce7/Job086e88c3-f058-4913-a82d-74118f046682-192583496-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377223317_2162612261-Time1747321941111.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","161616"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"666666"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"3c3d3d","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"434343","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"666666","hasP3":false}},"name":"do it afraid","artistName":"Yaya Bey","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On <i>do it afraid</i>, Yaya Bey expands her scope by inviting a whole roster of diverse and unique collaborators into the fold.

The variety in musical perspectives makes the effort Bey’s most eclectic album yet, a sonic guide to her many influences. \n\nOn “real yearners unite,” Yaya croons over a smooth jazz groove built around fingerpicked nylon string guitars and a shuffling, delicate drum groove. “raisins,” produced by DJ Harrison, is a dusty soul cut, dancing around heavy cymbals, a neo-soul bass melody, and grimy Rhodes vamps.

The lead single of his debut album <i>Fireworks & Rollerblades</i> was a runaway success that brought the 22-year-old to the stage of the 2025 Grammys, where he seamlessly busted a backflip off of a grand piano before launching into the sledgehammer chorus. As for his second flip of the show-stealing performance—that one was unplanned. “My thought process is that there’s not a thought process. It’s more like when I’m up there, I just do whatever feels right,” Boone told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe shortly after the performance. “During the moment, I was like, ‘You know what? I’ve been standing here for a while and I’m just going to do a flip.’ And that’s how it went.”\n\nWith his second album, <i>American Heart</i>, the newcomer known for his electric stage presence and Freddie Mercury-esque falsetto steps out of the shadow of his biggest hit. Its 10 tracks, all written by Boone and frequent collaborator Jack LaFrantz, live in the anthemic sweet spot between Springsteen-style heartland rock and the arena-ready pop-rock of The Killers (particularly on “Young American Heart,” whose “live fast, die young” narrative was inspired by a near-fatal car accident Boone got into in high school). He stays grounded with a pair of songs in honor of his parents: the tear-jerking “Momma Song” plus “Mr Electric Blue,” a prog-pop epic about hero-worshipping his dad (who, mind you, can do backflips well into his fifties). The energy is up compared to his first record: As Boone explained to Lowe, lead single “Sorry I’m Here for Someone Else” began as a sullen piano ballad and became a pulsing synth-pop banger about a run-in with an ex at a diner.\n\nCan lightning strike twice as far as another life-changing, world-conquering hit? Boone’s more interested in settling into himself. “I have such an eager mindset, where I’m always now, now, now: What’s going to happen right now? How are people going to react right now? What can I get right now?” he told Lowe. “In this career, that’s really good at times, but also it can get a little unhealthy, because it takes time—to figure out who you even want to be, and where you want to go, and what your goals are, and what kind of music you like, and who you want to make it with and what you’re trying to give the world.” He’s still evolving, he admits: “The music you hear from me right now probably won’t be the music you hear from me in 10 years. But I think I’ve finally found a version of my music that I really, really, really love.”\n","short":"A newly minted pop star steps out of the shadow of his breakout hit."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/35/5d/cb355d50-f32a-6641-db03-a1d08ad87399/093624834960.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5745d","textColor2":"d29377","textColor4":"aa775f","textColor1":"df9074","bgColor":"0a0401","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-heart/1807490612","playParams":{"id":"1807490612","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3C0QJ1R0T3xX0BUbOZcdCw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807490612/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1587414058","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1587414058?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750433190013,"RTCI":0}}},"1807505594":{"id":"1807505594","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807505594?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Alternative","Indie Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-none/1807505697","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"At Hope / In Civic Pride - Single","artistName":"THE NONE","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/72/b6/cb72b696-197e-c425-2934-46b6ee4f04fb/3663729373731_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3a34","textColor2":"1d1915","textColor4":"46423d","textColor1":"0e0e0a","bgColor":"e9e9dd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/at-hope-in-civic-pride-single/1807505594","playParams":{"id":"1807505594","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807505594/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1807505697","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1807505697?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393673685,"RTCI":0}}},"1807821030":{"id":"1807821030","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807821030?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/leo-jimenez/289431498","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"30 Años Tras el Apocalipsis","artistName":"Leo Jimenez","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bd/aa/ba/bdaabaa9-7b5e-aad0-a5f3-7236dfe52c16/199350333002.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"a8a8a8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/30-a%C3%B1os-tras-el-apocalipsis/1807821030","playParams":{"id":"1807821030","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6aGNiBc6ya8tJp585CGFBe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807821030/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"289431498","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/289431498?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750419064680,"RTCI":0}}},"1808035808":{"id":"1808035808","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808035808?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aitch/280038430","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/07/bd/60/07bd6087-7c32-1413-a041-8ec0f113abdf/6bfb35bc-43a7-4b27-9be0-a33020272fa8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a79892","textColor2":"dca592","textColor4":"b18779","textColor1":"d0bab2","bgColor":"040f13","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/50/fc/ab/50fcab72-a3a4-d49d-4a6b-4955a7667cd7/b5d74c10-da6d-441b-b109-fc8be46a37c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ddae4b","textColor2":"f3b4ac","textColor4":"d89b93","textColor1":"facc52","bgColor":"6a3a31","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d5/2b/d7/d52bd764-6210-877a-f7be-d98f3fa126cf/ed4aa185-e0d5-42d6-aacc-7201c42de1fb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e6afa9","textColor2":"f1a299","textColor4":"e0887e","textColor1":"f8d3cf","bgColor":"9c2112","hasP3":true}},"name":"4","artistName":"Aitch","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Since 2018, I brought life to the game. From the M-Town, Europe, States, even Zante. Cooking up with Sheeran, on stage with Ashanti,” Aitch raps on “STRAIGHT RHYMEZ 2.”\n\nThat’s one of many typically confident bars that Aitch—born Harrison Armstrong—spits on his second album, <i>4</i>. The Mancunian rapper has seen a shift in the landscape since 2022’s <i>Close to Home</i>, and <i>4</i> reflects that. “Music’s changed a lot since album one and I think I tried to find the balance of not trying to look like the sickest rapper in the world, but then over-confusing people,” he tells Apple Music’s Dotty. “I’ve found the middle ground of making a three-and-a-half-minute song into a two-minute song, also getting my point across.”\n\nIt’s an efficiency that extends to the largely sinewy beats that back his verses across the album. Aitch sees <i>4</i> as a move away from more heartfelt, personal tracks of the past like “My G,” his Ed Sheeran-assisted tribute to his little sister. This is the sound of a man who’s given away a lot and is now reaping the rewards and having fun with it.\n\n“I feel like my last album was a little bit more vulnerable, you got a side to me that no one knew. Before, I was that guy that was just rapping about partying all the time and I was sick of being that person. So then I made <i>Close to Home</i> with the thought process of: ‘Let people get to know Harrison, maybe do the “My G” tune.’ This one now is like: ‘Here’s a load of sick rap tunes. See you later,’” he says.\n\nWith such an accomplished album—and linkups with AJ Tracey (“TEST”), Tamera (“LOCKED IN”), and Anne-Marie (“LUV?”)—it’s hard to believe Aitch still has anything left to prove.\n\n“I’ve always believed in my little sauce,” he says. “I wanted to just channel a little bit of that old-school energy and kind of give people a feeling of rap and hip-hop. I’ve never really doubted myself.”","short":"Aitch on his second album: “Here’s a load of sick rap tunes.

This has never been the case for The Cure’s remix albums. Ever since their first—1990’s <i>Mixed Up</i>, which yielded the Balearic classic “Lullaby (Extended Mix)”—the band’s singer and principal songwriter, Robert Smith, has had a close hand in the process, doing many of the mixes himself. The tracks rarely veer into proper club-music territory. Instead, certain motifs are teased out and built upon, and are occasionally augmented with new instruments or lengthened for more languid DJ sets.\n\nThe band’s third remix album generally hews to that ethos. Even a towering name like Paul Oakenfold (who previously remixed “Close to Me” on <i>Mixed Up</i>) treats “I Can Never Say Goodbye” with a light touch, delicately accentuating its majestic vibe, while Orbital gives the downcast “Endsong” just a dab of industrial grit. Daniel Avery seems to even tone down the aggressive guitars and drums of “Drone:Nodrone” for his slightly more propulsive version.\n\nThere is, of course, a lot of variation across these 24 remixes (each of <i>Mixes of a Lost World</i>’s eight tracks gets three), and it comes most notably in the form of more traditional dance remixes. But rather than seeming like a crass attempt to gain favor in other musical spheres, Smith’s list of respected electronic music producers here indicates just how deeply his tastes run. Germans Anja Schneider, Gregor Thresher, and Âme manage to turn Smith’s tunes into restrained and elegant techno and house cuts, while Four Tet gives “Alone\" some of his signature garage-y shuffle.","short":"Oakenfold, Orbital, and more gently reconstruct The Cure’s 14th LP."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/46/02/67/46026726-4304-9347-d596-968a21261961/25UMGIM53812.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a5a7a1","textColor2":"dfa646","textColor4":"b78a3d","textColor1":"c8cac3","bgColor":"1a1c19","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mixes-of-a-lost-world/1808443712","playParams":{"id":"1808443712","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2OlRb9ISy8xZku7ImTV9n8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808443712/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"566519","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/566519?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750375315312,"RTCI":0}}},"1808551476":{"id":"1808551476","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808551476?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/keke-palmer/136765925","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5c/25/91/5c259113-68a2-5deb-7cac-63f876f332d1/190a7110-ead8-4518-9bfe-0ea4238a1c1d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"403135","textColor2":"241617","textColor4":"3c333a","textColor1":"2a1311","bgColor":"9ba6c8","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f7/60/69/f760696b-0955-5224-ee5b-d5e147d581a1/0b6daf0e-98a9-4ee1-9485-6529e830e688.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfc0c5","textColor2":"d1cdd8","textColor4":"c0afb9","textColor1":"e3e3e7","bgColor":"80363b","hasP3":true}},"name":"Just Keke","artistName":"Keke Palmer","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Ask three different people what their favorite Keke Palmer role is and you’re likely to get three different answers. Ask those same fans what their favorite Keke Palmer song is and you’d be lucky to get any answer at all. To be fair to Palmer—and those fans—the headline-making actor, singer, and media personality has put a lot more energy into building her cinematic catalog than her musical one. Which is a shame, because as her third album, <i>Just Keke</i>, verifies, Palmer’s own story is as interesting as the ones she’s brought to the big screen.\n\nWhich isn’t to say the album doesn’t owe a lot to her other passion. It’s rife with nods to Palmer’s love for television, including interludes featuring the music of sitcoms <i>Moesha</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i>, and <i>Living Single</i>. The three are framing devices for Palmer’s adult life which, much like the TV shows, has featured calamitous adventures in career, love, and growing older with grace.\n\nIndeed, Palmer addresses the dissolution of her relationship with her child’s father numerous times across <i>Just Keke</i>. It’s a story tabloid readers were invited into when the father of Palmer’s son took to social media to express his disdain for an objectively tender moment during a 2023 Las Vegas USHER concert when the “Confessions” singer made a show of serenading Palmer. <i>Just Keke</i>’s “My Confession” returns the favor, borrowing both the singer’s cadence and candor. Elsewhere, Palmer is overjoyed if not at complete peace with her life and the direction it’s taken. She’s earned her status as a new media darling—see “Amnesia” for a reference to her infamous “Sorry to this man” quip—and as she points out on “Ripples,” she comes from great stock. The fact is, Palmer was built to strive, and with or without the adulation, being <i>Just Keke</i> is enough.","short":"One of Hollywood’s most beloved comedic heroines tells her own story."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cc/34/37/cc3437c2-a4b7-c410-6ae4-c6448325fd01/039911129678_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"cdbec1","textColor2":"efd334","textColor4":"d6b135","textColor1":"e4e4e2","bgColor":"73283c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/just-keke/1808551476","playParams":{"id":"1808551476","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4qewouaN4cljIXNhTK3SPV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808551476/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"136765925","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/136765925?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750417528273,"RTCI":0}}},"1808671367":{"id":"1808671367","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808671367?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/togethereffect/1715022690","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Mid 20's - EP","artistName":"TogetherEffect","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5c/e1/e4/5ce1e4fc-1a17-515f-125d-5f2d670aa52d/199350072550.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"dedede","textColor4":"b4b4b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0d0d0d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mid-20s-ep/1808671367","playParams":{"id":"1808671367","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808671367/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1715022690","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1715022690?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750418984137,"RTCI":0}}},"1808907915":{"id":"1808907915","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808907915?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":51,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Baroque Era","Chamber Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=648055258-1244738554","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/9c/55/1e9c555c-8e9c-ce7b-67a3-de8dcb9c5442/4ea19450-55d2-44ce-9ee7-68b8a6ec45c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4bfb8","textColor2":"cbbfb6","textColor4":"a79d96","textColor1":"efeae1","bgColor":"171615","hasP3":false}},"name":"Biber: Complete Violin Sonatas — 1681","artistName":"Bojan Čičić & The Illyria Consort","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Bohemian composer Heinrich Biber was also a virtuoso violinist, and pioneered advanced techniques of playing and expression in the generation before Vivaldi. The eight violin sonatas Biber published in 1681 are typical of his fierily inventive but also ravishingly beautiful music. Here, they receive outstanding advocacy by the Croatian violinist Bojan Čičić—the grace and elegance of his artistry is evident in the charming “Variationes” movement of Sonata No. 1, while the “Aria – Presto” movement of Sonata No. 7 highlights his fleet-fingered dexterity. \n\nAltering the violin’s conventional tuning (a technique known as “scordatura”) is a trick Biber uses frequently, resulting in novel colorations. Yet staying perfectly in tune, even when playing several strings at once, is a strong feature of Čičić’s seemingly effortless performances. The small group of accompanying instruments—theorbo, harp, harpsichord, and organ—proves ideally collegial, warming the harmonies and varying the textures in these richly appealing sonatas.","short":"The Baroque violinist brings fire and elegance to Biber’s ravishing sonatas."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/34/47/2c/34472c7b-4ee4-57f4-850e-22e37037284d/199350294846.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"36332c","textColor2":"24221b","textColor4":"4d483e","textColor1":"070704","bgColor":"f0e4cc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/biber-complete-violin-sonatas-1681/1808907915","playParams":{"id":"1808907915","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808907915/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"648055258","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/648055258?l=en-US"},{"id":"1244738554","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1244738554?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393769095,"RTCI":0}}},"1809000175":{"id":"1809000175","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809000175?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yungblud/213048599","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/df/9e/c8/df9ec80c-017c-855f-d839-fe2f6ae1495d/8986b8e8-e227-4f93-99df-d0b97f3dd7c9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202020","textColor2":"100f0f","textColor4":"282827","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"878987","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1d/7a/c2/1d7ac267-63cb-758e-cd9c-770af4e04514/7dcb0612-bc1b-42ed-bec9-e08a99382c45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2a2a2a","textColor2":"1d1d1d","textColor4":"3e3e3e","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"c0c0c0","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a2/6d/50/a26d50f1-3f06-d088-d1f2-c726121a6169/4ca443e2-1b4e-494b-982a-ced8eaf67379.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7b7b7","textColor2":"c9c9c9","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"e1e1e1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"Idols","artistName":"YUNGBLUD","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Would this be the album you would expect me to make next?” Dominic Harrison, better known as perky pop punk YUNGBLUD, asks Apple Music. “Fuck no.” \n\n<i>Idols</i> is an ambitious, swaggering affair, from the nine-minute-long opener “Hello Heaven, Hello” to the heart-on-a-ripped-open-sleeve opus “Supermoon.” YUNGBLUD actually started making <i>Idols</i>, his fourth studio album, after his second, 2020’s <i>weird!</i>, but the timing wasn’t right.

But I really want to show that I could orchestrate and I have imagination to use horns, brass, strings, and classical elements.”\n\n<i>Idols</i> swings from big, bold stadium rock to Britpop and melancholy (with guitar solos aplenty), so he’s not expecting listeners to find instant gratification. “I want this to be an album you put on every week for the rest of your life, because that’s what I do with Fleetwood Mac’s <i>Rumours</i> or Pink Floyd’s <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>. I don’t just rinse a song that’s popping on TikTok for a month and then become bored of it.” Read on as he takes you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Hello Heaven, Hello”</b>\n“‘Hello Heaven, Hello’ is the overture to <i>Idols</i>. This was the last song that came. Originally, the album started with ‘Idols Pt. 1’ and it wasn’t good enough yet. It was a nine out of 10 and I was like, ‘We need a spectacle. We need a prelude.’ It’s the bridge between the past and now: It’s how we arrive at people understanding why I made this album. I start frail and afraid. It’s like, ‘Hello. Are you out there? Do you know me? Do you love me? Do you hate me?’ Every time I’m on stage, I see the negative people who don’t like me, right in front of me.”\n\n<b>“Idols Pt. 1”</b>\n“This song is about me being a kid and having ambition and dreams. We used to play as kings, queens, rock stars, and nurses, but then we rationalize everything and let our light go out. The whole concept of the album is it’s not an homage to my idols, it’s actually me turning away from them. We recorded the album in a haunted old Tetley’s brewery in Leeds [about 35 miles from YUNGBLUD’s birthplace, Doncaster]. I had no issues with the ghosts, I made friends with them. There’s actually one moment in this song where it goes [mimics woo-like ghost sound], and that’s unexplainable.”\n\n<b>“Lovesick Lullaby”</b>\n“I always wanted to do Britpop in eyeliner—I was obsessed with Trent Reznor [Nine Inch Nails] and Brian Molko [Placebo], then The Stone Roses and Oasis. Here, I set up the listener going like, ‘This song’s a party.’ Before you know it, that pint of lager that you’re holding as you bop your head is up in the air and you’re jumping up and down. The biggest thing I’ve learned with writing is that I’ve always told the listener what the song’s about, so I wanted to make this more ambiguous. And I wanted to set up the idea that this album is going to twist and turn through multiple genres because that’s who I am.”\n\n<b>“Zombie”</b>\n“I’ve had this song for five years. This was the album that I wanted to do, but I don’t think I was ready for it. ‘Zombie’ is about being afraid to turn to others for help. The fear of being a burden. The fear of appearing weak or ugly. For the video, I wanted to do a direct portrayal of what a nurse goes through, because we take them for granted—they’re so understaffed and underfunded, and the NHS [National Health Service] is a bedrock for why our country is great. I needed to find a great British artist who could carry that story with truth and authenticity. That was Florence Pugh. I think she’s our best export at the minute.”\n\n<b>“The Greatest Parade”</b>\n“This was one of the emotionally hardest songs to write, along with ‘Change,’ so that’s why they’re both in the middle. I would see people outgrow YUNGBLUD or be mean on the internet, but I felt stagnated in my growth because I never had time to make an album like this. I never had time to stop. You write with songwriters, what happens is seven different people a week have an opinion of what you should do next. Everything’s great because they want a cut. Mediocre art can fly because you made it. Fuck that.”\n\n<b>“Change”</b>\n“The reason why I put this in the middle is because if I didn’t call the album <i>Idols</i>, I would have called it ‘Change.’ This has been the biggest transition point of my life and this song was the fundamental moment that I really faced myself and realized that I was not right. I think, being a ‘famous’ rock star, when you go into a recording session, people hang on your every word. But when Mati (Schwartz, longtime collaborator) and I are writing together, he’ll say, ‘No, you can do better than that.’ This was written before ‘Hello Heaven, Hello.’ It was midnight, and he’s like, ‘You’ve not let me see you yet.’ It’s about the words that I let get to me.”\n\n<b>“Monday Murder”</b>\n“‘Monday Murder’ is about apathy. It’s about everything going on in the world and the lack of unity and coexistence. We’d rather judge than accept and we’d rather fight than live in peace. It’s about how we watch the world go by instead of looking at each other and celebrating our differences. We wake up and we compare ourselves to 15 different people before we even have our breakfast. I love having a fucking dinner party debate. That doesn’t mean I love you less as a person if your political agenda or views are different to mine. You’re going to teach me something, I’m going to teach you something.”\n\n<b>“Ghosts”</b>\n“This is probably my favorite song to sing on the album because I can’t believe it’s mine. It’s the hardest vocal in the world, but I really wanted to show off my vocals on this album. Lewis Capaldi said to me, ‘Stop fucking rapping. Fucking sing on this album.’ Again, this one just poured out of me. I’m standing at the edge of my mountain with war drums ready to charge. It’s about realizing your own mortality on the banks of the River Thames after a night out at six in the morning. It felt like a stadium-rock song, but I wanted to push the boundaries of imagination, so I was like, ‘Do you remember <i>The King and I</i>?’ Then I added the three-minute outro.”\n\n<b>“Fire”</b>\n“‘Fire’ is about sex and aggression and that feeling you get when you’re about to be punched in the face or about to be taken into a bedroom. I was really wanting to explore my sexual side—I think that’s why my whole album campaign’s been topless. At 27, I feel comfortable as a man now and I really wanted to feel that sense of adrenaline with this record. It’s about sex and fighting and animalistic humanity: the fundamentals of why we feel anything at all. Why do we love, why do we hate, why do we fight, why do we fuck?”\n\n<b>“War”</b>\n“This is about people trying to dim my light. I’ve always been too ‘this’ or too ‘that,’ or people wish I would have stayed in one place. I’m so emotional, I’m so raw, and I’m so gushy. I wish I could be something else, but I just can’t. It’s been this dichotomy within me to be what the world wants me to be. This is also about that feeling when you become forgotten by somebody. You meant so much to me, but you forgot me so quickly. It’s hard to deal with.”\n\n<b>“Idols Pt. II”</b>\n“This is a little reminder of what the album’s about. It’s where the protagonist—you, me—this is where we start to win. After everything, after all the war, after all the internal struggle, after all the change, after all the rejection, after all the pain, we realize that only you will know what it’s like to be alone in your own life. It solidifies the message of the album: you have to be the idol in your own life. Stop giving other people the credit. Which leads into ‘Supermoon.’”\n\n<b>“Supermoon”</b>\n“This is the first song I’ve put out that I didn’t write. Mati wrote this for me, and he kept it a secret for five years. He’s been there since the beginning: He saw a 15-year-old kid come into his studio, who he kicked out because he had nothing to say. I came back a year later as YUNGBLUD. It was never a fucking character. I was a 19-year-old in pink socks from the north of England, pissed off about Brexit. That’s how that monster was born. He saw the world love me and then tear me down. When he played me this, I thought, ‘I don’t believe a human being on this planet has understood me more than that man.’”","short":"“It’s five-dimensional”: YUNGBLUD on his “limitless,” genre-busting opus."},"artwork":{"width":3780,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a3/3e/db/a33edb69-e698-02d9-e953-b9165a64f4c5/25UMGIM43189.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3780,"textColor3":"383838","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"4a4a4a","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"f9f9f9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/idols/1809000175","playParams":{"id":"1809000175","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/19PD2IPfceDn9fLAa05TFE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809000175/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"213048599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/213048599?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750430116980,"RTCI":0}}},"1809021018":{"id":"1809021018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809021018?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Traditional Country","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dillon-carmichael/683342951","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Keepin' Country Alive","artistName":"Dillon Carmichael","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/c4/13/cbc41338-595c-25b9-633e-1bf297f4829b/199350297069.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccc8c4","textColor2":"fabfbe","textColor4":"cfa09e","textColor1":"f6f1ee","bgColor":"23231b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/keepin-country-alive/1809021018","playParams":{"id":"1809021018","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5HSjmqFMFffzXxgSL69unj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809021018/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"683342951","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/683342951?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393614126,"RTCI":0}}},"1809849957":{"id":"1809849957","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809849957?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/haim/164483115","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/08/b7/6f/08b76fc4-277c-5403-aaa7-57ac6c9c0439/300e284e-e8f5-402b-9560-9dcaf68ccf4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c3936","textColor2":"403028","textColor4":"635650","textColor1":"0f0c07","bgColor":"f0eff3","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/4b/51/234b5112-ec7f-4a41-569b-06c44c9ccb26/bb7518de-5e35-4184-a428-02217663da84.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"6698a9","textColor2":"64c0d2","textColor4":"5099a8","textColor1":"7fbed3","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true}},"name":"I quit","artistName":"HAIM","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Even though HAIM named their fourth studio album—and first since 2020’s <i>Women in Music, Pt. III</i>—<i>I quit</i>, the trio of sisters aren’t quitters. “Quitting can be looked at as giving up in normal circumstances,” bassist/vocalist Este Haim tells Apple Music. “We look at it as a new beginning and betting on yourself. We quit things that don’t serve us anymore.” \n\nThe follow-up to their Grammy-nominated opus takes its name from a scene in 1996’s <i>That Thing You Do!</i> where the band’s leader announces his departure by snapping his fingers and sing-talking the words “I quit”—a move the women use regularly as an inside joke. “One day, we were checking the mic and we did it again,” Este adds. “We were like, ‘Wait, should we name our album <i>I quit</i>? Say that again.’ ‘Wait a minute. Should we?’ It took on a life of its own.”\n\nProduced by Rostam and lead vocalist/guitarist Danielle Haim, the band’s latest takes parting shots at the people in their lives who have seemingly done them wrong. (And with single artwork inspired by paparazzi pics—most famously for “Relationships,” a cheeky take on the iconic post-divorce Nicole Kidman photo—the Haims aren’t just speaking to their romantic follies but the celebrity and industry machine at large.) Appropriately, the opening track “Gone” samples the George Michael smash “Freedom! ’90,” setting the tone for the album’s message: liberation from anything and everything that may have restrained them. “I’ll do whatever I want/I’ll see who I wanna see/I’ll fuck off whenever I want/I’ll be whatever I need,” Danielle intones. \n\nTheir songs range from groovy (“Down to be wrong”) to nostalgic (“Take me back”), dreamy (“Lucky stars”), and bluesy (“Blood on the street”). “All over me” feels straight out of a ’90s rom-com montage, and “The farm” gives off a Sheryl Crow-infused vibe. The contemplative “Everybody’s trying to figure me out”—co-written by Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon—also offers a meditation on self-acceptance: “Everybody’s got their own decisions, and I know that I’ve got mine/And I’ll be fine.” \n\nUltimately, though, the sibling rockers see their new work as fit for the stage, and that’s important to how they create their music, Este explains: “We always think about our live show when we are writing songs, because that’s really where our heart is—playing live.” \n","short":"Este, Danielle, and Alana get free on their first album since 2020."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d4/7c/61/d47c61de-0211-3820-4613-801f540456d9/196873071695.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"cdd1d2","textColor2":"55b2d3","textColor4":"4593b0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"061921","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-quit/1809849957","playParams":{"id":"1809849957","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6bpglEwFypc0rfzYDyhf6i"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809849957/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"164483115","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/164483115?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750430115175,"RTCI":0}}},"1810048535":{"id":"1810048535","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810048535?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-civil-wars/338978323","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The One That Got Away (The Best of the Civil Wars)","artistName":"The Civil Wars","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b1/e9/67/b1e967cc-e172-8b7c-f85b-be092f3838d2/859704864728_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"3b3b3b","textColor2":"242424","textColor4":"4a4a4a","textColor1":"121212","bgColor":"dfdfdf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-one-that-got-away-the-best-of-the-civil-wars/1810048535","playParams":{"id":"1810048535","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/50kwKWds653RtQ0U3ePBqB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810048535/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"338978323","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/338978323?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750393411874,"RTCI":0}}},"1811159730":{"id":"1811159730","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811159730?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/etienne-machine/1451006466","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Every Little Dream -

He hasn’t restricted himself to Afropop, fùjí, rap, or R&B; he has been an Afropop innovator, with a voice which he variously modulates across genres, a knack for indelible hooks that reflects his fùjí music heritage, and a non-hierarchical collaborative spirit. \n\nNow, with his 11th album, 2025’s self-titled <i>Olamidé</i>—which means “wealth” in Yoruba—the artist turns inward without being indulgent, the focus never straying from the songmaking even when the source of some songs is personal and private. “I name things how I feel them,” he tells Apple Music. “I wanted to create more mellow sounds for listeners who prefer laid‐back tracks over heavy drums. Knowing there’s fans who love that keeps me motivated to perfect each record.” \n\nWith the clear direction in mind, Olamide sat with a coterie of trusted producers to more closely align his feelings and intentions with the final output, though happenstance played a part: “On 99 percent of the songs, I sat in the studio with my producers, explained my ideas and the fan reaction I wanted, then we built the sound. Three tracks, ‘Billionaires Club,’ ‘Duro,’ and ‘Luvaluvah,’ came from P.Priime without any conversation—he just delivered smart beats,” asserts Olamide.\n\nHis goal for the listening experience was clear: “From the jump, the idea was to make a body of work that aligns with my craftsmanship and sonically breaks the norms. I wanted the album to feel like entering a jazz bar; an immersive experience where everything tightens up together, not a rollercoaster of random highs and lows.” The result is a suite of songs which avoid maudlin introspection and showy rapping, as though he has no more points to prove, striking a balance between confident songcraft and a lifelong habit for listening and experimentation. “Growing up, I absorbed everything. I eat, breathe, and sleep music,” he recalls. “[Most] of the time I’m online, discovering new sounds and genres. I rarely relisten to my own tracks, except during mixing and mastering. Life is a teacher, and as long as you stay open‑minded, you realize there’s always more to learn.” Below, Olamide talks through key songs on the album. \n\n<b>“Prelude” (feat. Fxrtune)</b>\n“So Fxrtune is someone you all have to watch out for. He’s going to be the next big thing. By the way, that’s my brother.”\n\n<b>“Hasibunallah”</b>\n“At the end of the day Arabic is just a language, you know? I grew up in a Muslim family, and Muslims obviously speak Arabic, but I’ve met a couple of Christian friends also who are from the Middle East, that speak Arabic as well. So it’s just a language. ‘Hasibunallah’ is strictly talking about the journey so far, and how much God has been there for me, and holding me down and helping me actualize my dreams and everything. And I clear whoever is in doubt or whoever cares to know that I’m still with my God, and I’m still not bothered by nothing, and I’m still always going to remain successful no matter what.”\n\n<b>“Kai!” (with Wizkid)</b>\n“Why do I rate Wiz? To be honest, I think it’s his approach to everything—from his vocals to his writing to his approach to life and everything. He’s just an all-rounder. He’s got his stuff together, everything on point. And it’s very rare to come across people like that, that’s 1000 percent certain about what they want in life and how they want to be perceived and how they want to roll, how they want to deliver their stuff, how they want people to feel when they hear their stuff and all that. That’s very rare.”\n\n<b>“Luvaluvah”</b>\n“We had some pushback from clearing a Lauryn Hill sample, but that was not an issue, because I totally understand it. So we came up with something else entirely to replace that [a sample of Hill’s 1998 track, ‘Can’t Take My Eyes off of You (I Love You Baby)’] and it’s sounding very good. I’ve been a big fan since forever and her music’s had so much impact in my life. Every time I listen to Lauryn’s music, it feels like a slice of heaven to me. And whenever I’m down or want solace and I need something to just keep me going, I listen to Lauryn. So I am just so much of a fan and I didn’t even know when I ended up sampling her, because I’ve always been so into Lauryn Hill, so into her music.”\n\n<b>“Billionaires Club” (feat. Wizkid, Darkoo)</b>\n“Myself and Wiz, we agreed from the jump that we should try to get a third person on the record. And I reached out to a couple of people, but Darkoo came through with that verse. I’ve listened to her over and over, and I’ve realized that she’s got some finesse. It’s one thing to love making music, then it’s another thing to have a finesse to it. Darkoo’s got some finesse to it. She can easily write on anything.”\n\n<b>“Duro”</b>\n“An inspiration for this song was fùjí music which often feels like a musical diary: no single hook, just hooks everywhere. Each four‐line section could be someone else’s chorus. It’s simple, relatable, and even if you don’t understand every word, you feel the vibe.”\n\n<b>“Indika” (feat. Dr. Dre, SPINALL)</b>\n“For me, making a song with Dr. Dre goes way beyond a stamp. This whole Afrobeats-to-the-world thing, if you’d asked us 15 or 20 years ago, none of us thought it’d be like this. Growing up watching mandem on MTV Base, then making music with them is madness. I never thought a day like this would come. It’s too crazy to put everything together now. Absurd. I have SPINALL to thank for the introduction.”\n\n<b>“1 Shot”</b>\n“I was a musician before I was a rapper, but rap gave me my platform. I respect rap and believe finesse is key.”\n\n<b>“99” (feat. Daecolm) (with Seyi Vibez, Asake, Young Jonn)</b>\n“While recording the album, Young Jonn came by my camp and played me a record. He wasn’t feeling it yet, so I asked if I could take it. I added my verse, then recruited Asake, Seyi Vibez, and Daecolm, keeping everyone in the loop so it never felt competitive. Asake sent his verse the next day; Seyi Vibez sent his after I explained the direction; Daecolm recorded immediately. Given Daecolm’s house music credentials, he was perfect for the vibe. The phrase ‘party like ’99’ is just a nostalgic vibe. None of us were really partying like that then, but it’s a feeling everyone connects with.”\n\n<b>“Ruba”</b>\n“If people think it’s a love song, it is and that was the intention. I don’t shy away from making love songs. I’m only human. I wanted to create something lovable that resonates with female fans and shows my vulnerable side: that I can fall in love and go the extra mile. It comes from practice and experience.”\n\n<b>“Rain” (feat. Popcaan)</b>\n“Growing up, rain was something my friends and I adored. We’d dance and play under it, and it felt beautiful. That changed when I visited a friend whose house would flood whenever it rained. Their roof leaked and their bed floated. I didn’t realize rain’s darker side until then. Now it’s bittersweet: It can calm you, ease your pain, but it can also bring hardship to others. That duality inspired the theme of ‘Rain.’ I featured Popcaan to lean into the track’s reggae-tinged sonics. The record itself was also inspired by a Bob Marley and Lauryn Hill collaboration I heard years ago [1999’s ‘Turn Your Lights Down Low’]. Its mood and message shaped my own vision for this song.”\n\n<b>“Paris” (feat. Fadi)</b>\n“I flew to Paris for fittings and meetings, then Ibiza to turn up, and Miami too. That mix of locations is like fùjí music’s diary style, touching on different experiences. ‘Paris’ captures a week of fittings, meetings, and parties; just me sharing my journey.”\n\n<b>“Lalakipo”</b>\n“‘Lalakipo’ is Yoruba slang. If your ex isn’t active or solid, he’s a ‘lalakipo.’ I wanted an unexpected hook, not the usual bounce. The beat sounded like a banger, so I crafted something unusual to match.”\n\n<b>“Stronger” (feat. Boj)</b>\n“‘Stronger’ celebrates independent women chasing dreams and living their best lives. It’s my way of saying, ‘Go girl, do your thing.’”","short":"The innovator returns: “The idea was to sonically break the norms.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ba/6d/fb/ba6dfb0f-3eb5-d02a-79f6-6a4483231e13/199316074352_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5b794","textColor2":"d9c9a1","textColor4":"bcae8f","textColor1":"e5d3a7","bgColor":"464646","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/olamid%C3%A9/1811179601","playParams":{"id":"1811179601","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4jUXymdfBvDcDQQV0gdure"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811179601/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"389401008","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/389401008?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750437185902,"RTCI":0}}},"1811404948":{"id":"1811404948","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811404948?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/leikeli47/793737490","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/39/32/6b/39326ba0-1dc0-10e8-1247-8a065ba75072/Job943cb495-e13b-4182-8e6e-98e69c03b84b-192886582-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377849838_2169327777-Time1747729629944.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","0ab0ef"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e1332"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b5cfd5","textColor2":"0ab0ef","textColor4":"0a92cb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e1332","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e1/46/a9/e146a9ec-0f60-ad32-cbc8-ae6a038dd5c8/Jobc3b49063-98fa-4ff2-852a-0627dc37a5bf-192886583-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377849837_2169327778-Time1747730607589.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"303a3f","textColor2":"083152","textColor4":"315872","textColor1":"080b13","bgColor":"d4f6f1","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e6/1c/85/e61c85f6-b2f3-d9ab-fc86-87881789efae/ec3bdb84-648f-4350-af65-2a5b63c5aa4f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bfd5db","textColor2":"b9d4e4","textColor4":"9fbad2","textColor1":"e1f5ee","bgColor":"38568d","hasP3":true}},"name":"Lei Keli ft. 47 / For Promotional Use Only","artistName":"Leikeli47","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When she broke through in 2017 with her studio debut, <i>Wash & Set</i>, the New York rapper obscured her face behind a ski mask in videos and onstage, as she’d continue to do over the rest of her <i>Beauty Series</i> album trilogy (2018’s <i>Acrylic</i> and 2022’s <i>Shape Up</i>).

yourself be free,” says artist and DJ Rebecca Black about her Pride DJ mix. “To me, there are so many different facets of music that make up what it means to be queer.” The artist, who first found viral fame in the early 2010s, has since re-emerged as a songwriter and DJ who attributes so much of her own evolution to those who came before. “My learning as a DJ was explicitly led by queer

Rick","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Who knows if hip-hop would’ve ever made it this far without Slick Rick? A style icon, rhyme maestro, and gifted storyteller, the London-born rapper/producer set the tone in the mid-’80s as Ricky D alongside Doug E. Fresh in The Get Fresh Crew. By the end of that decade, he’d transcended those auspicious beginnings with the full-length solo debut under his now best-known moniker, <i>The Great Adventures of Slick Rick</i>. In the more than three and a half decades since that album, a lot changed in the genre as well as in his personal and professional lives. Yet over all those years, even as his output slowed or stalled, respect for The Ruler never waned. \n\nFor <i>VICTORY</i>, his first album since 1999’s <i>The Art of Storytelling</i>, a 60-year-old Rick doesn’t even try to play in the contentious spaces currently occupied by viral drill and trap stars. Instead, he’s back for the love of the rap game, choosing playful production to match his seasoned flow. \n\nLest anyone need an introduction, “I Did That” runs through his résumé with ease before dipping into clubland for “Come On Let’s Go.” The unmistakeable spark of his narrative rap greatness flicks on once again for “Landlord,” a witty if scathing barrage of rent-due anecdotes timed for the first of the month, and “So You’re Having My Baby,” a jazzy chronicle that packs plenty in scarce little time. Even his guest selection, while highly limited, speaks to his own exquisite tastes rather than the marketplace, with Giggs popping in for “Stress” and Nas putting his stamp on “Documents.”","short":"After 26 years, The Ruler’s back and having the time of his

have always been more than just nightlife,” says Brazilian-born, Paris-based artist Slim Soledad. “They’re places of collective healing, protection, and resistance. Creating a sense of safety becomes instinctive because we don’t often find that in the outside world. These spaces, built by us and for us, are where we can breathe, exist fully, and remember we’re not alone.” Soledad’s Pride mix reflects her consideration of nightclubs as “temporary homes where chosen family forms, where bodies speak in rhythm and care,” she says. “In the queer world, we know we don’t get anywhere alone. Everything is built in collaboration, in mutual care. It’s not just a party, it’s a pulse that keeps us going.”","short":"Honoring queer nightclubs: “temporary homes where chosen family forms.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/86/ea/5e/86ea5ef1-1ddf-5b41-699a-ab82b979712a/74a955b9-d701-4ca6-9146-6c05eb2d3ad5.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"45253a","textColor2":"22201f","textColor4":"4d2f42","textColor1":"191415","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1815557208","playParams":{"id":"1815557208","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815557208/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666937057","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666937057?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1749843692385,"RTCI":0}}},"1815616265":{"id":"1815616265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815616265?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/half-queen/1599336502","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/22/f0/6e/22f06e3f-66a1-a569-c123-9cb80954461d/c4b6e911-71ae-4b90-80a6-0e43ade2c666.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"46353f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"52404b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2b5df","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9d/94/be/9d94be48-bc9a-b99d-7cbd-a44391226c01/d30afd1a-f052-4ebf-b15e-cedea8abf1c3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4e3b46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7c/39/a6/7c39a651-7356-f8f3-196f-b6bb96a87ae5/a8754fa2-5924-478e-9b16-32691e71bcfe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"54414c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/82/e5/38/82e538db-a5fb-a0fc-a1be-90f65d91c732/60be2a40-9910-4155-88dd-bad8ead69a23.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"493842","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"513c49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffbfeb","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/36/cb/85/36cb85a2-ff1c-fc5b-107a-11ad3d18e5bc/33e87244-4859-44f5-8b7d-709c5b2895ad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"4b3542","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f8/c2/9f/f8c29f25-50b2-4fbd-8967-ec2c4e60b86b/f0c5ff69-0d29-43ed-a480-de2e5cd9d519.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4e3b46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Half Queen","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“This mix is in honor of every queer space I’ve had the pleasure of playing in,” Half Queen tells Apple Music. “For all the Black, brown, Indigenous sweeties I’ve shared a dance floor with.

Stray Kids released <i>Hollow</i> in the middle of their global dominATE tour, eight years into their career. The context is vital for a self-produced album that gets emotional but never strays far from Stray Kids’ signature high-energy bravado or the buoyant urgency of the J-rock sensibility from which it occasionally borrows.\n\nTitle track “Hollow” is the most explicit in the album’s exploration of a deep loneliness, not easily shaken. “I embrace everything and run, but why do I feel hollow?/Loneliness haunts me no matter where I am, I’m alone,” Han sings in the chorus, shining some light on the realities of life as a hard-working K-pop idol. In the rat-tat-tat of “Parade,” Stray Kids keep marching, for themselves and their growing fandom, in spite of any criticism (“Who’s still whispering?/I don’t care, I’m walking even bigger and more confidently”). \n\nThe theme of persevering against hardship is made more tangible on the energetic fan song “Never Alone” (“Lightning is not scary/If we hold hands, we STAY, together, forever”). “just a little” slows things down in its request for one last moment with a lover, while “宿命” (“Fate”) finds electric-guitar-driven deliverance in the form of Stray Kids’ relationship with fandom STAY: “Even if I’m alone/I’m always by your side.”\n\nNotably, <i>Hollow</i> marks the first time all tracks on a Japanese Stray Kids release are original Japanese releases, rather than songs translated from a previous Korean- or English-language version into Japanese. As is common, Stray Kids’ production team, 3RACHA (composed of members Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han), participated in the production of every track on <i>Hollow</i>.\n","short":"Five songs unpacking

You form bonds in those spaces that go beyond friendship—they become your chosen family,” says the pop culture figure, performance artist, and DJ. \n\nThose spaces—and the people she met there—are reflected and honored in her Pride DJ mix. “[They] gave me the freedom to express myself fully, and it connected me with some of the most incredible, creative, and resilient people I know,” she says, explaining that her mix is a “celebration not just of the music, but of the community behind it.” Diving in a little further, Lepore shares that her mix is about “joy, resilience, glamour, the beauty of being seen—and most of all, pride.

HOUR : Part.3 - EP","artistName":"ATEEZ","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Following the release of their 2024 EP <i>GOLDEN HOUR : Part.2</i>, ATEEZ returns with the third installment in the series. From the fresh sounds of opening number “Lemon Drop” to the distinct vocal colors from all eight members on “Masterpiece” to the comforting lyrics of “Now this house ain’t a home” and “Castle,” the album is a showcase of ATEEZ’s signature charisma, brightness, and emotional depth. To mark the release, the members share their thoughts on each track with Apple Music.\n\n<b>“Lemon Drop”</b>\nSEONGHWA: “I think it might feel like the boys who sang ‘Wave’ six years ago have all grown up and returned to that same season. It’s ATEEZ’s first summer track in a while.”\nMINGI: “You’ll probably notice the refreshing sweetness of a lemon drop cocktail in this track, but I think you’ll also feel a summer that’s more than just blue. It’s ATEEZ exploring R&B and hip-hop in a fresh new way, so I hope you enjoy it with a cool breeze.”\n\n<b>“Masterpiece”</b>\nWOOYOUNG: “ATEEZ is the product of eight unique individuals coming together, and we’re on this incredible journey as one. That’s what this song represents. As you listen closely to our distinct vocal tones, you’ll notice how each distinct color blends into a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.”\n\n<b>“Now this house ain’t a home”</b>\nHONGJOONG: “This song reflects the emotional distance that exists between a house and a home. When you’re chasing your goals, there can be moments when your reality suddenly feels very strange. This song holds a message of encouragement to keep running until you find a place that truly feels like home.”\nYUNHO: “It’s a song that can offer comfort during those lonely times we all go through. Its charm lies in the hopeful yet bittersweet melody and vivid, relatable lyrics like ‘the TV we sat around on Sunday nights.’”\n\n<b>“Castle”</b>\nJONGHO: “This track offers a different kind of comfort from ‘Now this house ain’t a home.’ It’s about finding a space where we feel safe—to take a breath and give ourselves time to heal.”\nYEOSANG: “Just as there are no absolutes in life, there’s no such thing as pain we’re destined to endure forever. Through this song, we wanted to tell our fans, and ourselves, that it’s okay to not always push through. The beautiful lyrics express that message, which makes the song very special to me.”\n\n<b>“Bridge : The Edge of Reality”</b>\nSAN: “If you listen to the album in order, I think you’ll be surprised by how dramatically the mood shifts at this point. As you focus on the atmosphere and structure of the song, you might discover something completely unexpected and fun.”\n","short":"The members of the K-pop group detail the songs on this five-track EP."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6d/d2/68/6dd26826-582e-8f68-392d-3c8c4cd1ea23/196873155647.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"433418","textColor2":"161611","textColor4":"433416","textColor1":"161513","bgColor":"f8ae29","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/golden-hour-part-3-ep/1816843869","playParams":{"id":"1816843869","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816843869/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1439301205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1439301205?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750407282060,"RTCI":0}}},"1816946628":{"id":"1816946628","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816946628?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":30,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative","Indie Rock"],"releaseDate":"1994-01-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/done-lying-down/953137610","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Done Lying Down","artistName":"Done Lying Down","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/d0/ca/05d0ca8b-8182-98ca-66bb-90cdb50531b6/885890732435.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"35352f","textColor2":"16150c","textColor4":"3e3c34","textColor1":"0c0c06","bgColor":"dbd9d3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/done-lying-down/1816946628","playParams":{"id":"1816946628","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816946628/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"953137610","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/953137610?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750420253653,"RTCI":0}}},"1817009690":{"id":"1817009690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817009690?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wisin/49252346","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/df/ba/12/dfba122b-97c3-ec5a-ffaa-96653a769042/ea034187-1c33-493d-a932-86ca859bdbce.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7b19d","textColor2":"f4d4b6","textColor4":"c9b099","textColor1":"f2d6bb","bgColor":"1b2126","hasP3":true}},"name":"EL SOBREVIVIENTE WWW","artistName":"Wisin","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Given his decades in the game, Wisin might technically qualify for elder-statesman status among reggaetoneros, yet he continues to be one of the more reliable reps for his generation and beyond. As should be expected, his latest album <i>EL SOBREVIVIENTE WWW</i> includes the polished reggaetón that characterizes some of his biggest hits, with cuts like “Laguna” and “De Antes” closely resembling fan favorites. Yet his tenure in the genre means his range includes room for homage, executed faithfully on “Duro Pal Piso” and especially “Quiere Perreo” with fellow genre vet Sir Speedy. \n\nHis collaborative powers remain strong as well, building with Zion on “Carita” and flexing with Jory Boy and Brray on the throwback-laden “Dale Baby.” Naturally, he’s inclined to experiment with other styles as well, something his guests are all too happy to assist with. Beéle brings tropical fusion to their breezy “¿Qué Pasó Bebe?,” while an energized Farruko lets his dancehall reggae flag fly on “Sí o No.” Proudly on the Latin Afrobeats wave, Wisin links with Kapo for the lustrous “Luna.”\n","short":"The esteemed reggaetón veteran does what he does

- EP","artistName":"ILLIT","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Naming their third mini album <i>bomb</i> was clearly a statement of intent for a nascent girl group like ILLIT. The South Korean-based multinational act embellishes their signature beat-driven-yet-dreamy sound on five tracks that incorporate a modern vintage feeling (“little monster”) and playful moods (the boisterous “oops!”). In particular, the lead single “Billyeoon Goyangi (Do the Dance)” compares the thrill and trepidation of a first date to the shyness of a “borrowed cat” over chic French house beats. Exclusively for Apple Music, the group’s five members take us through the record, track by track.\n\n<b>“little monster”</b>\nYunah: “‘little monster’ is built around a vintage-inspired, simple sound and an addictive hook. The lyrical feel of the vocals really adds to the vibe of the track. In the lyrics, the ‘monsters’ represent all the negative emotions, like sorrow or gloom, that bother us. The point here is cheerfully saying that we’re going to gobble up all those monsters!”\n\n<b>“Billyeoon Goyangi (Do the Dance)”</b>\nMinju: “‘Do the Dance’ features strong lyrics, colorful melodies and hooks, and cat-themed choreography. The Korean title comes from the expression ‘like a borrowed cat’ to describe how you go blank after making a blunder on a first date with someone you’re really into. This track will feel even more special when you feel like diving into a magical atmosphere.”\n\n<b>“jellyous”</b>\nMoka: “‘jellyous’ expresses the sense of uncertainty, that tension mixed with anticipation, when you schedule a meet-up with someone you’re into and you’re wondering whether or not that counts as an actual date. The title comes from how people use ‘jelly’ as a cute way of saying ‘jealous,’ so being ‘full of jealousy’ becomes ‘full of jelly’! This track has a brisk, catchy beat that really stands out.”\n\n<b>“oops!”</b>\nWonhee: “‘oops!’ is a track in an exciting pop-punk style, and it’s about getting together with your besties to share juicy gossip. The song’s about ordinary girls who are just as likely to get up to silly nonsense as they are to share deep, heartfelt thoughts. Think of hanging out with your friends when listening to this one.”\n\n<b>“bamsopoong”</b>\nIroha: “‘bamsopoong’ conveys a gentle, dreamy feel, like you’re sharing a special moment at a private spot under the starlight. It’s about when worries keep you awake at night, you reach out to a soulmate and go on a picnic together. Think of a mellow picnic scene when listening to this.”","short":"The girl group sets it off with charming melodies and irresistible beats."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e4/bc/4d/e4bc4da3-0013-9949-8e54-0eede523f9d4/198704525001_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"c5c9ca","textColor2":"dcb498","textColor4":"b09684","textColor1":"f6f3ef","bgColor":"001e37","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bomb-ep/1817427556","playParams":{"id":"1817427556","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817427556/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1734551937","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1734551937?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750403571674,"RTCI":0}}},"1817459824":{"id":"1817459824","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817459824?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gylt/1730582129","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I Will Commit A Holy Crime: Tandem","artistName":"Gylt","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4b/1f/e5/4b1fe534-9aa6-e063-f06a-2b73aa8ac971/115058.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e6bfbd","textColor2":"fd8c74","textColor4":"ec7662","textColor1":"f6e8e7","bgColor":"a81c16","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-will-commit-a-holy-crime-tandem/1817459824","playParams":{"id":"1817459824","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3lchD9BzC5wAaMhCpdYsW6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817459824/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1730582129","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1730582129?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750419088433,"RTCI":0}}},"1817468360":{"id":"1817468360","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817468360?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/d%C3%A1vila-666/286845252","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dávila 666 - EP","artistName":"Dávila 666","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6d/97/c1/6d97c10b-671b-4494-e75b-abbed7a25748/115044.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"403334","textColor2":"252e2e","textColor4":"515556","textColor1":"110304","bgColor":"fff4f5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/d%C3%A1vila-666-ep/1817468360","playParams":{"id":"1817468360","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817468360/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"286845252","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/286845252?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750418922415,"RTCI":0}}},"1817532567":{"id":"1817532567","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817532567?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Jeymes Samuel's Spaghetti Western Collection","artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4d/48/5c/4d485c9b-1926-803a-7351-e898efd4a9a8/25UMGIM71330.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"353536","textColor2":"1c1c1d","textColor4":"434342","textColor1":"0a0b0e","bgColor":"deddd7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jeymes-samuels-spaghetti-western-collection/1817532567","playParams":{"id":"1817532567","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3B5FUieliuflYfk89fqx4I"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817532567/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750419342025,"RTCI":0}}},"1817710199":{"id":"1817710199","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817710199?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=6392055-30865945","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live And In Color","artistName":"Juicy J & Logic","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On its face, a collaboration between Three 6 Mafia icon Juicy J and Logic might be a bit surprising. The former made his name as a Memphis repping, horrorcore-loving, shit-talking street observer while the latter rose up by treating the studio booth as his own diary. On <i>Live and In Color</i>, though, they effortlessly meld their two styles and end up with the result all collab albums should strive for: unexpected yet thrilling. On the swaggering, five-and-a-half-minute title track opener, Juicy kicks things off over punchy piano chords and steady handclaps. \n\nHe sounds invigorated, trying on different flows and clearly looking to bring his best stuff while working with the hyper-verbose Logic. On the flip side, it would be easy for the Rockville, Maryland native to cede the spotlight to someone as decorated as Juicy J—especially as he handles production throughout the entire project. Never one to back down from a challenge, though, Logic brings some of his best beats to the project. Check out the playful, old-school, and swaggering “Big Bag Talk,” which features sirens—a nod to one of rap’s most celebrated producers, the late J Dilla.","short":"The hip-hop duo makes for an unexpected but thrilling combination."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ab/d6/12/abd61263-9f44-6ba9-2f50-dbc0209c6abe/193436429597_JuicyJLogicLAIC.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ecaf20","textColor2":"febb25","textColor4":"ec9932","textColor1":"ffd80f","bgColor":"a41067","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-and-in-color/1817710199","playParams":{"id":"1817710199","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4F6xX5UGoiGGpLpItFYHzp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817710199/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6392055","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6392055?l=en-US"},{"id":"30865945","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/30865945?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750394189390,"RTCI":0}}},"1817710478":{"id":"1817710478","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817710478?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/john-williams/63748","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/76/07/cf/7607cf40-799f-15a2-0e26-3e7c6c0c7724/Jobab797e40-abb1-4256-9a30-4bd6262b3172-193745233-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379546249_2185489086-Time1748638563500.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","56b1fa"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"162c3e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"639fde","textColor2":"56b1fa","textColor4":"499bde","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"162c3e","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/29/4d/56/294d5684-2ea6-140c-121e-8369ce6abf6c/Job7ddf3f3a-d0fe-486c-b352-1cf2767717df-193755594-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379546348_2185489231-Time1748646582495.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"eacdd0","textColor2":"f8e9e9","textColor4":"edc1c2","textColor1":"f4f8fa","bgColor":"bf2327","hasP3":false}},"name":"Jaws (Original Motion Picture Score -

For the EP-length <i>Y Lo Que Viene</i>, they proceed to hone that proven formula further, teaming up with old friends and new ones alike. One of their most frequent studio partners, Carín León, revives the bold energy of their prior joint cuts with the embittered, heartbroken opener “Mutuo.” Substantially more sorrowful is “La Buena Eras Tú,” which adds Neton Vega to amplify the boozy longing for a onetime love.

represent a raw, unflinchingly honest corrective to the city’s drill scene’s breezy descent into sample and sexy variants. The Brooklyn-bred rapper entered the picture hell-bent on disrupting the softening of her hometown’s hip-hop reputation by weaponizing her street-level experiences. So, it makes sense that her first non-single release would manifest as a mixtape. Benefitting from her bellicose delivery, <i>Scarred B4 Fame</i> emphasizes the realness of outer-borough life with every antagonistic lyric, taunting and threatening in equal measure on chilling cuts like “Melanin” and “Fruity Pebbles.” One of a handful of vocal guests, Lil Wayne has her back on “Pop That,” matching her pugilistic energy while still getting off his fair share of punch lines. More surprising than the Young Money boss’ feature is when ScarLip reveals some emotional range in her raps via “Eastside” and “Runaway Love Freestyle.”","short":"The NYC rapper puts her dukes up and lets her guard down."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/58/84/8d/58848de4-46fb-0616-c575-b64c805a673f/196873120096.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c2313","textColor2":"0b1315","textColor4":"322c22","textColor1":"160702","bgColor":"d19159","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/scarred-b4-fame/1818650786","playParams":{"id":"1818650786","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2QhUE3nQN7lYRFZ2yOfzXJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818650786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1482094675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1482094675?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750436431954,"RTCI":0}}},"1818691116":{"id":"1818691116","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818691116?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d0/4e/2f/d04e2f35-e617-9217-71f8-79e8a4fc2d04/aed42d3a-a0c5-48f2-926a-fe64a73fff06.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3b082","textColor2":"d0c394","textColor4":"aaa07a","textColor1":"dbd79e","bgColor":"121311","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Buccaneers: S2 (Apple TV+ Original Series Soundtrack)","artistName":"Various Artists","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","short":"A featherlight-pop backdrop to the period drama’s second season."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7c/0d/65/7c0d6511-7624-3687-249a-0fa064d09a6b/25UMGIM74037.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"be876b","textColor2":"e4966f","textColor4":"b87958","textColor1":"eba885","bgColor":"0d0200","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-buccaneers-s2-apple-tv-original-series-soundtrack/1818691116","playParams":{"id":"1818691116","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818691116/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750409458447,"RTCI":0}}},"1818880543":{"id":"1818880543","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818880543?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/est-gee/1387365020","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/36/d3/ae/36d3ae2f-c26f-c65f-14fb-a6f727da75a4/Job95e4b40c-2ad8-4da3-a485-311443b9f874-194514498-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381068154_2199005796-Time1749580024228.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f0e4e3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c1bdb6","textColor2":"f0e4e3","textColor4":"c0b6b5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/40/12/67/40126711-3ec1-7e07-a51e-f6d74fdb73df/64e345a2-7e6f-4d2b-8e6d-44d0b0cc834b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b6b5b9","textColor2":"cac0b9","textColor4":"aca39e","textColor1":"d8d6da","bgColor":"323134","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5e/d0/d6/5ed0d627-11be-74b6-5df8-d43cedd311b1/Job3528181b-bcda-4859-ba28-5061e92323c5-194514499-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381068153_2199005797-Time1749581918854.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c7c3bb","textColor2":"e7dbd1","textColor4":"bab1a9","textColor1":"f7f2e8","bgColor":"080808","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/59/d2/83/59d28334-b7b9-757f-b6f2-97b3f8c0d2d1/fddd55e5-44de-45bd-b29f-3e94a8a902e3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bba297","textColor2":"d3bfb1","textColor4":"b0a096","textColor1":"e0c1b2","bgColor":"272728","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/45/1a/3d451a17-6de1-6c8e-3292-6f5078ac4130/27962609-cdb5-4bd0-b8b3-d37eba6b3ba9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b8b8ba","textColor2":"c9cad2","textColor4":"a1a2a8","textColor1":"e6e6e8","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":true}},"name":"My World","artistName":"EST Gee","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Louisville slugger kicked off 2025 with January’s <i>I Ain’t Feeling You</i>, his star-studded second album with guest spots from Travis Scott, Lil Baby, and Veeze. Not six months later, Gee returns with a surprise third album, <i>My World</i>, whose unfussy song titles suggest a more spontaneous approach from the gravelly-voiced hustler who’s spent the six years since his 2019 debut mixtape <i>El Toro</i> ascending from the Kentucky hip-hop underground to the mainstream. He’s still balancing stone-cold street tales with a healthy dose of soul-searching. On “Take my time Geeski SH Feb 23,” Gee reflects on his trajectory as one of few rappers to make it out of his hometown. And an appearance from Yo Gotti on “PABLO FINAL GOTTI version” as the album’s only feature should implicitly quell the recent rumors of Gee’s supposed departure from the Memphis veteran’s CMG label.","short":"The Louisville slugger balances stone-cold street tales with

Arriving mere months after <i>The Final Call</i>, his joint album with Ransom, he links here in similar fashion with Roc-A-Fella Records alumnus Young Chris. Those who remember Philly duo Young Gunz and the adjacent State Property collective know how well Chris works with others, and <i>Fine Dining</i> demonstrates that he’s only gotten better at it with time. Most of the beats come from East’s go-to Triple A, who lays down rugged and soulful instrumentals like “Pablo & Gunner” and “Ain’t Adding Up” for the formidable pair to get their seasoned streetwise bars off. Their insular guest list reflects the respect they deservedly garner, with ElCamino coming through along with the aforementioned Calhoun and Ransom.","short":"Two East Coast rhyme vets spit for the

five years since 2020’s <i>FERXXO (VOL 1: M.O.R)</i>, during which time he’s catapulted to international fame as one of the biggest reggaetoneros around. Going from Colombian club fave to global arena/stadium headliner was no small feat, yet the Medellín artist’s success can be easily understood off the strength of albums like <i>FERXXOCALIPSIS</i> and his collaborative <i>LOS 9 DE FERXXO Y SKY ROMPIENDO</i>, to say nothing of his features alongside fellow hitmakers Bad Bunny, KAROL G, and Rauw Alejandro.\n\nFor <i>FERXXO (VOL X: Sagrado)</i>, Feid persists in his efforts to move reggaetón forward, yielding instantly gratifying results and potential future classics. He brings a wary sentimentality to “KELOIDE” and the comparatively brighter “I MIXX U,” unable to fully extract himself from the emotional clutches of an evidently problematic baddie. Unafraid to reconfigure the familiar, he nimbly transforms the prior single “SORRY 4 THAT MUCH”—presented here as a bonus track—into a slowed and reverb remix.\n\nPerreo pop moments like “DALLAX” with Ty Dolla $ign and the Wisin-featuring “hypnotixx” mingle with much more experimental expressions of the sound. In particular, “NOS DESCONOXIMOS” affixes it to an atmospheric house structure, something that resurfaces toward the end on the deceptively straightforward “Priority.” Still, as progressive as Feid’s style can get, he still shows love and knowledge for his chosen genre’s island origins, throwing it all the way back to its dancehall reggae beginnings on “NO ME DEJO XXIMBIAR.” Similarly, “ANDO XXIL” calls back to the overtly hip-hop presence once found on early DJ Playero mixtapes."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0e/dc/d4/0edcd462-1abe-7b66-08f3-453fe8dab49b/25UMGIM78108.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"31281e","textColor2":"060604","textColor4":"33281c","textColor1":"030706","bgColor":"e7ad7f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ferxxo-vol-x-sagrado/1819251013","playParams":{"id":"1819251013","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3PfMmFVUx9oJUFvnDf76Iz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819251013/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"194502100","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/194502100?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750407466508,"RTCI":0}}},"1819544141":{"id":"1819544141","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819544141?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/karol-g/290814601","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2f/98/13/2f981308-041c-330a-247e-905670583f61/2c0993c5-6dad-447b-8be0-c10b66d82b6b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e7cfca","textColor2":"fa9e6c","textColor4":"e78a5d","textColor1":"faf5f4","bgColor":"9d3825","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/65/4d/4c/654d4c06-03b6-8ad4-952e-57e251a953b0/c995a95a-0a3f-45c4-a457-191c7631b51d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbcac7","textColor2":"e9bbaf","textColor4":"d4a397","textColor1":"f2eceb","bgColor":"7f4439","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4e/c3/c6/4ec3c69c-5446-37d9-ab52-b82d87d38d12/ce46539c-42b3-432e-8f74-2cffbb7a1330.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c66244","textColor2":"e86f53","textColor4":"bd5b46","textColor1":"f37851","bgColor":"120c0f","hasP3":true}},"name":"Tropicoqueta","artistName":"KAROL G","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"With every album since 2017’s <i>Unstoppable</i>, KAROL G progressively moved beyond expectations. Clearly not content with being the top reggaetonera on the scene, the Colombian singer refined and repositioned herself with each new full-length, from the beach dreaminess of <i>OCEAN</i> through the diverse sides of her <i>MAÑANA SERÁ BONITO</i> era. Her unapologetic eagerness to cross genre lines while still building with longtime allies like Ovy On the Drums grew her global fanbase exponentially, outpacing just about everyone else in Latin music who emerged during the mid-2010s boom. \n\nNow fully vested in the trappings of megastardom, she offers what is easily her most ambitious album to date in <i>Tropicoqueta</i>, its titular portmanteau a marked pivot that reflects how reggaetón’s baddest bichota successfully evolved into one of the world’s biggest pop artists. Among the album’s triumphs is just how at ease KAROL sounds on these 20 shapeshifting tracks, adapting and thriving over different sounds in ways that even some of her famous peers could never. \n\nAiming to genuinely connect with and honor Latin musical cultures more broadly, she faithfully plays to homegrown vallenato on the pleading “No Puedo Vivir Sin Él” and reaches for cumbia villera on “Cuando Me Muera Te Olvido.” Decidedly Caribbean forms like bachata and dembow feature on “Amiga Mía” with Greeicy and “Un Gatito Me Llamó,” respectively. Her fusions spark joy as well, combining New York City’s sexy drill with Brazilian baile funk on “Bandida Entrenada” and embracing tropical pop on bilingual standout “Papasito.” And while Latin Afrobeats is essentially its own active subgenre at this point, she holds space for herself within it on the somewhat mysterious “Canción 13.”\n\nNone of this means that KAROL’s given up on reggaetón, of course. She sprinkles in a gratifying amount of it throughout, beginning with the poppy perreo of “LATINA FOREVA” and continuing on deeper cuts like “Tu Perfume” and the Mariah Angeliq reunion “FKN Movie.” Elsewhere, as on “Se Puso Linda,” that familiar polyrhythm operates more like a texture than a driver, leaving room for her femme-forward storytelling to shine. The sheer power of her relatable lyricism is hard to deny as well, from the character-driven world-building of “Ivonny Bonita” to the romantic mischievousness of “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido.”","short":"The Colombian megastar moves beyond expectations."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/39/f5/1e39f58c-e5c1-6431-d6ed-d6c32e29d63f/25UMGIM79234.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e99965","textColor2":"fc9461","textColor4":"e88055","textColor1":"fcb376","bgColor":"9c3123","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tropicoqueta/1819544141","playParams":{"id":"1819544141","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yY0fT7zibMEffhBJD9Nab"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819544141/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"290814601","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/290814601?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750435741384,"RTCI":0}}},"1819651307":{"id":"1819651307","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819651307?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/smiley/1356734441","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/93/fb/86/93fb8616-256f-3a7e-3e51-85be7d754f10/Job3d324376-a479-448f-8804-a1403d703975-194462750-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380966408_2198187402-Time1749529079134.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2e3628"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172314"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3e302d","textColor2":"2e3628","textColor4":"51574d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172314","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a5/fa/55/a5fa5506-30f6-454d-071c-81e49f45a367/efe5cbed-cbea-48d2-b193-1c19eb1ab08b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7ea6c5","textColor2":"91b3cc","textColor4":"7798b1","textColor1":"99c4e4","bgColor":"122d49","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8f/2a/6d/8f2a6da3-2807-bf98-653b-e28cc0112ae9/Jobbf895c8e-3b67-4524-a0cb-2d4787501e8b-194462751-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380966409_2198187406-Time1749530722071.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","313625"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172314"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"313030","textColor2":"313625","textColor4":"53584c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172314","hasP3":false}},"name":"Don't Box Me In","artistName":"Smiley","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"Alexander Eli Morand comes by his nom de rap—Smiley—honestly. Even when the Drake-approved Toronto MC is popping off about street struggles and girl trouble over atmospheric OVO beats, he exudes an excitable energy and tongue-in-cheek attitude that turns frowns upside down. The quick-hit mixtape <i>Don’t Box Me In</i> functions as a status update on how Smiley’s life has changed ever since his Drizzy collab “Over the Top” blew up in 2021, and whether he’s reaffirming his loyalty to his Pelham Park homies on “Budge” (“This for all the dogs/I’ll never do a Michael Vick”) or fending off gold-digging girlfriends on “6ixSideKids” (“All you do is talk, bitch/Go start a podcast”), Smiley filters his self-aggrandizing bravado through a sly sense of humor. But true to its title, <i>Don’t Box Me In</i> exemplifies Smiley’s desire to break free of both geographic and musical boundaries: On “Spill the Tea,” he bids his hometown adieu to pursue his world-conquering ambitions while floating off into the sunset on a dreamy Sean Leon/River Tiber sample.","short":"The Drake-approved MC breaks free of musical and geographic boundaries."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0b/ad/86/0bad86d8-6151-43fc-8725-c59d87a07bbb/54169.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d3430","textColor2":"33221c","textColor4":"4d403d","textColor1":"0b120c","bgColor":"b5bbc2","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-box-me-in/1819651307","playParams":{"id":"1819651307","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2TLqwyhFd2gr8ACn4G7xiT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819651307/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1356734441","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1356734441?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750419455413,"RTCI":0}}},"1820018673":{"id":"1820018673","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820018673?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brandon-lake/1050382282","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"King Of Hearts (Full Deck Deluxe)","artistName":"Brandon Lake","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Worship anthems meet personal reflections on the singer’s fifth LP."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/c5/a9/bec5a994-b837-3dbc-4d5e-3012efcd7cf8/196873259444.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dcb6a4","textColor2":"efb998","textColor4":"d79e7c","textColor1":"f6d7cb","bgColor":"773309","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/king-of-hearts-full-deck-deluxe/1820018673","playParams":{"id":"1820018673","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58h0AZmXG7bYxk7gBxIWu0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820018673/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1050382282","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1050382282?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750431674842,"RTCI":0}}},"1820020221":{"id":"1820020221","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820020221?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dowba-montana/1459338383","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Bryan Season","artistName":"Dowba Montana","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7f/83/46/7f834697-5627-f005-7517-b0d259a1b78f/199350864469.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"be9b4a","textColor2":"fba561","textColor4":"cf8851","textColor1":"e6bd58","bgColor":"1d1614","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bryan-season/1820020221","playParams":{"id":"1820020221","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7AzndIxKaS5M6IN7KmodSu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820020221/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1459338383","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1459338383?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750315092779,"RTCI":0}}},"1820093990":{"id":"1820093990","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820093990?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-wayne/5869117","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6f/55/6e/6f556e59-127a-7c04-fa5d-acddd980243c/67de097b-e470-4e25-be66-172f0ef6fc96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c3032","textColor2":"191411","textColor4":"363635","textColor1":"0d0d0e","bgColor":"aabdc4","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/ce/8e/0cce8ef7-ac10-57fb-9ba4-380b187f86f2/03db68c3-142d-4b09-97be-d931868ddb48.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3c3b","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"494342","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"707e81","hasP3":true}},"name":"Tha Carter VI (Bonus)","artistName":"Lil Wayne","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Hip-hop loves a franchise, and arguably none deserves more of that adoration than Lil Wayne’s <i>Tha Carter</i>. Plenty of rappers have gone the sequels route in the hopes of recapturing a vibe or reinvigorating a fanbase, but the first four installments of the Young Money impresario’s album series hit the culture like monumental events. The exhaustive way in which this quartet was discussed, dissected, ranked, and re-ranked by listeners and critics alike almost eclipsed their chart successes, securing Weezy’s spot in the G.O.A.T. debate forever. The seven-year gap between the fourth and fifth volumes felt like an eternity, especially as focus shifted towards fresh stars and new sounds. Yet even that wait came with a massive payoff—not rebooting the saga to suit the times but continuing his story in a way only he could.\n\nAnother seven years may have passed, with a handful of mixtapes in between, yet this sixth volume proves well worth the wait. After the brief albeit maximalist opener “King Carter,” those who’ve missed his powerful punchlines and rich rhyme schemes are immediately rewarded with the triumphant “Welcome to Tha Carter.” As should be expected this deep into his storied career, his proverbial pen prevails on “Banned from NO” and “Peanuts 2 N Elephant,” just two examples of his devotion to the MC craft. Longtime fans will rejoice over the Mannie Fresh team-up “Bein Myself,” while those unsure of how a fortysomething Wayne fits into the contemporary mix will be corrected swiftly on the Wheezy-produced “Rari.”\n\nThough some vocally resisted his literal rock-star tendencies on records like 2010’s <i>Rebirth</i>, he remains committed to that side of his artistry. Starting with the opening moments of “Bells,” he reminds everyone listening that rap and rock share genetic material before wrapping his wordplay around an ’80s-informed flow. Mixing Weezy with Weezer, the inventive interpolation “Island Holiday” starts out like a faithful cover song until he swaps out the “hip hip” with “sip sip” and proceeds to make it his own. After a ruthless two-and-a-half-minute streak of bars, “Loki’s Theme” drops an unexpected swell of guitar soloing, leading directly into the acoustic balladry of “If I Played Guitar.” Considering his guest list includes Bono and Jelly Roll alongside Big Sean and BigXthaPlug, not to mention operatic pop icon Andrea Bocelli, clearly no one genre can contain the force that is Lil Wayne.\n","short":"Weezy F.

On 2024’s <i>SAKURA</i>, the Spanish artist showed his growing fanbase just how effective he can be when he’s the host rather than the guest, with album highlights like “BADGYAL” and “ESKELETO” making his case. Arriving a little over a year later, his moderately shorter follow-up <i>NATSUKASHII YORU</i> shows an emboldened SAIKO maximizing his moment and expanding his sonic breadth. Bookended by “SÍ QUIERO” and “NOSTALGIA,” two tracks that intentionally lean into the traditional, the rest of his 13-song set pushes forward with a futurist edge. That’s evident on the shimmering slowed dembow of “MIAMI 22,” the urgently pulsating electronica of “SAN JUAN,” and the progressive perreo of “WEKEWEKE.” Naturally, he’s invited some guests of his own along, setting his sights on some baddies with Omar Courtz on the thumping “LOKENECESITAS” and blissing out with Leire Martinez over the synth rock of “MARIPOSAS.”","short":"Nostalgia and futurism

hard to overstate SOPHIE’s influence on 21st-century pop. Pioneer, visionary, and an icon in music and beyond, the DJ, producer, and artist was as lauded by pop’s underground as its most mainstream artists—and the Glaswegian’s touch can be felt on almost everything in between. This is music that, somehow, channelled both the avant garde and a kind of blistering directness. Right from the start of the early 2010s, when SOPHIE emerged as a mystery-shrouded affiliate of experimental pop label PC Music, songs resisted musical boundaries. Rushing, hyperkinetic moments of ecstasy (“Immaterial”), glinting, metallic percussion (“Hard”), syncopated soda-bubble trap (“Lemonade”); whether through alien, synthesised effects or distorted snatches of robotic vocal, this former art school student brought a sculptor’s sensibility to candy-painted pop. But that didn’t mean subtlety and traditional musicianship weren’t present. 2018’s debut album <I>Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</I> broadened the scope, hurtling from the whispered torch song theatrics of “It’s Okay To Cry” to the smashed-glass, R&B gear-switches that give “Faceshopping” its urgent, convulsive energy. SOPHIE died January 30, 2021, at age 34.
