Album","standard":"Don’t let her sweetness fool you: Frankie Cosmos’ Greta Kline has more insights about the inner struggles of sensitive young people than most of her indie-pop peers. Or, hey, do let it fool you—getting fooled is part of what being young is about. “I think it’s funny not to learn my lesson/And keep on acting like I’m 27,” she sings from her perch of infinite wisdom at age 31 (“Porcelain”), having confessed two minutes earlier, “I can’t go a day without touching my fucking telephone” (“Bitch Heart”). The music is more sophisticated than her 2010s K Records-style scrawls (listen to the ’70s soft-pop of “Vanity”) but never so sophisticated it gets in the way of her lyrics, which hit like little pinpricks. If it’s true, why make it more complicated?","short":"A quietly great indie-pop band delivers deep insight with a laugh and a

Album and Interview","standard":"A recurring piece of fan feedback shaped Sons Of The East’s second album: “I love your recorded music, but seeing you live is a completely different experience,” keyboardist/vocalist Nic Johnston recounts to Apple Music. “So we wanted to get the record a little closer to what it might sound like to come and see us live.” Accordingly, the Sydney indie-folk trio recorded much of the album together in the same room rather than tracking their parts separately. There is, Johnston says, “a little more chaos, a little more liveliness. In a very broad sense, that’s one of the big things we wanted to bring to this record.”\n\nSimilarly impactful was the fact many of the ideas were formulated while touring. Some came while walking around empty venues before doors opened, guitar in hand (“Hard to Tell”); others while noodling on their instruments en route to the next show. “That’s probably why so many of the songs feel so good when you’re driving in a car, because a lot of them came about in those circumstances,” says guitarist/banjo player Dan Wallage.\n\nThe resulting album moves from anthemic indie-folk (“Rescue Me”) and indie-rock (“Recognise”) to pastoral folk (“10 Days”) and ’70s West Coast grooves (“Pour the Wine”), tied together by the trio’s lush, CSNY-inspired vocal harmonies. Here, Johnston and Wallage take Apple Music through <i>SONS</i> track by track.\n\n<b>“It’s Alright”</b>\nDan Wallage: “The basis for that song came from a jam in the studio. It was one of those songs that just made all of us smile.”\nNic Johnston: “Lyrically, it follows that sense of everything’s relaxed and vibey and we’re having fun. We just wanted to keep it light and enjoyable, open the album on not too heavy a note.”\n\n<b>“Sweet Thing”</b>\nNJ: “Definitely a heartbreak song. I remember sitting in the studio and playing these chords and Jack [Rollins, guitar/vocals] came up with this melody over the top really quickly, and it was quite seamless. Then we worked on instrumentation, trying to pair Dan’s arpeggiated acoustic guitar with the organ.”\n\n<b>“Rescue Me”</b>\nNJ: “The lyrics are quite emotional and sad and hinting at impending heartbreak, but it’s also quite hopeful as well. It came from this jam we had ages ago and I kept coming back to it, like, ‘There’s something here.’ The original recording is complete chaos—us going hell for leather on all our instruments and singing different lyrics. It took us quite a while to home in on what the song’s about and what it all meant.”\n\n<b>“Pour the Wine”</b>\nDW: “It was keys, banjo, guitar, just us sitting in comfy chairs, very relaxed, with a bunch of mics on us, and we just jammed through the whole song. Let’s not worry about being completely perfect or playing to a click, let’s just create a vibe within those three instruments. I’ve always wanted a song where we go from Jack to Nic or Nic to Jack singing lead. It starts with Nic on the lead vocal then switches to Jack and then, the chorus, you don’t know who’s doing what. I love the chaos in that.”\n\n<b>“Recognise”</b>\nNJ: “It’s a bit of a standout for us in terms of the band going in a slightly new direction. This one makes me think of being on tour in America, or just generally being on tour. It’s got this traveling feel to it.”\nDW: “We’ve never gone, ‘We have to be a folk band, we have to be blues country.’ We all like different types of music so we thought, ‘Let’s try and create something that feels like Sons Of The East, but has elements from all different genres.’ It’s got the driving drums and banjo and synth together, which is a unique flavor.”\n\n<b>“10 Days”</b>\nNJ: “It’s definitely the rawest song on the record. For a while there it was quite hard to listen to. Lyrically, it’s a massive question mark over where a relationship is going; that feeling of something slipping away but you’re not quite sure how it happened and where it’s going. It’s very vulnerable and close to my heart.”\n\n<b>“Time Will Tell”</b>\nDW: “It kind of falls into a similar boat to ‘Rescue Me’—it delves into similar tales of hope and resilience and rolling with the punches and getting to the other side. We wanted to take it back to how we started Sons Of The East, which was one of us playing acoustic guitar and then maybe some piano and some vocal, and then have this ending where it’s very upbeat. You want people to sing the chorus even though it’s somber.”\n\n<b>“Wish I Knew”</b>\nNJ: “This was another one where we wanted to replicate that live experience a little more. We just wanted this to be a big sing-along. Lyrically, it’s a pretty universal feeling of sometimes you just have no idea where you’re headed. That idea we’re all in some way, shape or form making it up as we go along. And that’s OK.”\n\n<b>“Get Even”</b>\nNJ: “I remember being on tour last year and we were going through this tiny town in Nevada. And we stopped at this little servo [rest stop] that was selling these cheap cowboy hats. There was something about the combination of it feeling so foreign—we were so far from home, surrounded by massive American road trains and truckies [truck drivers] and these big truck stops—paired with then pulling up FaceTime and calling loved ones back home. That set the scene for where this song began.”\n\n<b>“Oh My My”</b>\nDW: “Once again, these overall themes of persistence and strength and freedom come into ‘Oh My My.’ One of my favorite lyrics is ‘Taking on water but I’m bailing it out and it’s my life.’ Just that idea bad stuff’s going to happen and we’re all going to have our ups and downs, but sometimes you just have to see it through to the other side.”\n\n<b>“Head Above the Water”</b>\nNJ: “It was written as a song to a friend who was going through a hard time. It’s basically, I’ve got your back. Quite often those songs are written in a relationship context, and it was really nice to write something that was just for a friend. Love between friends is not showcased quite as much and it’s such an important part of all our lives, that support network we have around us.”\n\n<b>“Hard to Tell”</b>\nNJ: “That first riff came about in Atlanta in a venue. Quite often we’ll just grab a guitar and walk around an empty venue and strum ideas, and there’s something about being in that context that is quite conducive to letting your mind wander and coming up with new ideas. To me that song is nostalgic of that very first tour we did in the States. And I think it’s reflected through the vibe of the song.”","short":"The Sydney trio embrace their live energy on their second

Album and Interview","standard":"A mid-career self-titled album is often an intentional statement, if not an outright reset. For Parker McCollum, attaching his name to his fifth studio album is something of a reintroduction, an hour-long tour of the Texas-born singer-songwriter’s expansive talents and a glimpse into his still immense potential. Co-produced by Music Row veteran Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack), the collection finds McCollum pushing his artistry to new places, a feat aided by stepping back from longtime collaborator Jon Randall and jetting up to New York City to record the album’s 14 tracks.\n\n“This record that we made in New York is the record I always wondered if I was good enough to make,” McCollum tells Apple Music. “I always thought about a record like this, and I finally just feel like maybe I might’ve gotten close to something that could be that.”\n\nThe LP opens with “My Blue,” a rootsy, near-folk song following a character named Jackie whose life is marked by loss and hardship. That song, with its emphasis on narrative songwriting and traditional instrumentation, immediately announces <i>Parker McCollum</i> as an outlier among recent releases from McCollum’s peers, and shows him to have more in common with genre outsiders like Jason Isbell or Tyler Childers than the current crop of country stars. “Solid Country Gold,” with its chiming piano and crunchy guitar, recalls the hardscrabble twang of fellow Texan Hayes Carll, name-checking John Prine at the chorus for good measure. Below, McCollum shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“My Blue”</b>\n“I knew I wanted ‘My Blue’ to be the first song on the record, because I knew if you heard that song and you didn’t get it and it didn’t do it for you, then this record’s not for you. My agent the other day joked, ‘Well, if you like cocaine and suicide, this record’s for you.’ But I wasn’t trying to put them in any chronological order or get from one place to another. Anytime I sequence an album, I’m just like, ‘I just want you to go somewhere else each song.’ And I think that works. I think that’s not an easy way, but a commonly effective way to lay out the tracks for a record.’”\n\n<b>“Killin’ Me”</b>\n“It’s pretty different from how I wrote it, especially the scene change in the solo. You’re going to a whole other place for that solo, and then you come right back to where you were. I don’t think the band heard any of the songs on the record before we were recording them. I would just start playing them and everybody would just fall in. And everybody was really encouraged and told very sternly like, ‘Hey, play whatever the hell you want to play. Mess up, play wrong notes. If you think it’s dumb, wrong—just play and play.’”\n\n<b>“Good Time Charlie’s Got the Blues” (feat. Cody Johnson)</b>\n“Cody’s a lot better than I am. We ain’t even playing the same game. But I’ve just always been such a fan, and it was selfish of me to have him on that song, because I’ve always listened to that song and wanted to hear him sing it. I think he’s one of the best singers that I’ve ever heard. And his voice is so unique and it’s so true, and I believe every bit of it. I just always wanted to hear him sing that song, and so I mustered up the courage one day to text him. And then, about four months later, I was like, ‘Man, I should not have done that. I’m probably a pain in his ass. And he probably complained to his management that he’s got to sing on this dumb Parker song.’ And thank you—shout-out Cody for doing it again. But I listened to it after he’d sang it, and I was just like, ‘Damn, I was so right.’”\n\n<b>“New York Is on Fire”</b>\n“I had wanted to go to New York in the late fall. I wanted to catch it when that first cool, crisp air was rolling in. I just wanted to set it up and pretend like I was in my own movie for a week. And when we were flying in, the trees were electric. And I said out loud to Charlie, my keys player who was with me, I said, ‘Dude, it looks like New York is on fire.’ Then we were in the studio the first day, and we were just messing around between takes around lunchtime. I started singing, ‘New York is on fire’ over and over and over again. And Frank was just buzzed in. He was the only one in the control room listening. And he was like, ‘Hey, whatever that is, keep doing that.’”","short":"The Texas star reintroduces himself on his fifth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/parker-mccollum/1802060343","playParams":{"id":"1802060343","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yqDWZNB69J3FYyQPgF4xA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802060343/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"733165597","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/733165597?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751042977029}}},"1803492393":{"id":"1803492393","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803492393?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cole-swindell/354625084","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/47/b8/b7/47b8b714-167d-3225-b4c6-b044ab8f53bc/Jobf7880501-4a90-45aa-b008-9d4149452d13-189536858-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371129793_2110637050-Time1743725129886.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e0e1a0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1b13"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3b98a","textColor2":"e0e1a0","textColor4":"b8b883","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1b13","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/2c/fb/7d2cfbe8-137c-1f03-5e98-55b1a24c9df2/173c59ae-dff8-4a71-94db-033e8e587b9f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a0a09a","textColor2":"d2a188","textColor4":"ab8470","textColor1":"c4c4bd","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bf/30/2e/bf302e8d-c62a-07b6-0ccc-db8c75d0192a/Jobdac91d4e-8231-427a-9239-e6723126657e-189536857-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371129792_2110637049-Time1743723833119.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bfbf97","textColor2":"f4e6ae","textColor4":"c6bb8c","textColor1":"eaebbc","bgColor":"110f04","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9f/87/13/9f87135f-8ef5-487e-a9bc-f2587eda17cf/597154b5-8f7c-485e-a7ba-d80e009a553b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"30271c","textColor2":"2b1e0d","textColor4":"433625","textColor1":"130b02","bgColor":"a39a84","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/37/cc/29/37cc2995-3dc7-1254-b54c-4c7e4060a2fc/546c0525-8b59-45be-bfad-c289ea4342bb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac9c75","textColor2":"cbaf78","textColor4":"a48e61","textColor1":"d5c091","bgColor":"0a0a04","hasP3":true}},"name":"Spanish Moss","artistName":"Cole Swindell","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/df/28/cfdf28c7-3920-43f3-f814-fac3a3834f26/093624831303.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0b18d","textColor2":"dedbac","textColor4":"b7b38b","textColor1":"e8d9af","bgColor":"1f1307","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Over a decade into his career, Cole Swindell is not the same man he was when he released his hit debut single, “Chillin’ It,” in 2013. The Georgia-born singer-songwriter has lived a lot of life in the intervening years, ascending to country stardom and, more recently, getting married and becoming a father. The 21 songs composing his fifth studio album reflect this more mature stage of life, digging into vulnerable topics like marriage, parenthood, and grief. And with assists from 11 producers and a veritable who’s who of Nashville songwriters, Swindell turns in one of the more stylistically varied projects he’s done yet. \n\n<i>Spanish Moss</i> opens with “Kill a Prayer,” a laidback, midtempo track with deceptively loose production, as Swindell acknowledges his hard-partying ways could have landed him in dire straits if “a mama’s amen” hadn’t helped him see the light. “Dale Jr.” was inspired by a real-life meeting with the NASCAR star, during which Swindell and Earnhardt connected over having both lost their fathers. “Georgia (Ain’t on Her Mind)” gives Swindell a chance to celebrate his home-state roots, turning in a smooth and sturdy vocal as he traces a relationship from its Peach State roots to its highway-bound dissolution. “Forever to Me” is sure to soundtrack many a future wedding, with sweeping production and sweet, romantic imagery. Closing track “Heads Up Heaven,” a tender and sparsely adorned ballad, ends the collection on an especially emotional note, paying tribute to Swindell’s late mother, who died in 2021.","short":"Over 21 songs, one of the most stylistically varied projects of his career."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/spanish-moss/1803492393","playParams":{"id":"1803492393","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7k56MAd5kMXPEGLlH8s13V"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803492393/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"354625084","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/354625084?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751039967847}}},"1804688733":{"id":"1804688733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804688733?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":83,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-springsteen/178834","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4a/99/5f/4a995fe0-23d5-b9ca-96c2-5f71d63ae5f2/Job0fc20ee8-4efa-4319-80dc-8e63ccd6048b-190572034-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373208463_2127632271-Time1745001857444.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cdcac4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0a0a0a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c4c2b7","textColor2":"cdcac4","textColor4":"a7a4a0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/18/02/db/1802dbc6-2440-d9e5-024e-752d4f5aaba4/ca7f5f7f-875f-4d69-b277-463ef877f4f7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb8039","textColor2":"da8b3d","textColor4":"b27335","textColor1":"e59c43","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7f/33/c4/7f33c4ce-983a-328c-7d45-cf17574030eb/Job3ff3915e-93bf-40e0-b8e9-e35c9348ba74-190572035-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373208462_2127632270-Time1745002890311.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"31302e","textColor2":"0f0f0f","textColor4":"3a3936","textColor1":"040405","bgColor":"e5e1d4","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c6/5f/09/c65f0981-771a-ac30-298c-e61b4b5f5d93/f84efd7f-f361-4c13-b857-710423f9237c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfbeb0","textColor2":"e5e1d8","textColor4":"bfbcb5","textColor1":"fae5d2","bgColor":"262627","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e4/d7/7f/e4d77f17-c4a1-06c0-b594-ba1a67836db2/7f955986-3c93-4e38-a845-485a83b2f4bd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c3c3c","textColor2":"0f0f0f","textColor4":"3c3c3c","textColor1":"0f0f0f","bgColor":"efefef","hasP3":true}},"name":"Tracks II: The Lost Albums","artistName":"Bruce Springsteen","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c5/6f/eb/c56feb9d-b333-a761-41ae-2dffe517eef2/196873001647.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d4d4ce","textColor2":"f2efdf","textColor4":"cbc8bc","textColor1":"fffff7","bgColor":"2d2d2f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"History gets harder and harder to make, but never in the long, weird history of popular music has there been an analogue for this. Doorstop box sets with troves of fan-coveted rarities are de rigueur for any legacy artist, very much including Bruce Springsteen, whose 1998 compilation <i>Tracks</i> dutifully assembled 66 of these—four and a half hours of alternate history to one of rock’s most vaunted narratives. Twenty-seven years later, its nominal sequel is composed of seven full and distinct stand-alone albums recorded between 1983 and 2018, largely unknown to even the most devout Springsteen cryptographers. That something so auspicious and audacious bears the modest title <i>Tracks II</i> is the slyest joke of his career.\n\nIndividually, these albums demonstrate both logical extensions of his classic songwriting that manage to meet that impossible standard, as well as tantalizing, disciplined, and fully realized genre exercises that have no real precedent in his discography. As a whole, the collection begs nothing less than a wholesale reevaluation of an already deeply considered career.\n\nA collection of gussied-up home recordings that bridges the gap between 1982’s <i>Nebraska</i> and the 1984 supernova <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>. An entire album in the subdued synth-pop vein of “Streets of Philadelphia” and “Secret Garden.” (The long-held idea that the ’90s was a relatively fallow period for Springsteen, for example, goes very much out the window.) An atmospheric soundtrack to a shelved western that answers the question, “What if Springsteen transformed himself into Tom Waits?” One pure honky-tonk album and one of untied-bow-tie jazz-standards style torch songs. An album influenced by Mexican music, another of full-bore, more recent vintage-rock songs.

Produced by Jimmy Robbins (Maren Morris, Charles Kelley) and Dann Huff (Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban), <i>2.0</i> opens with “Drink with You,” a mature cautionary tale about the slippery slope of sipping too much around an ex-flame. \n\nLady A joins Young on “Who I Do It For,” a sweet and sentimental portrait of parenthood with rich harmonies and flourishes of pedal steel. “Full House” is another celebration of family life, with Young sounding especially soulful as he sings of “sticky fingerprints down the hallway” and “teddy bears up and down the staircase.” George Birge joins Young on “You Don’t Know What You’re Missing,” a delicate ballad about trading late-night benders for bedtime stories. Young closes the project with “In Case You Didn’t Know 2.0,” a reworking of his 2017 love song that features duet vocals from up-and-comer Hannah McFarland.","short":"On his fourth studio album, the country star gets an upgrade."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/2-0/1805002919","playParams":{"id":"1805002919","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4cHDMUgQiIMYMe3QjWFgi7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805002919/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1084576956","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1084576956?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751038179847}}},"1806160413":{"id":"1806160413","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806160413?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-dare/1638797654","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/45/eb/1c/45eb1c35-af22-2a27-54f2-ad3893de92ff/da2d578e-2c8a-48a9-a272-e2cb22f738d9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5b0b6","textColor2":"c3b8c4","textColor4":"a39ba5","textColor1":"dad2da","bgColor":"242629","hasP3":true}},"name":"What’s Wrong With New York?: Afters","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"The Dare","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4b/bb/c3/4bbbc386-1f68-463f-baa4-86145ff0421a/24UMGIM64117.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfb5bc","textColor2":"e2cee4","textColor4":"b4a5b7","textColor1":"efe1eb","bgColor":"000403","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"The dream of the mid-2000s is alive in New York City, where Harrison Patrick Smith (better known as The Dare) has become the figurehead for a revivalist movement of a certain Myspace-era jouissance.

The lead single of his debut album <i>Fireworks & Rollerblades</i> was a runaway success that brought the 22-year-old to the stage of the 2025 Grammys, where he seamlessly busted a backflip off of a grand piano before launching into the sledgehammer chorus. As for his second flip of the show-stealing performance—that one was unplanned. “My thought process is that there’s not a thought process. It’s more like when I’m up there, I just do whatever feels right,” Boone told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe shortly after the performance. “During the moment, I was like, ‘You know what? I’ve been standing here for a while and I’m just going to do a flip.’ And that’s how it went.”\n\nWith his second album, <i>American Heart</i>, the newcomer known for his electric stage presence and Freddie Mercury-esque falsetto steps out of the shadow of his biggest hit. Its 10 tracks, all written by Boone and frequent collaborator Jack LaFrantz, live in the anthemic sweet spot between Springsteen-style heartland rock and the arena-ready pop-rock of The Killers (particularly on “Young American Heart,” whose “live fast, die young” narrative was inspired by a near-fatal car accident Boone got into in high school). He stays grounded with a pair of songs in honor of his parents: the tear-jerking “Momma Song” plus “Mr Electric Blue,” a prog-pop epic about hero-worshipping his dad (who, mind you, can do backflips well into his fifties). The energy is up compared to his first record: As Boone explained to Lowe, lead single “Sorry I’m Here for Someone Else” began as a sullen piano ballad and became a pulsing synth-pop banger about a run-in with an ex at a diner.\n\nCan lightning strike twice as far as another life-changing, world-conquering hit? Boone’s more interested in settling into himself. “I have such an eager mindset, where I’m always now, now, now: What’s going to happen right now? How are people going to react right now? What can I get right now?” he told Lowe. “In this career, that’s really good at times, but also it can get a little unhealthy, because it takes time—to figure out who you even want to be, and where you want to go, and what your goals are, and what kind of music you like, and who you want to make it with and what you’re trying to give the world.” He’s still evolving, he admits: “The music you hear from me right now probably won’t be the music you hear from me in 10 years. But I think I’ve finally found a version of my music that I really, really, really love.”\n","short":"A newly minted pop star steps out of the shadow of his breakout hit."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-heart/1807490612","playParams":{"id":"1807490612","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3C0QJ1R0T3xX0BUbOZcdCw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807490612/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1587414058","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1587414058?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751039677424}}},"1808004983":{"id":"1808004983","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808004983?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Contemporary Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jasper-h%C3%B8iby/427032112","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Fellow Creatures: We Must Fight","artistName":"Jasper Høiby","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1a/24/4e/1a244ee2-74b3-b165-8675-12d61d2684c2/199350161742.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"d7d7d7","textColor4":"acacac","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fellow-creatures-we-must-fight/1808004983","playParams":{"id":"1808004983","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Vk3H6u5GPdKSnTzmQfswu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808004983/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"427032112","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/427032112?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751026030135}}},"1808014803":{"id":"1808014803","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808014803?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/russ/683622116","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"W!LD","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Russ","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c0/44/c0/c044c0a6-8f05-6a6f-6be2-048535017804/199282716966_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"393937","textColor2":"00204f","textColor4":"2f486c","textColor1":"0d0d0c","bgColor":"ece9e4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Wolves tend to pop up regularly on Russ’ album art, but the creature on the cover of <i>W!LD</i> is something more ambiguous—perhaps a kind of wolf-horse hybrid, looking wistfully over its shoulder. Breaking down the image and title of what he bills as his sixth album (though technically you could consider it his 17th) on social media, the 32-year-old rapper explained that after spending years single-mindedly focused on external success, he’d grown more interested in exploring the “wilderness” of self-discovery. \n\nFive years after completing his deal with Columbia Records and going fully independent, the rapper who was once known as a lightning rod for controversy seems to have chilled significantly, meditating on success, love, and his own unexpected trajectory over soulful self-produced beats. (“How’d I beat the game without looking at the user guide?” he marvels on the intro.) He has yet to chill on punny entendres that oscillate between cringe and brilliant, like the one he drops on “Go Up”: “Brooks Garth/This country’s backwards.”\n","short":"A onetime lightning rod lightens up."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/w-ld/1808014803","playParams":{"id":"1808014803","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1gFQ6dGFvpDsHmnr4bPbTV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808014803/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"683622116","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/683622116?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751040946356}}},"1808020400":{"id":"1808020400","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808020400?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Mainstream Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=330082948-166619922","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Le grand Michel [A Journey With Michel Legrand]","artistName":"Giovanni Ceccarelli & Ferruccio Spinetti","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7c/32/7f/7c327f20-8f5d-d496-1fdb-b519989fa2f8/3770000294439_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdbf15","textColor2":"f1cda8","textColor4":"c6aa89","textColor1":"fae716","bgColor":"1b1f11","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/le-grand-michel-a-journey-with-michel-legrand/1808020400","playParams":{"id":"1808020400","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2za9EE6hGweMgMZQeJOToh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808020400/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"330082948","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/330082948?l=en-US"},{"id":"166619922","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/166619922?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751026029500}}},"1808035808":{"id":"1808035808","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808035808?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aitch/280038430","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/07/bd/60/07bd6087-7c32-1413-a041-8ec0f113abdf/6bfb35bc-43a7-4b27-9be0-a33020272fa8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a79892","textColor2":"dca592","textColor4":"b18779","textColor1":"d0bab2","bgColor":"040f13","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/50/fc/ab/50fcab72-a3a4-d49d-4a6b-4955a7667cd7/b5d74c10-da6d-441b-b109-fc8be46a37c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ddae4b","textColor2":"f3b4ac","textColor4":"d89b93","textColor1":"facc52","bgColor":"6a3a31","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d5/2b/d7/d52bd764-6210-877a-f7be-d98f3fa126cf/ed4aa185-e0d5-42d6-aacc-7201c42de1fb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e6afa9","textColor2":"f1a299","textColor4":"e0887e","textColor1":"f8d3cf","bgColor":"9c2112","hasP3":true}},"name":"4","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Aitch","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/28/92/a1/2892a1b5-dc5f-bad3-3698-46c75f7a3767/199350349614.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"350b08","textColor2":"160403","textColor4":"3e0d09","textColor1":"0b0201","bgColor":"e03022","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Since 2018, I brought life to the game. From the M-Town, Europe, States, even Zante. Cooking up with Sheeran, on stage with Ashanti,” Aitch raps on “STRAIGHT RHYMEZ 2.”\n\nThat’s one of many typically confident bars that Aitch—born Harrison Armstrong—spits on his second album, <i>4</i>. The Mancunian rapper has seen a shift in the landscape since 2022’s <i>Close to Home</i>, and <i>4</i> reflects that. “Music’s changed a lot since album one and I think I tried to find the balance of not trying to look like the sickest rapper in the world, but then over-confusing people,” he tells Apple Music’s Dotty. “I’ve found the middle ground of making a three-and-a-half-minute song into a two-minute song, also getting my point across.”\n\nIt’s an efficiency that extends to the largely sinewy beats that back his verses across the album. Aitch sees <i>4</i> as a move away from more heartfelt, personal tracks of the past like “My G,” his Ed Sheeran-assisted tribute to his little sister. This is the sound of a man who’s given away a lot and is now reaping the rewards and having fun with it.\n\n“I feel like my last album was a little bit more vulnerable, you got a side to me that no one knew. Before, I was that guy that was just rapping about partying all the time and I was sick of being that person. So then I made <i>Close to Home</i> with the thought process of: ‘Let people get to know Harrison, maybe do the “My G” tune.’ This one now is like: ‘Here’s a load of sick rap tunes. See you later,’” he says.\n\nWith such an accomplished album—and linkups with AJ Tracey (“TEST”), Tamera (“LOCKED IN”), and Anne-Marie (“LUV?”)—it’s hard to believe Aitch still has anything left to prove.\n\n“I’ve always believed in my little sauce,” he says. “I wanted to just channel a little bit of that old-school energy and kind of give people a feeling of rap and hip-hop. I’ve never really doubted myself.”","short":"Aitch on his second album: “Here’s a load of sick rap tunes.

Ask those same fans what their favorite Keke Palmer song is and you’d be lucky to get any answer at all. To be fair to Palmer—and those fans—the headline-making actor, singer, and media personality has put a lot more energy into building her cinematic catalog than her musical one. Which is a shame, because as her third album, <i>Just Keke</i>, verifies, Palmer’s own story is as interesting as the ones she’s brought to the big screen.\n\nWhich isn’t to say the album doesn’t owe a lot to her other passion. It’s rife with nods to Palmer’s love for television, including interludes featuring the music of sitcoms <i>Moesha</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i>, and <i>Living Single</i>. The three are framing devices for Palmer’s adult life which, much like the TV shows, has featured calamitous adventures in career, love, and growing older with grace.\n\nIndeed, Palmer addresses the dissolution of her relationship with her child’s father numerous times across <i>Just Keke</i>. It’s a story tabloid readers were invited into when the father of Palmer’s son took to social media to express his disdain for an objectively tender moment during a 2023 Las Vegas USHER concert when the “Confessions” singer made a show of serenading Palmer. <i>Just Keke</i>’s “My Confession” returns the favor, borrowing both the singer’s cadence and candor. Elsewhere, Palmer is overjoyed if not at complete peace with her life and the direction it’s taken. She’s earned her status as a new media darling—see “Amnesia” for a reference to her infamous “Sorry to this man” quip—and as she points out on “Ripples,” she comes from great stock. The fact is, Palmer was built to strive, and with or without the adulation, being <i>Just Keke</i> is enough.","short":"One of Hollywood’s most beloved comedic heroines tells her own story."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/just-keke/1808551476","playParams":{"id":"1808551476","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4qewouaN4cljIXNhTK3SPV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808551476/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"136765925","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/136765925?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751039730998}}},"1809000175":{"id":"1809000175","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809000175?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yungblud/213048599","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/df/9e/c8/df9ec80c-017c-855f-d839-fe2f6ae1495d/8986b8e8-e227-4f93-99df-d0b97f3dd7c9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202020","textColor2":"100f0f","textColor4":"282827","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"878987","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1d/7a/c2/1d7ac267-63cb-758e-cd9c-770af4e04514/7dcb0612-bc1b-42ed-bec9-e08a99382c45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2a2a2a","textColor2":"1d1d1d","textColor4":"3e3e3e","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"c0c0c0","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a2/6d/50/a26d50f1-3f06-d088-d1f2-c726121a6169/4ca443e2-1b4e-494b-982a-ced8eaf67379.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7b7b7","textColor2":"c9c9c9","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"e1e1e1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"Idols","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"YUNGBLUD","artwork":{"width":3780,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a3/3e/db/a33edb69-e698-02d9-e953-b9165a64f4c5/25UMGIM43189.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3780,"textColor3":"383838","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"4a4a4a","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"f9f9f9","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Would this be the album you would expect me to make next?” Dominic Harrison, better known as perky pop punk YUNGBLUD, asks Apple Music. “Fuck no.” \n\n<i>Idols</i> is an ambitious, swaggering affair, from the nine-minute-long opener “Hello Heaven, Hello” to the heart-on-a-ripped-open-sleeve opus “Supermoon.” YUNGBLUD actually started making <i>Idols</i>, his fourth studio album, after his second, 2020’s <i>weird!</i>, but the timing wasn’t right. So he made 2022’s <i>YUNGBLUD</i> instead. Now, it’s time for <i>Idols</i>. “This is not an album for your head, it’s an album for your chest,” he says. “It’s five-dimensional. Limitless. Everyone’s had a lot of opinions about YUNGBLUD, which I think is beautiful, good and bad, because that means my art’s doing something to people. But I really want to show that I could orchestrate and I have imagination to use horns, brass, strings, and classical elements.”\n\n<i>Idols</i> swings from big, bold stadium rock to Britpop and melancholy (with guitar solos aplenty), so he’s not expecting listeners to find instant gratification. “I want this to be an album you put on every week for the rest of your life, because that’s what I do with Fleetwood Mac’s <i>Rumours</i> or Pink Floyd’s <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>. I don’t just rinse a song that’s popping on TikTok for a month and then become bored of it.” Read on as he takes you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Hello Heaven, Hello”</b>\n“‘Hello Heaven, Hello’ is the overture to <i>Idols</i>. This was the last song that came. Originally, the album started with ‘Idols Pt. I’ and it wasn’t good enough yet. It was a nine out of 10 and I was like, ‘We need a spectacle. We need a prelude.’ It’s the bridge between the past and now: It’s how we arrive at people understanding why I made this album. I start frail and afraid. It’s like, ‘Hello. Are you out there? Do you know me? Do you love me? Do you hate me?’ Every time I’m on stage, I see the negative people who don’t like me, right in front of me.”\n\n<b>“Idols Pt. I”</b>\n“This song is about me being a kid and having ambition and dreams. We used to play as kings, queens, rock stars, and nurses, but then we rationalize everything and let our light go out. The whole concept of the album is it’s not an homage to my idols, it’s actually me turning away from them. We recorded the album in a haunted old Tetley’s brewery in Leeds [about 35 miles from YUNGBLUD’s birthplace, Doncaster]. I had no issues with the ghosts, I made friends with them. There’s actually one moment in this song where it goes [mimics woo-like ghost sound], and that’s unexplainable.”\n\n<b>“Lovesick Lullaby”</b>\n“I always wanted to do Britpop in eyeliner—I was obsessed with Trent Reznor [Nine Inch Nails] and Brian Molko [Placebo], then The Stone Roses and Oasis. Here, I set up the listener going like, ‘This song’s a party.’ Before you know it, that pint of lager that you’re holding as you bop your head is up in the air and you’re jumping up and down. The biggest thing I’ve learned with writing is that I’ve always told the listener what the song’s about, so I wanted to make this more ambiguous. And I wanted to set up the idea that this album is going to twist and turn through multiple genres because that’s who I am.”\n\n<b>“Zombie”</b>\n“I’ve had this song for five years. This was the album that I wanted to do, but I don’t think I was ready for it. ‘Zombie’ is about being afraid to turn to others for help. The fear of being a burden. The fear of appearing weak or ugly. For the video, I wanted to do a direct portrayal of what a nurse goes through, because we take them for granted—they’re so understaffed and underfunded, and the NHS [National Health Service] is a bedrock for why our country is great. I needed to find a great British artist who could carry that story with truth and authenticity. That was Florence Pugh. I think she’s our best export at the minute.”\n\n<b>“The Greatest Parade”</b>\n“This was one of the emotionally hardest songs to write, along with ‘Change,’ so that’s why they’re both in the middle. I would see people outgrow YUNGBLUD or be mean on the internet, but I felt stagnated in my growth because I never had time to make an album like this. I never had time to stop. You write with songwriters, what happens is seven different people a week have an opinion of what you should do next. Everything’s great because they want a cut. Mediocre art can fly because you made it. Fuck that.”\n\n<b>“Change”</b>\n“The reason why I put this in the middle is because if I didn’t call the album <i>Idols</i>, I would have called it ‘Change.’ This has been the biggest transition point of my life and this song was the fundamental moment that I really faced myself and realized that I was not right. I think, being a ‘famous’ rock star, when you go into a recording session, people hang on your every word. But when Mati (Schwartz, longtime collaborator) and I are writing together, he’ll say, ‘No, you can do better than that.’ This was written before ‘Hello Heaven, Hello.’ It was midnight, and he’s like, ‘You’ve not let me see you yet.’ It’s about the words that I let get to me.”\n\n<b>“Monday Murder”</b>\n“‘Monday Murder’ is about apathy. It’s about everything going on in the world and the lack of unity and coexistence. We’d rather judge than accept and we’d rather fight than live in peace. It’s about how we watch the world go by instead of looking at each other and celebrating our differences. We wake up and we compare ourselves to 15 different people before we even have our breakfast. I love having a fucking dinner party debate. That doesn’t mean I love you less as a person if your political agenda or views are different to mine. You’re going to teach me something, I’m going to teach you something.”\n\n<b>“Ghosts”</b>\n“This is probably my favorite song to sing on the album because I can’t believe it’s mine. It’s the hardest vocal in the world, but I really wanted to show off my vocals on this album. Lewis Capaldi said to me, ‘Stop fucking rapping. Fucking sing on this album.’ Again, this one just poured out of me. I’m standing at the edge of my mountain with war drums ready to charge. It’s about realizing your own mortality on the banks of the River Thames after a night out at six in the morning. It felt like a stadium-rock song, but I wanted to push the boundaries of imagination, so I was like, ‘Do you remember <i>The King and I</i>?’ Then I added the three-minute outro.”\n\n<b>“Fire”</b>\n“‘Fire’ is about sex and aggression and that feeling you get when you’re about to be punched in the face or about to be taken into a bedroom. I was really wanting to explore my sexual side—I think that’s why my whole album campaign’s been topless. At 27, I feel comfortable as a man now and I really wanted to feel that sense of adrenaline with this record. It’s about sex and fighting and animalistic humanity: the fundamentals of why we feel anything at all. Why do we love, why do we hate, why do we fight, why do we fuck?”\n\n<b>“War”</b>\n“This is about people trying to dim my light. I’ve always been too ‘this’ or too ‘that,’ or people wish I would have stayed in one place. I’m so emotional, I’m so raw, and I’m so gushy. I wish I could be something else, but I just can’t. It’s been this dichotomy within me to be what the world wants me to be. This is also about that feeling when you become forgotten by somebody. You meant so much to me, but you forgot me so quickly. It’s hard to deal with.”\n\n<b>“Idols Pt. II”</b>\n“This is a little reminder of what the album’s about. It’s where the protagonist—you, me—this is where we start to win. After everything, after all the war, after all the internal struggle, after all the change, after all the rejection, after all the pain, we realize that only you will know what it’s like to be alone in your own life. It solidifies the message of the album: you have to be the idol in your own life. Stop giving other people the credit. Which leads into ‘Supermoon.’”\n\n<b>“Supermoon”</b>\n“This is the first song I’ve put out that I didn’t write. Mati wrote this for me, and he kept it a secret for five years. He’s been there since the beginning: He saw a 15-year-old kid come into his studio, who he kicked out because he had nothing to say. I came back a year later as YUNGBLUD. It was never a fucking character. I was a 19-year-old in pink socks from the north of England, pissed off about Brexit. That’s how that monster was born.

Lyrically, Spencer Smith is equally vulnerable, like on the aforementioned opener, where she rummages through her feelings to help explain why she feels so particularly shitty on such a gorgeous day. Her makeup is applied perfectly; not a hair is out of place. And yet? Sadness prevails. \n\nSpencer Smith spends the album finding ways to be okay while not being okay, like on the indie pop cut “bridesmaid.” Here, she reckons with the deterioration of a friendship, cleverly contextualizing such heartbreak by wishing her ex-bestie could be standing by her side on her wedding day, now that she’s “finally found the man that I adore.” On <i>THE ART OF BEING A

Album","standard":"Even though HAIM named their fourth studio album—and first since 2020’s <i>Women in Music, Pt. III</i>—<i>I quit</i>, the trio of sisters aren’t quitters. “Quitting can be looked at as giving up in normal circumstances,” bassist/vocalist Este Haim tells Apple Music. “We look at it as a new beginning and betting on yourself. We quit things that don’t serve us anymore.” \n\nThe follow-up to their Grammy-nominated opus takes its name from a scene in 1996’s <i>That Thing You Do!</i> where the band’s leader announces his departure by snapping his fingers and sing-talking the words “I quit”—a move the women use regularly as an inside joke. “One day, we were checking the mic and we did it again,” Este adds. “We were like, ‘Wait, should we name our album <i>I quit</i>? Say that again.’ ‘Wait a minute. Should we?’ It took on a life of its own.”\n\nProduced by Rostam and lead vocalist/guitarist Danielle Haim, the band’s latest takes parting shots at the people in their lives who have seemingly done them wrong. (And with single artwork inspired by paparazzi pics—most famously for “Relationships,” a cheeky take on the iconic post-divorce Nicole Kidman photo—the Haims aren’t just speaking to their romantic follies but the celebrity and industry machine at large.) Appropriately, the opening track “Gone” samples the George Michael smash “Freedom! ’90,” setting the tone for the album’s message: liberation from anything and everything that may have restrained them. “I’ll do whatever I want/I’ll see who I wanna see/I’ll fuck off whenever I want/I’ll be whatever I need,” Danielle intones. \n\nTheir songs range from groovy (“Down to be wrong”) to nostalgic (“Take me back”), dreamy (“Lucky stars”), and bluesy (“Blood on the street”). “All over me” feels straight out of a ’90s rom-com montage, and “The farm” gives off a Sheryl Crow-infused vibe. The contemplative “Everybody’s trying to figure me out”—co-written by Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon—also offers a meditation on self-acceptance: “Everybody’s got their own decisions, and I know that I’ve got mine/And I’ll be fine.” \n\nUltimately, though, the sibling rockers see their new work as fit for the stage, and that’s important to how they create their music, Este explains: “We always think about our live show when we are writing songs, because that’s really where our heart is—playing live.” \n\n<b>“Gone”</b>\nAlana Haim: “‘Gone’ was actually the last song that we wrote for this album. We were listening to the album and it felt like we really needed an introduction to the world of <i>I quit</i>. Before ‘Gone’ was written, it felt like it was going into, it needed that breath of, ‘Okay, we’re starting the album.’ We started with that guitar line—I think Danielle had this—and it kind of just came out. I think every songwriter would say this: There’s this spiritual muse that comes into your brain sometimes, and we love that muse. We pray for that muse to kind of let us be the vessel. But we were kind of hanging on this one note, and Danielle just kind of blurted out, ‘Can I have your attention, please?’ And we were like, ‘Oh, we’re starting now.’”\n\n<b>“All over me”</b>\nAH: “Maybe other people are very open with their siblings. We are not! I don’t want to know! But when we were making ‘All over me,’ we had fallen into this time where we were all single and we were all having very different experiences, but they were all coming kind of from the same point of view: We were all having these one-night stands and we were all having these crazy-ass stories about these one-night stands. ‘All over me’ kind of just blossomed from that time.”\n\n<b>“Relationships”</b>\nDanielle Haim: “This was one of the hardest songs to crack—and honestly, there’s always one on every album. It’s always kind of like our favorite one. ‘The Wire’ was very tough to crack; ‘Want You Back’ was super tough to crack; ‘The Steps,’ super, super tough to crack. This is in the same lineage as those. It went through a bunch of different versions, but it’s one of my favorite songs we’ve ever written.”\n\n<b>“Down to be wrong”</b>\nDH: “We knew we were writing songs in the studio with Rostam and he’s always so supportive of searching for different sounds. I know we were like, ‘Yeah, we’re making an album,’ but it wasn’t until we wrote that song where we were like, ‘Okay, wow, we have one super down.’ Not to sound weird, but it was just that was the one where we were like, ‘Holy shit, I do think we have a great song here.’ And when we got that chorus, I think it kind of just opened up something within all of us.”\nAH: “When we wrote that chorus of just screaming, we were visualizing just playing it live and screaming with everybody and getting that weight off your shoulders. It was a very cathartic day in the studio.”\n\n<b>“Take me back”</b>\nDH: “Our friend Tobias Jesso Jr. was in the area when we were working on this in the studio. Honestly, we didn’t plan on writing anything; we just wanted to show him an update of what we had been making. He’s from Vancouver, and we somehow got on this conversation about high school, and what we were doing during high school.”\nEste Haim: “I’m just going to say, to be fair, all three of us went to the same high school, so we don’t really have any perspective on what it was like to go to school anywhere else.”\nAH: “That day, it was filled with so much joy and this nostalgic feeling of reminiscing about that funny time.”\n\n<b>“Love you right”</b>\nDH: “That was one of the first songs we wrote. ‘Love you right’ came from a drumbeat. I feel like we needed to have this kind of moody, really in-the-pocket drum, like roomy-sounding. I had this whole vision in my head.”\nAH: “We’re extremely inspired by the drums. A lot of these songs were birthed out of Danielle cooking on the drums.”\n\n<b>“The farm”</b>\nAH: “It was a somber day in the studio. When we made this album, we were all across the board extremely happy that we were single. But then there are those moments where you have to be self-reflective and you’re in your home alone and you realize that you’re a human being that has emotions, and you’re looking around your house where there’s no noise. You’re just sitting in silence and you realize: You know what? I’m alone. ‘The farm’ is that kind of song where you’re reflecting on that time of being alone. Learning to be okay alone with yourself is the most important lesson you can learn just being alive.”\n\n<b>“Lucky stars”</b>\nDH: “It’s a very optimistic song. There were some really amazing times through these last couple of years where we were meeting new people. There were some that just fully came into our lives, maybe for not that long, but it was truly so fun and inspiring. It just was like, wait, this person’s amazing. It’s reflecting on putting yourself out there and then also wondering why some people come into your life and being so thankful for that, but also just kind of being like, ‘Wow, I’m so happy that I met this person.’ Is it in the stars or what, I wonder, or is this just kind of happening?”\n\n<b>“Million years”</b>\nAH: “Saying, ‘I’ll carry you on my back even if it takes a million years,’ to me, that is kind of like an ode to my siblings. Anytime I’m feeling low, I’m so lucky that I was born with my two best friends. In [my] low points, I get to call my siblings and they know exactly what to say. It’s an ode to anyone in your life that you’ll have forever, that has your back.”\n\n<b>“Everybody’s trying to figure me out”</b>\nDH: “That song’s really close to my heart. It’s probably my favorite one on the album. It started after a bit of a panic attack after tour. I just remember sitting down and writing, ‘Everybody’s trying to figure me out and that’s all right,’ which I think, at the time, I lost track of a bunch of people and got really in my head. I used the whole song as a bit of a mantra to remind myself that I’m okay, and you think you’re going to die, but you’re not going to die. When I’m having a bit of a panic moment, it’s a really helpful mantra.”\n\n<b>“Try to feel my pain”</b>\nDH: “It’s a bit like holding up a mirror, maybe to yourself, and maybe a bit to your partner, and realizing that sometimes you can feel yourself a bit numb within a relationship. And I think that’s a bit like putting everything on the table and putting a mirror up to it.”\n\n<b>“Spinning”</b>\nAH: “The first song that I’ve ever sang lead on—so daunting! I had just started dating someone, and I was so fucking obsessed with that ooey-gooey first four days where you are falling down the rabbit hole. You’re getting calls and you see their name and you get all butterflies and all those ooey-gooey first moments. The relationship lasted very little time after I wrote the song. I fall head first into every relationship; I really throw all caution to the wind. The man that it’s about has no idea. And in the grand scheme of things it was a very insignificant part of my life, but for that moment, it was great. I wish I could bottle the feeling, but it’s now bottled in a song.”\n\n<b>“Cry”</b>\nEH: “This is the first song I’ve sung lead on by myself—like Alana said, super daunting. I fashion myself a bass player first and maybe a singer after that. When we came into the studio [that day], I was crying, which is not a rare occurrence. I tend to feel things—maybe not deeper than most people, but I’m a pretty sensitive bitch. I was with someone for almost five years and we left on completely amicable terms, but even when that happens, you’re still mourning the loss of something, almost like having a best friend and then all of a sudden they’re gone. I was talking about it in the studio, and I said his name, and I just burst into tears. I can’t remember what sister it was—it might even have been Rostam—but someone was like, ‘We should probably talk about this with music. Let’s harness this feeling while it’s fresh.’ I had been bottling up a lot of what I was feeling in order to just survive. Hopefully I’ll be able to get through it on tour. Even when I was hearing it in the studio, I just starting crying. So hopefully I’ll get my shit together and get tear duct surgery before that and just plug them up.”\n\n<b>“Blood on the street”</b>\nAH: “On our first album, we had ‘The Wire.’ On our third album, we had ‘Hallelujah.’ And I think when it came to ‘Blood on the street,’ we really wanted a song where we each sing a verse. And me and my siblings grew up jamming together. I will say, we were in a very interesting place mentally when we wrote that song, but it was like this feeling of just being like, to be frank, ‘Fuck you for fucking me over.’ We really did get all of our aggression out. We’ve been playing it live, and that song live is the biggest release.”\n\n<b>“Now it’s time”</b>\nAH: “We were just kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall when we were making this. Obviously we love U2; we interpolated their guitar riff from ‘Numb.’ It was an exchange because U2, they have a song on <i>Songs of Experience</i> called ‘Lights of Home’ where they interpolated Danielle’s guitar riff from ‘My Song 5.’ This album really is this beautiful journey of self-exploration for us, of feeling comfortable in your own skin and being okay with just being with yourself. In this song, we’re standing on this solid ground with our six feet of being like, ‘We have now given you every emotion that we felt like in this chapter of our lives—and now we’re on the other end

all-original tracks from Ed Sheeran, Burna Boy, ROSÉ, and many more.","standard":"There’s no singular demographic within FORMULA 1 fandom. The sport has exploded in recent years, with TV coverage and social media making it accessible and obsessed over by folks of every background, every age. (And that’s before you even consider that the championship travels to more than 20 countries each season.) <i>F1® The Album</i>—the soundtrack to Apple Original Film <i>F1® The Movie</i>—follows suit, featuring original songs from artists spanning both geographic and musical spectrums.\n\nThe soundtrack’s diversity isn’t just there for the sake of it—it sets the tone for the film’s exhilarating, emotional ride. Leave the on-track action (and sounds) to the cars and their colossal engines. It’s the in-between moments where this music comes in: the drama, the tension, the romance, the overcoming.\n\nRoddy Ricch’s “Underdog” is all bravado and swagger, a shout-out to the underdogs from atop the rapper’s perch. It feels like the musical embodiment of young gun Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the talented rookie with a bright future—and plenty of hurdles—ahead. Meanwhile, the country rock of Chris Stapleton’s “Bad as I Used To Be” perhaps best depicts the rebellious cool of Brad Pitt’s Sonny Hayes, the rule-breaking racer who returns to F1® some 30 years after a near-fatal crash.\n\nElsewhere, Ed Sheeran goes full hard rock on “Drive,” belting it out over chunky guitars and big, brash drums (courtesy of John Mayer and Dave Grohl, no less). K-pop star ROSÉ delivers a passionate, lovelorn ballad with “Messy,” RAYE provides hearty soul via “Grandma Calls the Boy Bad,” and Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers goes old-school with “Baja California,” rapping in Spanish over a 1991 Black Sheep sample.\n\nDance music reigns throughout the rest of the soundtrack, making it every bit as fitting for a heaving dance floor or a speedy highway joyride. Darkoo’s “Give Me Love” has a sweetly tropical bounce, Burna Boy’s “Don’t Let Me Drown” is smooth and tender, and Obongjayar’s “Gasoline” is ultra-funky and flirtatious. EDM meets rap on “OMG!” by Dutch legend Tiësto (who makes a cameo in the film) and Sexyy Red, while the vibe goes dark and sweaty with the thumping house of PAWSA’s “DOUBLE C” and Peggy Gou’s “D.A.N.C.E.” As with FORMULA 1 itself, there’s something for everyone on <i>F1® The Album</i>. And that’s what makes it such a thrill."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/f1-the-album/1810796698","playParams":{"id":"1810796698","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0OHCKctKPM4x8TIndhgXYb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810796698/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751040901965}}},"1810905299":{"id":"1810905299","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810905299?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lorde/602767352","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/44/c6/01/44c6019d-836e-4def-7a23-5b135de10509/9d386a9b-d800-4731-b013-19b1a214c2b0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e3cfd0","textColor2":"b8d8eb","textColor4":"afb8c8","textColor1":"f9f5f5","bgColor":"8c393f","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9a/dc/d2/9adcd242-abba-169e-50c7-ae0e010d3942/620e0cdd-fbeb-419f-a083-244c3406149b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b2c8da","textColor2":"8ec5f0","textColor4":"7babd1","textColor1":"d3e9fb","bgColor":"304456","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/53/27/9e/53279e73-31cc-6149-619f-18a66308531a/767cb054-9098-4dc9-9654-c35744279df6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"989ea7","textColor2":"afbac6","textColor4":"8d96a0","textColor1":"bdc4cf","bgColor":"050607","hasP3":true}},"name":"Virgin","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lorde","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/72/3c/07/723c07a7-4ff6-b052-927d-6997fff13676/25UMGIM60545.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"011e29","textColor2":"151616","textColor4":"112d38","textColor1":"010204","bgColor":"008bbd","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The cover art for <i>Virgin</i>—an X-ray of a pelvis with a visible IUD—was a far cry from that of Lorde’s bright, beachy third album, 2021’s <i>Solar Power</i>, whose sun-soaked, jasmine-scented songs drew from Laurel Canyon folk and Y2K soft rock. Looking back, that album’s free-spirited imagery was a bit idealistic—a projection of how the New Zealand native turned New Yorker wished she could be. Her fourth album, as she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, is a portrait of the 28-year-old singer as she is, without edits or apologies: “Kind of like a photo of yourself that you don’t love, but captures something true about you.”\n\nThe resulting songs, written between 2023 and 2025, are forthcoming and visceral, trading <i>Solar Power</i>’s New Age-chill for beats you can feel in your gut. (It’s her first album since her 2013 debut not co-written and -produced by Jack Antonoff; instead, she shared production duties with the LA-based electronic musician Jim-E Stack.) Surrealist introspection gives way to throbbing bass on opening track “Hammer,” where a walk down Canal Street ripples with psychedelic visions. “I had just come off my birth control, and I could not believe how I was feeling,” Lorde told Lowe about the song’s inception. “Everything was pure possibility. That first sound feels like it’s coming from a very guttural place in the body. My sister said, ‘It sounds like it’s coming from your womb.’”\n\nCue the aura readings, 3 am cigarettes, broken mirrors, pregnancy tests, ego death. On “Man of the Year” and “Favourite Daughter,” questions beget more questions on the subject of what it means to be a woman, and moreover, a woman who’s now been famous for nearly half her life. The latter is at once a love letter to her mother and a meditation on being a teenager thrust into global pop stardom. “There’s been this dynamic for the last 10 to 12 years—and then further back—of wanting so badly to be loved, and to get this approval, and to be the favorite,” she told Lowe. “And it was really moving to me how, even as I was singing this song about my foremost idol and the person who I think is the most amazing in the world, I was also singing about what a crazy thing it is to have happened to you, what happened to me at 16.”\n\nNow the superstar finds freedom in the freefall: “I’ve been up on the pedestal/But tonight I just want to fall,” she sings on the shuffling “Shapeshifter.” “I still don’t know what happens when you put out a record that is like this,” she admitted about the unfiltered portrait <i>Virgin</i> presents. But in its full transparency, she arrives at something like peace.\n","short":"A self-portrait with no edits or apologies, but plenty of questions."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/virgin/1810905299","playParams":{"id":"1810905299","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/28bHj2enHkHVFLwuWmkwlQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810905299/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"602767352","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/602767352?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751038478779}}},"1811179601":{"id":"1811179601","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811179601?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["African","Music","Afrobeats"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/olamide/389401008","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/08/33/60/08336006-0bce-fcc4-133b-9c44d3d4b371/Job63a7e384-e5a2-4237-b404-5402a2b790e2-195171693-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382429531_2212015295-Time1750286358539.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cabfa0","textColor2":"decea2","textColor4":"c1b491","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"504f4d","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/25/da/52/25da525a-2aba-2946-d4bb-f15e99e37105/cc6821c1-23d0-4de3-87d5-45cb871fe66d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ceaeae","textColor2":"99b7f2","textColor4":"8794c3","textColor1":"f2d8d8","bgColor":"3f0706","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/aa/8a/52/aa8a5228-d88a-1987-650e-1c8883f094d4/Job5268f358-75e5-4b95-bf1b-ad83f2b0a60f-195171694-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382429530_2212015296-Time1750287976378.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d5c197","textColor2":"edd0a4","textColor4":"cdb592","textColor1":"f8dfab","bgColor":"4a4a4a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a1/ca/c2/a1cac247-5ee3-147a-29d8-b87a3eaf4c1c/915e5241-6f8f-4e7d-814c-25550c7b8cbc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"201e19","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"201e19","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"938972","hasP3":true}},"name":"Olamidé","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Olamide","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ba/6d/fb/ba6dfb0f-3eb5-d02a-79f6-6a4483231e13/199316074352_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5b794","textColor2":"d9c9a1","textColor4":"bcae8f","textColor1":"e5d3a7","bgColor":"464646","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Since first making waves in 2011, Nigerian singer, rapper, and YBNL label head Olamide has released 10 albums, numerous hits, and shepherded the careers of chart-toppers such as Asake, Young Jonn, Fireboy DML, and Lil Kesh. He hasn’t restricted himself to Afropop, fùjí, rap, or R&B; he has been an Afropop innovator, with a voice which he variously modulates across genres, a knack for indelible hooks that reflects his fùjí music heritage, and a non-hierarchical collaborative spirit. \n\nNow, with his 11th album, 2025’s self-titled <i>Olamidé</i>—which means “wealth” in Yoruba—the artist turns inward without being indulgent, the focus never straying from the songmaking even when the source of some songs is personal and private. “I name things how I feel them,” he tells Apple Music. “I wanted to create more mellow sounds for listeners who prefer laid‐back tracks over heavy drums. Knowing there’s fans who love that keeps me motivated to perfect each record.” \n\nWith the clear direction in mind, Olamide sat with a coterie of trusted producers to more closely align his feelings and intentions with the final output, though happenstance played a part: “On 99 percent of the songs, I sat in the studio with my producers, explained my ideas and the fan reaction I wanted, then we built the sound. Three tracks, ‘Billionaires Club,’ ‘Duro,’ and ‘Luvaluvah,’ came from P.Priime without any conversation—he just delivered smart beats,” asserts Olamide.\n\nHis goal for the listening experience was clear: “From the jump, the idea was to make a body of work that aligns with my craftsmanship and sonically breaks the norms. I wanted the album to feel like entering a jazz bar; an immersive experience where everything tightens up together, not a rollercoaster of random highs and lows.” The result is a suite of songs which avoid maudlin introspection and showy rapping, as though he has no more points to prove, striking a balance between confident songcraft and a lifelong habit for listening and experimentation. “Growing up, I absorbed everything. I eat, breathe, and sleep music,” he recalls. “[Most] of the time I’m online, discovering new sounds and genres. I rarely relisten to my own tracks, except during mixing and mastering. Life is a teacher, and as long as you stay open‑minded, you realize there’s always more to learn.” Below, Olamide talks through key songs on the album. \n\n<b>“Prelude” (feat. Fxrtune)</b>\n“So Fxrtune is someone you all have to watch out for. He’s going to be the next big thing. By the way, that’s my brother.”\n\n<b>“Hasibunallah”</b>\n“At the end of the day Arabic is just a language, you know? I grew up in a Muslim family, and Muslims obviously speak Arabic, but I’ve met a couple of Christian friends also who are from the Middle East, that speak Arabic as well. So it’s just a language. ‘Hasibunallah’ is strictly talking about the journey so far, and how much God has been there for me, and holding me down and helping me actualize my dreams and everything. And I clear whoever is in doubt or whoever cares to know that I’m still with my God, and I’m still not bothered by nothing, and I’m still always going to remain successful no matter what.”\n\n<b>“Kai!” (with Wizkid)</b>\n“Why do I rate Wiz? To be honest, I think it’s his approach to everything—from his vocals to his writing to his approach to life and everything. He’s just an all-rounder. He’s got his stuff together, everything on point. And it’s very rare to come across people like that, that’s 1000 percent certain about what they want in life and how they want to be perceived and how they want to roll, how they want to deliver their stuff, how they want people to feel when they hear their stuff and all that. That’s very rare.”\n\n<b>“Luvaluvah”</b>\n“We had some pushback from clearing a Lauryn Hill sample, but that was not an issue, because I totally understand it. So we came up with something else entirely to replace that [a sample of Hill’s 1998 track, ‘Can’t Take My Eyes off of You (I Love You Baby)’] and it’s sounding very good. I’ve been a big fan since forever and her music’s had so much impact in my life. Every time I listen to Lauryn’s music, it feels like a slice of heaven to me. And whenever I’m down or want solace and I need something to just keep me going, I listen to Lauryn. So I am just so much of a fan and I didn’t even know when I ended up sampling her, because I’ve always been so into Lauryn Hill, so into her music.”\n\n<b>“Billionaires Club” (feat. Wizkid, Darkoo)</b>\n“Myself and Wiz, we agreed from the jump that we should try to get a third person on the record. And I reached out to a couple of people, but Darkoo came through with that verse. I’ve listened to her over and over, and I’ve realized that she’s got some finesse. It’s one thing to love making music, then it’s another thing to have a finesse to it. Darkoo’s got some finesse to it. She can easily write on anything.”\n\n<b>“Duro”</b>\n“An inspiration for this song was fùjí music which often feels like a musical diary: no single hook, just hooks everywhere. Each four‐line section could be someone else’s chorus. It’s simple, relatable, and even if you don’t understand every word, you feel the vibe.”\n\n<b>“Indika” (feat. Dr. Dre, SPINALL)</b>\n“For me, making a song with Dr. Dre goes way beyond a stamp. This whole Afrobeats-to-the-world thing, if you’d asked us 15 or 20 years ago, none of us thought it’d be like this. Growing up watching mandem on MTV Base, then making music with them is madness. I never thought a day like this would come. It’s too crazy to put everything together now. Absurd. I have SPINALL to thank for the introduction.”\n\n<b>“1 Shot”</b>\n“I was a musician before I was a rapper, but rap gave me my platform. I respect rap and believe finesse is key.”\n\n<b>“99” (feat. Daecolm) (with Seyi Vibez, Asake, Young Jonn)</b>\n“While recording the album, Young Jonn came by my camp and played me a record. He wasn’t feeling it yet, so I asked if I could take it. I added my verse, then recruited Asake, Seyi Vibez, and Daecolm, keeping everyone in the loop so it never felt competitive. Asake sent his verse the next day; Seyi Vibez sent his after I explained the direction; Daecolm recorded immediately. Given Daecolm’s house music credentials, he was perfect for the vibe. The phrase ‘party like ’99’ is just a nostalgic vibe. None of us were really partying like that then, but it’s a feeling everyone connects with.”\n\n<b>“Ruba”</b>\n“If people think it’s a love song, it is and that was the intention. I don’t shy away from making love songs. I’m only human. I wanted to create something lovable that resonates with female fans and shows my vulnerable side: that I can fall in love and go the extra mile. It comes from practice and experience.”\n\n<b>“Rain” (feat. Popcaan)</b>\n“Growing up, rain was something my friends and I adored. We’d dance and play under it, and it felt beautiful. That changed when I visited a friend whose house would flood whenever it rained. Their roof leaked and their bed floated. I didn’t realize rain’s darker side until then. Now it’s bittersweet: It can calm you, ease your pain, but it can also bring hardship to others. That duality inspired the theme of ‘Rain.’ I featured Popcaan to lean into the track’s reggae-tinged sonics. The record itself was also inspired by a Bob Marley and Lauryn Hill collaboration I heard years ago [1999’s ‘Turn Your Lights Down Low’]. Its mood and message shaped my own vision for this song.”\n\n<b>“Paris” (feat. Fadi)</b>\n“I flew to Paris for fittings and meetings, then Ibiza to turn up, and Miami too. That mix of locations is like fùjí music’s diary style, touching on different experiences. ‘Paris’ captures a week of fittings, meetings, and parties; just me sharing my journey.”\n\n<b>“Lalakipo”</b>\n“‘Lalakipo’ is Yoruba slang. If your ex isn’t active or solid, he’s a ‘lalakipo.’ I wanted an unexpected hook, not the usual bounce. The beat sounded like a banger, so I crafted something unusual to match.”\n\n<b>“Stronger” (feat. Boj)</b>\n“‘Stronger’ celebrates independent women chasing dreams and living their best lives. It’s my way of saying, ‘Go girl, do your thing.’”","short":"The innovator returns: “The idea was to sonically break the

Album","standard":"On his second mini-LP of 2025, the intensely introspective JP Saxe continues to blur the line between self-analysis and self-flagellation that he toed on the preceding <i>Articulate Excuses</i>. “If I turn off my head, will it still turn back on?” he asks on the crestfallen piano ballad “I HAVEN’T SAID ENOUGH,” underscoring his inner anguish with liberal quotes of “Losing My Religion” that remind us the R.E.M. classic was named after the Southern-slang term for freaking out. But <i>Make Yourself at Home</i> shows that Saxe is learning to exhale a bit—or at least figuring out (as the closing acoustic lullaby puts it) “HOW TO STAY HUMAN.”\n\nIn other words, he’s giving himself a little more grace for not always having his shit together, as reflected in the album’s more relaxed feel and endearingly homespun blend of his go-to synth-pop, R&B, and classic singer-songwriter influences. And with Argentine pop star TINI turning up to drop some Spanish verses on the moody slow jam “STRANGERS,” Saxe’s musical vocabulary continues to expand even as his writing remains achingly intimate.","short":"The intensely introspective songwriter is learning to relax."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/make-yourself-at-home/1811435470","playParams":{"id":"1811435470","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/46jHQdOJZaEaunUrtYEqD1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811435470/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"663417013","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/663417013?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751036742078}}},"1811464270":{"id":"1811464270","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811464270?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/katseye/1754284416","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/cf/99/8d/cf998d17-d78c-6b67-0db9-839c621b3b92/75522294-2fc6-46fd-8804-bebf25260b54.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1a1915","textColor2":"030202","textColor4":"1a1a17","textColor1":"020100","bgColor":"7a786a","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1b/9c/29/1b9c29cc-0b4f-966c-485a-e14fc91973df/e354b4cb-62fa-4428-8949-5c4e728cfc78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbdad5","textColor2":"f0efed","textColor4":"d6d2cc","textColor1":"f6f9f8","bgColor":"6f604c","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d2/5d/3e/d25d3e50-7087-0025-1215-1aff82c4c83e/eb0c16e0-ea0f-4b86-aaa9-0574c09299c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"abaaa2","textColor2":"c8c6b7","textColor4":"a3a296","textColor1":"d2d0c7","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"BEAUTIFUL CHAOS - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"KATSEYE","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ad/92/ca/ad92ca90-90f5-eb46-7a56-e7b6b88584f7/25UMGIM37394.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0bcbf","textColor2":"d5a96e","textColor4":"aa8858","textColor1":"f1eaee","bgColor":"000300","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"“Gnarly,” the lead single from KATSEYE’s <i>BEAUTIFUL CHAOS</i> EP, is both a comeback and a cannonball into the girl group’s new era. It’s a revved-up, hyperpop fever dream that’s braggadocious and tongue-in-cheek in equal measure (“Hottie, hottie/Like a bag of Takis/I’m the shit,” they chant), with generous cursing that cuts as sharply as its knife-slashing sound effects. It’s almost hard to believe this is the same group that debuted just a year earlier with 2024’s <i>SIS (Soft Is Strong)</i>, whose breakthrough single “Touch” was a sweet kiss-off wrapped in candy hearts. But that’s the point: KATSEYE are no longer the rookies pieced together by label giants HYBE and Geffen. “Gnarly” marks their charge into bolder, more daring territory that reflects who they really are: chronically online, fierce yet funny, mature yet refreshingly unfiltered.\n\n<i>BEAUTIFUL CHAOS</i> continues down that path, exploring the complexities of modern womanhood—dating, digital personas, and, in KATSEYE’s case, six distinct personalities living under one roof—across an eclectic range of tracks. On “Gabriela,” they warn off a romantic rival atop a breeze of Spanish guitars, with member Daniela delivering the group’s first Spanish-language verse. <i>SIS</i> fans will find an older sister to “Touch” in “Gameboy,” a pastel rebuff layered in 8-bit bleeps and hopscotch percussion, while the balladic “Mean Girls” lets the group’s vocal runs and harmonies shine as they rise above online haters. But closer “M.I.A” steers KATSEYE back to the club, reasserting their self-worth (“Don’t be like this/No, you won't put a leash on a bitch”) over a gritty, throbbing beat and ready to dash into the night.","short":"A fierce, funny cannonball into the girl group’s next

DJ Mix","standard":"“This is a soundtrack for the queer clubs where you go to dance and let yourself be free,” says artist and DJ Rebecca Black about her Pride DJ mix. “To me, there are so many different facets of music that make up what it means to be queer.” The artist, who first found viral fame in the early 2010s, has since re-emerged as a songwriter and DJ who attributes so much of her own evolution to those who came before. “My learning as a DJ was explicitly led by queer people, and a set that takes you through a sonic journey full of surprises is my favorite way to approach sets, all full of humor, unseriousness, and thumping bass,” she says. “The majority of these remixes were made by legendary underground queer and trans DJs across the world. This mix is in honor of the artists and DJs who inspired me, led me through my own artistic discovery.”","short":"A soundtrack for the queer clubs where you can “let yourself be free.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1814237606","playParams":{"id":"1814237606","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814237606/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"426285675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/426285675?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751036126879}}},"1814372225":{"id":"1814372225","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814372225?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chippy-nonstop/465339138","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/91/ab/41/91ab41ae-268e-8d9b-7ab1-8f661fdfbdb3/6c18074b-0cee-4d57-b673-35f2c77651e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"44343d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e4354","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2b5df","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/63/c0/21/63c021d8-cfed-e8c4-ccb6-9bf5b3055ba1/458ee4fc-6407-4b0a-9459-a89cd51c6417.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5e3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f8/ff/71/f8ff713f-9d07-812c-d7a5-bdda2f5aaa4b/6677f71c-d86b-481e-b455-2bc2eef2a2e1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5a3e4f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/96/6d/b3966d3d-f3e5-65c5-6bd2-9dd831c67446/58adc579-218c-4244-8738-13ea124c358d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"483842","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"513c49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffbfeb","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e6/29/70/e6297057-a4fb-356d-befa-0d5796ab59c2/625a54c2-1c55-42de-bf4b-ae2ee60119d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"4b3542","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/7b/2f/137b2f0d-3b49-4a9f-ec1d-75f470efe4d3/3a292c5b-eb39-47e3-a4dd-58761055384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48333f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5d3f52","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f9a3da","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Chippy Nonstop","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ae/c5/65/aec5652d-c20e-9d13-e793-4e3c9c242218/7d1610e7-4194-44fb-95b8-e2355e47c7d2.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4b3441","textColor2":"35262e","textColor4":"5c3f51","textColor1":"1f191b","bgColor":"f9a3dc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“This mix is for the weirdos, the club kids, the children of the underground,” producer Chippy Nonstop tells Apple Music about her Pride DJ mix. “The girls that know the parties are always better in the bathroom stall.

“It’s for those who show up to these spaces with love and support, regardless of how hard it is for them at home or in their communities. My focus here was mixing songs centering queer Black, Latin American, and Caribbean artists.”\n\nDescribing the sound and vibe, they set the scene: “I imagined being at the raves that I’ve enjoyed, ones where the dance floor is dominated by queer Latin people, the spaces where people get to feel seen and be in community. These rhythms carry ancestral sounds and bring with them memories that many of us have attached to precious moments in our life. I envision this mix being played anywhere Latin queerness is being celebrated.”","short":"A mix for the queer Latin spaces “where people get to feel seen.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1815611193","playParams":{"id":"1815611193","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815611193/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1545092542","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1545092542?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1749843425315}}},"1815865407":{"id":"1815865407","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815865407?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stray-kids/1304823362","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/87/2b/97/872b97a6-7711-1709-f7d8-546bf0dd9752/cd182726-b333-4f18-85a2-4a53ea6a5205.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"29341d","textColor2":"0d1811","textColor4":"2c3327","textColor1":"091905","bgColor":"a9a07f","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bf/ce/1b/bfce1bd3-f838-a7f7-04f9-4847bde87ab1/0d2e135d-39ec-4244-828e-4e4f2a879d23.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"242720","textColor2":"0b100d","textColor4":"282820","textColor1":"060d0c","bgColor":"9d8c70","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ea/54/af/ea54afd9-ad15-2de9-7e88-1d9e8428b396/be4f27c7-704e-4f24-953c-08c6143f40b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a9ab83","textColor2":"d6c28f","textColor4":"b0a177","textColor1":"cdce9d","bgColor":"1c2019","hasP3":true}},"name":"Hollow - EP","artistName":"Stray Kids","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c2/52/b1/c252b1ef-863a-ec99-98a2-74d98b9731f6/4547366755893.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d2e21","textColor2":"162217","textColor4":"2f3929","textColor1":"13130d","bgColor":"969870","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"In 2025, Stray Kids used their third Japanese mini album, <i>Hollow</i>, to sing and rap about the highs and lows of life as an active, successful K-pop group, exploring feelings of emptiness despite success and defiant pride in the face of criticism across five tracks. Stray Kids released <i>Hollow</i> in the middle of their global dominATE tour, eight years into their career. The context is vital for a self-produced album that gets emotional but never strays far from Stray Kids’ signature high-energy bravado or the buoyant urgency of the J-rock sensibility from which it occasionally borrows.\n\nTitle track “Hollow” is the most explicit in the album’s exploration of a deep loneliness, not easily shaken. “I embrace everything and run, but why do I feel hollow?/Loneliness haunts me no matter where I am, I’m alone,” Han sings in the chorus, shining some light on the realities of life as a hard-working K-pop idol. In the rat-tat-tat of “Parade,” Stray Kids keep marching, for themselves and their growing fandom, in spite of any criticism (“Who’s still whispering?/I don’t care, I’m walking even bigger and more confidently”). \n\nThe theme of persevering against hardship is made more tangible on the energetic fan song “Never Alone” (“Lightning is not scary/If we hold hands, we STAY, together, forever”). “just a little” slows things down in its request for one last moment with a lover, while “宿命” (“Fate”) finds electric-guitar-driven deliverance in the form of Stray Kids’ relationship with fandom STAY: “Even if I’m alone/I’m always by your side.”\n\nNotably, <i>Hollow</i> marks the first time all tracks on a Japanese Stray Kids release are original Japanese releases, rather than songs translated from a previous Korean- or English-language version into Japanese. As is common, Stray Kids’ production team, 3RACHA (composed of members Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han), participated in the production of every track on <i>Hollow</i>.\n","short":"Five songs unpacking

DJ Mix","standard":"“Queer spaces like nightclubs have always meant so much to me,” Amanda Lepore tells Apple Music. “They were where I first found freedom, safety, and a real sense of belonging. For someone like me, coming up in a world that didn’t always understand or embrace difference, clubs were where I found my people. You form bonds in those spaces that go beyond friendship—they become your chosen family,” says the pop culture figure, performance artist, and DJ. \n\nThose spaces—and the people she met there—are reflected and honored in her Pride DJ mix. “[They] gave me the freedom to express myself fully, and it connected me with some of the most incredible, creative, and resilient people I know,” she says, explaining that her mix is a “celebration not just of the music, but of the community behind it.” Diving in a little further, Lepore shares that her mix is about “joy, resilience, glamour, the beauty of being seen—and most of all, pride. My set is sexy, decadent, queer, and above all, it’s fun. Just like me.”\n","short":"A dance-floor-ready mix from the singer and performance artist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2025-dj-mix/1816337129","playParams":{"id":"1816337129","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816337129/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"108312848","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/108312848?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1750457968959}}},"1816459140":{"id":"1816459140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816459140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/la-roux/292533375","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/3a/13/693a13d2-0997-21bd-d634-2c417859cc30/99a6e486-b608-42ba-9bbe-565f8c6b50b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"34162b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"35172b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7f/90/14/7f901445-d0dc-123b-a70e-0c7eb4859499/8866d213-7f85-4299-870d-21227cef8ccf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"472a3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4a/b4/b5/4ab4b5b2-065b-575f-e0a3-779065c03c35/cc3cec46-ca7d-4954-b5fe-34c740663bf6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4e2942","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2d/4a/00/2d4a00b7-d2a2-1f30-f0c2-a6822ad8f7e1/7be5b932-7b22-4f4b-bb16-f9599b1a5df1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"49263c","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47273b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ff67cf","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/a0/d2/a1a0d27a-dbfd-9d48-3261-4fab03033f2a/4389135d-afff-4526-91a9-dbee255486ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"45263a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b283f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96cce","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/67/8f/0f/678f0f09-2bda-0609-b17d-09b35e0fcfe3/912aca23-93d2-4acd-959d-5146068a9e33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"48273d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"472a3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f96bce","hasP3":true}},"name":"Pride 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"La Roux","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/48/7d/68/487d6803-a39d-a7a7-bab7-b89b69446dfb/65635dfb-c459-47a0-8502-0d7c465cc584.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"46283b","textColor2":"261f22","textColor4":"502e45","textColor1":"191616","bgColor":"f96ccf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Pride DJ Mix","standard":"“I’ve always been lucky in that I never really had to come out or change anything about my lifestyle,” says La Roux’s Elly Jackson. “I kept going to the spaces I had already been going to which weren’t queer specifically, but I’ve always been around people and scenes where anything is possible and anything goes with total acceptance. That’s so important for young people finding themselves.” The synth-pop act’s biggest hits have been mainstays of LGBTQ+ dance floors since 2009 hit, “In for the Kill.” So it’s only fitting for Jackson to craft her own DJ mix in honor of Pride. “It’s mostly an old-school selection of ’90s house and groove moments,” she says, “with some modern electronica and two of my favorite La Roux remixes thrown in. Definitely reminiscent of going out around 2007 and discovering ’90s house, ’80s music, and electronica at the same time.”","short":"Elly Jackson of La Roux’s mix is about “’90s house and groove

Album","standard":"When trap entered the mainstream in the late 2000s, it was uniformly serious business; now it can sound as playful and dreamy as anything we call “indie” or “pop,” and we have producers like Pi’erre Bourne to thank. His rapping has gotten better, but his beats are still the draw, a buffet of video game blips and accordion riffs (“La Loi, C’est La Loi”), drums that rumble like toy tanks, and melodies as sweet and light as the breeze through his extremely expensive hotel curtains (“JBH”), more <i>Looney Tunes</i> than <i>Gangsta Grillz</i>. Even his sexual conquests are framed as fairy tales (“Rapunzel”). He’s having fun with it—and why not?","short":"The Carti/Nudy/Uzi producer continues his playful, rainbow-colored

Album","standard":"When hip-hop supergroup BROCKHAMPTON broke up in 2022, they announced what was billed as the group’s final album; in reality, <i>The Family</i> functioned more like a solo album from founder and de facto leader Kevin Abstract, who helmed the project as its only vocalist. <i>Blanket</i>, the first solo Abstract album since BROCKHAMPTON’s breakup, arrived the following year, departing almost entirely from rap to wallow in moody indie rock and grunge. Two years later, its follow-up, <i>Blush</i>, feels like a full-circle moment: Here Abstract assumes more of a curatorial role, regularly ceding focus to a deep roster of collaborators, including former BROCKHAMPTON bandmates Ameer Vann, Romil Hemnani, and Kiko Merley, plus alt-rap heroes Danny Brown and JPEGMAFIA and frequent collaborator Dominic Fike. \n\nThe title doubles as the name of the loose collective of Houston-based musicians who appear across the album’s 18 tracks: Love Spells, roro, E Bleu, Makana XO, Truly Young, Diego, Drigo, DERBY, and Devan. Between grimy Texas boom-bap, alt-rock breakup ballads, and a Sublime-channeling ska jam (“Geezer”), it’s got the scope to take in all the lives Abstract has lived over the years.\n","short":"The BROCKHAMPTON leader comes full circle on his second post-breakup LP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blush/1819096293","playParams":{"id":"1819096293","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1aUFNUsjLeUwhJZjBZpoKa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819096293/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"416903584","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/416903584?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751041291648}}},"1819544141":{"id":"1819544141","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819544141?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/karol-g/290814601","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2f/98/13/2f981308-041c-330a-247e-905670583f61/2c0993c5-6dad-447b-8be0-c10b66d82b6b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e7cfca","textColor2":"fa9e6c","textColor4":"e78a5d","textColor1":"faf5f4","bgColor":"9d3825","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/65/4d/4c/654d4c06-03b6-8ad4-952e-57e251a953b0/c995a95a-0a3f-45c4-a457-191c7631b51d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbcac7","textColor2":"e9bbaf","textColor4":"d4a397","textColor1":"f2eceb","bgColor":"7f4439","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4e/c3/c6/4ec3c69c-5446-37d9-ab52-b82d87d38d12/ce46539c-42b3-432e-8f74-2cffbb7a1330.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c66244","textColor2":"e86f53","textColor4":"bd5b46","textColor1":"f37851","bgColor":"120c0f","hasP3":true}},"name":"Tropicoqueta","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"KAROL G","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/39/f5/1e39f58c-e5c1-6431-d6ed-d6c32e29d63f/25UMGIM79234.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e99965","textColor2":"fc9461","textColor4":"e88055","textColor1":"fcb376","bgColor":"9c3123","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"With every album since 2017’s <i>Unstoppable</i>, KAROL G progressively moved beyond expectations. Clearly not content with being the top reggaetonera on the scene, the Colombian singer refined and repositioned herself with each new full-length, from the beach dreaminess of <i>OCEAN</i> through the diverse sides of her <i>MAÑANA SERÁ BONITO</i> era. Her unapologetic eagerness to cross genre lines while still building with longtime allies like Ovy On the Drums grew her global fanbase exponentially, outpacing just about everyone else in Latin music who emerged during the mid-2010s boom. \n\nNow fully vested in the trappings of megastardom, she offers what is easily her most ambitious album to date in <i>Tropicoqueta</i>, its titular portmanteau a marked pivot that reflects how reggaetón’s baddest bichota successfully evolved into one of the world’s biggest pop artists. Among the album’s triumphs is just how at ease KAROL sounds on these 20 shapeshifting tracks, adapting and thriving over different sounds in ways that even some of her famous peers could never. \n\nAiming to genuinely connect with and honor Latin musical cultures more broadly, she faithfully plays to homegrown vallenato on the pleading “No Puedo Vivir Sin Él” and reaches for cumbia villera on “Cuando Me Muera Te Olvido.” Decidedly Caribbean forms like bachata and dembow feature on “Amiga Mía” with Greeicy and “Un Gatito Me Llamó,” respectively. Her fusions spark joy as well, combining New York City’s sexy drill with Brazilian baile funk on “Bandida Entrenada” and embracing tropical pop on bilingual standout “Papasito.” And while Latin Afrobeats is essentially its own active subgenre at this point, she holds space for herself within it on the somewhat mysterious “Verano Rosa” featuring Feid.\n\nNone of this means that KAROL’s given up on reggaetón, of course. She sprinkles in a gratifying amount of it throughout, beginning with the poppy perreo of “LATINA FOREVA” and continuing on deeper cuts like “Tu Perfume” and the Mariah Angeliq reunion “FKN Movie.” Elsewhere, as on “Se Puso Linda,” that familiar polyrhythm operates more like a texture than a driver, leaving room for her femme-forward storytelling to shine. The sheer power of her relatable lyricism is hard to deny as well, from the character-driven world-building of “Ivonny Bonita” to the romantic mischievousness of “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido.”","short":"The Colombian megastar moves beyond expectations."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tropicoqueta/1819544141","playParams":{"id":"1819544141","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yY0fT7zibMEffhBJD9Nab"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819544141/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"290814601","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/290814601?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751038555355}}},"1820033664":{"id":"1820033664","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820033664?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lee-morgan/999711","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Here's Lee Morgan (Original Jazz Classics Series / Remastered 2025) [feat.

Album","standard":"As salsa enjoys a youthful 2020s resurgence, Christian Alicea has undeniably become one of its most visible and admired players. Blessed by veterans like Tito Nieves and aligned with contemporaries like Luis Figueroa, the Puerto Rican singer represents this new tropical wave with vibrant energy and obvious star power. Following up his 2023 debut, the simply-titled <i>Yo</i>, his second proper full-length <i>Swingkete Vol. 1 - Maratón</i> reflects his growing profile with nearly an hour’s worth of songs that speak to the genre’s past while positioning it for this modern era. \n\nAlbum opener “Hello, What’s Up” provides a playful entry point for newcomers, overcoming perceived language barriers with winking humor and no small amount of charm. Songs like “El Dominó” and “E.M.U.” offer knowing stylistic touches familiar to longtime lovers of this music without ever feeling stodgy or stale. He sings with passion and pride in his country on “En PR con Plena,” adding to a contemporary canon of Puerto Rican homeland homage.\n\nAll too happy to invite reggaetoneros into his space, Alicea brings Jowell & Randy along for the uptempo “Carrusel” and lets singer J Alvarez in for a proper duet on “Homenaje a J Alvarez.” With Eliot El Mago D Oz by his side, he even manages to slip some bachata vibes into the mix on “Tus Celos.” Yet even without guests, he hints and gestures towards a potential for a more expansive vision of Latin stardom. After gliding over the drill-adjacent title track, he toys with reggae cadences on “Bomba Para Afincar” and tries out Afrobeats for size on “Ella Es Así.”","short":"One of salsa’s brightest young stars is in it to win it."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/swingkete-vol-1-marat%C3%B3n/1821045129","playParams":{"id":"1821045129","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3swn9BL0MqR8K0wcKUJwGi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821045129/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"831088637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/831088637?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751032950473}}},"1821055553":{"id":"1821055553","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821055553?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/maisak/1610652984","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"DR.

Album","standard":"Throughout his decades-long career, Arcángel has remained a force to reckon with in both reggaetón and hip-hop spaces, often at the same time. Yet his pivotal role in the 2010s Latin trap movement as both scene elder and savvy hitmaker kept him part of a contemporary vanguard otherwise populated by younger, hungrier talents. By the time <i>SR. SANTOS</i> dropped in 2022, his stature as a trapero was widely acknowledged and appreciated across generations of listeners. Arriving just a few years later, this robust rap-centric sequel leaves little argument against his being a Spanish-language rap G.O.A.T. contender. After laying waste on the graphic intro “Apocalipsis,” he proceeds to prove his endurance on the mic has in no way lessened.

It makes sense, given that his melodic monotone and pleasure-seeking lyrics jibe so well with the atmospheric reggaetón he seems to prefer. Working mainly, though not exclusively, with his prior go-to producers, like Nes on the Shet and Panda Black, he maintains a consistency both sonically and thematically across the full-length <i>Apocalipsis</i>. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the songs here tend toward hedonism, not infrequently veering into sexually charged territory that starts on the dance floor and ends in the bedroom. Versatile yet consistent, he’s the consoling suitor for a heartbroken baddie on “Braile,” the adventurous lover with certain proclivities on “Temblar,” and the confident mile-high clubber on “Jet.” Money showers, shopping sprees, and late-night trysts define the world he’s building, track by seductive track. As such, it’s easy to get lost in these strobe-light serenades, his provocations and pleas proving hypnotically alluring on “Vamo a Bailotear” and “Una Flor.” Still, there’s a Weeknd-esque gloom lurking in those slinky shadows, revealed in spots like “7 Trompetas.”\n\nThough dembow-derived rhythms drive the bulk of <i>Apocalipsis</i>’ contents, he affixes a similarly erotic yet moody vibe to the gothic synth-pop of “Fashion Week” and the booming trap of “El Tiempo Se Pierde.” Neo-disco thump pushes “RocknRoll” into a retrofuturist thrill zone, while “Tercer Cielo” warbles as much as it throbs. Yet no matter where the beat takes him, Cris MJ seems down for whatever the night might bring.","short":"Chile’s viral reggaetonero mixes the atmospheric with the erotic."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apocalipsis/1822056803","playParams":{"id":"1822056803","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/47JohERDAJVAzmfCgOfG5w"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822056803/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1504191840","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1504191840?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1751038936301}}},"1822319711":{"id":"1822319711","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822319711?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":35,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic","Bass"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rl-grime/583453223","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"RL Grime at EDC Las Vegas 2025: Cosmic Meadow Stage (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"RL Grime","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/89/bc/c9/89bcc9cc-71eb-f3be-20ef-a982e06c8c51/a1fca17a-21b5-422a-95b9-fa86dd11a527.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"b0a897","textColor2":"de9a6b","textColor4":"b47d58","textColor1":"dad0ba","bgColor":"0a0b0d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rl-grime-at-edc-las-vegas-2025-cosmic-meadow-stage-dj-mix/1822319711","playParams":{"id":"1822319711","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822319711/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"583453223","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/583453223?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1750980456979}}},"1822468786":{"id":"1822468786","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822468786?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=2707186-1822468788","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Last Drop - EP","artistName":"The Blackbyrds & Jazztunes","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b0/7c/c6/b07cc667-9b6b-d36a-379b-65605220ea3d/803961.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a2820","textColor2":"2f211a","textColor4":"533b1e","textColor1":"0f0a1c","bgColor":"e4a230","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-drop-ep/1822468786","playParams":{"id":"1822468786","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822468786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2707186","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2707186?l=en-US"},{"id":"1822468788","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1822468788?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1750744488207}}},"1822827244":{"id":"1822827244","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822827244?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lizzo/472949623","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/b4/a5/a1b4a546-9f53-f6b7-feb0-26a3ec7c8793/878a43aa-70b4-44e6-8cd6-f3cbed254711.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bab2a6","textColor2":"cfb09b","textColor4":"a99080","textColor1":"e5dacb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/78/3e/d0783e37-acd3-4056-de29-244da28f9240/8264035e-3d44-444d-b9d9-6623525de4fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"272e2b","textColor2":"1b2112","textColor4":"313932","textColor1":"0e1309","bgColor":"8897b3","hasP3":true}},"name":"MY FACE HURTS FROM SMILING","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lizzo","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/79/24/1c79249b-701b-8cc0-2582-2a1d282df1b9/075679604262.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1f1c0d","textColor2":"030302","textColor4":"211d0e","textColor1":"020301","bgColor":"96823d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"The singing, rapping, flute-playing polymath spent the three years since 2022’s <i>Special</i> courting unexpected controversy and flirting in social media posts with quitting music entirely. After mostly laying low throughout the turbulence, Lizzo emerged in February 2025 with a rock-inspired new single and an announcement of her fifth album, both titled <i>Love in Real Life</i>. But first, a bit of raucous, freewheeling fun: With three days’ notice in late June, she revealed a surprise 13-track mixtape whose artwork shows the singer grinning from ear to ear and flipping the double bird. The project came together just as spontaneously. “I did this shit in three motherfucking days, bitch!” she crows on “DITTO,” before adding: “You’re welcome!”\n\nFrom the jump, <i>MY FACE HURTS FROM SMILING</i> stands in stark contrast to the posi-vibes-only pop-rap that skyrocketed the 37-year-old singer into the mainstream circa 2019. “Bitch, I’m mad! Bitch, I’m pissed off!” she bellows on intro “CRASHOUT” before letting loose a 35-minute barrage of blistering, boisterous trap music. But her formidable Southern rap skills come as no surprise to those who heard her unofficial TikTok remix of PLUTO and YKNIECE’s 2025 viral hit “WHIM WHAMIEE,” which appears here as the rowdy “YITTY ON YO TITTYS (FREESTYLE).”\n\nOver grimy, bouncy beats from the likes of Zaytoven and Tay Keith, Lizzo sounds like she’s having more fun than she’s had in years: firing shots at the haters, turning up with her girls, and interpolating trap throwbacks. (“NEW MISTAKES” is likely the only song of 2025 to interpolate both Boosie Badazz and “Für Elise.”) She’s joined by Doja Cat on “STILL CAN’T FUH” and SZA on “IRL” for a pair of bratty bad-bitch symposiums. “I can’t let no comment section ever fuck with my vibe,” she spits on the latter duet.
