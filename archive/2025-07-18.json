Deluxe Edition","standard":"When it dropped in 1999, the third album from the Backstreet Boys broke just about every record you could think of, besting Garth Brooks’ previous stats for single-week sales and ultimately becoming the year’s best-selling album. Back then, you couldn’t leave the house without hearing the silky harmonies of the Orlando, Florida, five-piece. Narratively, “I Want It That Way” may have been a bit of a head-scratcher, but its earworm chorus embedded itself into the fabric of pop history, while the Latin-tinged lushness of “Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely” soundtracked the collective ache of millions of teenage yearners. A quarter of a century later, <i>Millennium</i> still stands as one of the best-selling albums of all time. Here the boys (er, men?) don their vintage white getups to recreate the cover photo for the anniversary edition, which features remastered versions of the original tracklist, a handful of demos and live recordings, and one new single, “Hey.”","short":"A 25th-anniversary reissue with demos and live

Album and Interview","standard":"“I found myself in a new world of touring and chaos so quickly that I built a separation between myself as Josh and Barry on stage to deal with it,” Josh Mainnie tells Apple Music. “But when it came to writing this album, I knew it had to be for me as Josh. I wanted to bring those two parts back together.”\n\nAs DJ and producer Barry Can’t Swim, Mainnie has had a meteoric rise since the release of his 2021 debut EP <i>Amor Fati</i> and 2023 album <i>When Will We Land?</i>. Blending emotive melody with thumping electronic percussion and expertly chopped vocal samples, Mainnie’s signature has become a feel-good dance-floor communion.\n\nFor his second album, <i>Loner</i>, Mainnie turns inwards to explore his rise to fame, moving from the spoken-word soul-searching of “The Person You’d Like to Be” to the trance synths of “About to Begin” and soulful horn fanfares of “Childhood,” all while keeping his introspection anchored in the joy that has become his calling card.\n\n“Once I started, it all came together quickly,” he says. “It’s an authentic side of me that needed to come out for everyone to hear.” Read on for Mainnie’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“The Person You’d Like to Be”</b>\n“This is a collaboration with a good friend of mine, the poet Séamus. I’ve known him since university and always wanted to work together. We finally managed to make it happen and he came up with these lyrics that set the tone for the themes of the album really well. It’s about having two voices of conflict and duality—myself and Barry. I then put his vocal through an AI voice generator, so that it starts AI and becomes more and more Séamus as the track continues.”\n\n<b>“Different”</b>\n“I loved the lyric of ‘everybody different’ in this vocal sample I found and ended up building the entire track around it. I was also really inspired by the track ‘Church of Nonsense’ by Daniele Papini, which I’ve played in DJ sets for years, since it has this incredible rising bassline that I wanted to emulate here. It’s minimalistic and the synth that comes in two thirds of the way through wasn’t originally in there but when I brought it to rehearsals for the live show my keys player Jakes [UK producer/artist Hannah Jacobs] added it in and so it stayed!”\n\n<b>“Kimpton” (with O’Flynn)</b>\n“‘Kimpton’ is one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album. I wasn’t sure where to begin, so I went round to [London DJ/producer] O’Flynn’s house, since he lives around the corner from me, and we just began mucking about. He started this tune himself when he was on tour with Bonobo and I liked the vocal a lot but wanted to simplify it and build a different chord progression and texture around it. It developed as a jigsaw from there and I’m really happy with how it turned out.”\n\n<b>“All My Friends”</b>\n“This is another early one, probably written in November or December 2023. I found the vocal sample first and loved it so much I decided to keep it as it was and not overdo it with too much extra instrumentation. I’m generally quite quick in the studio, playing most of the instrumentation live myself and working on ideas until they’re finished rather than multiple things at once.”\n\n<b>“About to Begin”</b>\n“I wrote this while I was staying at my parents’ house on the day I delivered the finished album. I didn’t have anything to do, so I decided to quickly make something fresh to keep busy. I picked this vocal from a sample pack and it sounded pretty cheesy and American but I liked the energy of it. I put it through an AI voice generator, which added another persona to the themes of the record, and it’s since become a huge tune in the live show, so it had to go on the record.”\n\n<b>“Still Riding”</b>\n“This is one of my favorite tunes I’ve made and it was written a few years ago when I got back from touring in America for the first time. It’s been finished for a while but I couldn’t get the Kali Uchis vocal sample cleared until I think my own profile got bigger and they finally agreed. I’m so pleased because I love the track.”\n\n<b>“Cars Pass by Like Childhood Sweethearts”</b>\n“I was listening to a lot of [French DJ/producer] Pepe Bradock and his tune ‘Deep Burnt’ when I made this because I love the warmth and texture of the strings loop he uses. I started writing strings inspired by that and built all the other parts around it. It was originally just an instrumental but I spent a couple of weeks digging through samples and eventually found this vocal that works really well with the vibe of the tune.”\n\n<b>“Machine Noise for a Quiet Daydream” (feat. Séamus)</b>\n“This is a good place to have a bit of breathing space in the record. Séamus just sent me a poem he was working on one day, and I thought I’d see how it sounded on an instrumental I’d already finished and I loved the energy of it. I didn’t do much else, and none of it is really in time but I fell in love with his delivery on the phone voice note he sent through, so that’s what we kept.”\n\n<b>“Like It’s Part of the Dance”</b>\n“I don’t often write tracks for my live show but this is one that found its way into the show very quickly. I’ve been playing it for six or seven months and it always goes off—even when I sent the album to friends and the people I trust, a lot of people picked it out as their favorite. It’s all about the build and drop and energy.”\n\n<b>“Childhood”</b>\n“I was in Lisbon on holiday with my partner and I smuggled a keyboard along with me, which is what I ended up writing this one on. I started with the horns and vocal sample and then it was a case of finding a chord progression that led nicely into a sense of release. I felt like the track had a feeling of innocence to it, which comes with childhood, hence the title.”\n\n<b>“Marriage”</b>\n“‘Marriage’ ended up having a strange Russian doll process to it, since I wrote the vocal and had someone sing it live over an existing instrumental. Then I realized I didn’t like that instrumental, so I changed it before realizing I didn’t like the vocal anymore either so had to change that too! We got there in the end, and I love that it’s built around the lyric ‘My heart is closed for the season.’”\n\n<b>“Wandering Mt. Moon”</b>\n“I was in the toilet of an Indian restaurant in Brick Lane and suddenly heard the strings part of an amazing Bollywood track play through the speakers. I immediately Shazamed it and once I got home, wrote my own part inspired by it. It’s definitely become one of my favorites on the album since it’s such a lush and textured ending to have. The title also comes from a Game Boy <i>Pokémon</i> level, where you’re exploring a dark cave with only a ray of light, which is what this felt like to me.”","short":"The DJ/producer reveals “an authentic side of me that needed to come out.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loner/1798245645","playParams":{"id":"1798245645","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6aE10Kz82jIDkcOM2hRhR5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798245645/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1492752064","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1492752064?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752850033930,"RTCI":0}}},"1799272049":{"id":"1799272049","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799272049?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/split-chain/1676624154","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fd/85/bd/fd85bdab-e560-98d3-d32a-8ac7485b9457/a96f5c12-0aea-4b03-b3e8-e4faf937ce28.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9bec2","textColor2":"bfcfd6","textColor4":"9ca9ae","textColor1":"e3eaee","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"Motionblur","artistName":"Split Chain","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fe/2d/ed/fe2deda6-b138-e963-af3b-3023948e381e/0045778809660.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0bac6","textColor2":"86ddea","textColor4":"6db6c3","textColor1":"d9e2ee","bgColor":"0a1c26","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The hotly anticipated debut album from Split Chain sees the British band spanning decades with a sound that filters some of the 1990s’ dominant genres through a modern sensibility.

Meanwhile, drummer Aaron Black, bassist Tom Davies, and guitarists Ollie Bowles and Jake Reid weave heavy shoegaze magic on “bored. Tired. Torn.” and early single “I’m Not Dying to Be Here.” Later, “Subside” trades in smoothed-edge nu metal, while “Who Am I?” builds on the impassioned themes of post-hardcore and Y2K emo.

Their debut—2022’s <i>Wet Leg</i>—provided 36 minutes of lo-fi hooks, wit, and twentysomething confessions to catapult them into a BRIT- and Grammy-winning swirl of well-deserved hype. After a relentless but enjoyable touring schedule, they decided to escape to a seaside town for two weeks at a time to turn their attention to album number two.\n\n“I think we’re really fortunate we can write in that traditional band setup,” Rhian Teasdale tells Apple Music’s Matt Wilkinson. “When we stopped touring, we were like, ‘OK, what are we going to play when we go on tour again? Let’s make some tunes.’”\n\nSo the band decamped to a house in Southwold, Suffolk and got to work. “There was a kid’s playroom with some LEGO around, so we took the majority of the stuff out and put all of our gear in it,” says guitarist Joshua Mobaraki. “Some days we were like, ‘OK, let’s start at this time and put a shift in.’ And then other times, it was 1 am and all of a sudden we were writing again. It was really cool.”\n\n<i>moisturizer</i> finds the band once again teaming up with producer Dan Carey and repeatedly nailing the perfect three-minute song on 12 tight tracks. They admit they give away more of themselves than they did on <i>Wet Leg</i>. While “catch these fists” has a strong message about reclaiming personal space, they stray into more romantic territory elsewhere. Hester Chambers wrote “don’t speak” for Mobaraki, who’s also her partner, but she subverted the idea. “She wrote me a song from me to her, which is really cheeky,” he says.\n\n“CPR” captures the feeling of infatuation, while “davina mccall” and “11: 21” sum up more secure, longer-term love, which are themes Teasdale had avoided before this album. “I’d never even attempted writing any kind of lyrics that were to do with love,” she says. “I had this rule when I was younger to just not even use the word ‘love.’ I was really hesitant because I felt like there were so many love songs out there. Also, it didn’t feel very authentic. When I was younger, I don’t think I really did know love, so I was just pulling out cliche after cliche.”\n\nOn <i>moisturizer</i>, Wet Leg sound as vital and adventurous as they did on their debut—but there’s a new assurance creeping in too. “Our position as a band is to just constantly be surprised that people still want to listen to it,” says Mobaraki. “I don’t know if the imposter syndrome goes or it’s like you turn it into something else. It’s a way of not being like, ‘Everyone’s telling us that we’re amazing. That means that we are amazing.’ Instead, it’s just like, ‘Huh, let’s do another song. I like that one. Let’s do another one.’ I think we’ve developed and grown and we’re different now. We’re giving ourselves permission to take up space.”","short":"The balm of a second album gives the band “permission to take up space.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moisturizer/1802918329","playParams":{"id":"1802918329","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YVnHpyms4rLr3fXS0ROQy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802918329/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1569685293","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1569685293?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752851251957,"RTCI":0}}},"1803701071":{"id":"1803701071","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803701071?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative Folk","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jade-bird/1167712148","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f0/64/ad/f064ad44-3ca7-ae8b-f7a2-154e1199ff2e/Job3c3c6451-fc79-448e-bfb6-2da778d0636f-192532481-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377109454_2161509801-Time1747259625055.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","3e271d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"384750"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"363339","textColor2":"3e271d","textColor4":"5f4a41","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"384750","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/e2/b9/dce2b9a8-11ce-0f5e-5540-bab525a18ec0/650a7273-c845-4390-9cf8-ec04627ae3ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2b8b1","textColor2":"e1aa93","textColor4":"b78c7b","textColor1":"eee0d7","bgColor":"121618","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/cd/57/6d/cd576d64-7ea8-72cd-d954-80d418bce743/Job7d45b03c-4b38-4ca0-a1f1-78339f8ee6d8-192532482-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377109455_2161509802-Time1747260969370.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"375366","textColor2":"12354e","textColor4":"3f586c","textColor1":"082e47","bgColor":"f1e8e4","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4e/11/61/4e116149-9412-f863-a8aa-04a96422f706/95e3bc17-3105-497a-ab55-c193b1ef470a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d0c9c9","textColor2":"eddfc8","textColor4":"c9c4b7","textColor1":"f7e6df","bgColor":"375773","hasP3":true}},"name":"Who Wants to Talk About Love?","artistName":"Jade Bird","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/79/c6/ca79c6e0-9968-e2fc-dfe4-677b6c9eacbc/198846843285.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"beced6","textColor2":"efc3be","textColor4":"c3adb3","textColor1":"e9ecea","bgColor":"115786","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When UK-born singer-songwriter Jade Bird was making her 2024 EP <i>Burn the Hard Drive</i>, she didn’t realize she was writing about a breakup that hadn’t happened yet—the one that would involve her fiancé-slash-touring guitarist. <i>Who Wants to Talk About Love?</i>, Bird's third album, is a more conscious processing of that loss. But rather than focus its songs tightly on just that relationship, Bird widens her lens of self-reflection, reckoning with the failed marriages around her (specifically her parents’ and both sets of grandparents’) to better understand where she might’ve gone wrong.\n\nThis personal introspection underscores Bird’s gifts for raw, nakedly honest storytelling. She poses the album’s title as a rhetorical question in “Who Wants,” a look at her family’s poor communication habits in the face of love breaking down. And on “Dreams,” which she wrote the morning after a particularly rough night with her now ex, Bird questions her will to leave a partnership that isn’t working. But in “Glad You Did,” she finds that, in hindsight, it was all for the best. “You let me slip right out your grip,” she sings. “You lost me, gone bit by bit, but I’m so glad you did.”\n","short":"Raw

Album","standard":"The 11 tracks on Hong Kong-born artist Jackson Wang’s album <i>MAGICMAN 2</i> started as diary entries. “After 10 years of nonstop schedules, all packed every day of the year, I figured I needed some rest,” Wang tells Apple Music, referring to his first decade of work in the massively successful K-pop group GOT7. In stark contrast, Wang spent the lead-up to production on the 2025 album with family and getting introspective: “I took almost a year off just for myself to breathe and to think about what does everything mean.” \n\nThe album is a follow-up to Wang’s 2022 solo album <i>MAGIC MAN</i>, which was a raw and dramatic alt-rock effort inspired by the artist’s experiences with burnout. <i>MAGICMAN 2</i>, a different kind of confession, expands the thematic scope of the man behind the pop persona. “People see Jackson Wang, my audience sees me, but how do I really feel? I didn’t even know that,” says Wang. “This album is all about how I feel in everything—in reality, in society, in industry.” \n\n<i>MAGICMAN 2</i> is divided into four chapters, meant to take the listener on an emotional journey through “manic highs,” “losing control,” “realization,” and “acceptance,” explains Wang. The album gets personal in its subject matter, prioritizing vulnerable specificities over vague universalities. Early on, in the haunting, dramatic synth-pop track “High Alone,” Wang makes a desperate plea to an ex-lover. In “BUCK,” featuring Indian superstar Diljit Dosanjh, he celebrates the infinite groove of the dance floor.  \n\nWang finishes the album with the acoustic pop track “Made Me a Man,” which he calls his favorite on the album, a song he did not intend to be a commercial hit as much as an honest statement. “I felt like I needed one of those albums in my life that represents me,” he says. “Not thinking about, ‘Oh, is this going to be an ear candy song?’ I want something that represents me.”\n","short":"The veteran K-pop star gets personal: “I want something that represents

Album","standard":"Dylan Gossett’s debut album opens a prayer. With minimal accompaniment, the Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter wonders if he’s too far gone on the LP’s old-timey opening track, pairing gospel-tinged harmonies with rootsy guitar to dramatic effect as he asks, “Lord, will you carry me?” Only a minute and a half long, the song sets the tone for the searching and heartfelt collection, which Gossett wrote and produced himself. That tune leads into “Hangin’ On,” a bright and buoyant folk-rocker reminiscent of early Mumford & Sons with its quick-strummed rhythm guitar and anthemic feel. The road song “American Trail” dips into newgrass, complete with banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and multi-part vocal harmonies, a sound that differentiates Gossett from peers like Zach Bryan. And the album, of course, features one of Gossett’s biggest hits, the stripped-down and vulnerable “Coal,” on which he wonders if the pressures of life will ever bring forth growth.","short":"A searching and heartfelt album from the Austin, Texas, singer-songwriter."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/westward/1811479220","playParams":{"id":"1811479220","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22iWmNK24h2hurzUzXnY1V"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811479220/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1526025679","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1526025679?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752876578053,"RTCI":0}}},"1811669372":{"id":"1811669372","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811669372?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":59,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance","Garage"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mph/465495678","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7d/4b/5f/7d4b5f5d-9044-2187-cb23-f98e8ed781c0/1dd91409-1844-4376-871c-e4c3357394fd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0ccda","textColor2":"fce2b5","textColor4":"dbc6a2","textColor1":"daeafa","bgColor":"565656","hasP3":true}},"name":"Chemistry Radio with MPH, Ep. 2 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"MPH","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c4/4f/80/c44f80f8-290c-9b56-cdae-94392cd7069a/df068953-d3a6-4faf-ae29-586e47f99791.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"311b10","textColor2":"160a07","textColor4":"3f2013","textColor1":"050303","bgColor":"e17a42","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Apple Music Club DJ Mix","short":"Chris invites his collaborator MPH into the mix for an uptempo UKG set."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemistry-radio-with-mph-ep-2-dj-mix/1811669372","playParams":{"id":"1811669372","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811669372/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"465495678","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/465495678?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867584196,"RTCI":0}}},"1811688038":{"id":"1811688038","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811688038?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/max-mcnown/1682299543","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6b/6a/1c/6b6a1cdf-4c94-a065-5a53-04e1fec05a1f/d9dc794d-57d2-4830-8edc-309e02271fc4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfd7de","textColor2":"ebeef1","textColor4":"c7d1d8","textColor1":"f5f6f8","bgColor":"395c76","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/59/dd/93/59dd9356-d6bb-0ef7-a4e3-40cd3c81fb98/6b598bf6-462a-404c-9fec-7ff09fce0e03.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8a3a3","textColor2":"92bbdf","textColor4":"7b9bb8","textColor1":"cbc5c5","bgColor":"1e1b1d","hasP3":true}},"name":"Night Diving (The Cost of Growing Up)","artistName":"Max McNown","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a8/26/ca/a826ca87-8734-b96b-d905-7693d267534d/850064541656.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b1bcc6","textColor2":"7ec6e3","textColor4":"6aa2b9","textColor1":"d6e7f4","bgColor":"1a1210","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"This sophomore album from Max McNown comes less than a year after his 2024 full-length debut, the viral success <i>Willfully Blind</i>. On that outing, the pop-folk singer-songwriter from Oregon crafted a collection of songs tailor-made for fans of fellow of-the-moment troubadours like Noah Kahan and Zach Bryan. <i>Night Diving</i> doesn’t mess with that formula, instead doubling down on the raw, heart-on-his-sleeve sound that made McNown a TikTok favorite. <i>Night Diving</i> opens with its title track, a brooding rendering of youthful regret that recalls the more somber sounds of The Lumineers. Another ballad, “It’s Not Your Fault,” offers absolution to an unknown subject, adding a sense of universality to the song’s titular message. And another highlight, “Roses and Wolves,” is the lone collaboration on the album, bringing McNown together with critically acclaimed country singer-songwriter Hailey Whitters for a duet about the last days of a doomed relationship.","short":"The Oregon newcomer’s second album doubles down on earnest songwriting."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/night-diving-the-cost-of-growing-up/1811688038","playParams":{"id":"1811688038","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0iK9uLukiE9sSqJ7P58C4c"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811688038/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1682299543","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1682299543?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752875066775,"RTCI":0}}},"1811706126":{"id":"1811706126","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811706126?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Tectonic Sound","artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f5/1d/18/f51d1822-7dae-c5db-6bf2-28425eef18fa/5065002108661_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"d1dde0","textColor2":"f5feff","textColor4":"d1dde0","textColor1":"f5feff","bgColor":"425966","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tectonic-sound/1811706126","playParams":{"id":"1811706126","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6fZab445GXHj3FPdGhYOiv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811706126/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867691847,"RTCI":0}}},"1811710874":{"id":"1811710874","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811710874?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lord-huron/393068687","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cc/2d/cf/cc2dcf69-e785-e706-1204-840c52a1d820/0a0102fb-0d60-4eb5-9ae2-a45ef04ec31a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9bcee0","textColor2":"84c6eb","textColor4":"71b0d4","textColor1":"b8ebfa","bgColor":"25597a","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/48/4a/57/484a579f-5478-fa48-6fb2-7a8adfa70535/5bb966cb-6a1b-4c1a-886f-e04a4d4d4c4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ca8984","textColor2":"f27e6a","textColor4":"cb6e5e","textColor1":"f19f99","bgColor":"2f2e31","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Cosmic Selector Vol. 1","artistName":"Lord Huron","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/11/fa/d511fac1-3089-829c-43f7-883b3b4afa61/25UMGIM45642.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b07f44","textColor2":"dd9937","textColor4":"b27d2e","textColor1":"da9d52","bgColor":"0a0b0d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Lord Huron’s reverb-soaked, sepia-toned Americana has worn several faces over the years: the wide-eyed pioneer (<i>Strange Trails</i>), the lovelorn drifter (<i>Vide Noir</i>), the wistful cowboy just looking for a cold beer and place to hang up his spurs (<i>Long Lost</i>). As its title suggests, <i>The Cosmic Selector</i> leans into the spacier side of their sound, channeling moody, Lynchian atmospheres (“Looking Back”), ’50s ballads (“It All Comes Back”), and front-porch hymns (“Looking Back”) with the kind of gauzy, interstellar remove of late-’90s bands like Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse.\n\nPart of the project’s charm is that it never tries to sound too

On “NOBODY CARES,” his lyricism, flows, and rhyme schemes are superlative, which he showcases throughout <i>ADHD 2</i> as well. Take “One of Them,” which features skittering synths and stomping drums. Lucas promises 2025 is the year he’s “gotta make shit bloody.” Elsewhere, he turns contemplative, like on the blackbear-assisted “Anxiety Wins” and the pre-release single “White Noise.”","short":"Superlative lyricism and flows on display on the MC’s third album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/adhd-2/1815328278","playParams":{"id":"1815328278","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6CdUv4PQeizXqsV1dsTegM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815328278/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"888715002","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/888715002?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752860039070,"RTCI":0}}},"1815356726":{"id":"1815356726","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815356726?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/giv%C4%93on/1070668868","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3b/01/4d/3b014d3b-aa9e-ab20-6ad5-1cf3784d7761/826b1caf-e619-4051-8dbe-f082ce6a4aac.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"252729","textColor2":"1a1716","textColor4":"313132","textColor1":"0b0b0a","bgColor":"8f99a2","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/5d/4d/dc5d4dd6-0b40-93cf-1afd-477700f7ae1f/e45e8440-a18e-4f98-80ff-6c3c7f490a78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cac8c2","textColor2":"d5c7be","textColor4":"b7aca5","textColor1":"edeae3","bgColor":"404140","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/03/67/ce03679a-3014-0a03-b9f5-155cbd7c8c60/720700c5-eb2a-41a4-8f7d-0b2ea945c2ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"27292a","textColor2":"201f1f","textColor4":"373839","textColor1":"0c0c0b","bgColor":"939da5","hasP3":true}},"name":"BELOVED","artistName":"GIVĒON","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/03/4c/47034c71-831b-61a2-8cc2-502f927834bd/196873057620.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7ccc5","textColor2":"d9c7a3","textColor4":"b7ad8f","textColor1":"edeee6","bgColor":"2d4243","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"GIVĒON has been working on his craft these past few years, and the fruits of his labor are resplendent on <i>BELOVED</i>, a love letter to R&B that has the timeless feel of ’70s soul sides while possessing a distinctly 21st-century sensibility. “There’s that element where I’m doing this because it’s in my DNA,” GIVĒON tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I didn’t choose music. I tell people all the time, ‘I didn’t choose it. It chose me.’ But I care about rhythm and blues. It means a lot to me.”\n\n<i>BELOVED</i> starts off in a big way: Surging strings create a high-drama atmosphere that sets the mood for “MUD,” a poison-pen letter to an ex that’s given a cushion by GIVĒON's supple croon and the sonic splendor surrounding it. Not only does the song send a message to the person who did GIVĒON wrong, it lets listeners know that the singer-songwriter has leveled up in the years since his last album, 2022’s <i>Give or Take</i>. \n\n“I think I grew as an artist exponentially,” he says. “There’s a leap in my knowing how to articulate what I feel, or what I have a taste for.” On <i>BELOVED</i>, GIVĒON showcases his evolution in a way that’s dazzling without being showy—the longing “I CAN TELL” frames his vulnerable vocals in rhythmic snaps and dry horns, while on the slow-burning “KEEPER” he fully throws himself into his plea to a lover he’s missing. Much of <i>BELOVED</i> came out of GIVĒON and his collaborators jamming in the studio, and its grooves possess the sort of loose yet locked-in feel that characterizes the most sublime soul. \n\nDespite growing up in Southern California, GIVĒON was raised on East Coast R&B, and he studied records by the likes of Teddy Pendergrass, as well as the productions of Philadelphia soul architects Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, to get properly inspired for <i>BELOVED</i>. He also got better at fully tuning in to his artistic desires and curiosity. “I know what artist I am,” he says. “I understand my process. I understand how to evolve as well.”\n","short":"“I understand how to evolve”: The R&B star crafts a love letter to the genre."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beloved/1815356726","playParams":{"id":"1815356726","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7pcBXbl1g198PNAxt44bHQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815356726/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1070668868","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1070668868?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752877009760,"RTCI":0}}},"1815520672":{"id":"1815520672","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815520672?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/paloma-mami/1401778806","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c3/d2/40/c3d240d4-5f5c-fa03-2fd0-a0c464f9ecd3/7851cad3-ce24-49be-81f6-62b9ce77d53b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1e1f20","textColor2":"111011","textColor4":"282a2c","textColor1":"050302","bgColor":"869196","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5f/68/17/5f68173d-3db7-da99-2bf5-aa7faa39eee0/ebf379a0-f1ba-42c2-9133-2c91611431cb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"1b191a","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"1b1a1b","textColor1":"030202","bgColor":"7c777c","hasP3":true}},"name":"CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA","artistName":"Paloma Mami","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/af/05/c3/af05c312-7e6c-3fd2-20eb-8aff5fee3fb3/196873033778.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"262727","textColor2":"252525","textColor4":"3f4040","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"a7abac","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I have a lot of artistry inside me that I hadn’t been able to explore,” Paloma Mami tells Apple Music about making her second full-length album, <i>CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA</i>. “Since I was creating this whole album, I finally got the opportunity to really experiment.” In following up 2021’s <i>Sueños de Dalí</i>, which paired her with producers like El Guincho and Hit-Boy, the Chilean American sought to take greater creative control of her musical process. That meant, in part, limiting those who had access to her while recording, including her own family members. “I was completely alone, by myself, just working, and only had my engineer,” she says. “It was a big moment for me to know myself and see who I am, really.”\n\nAs such, a clearer picture of Paloma Mami comes into focus across these 11 engaging tracks. Though she playfully indulges in a doll-like visual transformation on the cover, her <i>CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA</i> is anything but superficial. Here, she pushes female empowerment in numerous ways, be it in reevaluating relationships as on “SíNTOMAS DE SOLTERA” or exhibiting a command of sex positivity on “Mi KAMA.” “I spent some time searching, really, looking for my femininity,” she says. “This whole muñeca aesthetic and concept comes from being a powerful girl in general.”\n\nAs she decodes and redefines her personal definition of girl code throughout, she chooses collaborators who can live up to her expectations. This comes through in the sultry Rauw Alejandro duet “LA FREAK” as well as the more emotionally resonant “SiNKRONiZAMOS” with DannyLux. “I never had the chance to know myself,” she says, looking back on the process. “I was just in a whole other world before. Now I’m finally myself.”\n","short":"“Now I’m finally myself.” The Chilean American star decodes girl code."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/c%C3%B3digos-de-mu%C3%B1eka/1815520672","playParams":{"id":"1815520672","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6E8dYhNdpnk83fjNHzsrrE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815520672/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1401778806","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1401778806?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752827607128,"RTCI":0}}},"1815620619":{"id":"1815620619","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815620619?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Afro-fusion","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/burna-boy/591899010","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e6/96/74/e6967456-a571-8421-59a4-de31f3162abd/ee2489e5-7bf6-4578-a492-a2bdac902f38.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"90a8b2","textColor2":"8fb8cb","textColor4":"7396a5","textColor1":"b4cfdb","bgColor":"040c0d","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d1/38/12/d1381299-3b9c-8a4a-9620-14b1ccad3b90/89a2c394-74bd-4f98-8fe4-f2acb989719f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c9b893","textColor2":"f1d3c1","textColor4":"c7afa0","textColor1":"f3deb0","bgColor":"211f1f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/70/50/bf/7050bf6a-b893-ba35-a8bc-0bb7d9c587d5/dae1ab49-24d1-463e-a89a-716f672cece3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b8af97","textColor2":"d4af9a","textColor4":"ad8f7f","textColor1":"e2d6b9","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"No Sign of Weakness","artistName":"Burna Boy","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/25/a5/b6/25a5b6bf-c1ef-81de-4ddf-e5a8bfd1383d/075679623539.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"baa68e","textColor2":"d3bd9b","textColor4":"b1987c","textColor1":"deceb1","bgColor":"2c0404","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The man who in 2019 knew well enough to declare himself the <i>African Giant</i> may not have needed a Mick Jagger collaboration to certify his rock-star bona fides, but with his eighth studio album, <i>No Sign of Weakness</i>, that is what Burna Boy saw fit to deliver. “Shout-out to Naomi Campbell,” the Nigerian-born superstar tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “It was literally her idea. She was like, ‘You and Mick Jagger would be so legendary.’ And she pressed about it for so long.”\n\nThe song is called “Empty Chairs” and is a unique classic-rock/Afrobeats hybrid—just one of a wealth of disparate vibes Burna explores across <i>No Sign of Weakness</i>, an album whose title implies a plan for continued dominance while asserting a pronounced lack of fear in his musical practice. “I was trying to make something that I haven’t made before,” Burna says. “In a sense that I’m trying to do the opposite of everything I’ve ever done—in a good way. I just feel like right now, I’m big enough to do it. I’m big enough to enjoy it now and just do everything that I would want to listen to, if it wasn’t me.”\n\nBut it <i>is</i> him who fans the world over have been adding to playlists, requesting in DJ sets, and buying tickets to see season after season since at least 2018’s “Ye” took the Afrobeats world by storm. His practice has expanded with every release since, and on <i>No Sign of Weakness</i> we get dalliances with hip-hop (“No Sign of Weakness”), country (“Change Your Mind”), house (“Kabiyesi”), baile funk (“TaTaTa”), lovers rock (“Sweet Love”), and R&B (“Come Gimme”), complemented by linkups with Travis Scott, Stromae, and Shaboozey, an artist Burna actually feels a tribal connection to. \n\n“So, here’s the thing: I didn’t know he was actually Nigerian,” Burna says, “Before he came, they would tell me, ‘Hey, you know this guy’s Nigerian, right?’ But when [people] say someone is Nigerian, it’s like they probably have one drop of Nigerian blood somewhere. With Shaboozey, his name is Chibueze, and I’m speaking pidgin, and he understands that.”\n\nYou’d not need to be kin to the singer and MC to understand the Burna Boy lifestyle, specifically in regard to reaping the financial benefits of his genius (“Bundle by Bundle”), his undying love for the ganja leaf (“28 grams”), or even his amusement at making local tabloids (“Dem Dey”). He’s happy to tell you all about it—including how he deals with it all—as he does on album mission statement “No Panic.” “Basically, I’m saying, every day I’ve done all this, but I don’t panic—I won’t panic,” he says. “It’s some shit that they say in the streets in Nigeria as well. It’s like, ‘Dem go whine you, but no panic.’ It means they’ll play with you, but don’t panic.”\n","short":"Eight albums in, the African Giant seems only to be getting stronger."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-sign-of-weakness/1815620619","playParams":{"id":"1815620619","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/35EMM8QwKJ2qXmoUJnUSNf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815620619/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"591899010","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/591899010?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752835245761,"RTCI":0}}},"1815825254":{"id":"1815825254","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815825254?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alex-g/871667491","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/19/ec/b819ecd3-532f-f236-a2d8-3a79b5a58af0/0877e8b7-2efd-4da9-bb10-c6aee9d4f4db.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292524","textColor2":"0e1111","textColor4":"252a2c","textColor1":"130c07","bgColor":"828c9a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Headlights","artistName":"Alex G","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/df/33/7c/df337c6f-7853-b1f8-8bd0-b4c9737fccc4/196872969757.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcddd","textColor2":"fcd4b4","textColor4":"d0bcaf","textColor1":"f9eaed","bgColor":"215a9e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Alex G’s cryptic, heartfelt indie rock has earned him friends in interesting places: He contributed guitar and arrangements to Frank Ocean’s <i>Endless</i> and <i>Blonde</i>, he co-wrote and produced about half of Halsey’s <i>The Great Impersonator</i>, he’s toured with Foo Fighters, and he soundtracked Jane Schoenbrun’s 2024 movie <i>I Saw the TV Glow</i>—a movie that, like G’s music, seemed almost instantly destined to be a cult classic, playing with nostalgia for early-’90s pop culture in ways that felt both comforting and deeply unsettling. He’s not a household name, but he touches a nerve.\n\nHis first major-label album (whatever that really means in 2025), <i>Headlights</i>, isn’t different from his run of Domino albums (2015’s <i>Beach Music</i> to 2022’s <i>God Save the Animals</i>) in kind so much as in degree. “Every couple weeks, I’d have a new song and just start working on it,” he tells Apple Music. “And then, at the end of a couple of years, I guess I had these 12 songs that were good.” The conventional tracks are more straightforward (the early Wilco stomp of “Logan Hotel”), the experiments are both bolder and catchier (the Auto-Tuned hyperpop of “Bounce Boy”). For an artist who can pull deep feeling out of vague stretches of sound, he’s gotten incredibly good at knowing how to use detail and when: Just listen to the accordion that seeps into “June Guitar” or the girls’ chorus that drifts in and out of the alien-abduction/high-school-football story (yes) “Beam Me Up”—touches that feel both unexpected and irreplaceable. \n\nThe result is an album that feels less like a collection of indie-rock songs than a dream about collections of indie-rock songs—vivid but patchy, intimate but abstract, emotionally deep but totally indirect. In some ways, he’s just another point on the continuum of artists like Pavement or The Velvet Underground, both of whom managed to balance directness with abstraction, shadow with light. In others, he feels perfectly made for his moment, an enigmatically normal-seeming guy whose gift for melody and cool fragments of sound work as well as background vibes for chill times as hermetic texts left to be parsed by comment-section scholars. There’s a reason his fans latch on so tight: Like a good dream, Alex G points toward mystery.","short":"A cult songwriter makes his most direct record yet, without sparing the mystery."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/headlights/1815825254","playParams":{"id":"1815825254","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6txHM80BKWlp4UdqLpWXRZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815825254/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"871667491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/871667491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752857108248,"RTCI":0}}},"1816313639":{"id":"1816313639","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816313639?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=627567-682277-1819765935","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b1/c2/4d/b1c24d7d-2c8f-0088-a878-72cd90cdbb03/Jobee9d0735-c614-4692-9110-4b11dc8d2be8-194261636-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380557960_2195018158-Time1749229399419.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","171316"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"292229"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"45393f","textColor2":"171316","textColor4":"443a40","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"292229","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a0/70/8b/a0708be3-c4bc-8c69-afe6-9f5ae8a27f1c/59d6db6f-e5d3-4041-adc1-b00143010344.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/39/df/8e/39df8e65-3e87-252c-06c2-25000e6e8f52/Jobce3a525d-c5fc-4ea9-8d58-0a5bb13f2a4a-194261637-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380557961_2195018159-Time1749230505067.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","45292b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"292229"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"443b41","textColor2":"45292b","textColor4":"694b50","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"292229","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6a/8c/8e/6a8c8e6a-d755-1a60-6e66-68641482849a/b5cdecb0-1ce9-4e56-a2e9-0232a5c2d4c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbc1cc","textColor2":"e4d0d0","textColor4":"c8b5b6","textColor1":"fbdfec","bgColor":"5b474d","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5f/32/d7/5f32d712-2145-e437-0435-3a7d8ba234f8/129c961e-ad8d-4f33-8bf8-03ed2cc676bc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"cccccc","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"f0f0f0","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":true}},"name":"Let God Sort Em Out","artistName":"Clipse, Pusha T & Malice","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":2500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/70/a6/9a/70a69aeb-3bcf-968b-de75-f3cb44a89e1b/1605.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2500,"textColor3":"d5c7c3","textColor2":"f9dae6","textColor4":"ddc0cc","textColor1":"efe3dc","bgColor":"6f5762","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“It is because of my faith that I’m sitting here with you right now,” Malice tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden about reforming Clipse with Pusha T. “That is the only reason that I get to sit here with my brother.” Brethren both in blood and in song, the Thorntons made up one of the most vital rap duos of the 2000s. Signed back in the day to The Neptunes’ Star Trak imprint, the Virginia Beach pair spat intricate yet gratifying narco bars over cutting-edge production.\n\nYet despite dropping three essential, consequential albums over the course of that decade, an apparent crisis of Christian values appeared to prompt a creative split. Not long after the late-2009 release of <i>Til the Casket Drops</i>, a hiatus commenced as both members explored solo careers with distinct differences. Pusha T continued his coke-rap ascent within the GOOD Music roster, while Malice purposefully rebranded himself a Christian artist under the subtly adjusted moniker No Malice. \n\nThankfully, their bond could never be broken. A momentous 2019 appearance by both brothers on Kanye West’s <i>Jesus Is King</i> suggested a greater musical reconciliation. Yet it took the return of longtime collaborator Pharrell Williams, a core architect of the classic Clipse sound, to produce <i>Let God Sort Em Out</i>, their first new album in some 15 years. “It just felt like a real good family setting,” Malice says of the studio sessions in Paris that yielded these tracks. “The creative aspect, the same as it’s always been from yay high.”\n\n“We get caught up in the feeling of certain records,” Pusha T adds. “You got to realize that before we even get to the process of hooks and writing, man, we’re so entranced by the beat.” Considering the triumphant sound of Pharrell’s production on the first single, “Ace Trumpets,” it’s hard not to believe the sincerity of that statement.\n\nReunited at last, their chemistry feels as potent as ever beginning with “The Birds Don’t Sing” where, with a little help from John Legend, they pay respect to their departed parents with their respective verses. “The framework of the song was my last conversation with my mom and his last conversation with my dad,” Pusha T says. “It was therapeutic, but it was the hardest record to make. That’s why it actually starts the album.”\n\nNotorious for taking out his foes with acutely pointed bars, Pusha T once again wields his surgical summer skill set with incisive precision on “So Be It Pt. II.” It’s little wonder they invited the like-minded Kendrick Lamar to join in on the fun with a euphorically acrimonious verse on “Chains & Whips.” And while the album boasts a handful of choice rap features by everyone from Neptunes superfan Tyler, The Creator to Griselda affiliate Stove God Cooks, one of the biggest moments comes from an artist who preceded and inspired Clipse. \n\n“I was like, ‘Man, this, this piece right here is made for Nas,’” Pusha T says of the title track’s guest appearance, adding that the Queensbridge legend was originally meant to rap on his 2022 solo album, <i>It’s Almost Dry</i>. “His excitement was through the roof.” For Malice, it was his younger sibling’s enthusiasm towards the new music that lit a proverbial fire underneath him. “It just reminds me of how it was when we started,” he says. “We ain’t felt like this in a while.” \n\nThat feeling comes through in a major way with every single verse from the rejuvenated elder brother, slipping a stunning blend of religious imagery and key memories into tracks like “P.O.V.” and “So Far Ahead.” Aglow with gospel vibes and synth swells, the latter of these succinctly sums up the spiritual dilemma that kept Malice away from Clipse for so long with one crucial insular line: “I done been both Mason Bethas.”\n\n“It is in the suffering when you start looking for answers,” he says. “Nothing is going to help you until you get into that word of God. That’s where I get all my peace from.”","short":"Malice and Pusha T return. “We ain’t felt like this in a while.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-god-sort-em-out/1816313639","playParams":{"id":"1816313639","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/17ScNnJ0lSWajodZaRpHdQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816313639/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"627567","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/627567?l=en-US"},{"id":"682277","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/682277?l=en-US"},{"id":"1819765935","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1819765935?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752854750763,"RTCI":0}}},"1817034324":{"id":"1817034324","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817034324?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/year-of-the-dragon/139521434","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dragon Burn - EP","artistName":"Year of the Dragon","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ce/f9/40/cef940eb-5a92-a20d-824c-25b88319e84f/28044.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cd8935","textColor2":"fc1902","textColor4":"d31602","textColor1":"f5a941","bgColor":"2d0a06","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dragon-burn-ep/1817034324","playParams":{"id":"1817034324","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817034324/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"139521434","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/139521434?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867703932,"RTCI":0}}},"1817294201":{"id":"1817294201","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817294201?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fletcher/1131301545","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8c/8f/45/8c8f454f-4686-e153-18ec-f19bbfb1328a/f11a3389-940c-42a4-8243-e8e7063fc27b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d4cfcd","textColor2":"f8ebcf","textColor4":"dbcdb5","textColor1":"efeeed","bgColor":"67574d","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/44/f3/c7/44f3c7ae-9510-de0d-289c-922ca6539fe7/07f87377-cedc-4c98-ab53-7f0fc672b5d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cad5d8","textColor2":"deecf8","textColor4":"c0ced9","textColor1":"ebf4f6","bgColor":"485761","hasP3":true}},"name":"Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me?","artistName":"FLETCHER","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3594,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/bf/f8/3bbff83d-3d49-cef0-60d1-b00bf913a437/25UMGIM70160.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3594,"textColor3":"242625","textColor2":"17110b","textColor4":"2f2e2b","textColor1":"0a0804","bgColor":"8da0ab","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The concept for FLETCHER’s third album, <i>Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me?</i>, came to her while touring in support of her sophomore effort, <i>In Search of the Antidote</i>.

With this 2025 LP, she aimed to wrestle agency back from oblivion and make a project that would provide satisfaction on its own terms, in its own time. FLETCHER is satisfied in ruminating on these weighty philosophical questions, finding as much joy in reflecting on the puzzling nature of happiness as in the feeling itself.\n\nOpener “Party” is a piano-driven pop ballad buoyed by FLETCHER’s powerful voice. She sings of champagne bottles that have gone flat after having been left open too long. The festivities have ended and there’s no one left to clean up the mess. Elsewhere, on “Chaos,” she opts for a simple arrangement of contemplative acoustic guitar chords, allowing plenty of room for her to reflect on her phone calls with God, in which she admits that she doesn’t know what she’s doing. That, in and of itself, is reason enough for FLETCHER to keep singing.","short":"Existential pop that questions the nature of happiness—but in a fun way."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/would-you-still-love-me-if-you-really-knew-me/1817294201","playParams":{"id":"1817294201","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7CrfDijJ4YRvLEjlOMkgZI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817294201/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1131301545","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1131301545?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752829013828,"RTCI":0}}},"1817434326":{"id":"1817434326","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817434326?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Alternative Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%24ilkmoney/1042415244","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE ONCE THE LEAVES DRY UP AND FRUITS NO LONGER BEAR?","artistName":"$ilkMoney","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ac/b9/fd/acb9fdb7-66fc-5455-0339-8b7363d5ae22/508.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6b392","textColor2":"acd0b9","textColor4":"96b09d","textColor1":"d5d3ac","bgColor":"3b322d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-waters-the-wilting-giving-tree-once-the-leaves-dry/1817434326","playParams":{"id":"1817434326","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1MEZKXMJDSMGJqliRRrD7r"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817434326/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1042415244","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1042415244?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752747557991,"RTCI":0}}},"1817449307":{"id":"1817449307","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817449307?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1817449310-1355037497","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Rot in Helvetica","artistName":"NODEGA & BODEGA","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bc/fa/90/bcfa9066-4d4f-7acd-9e02-5d0cf872a92e/54969.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c2a2","textColor2":"efe7c3","textColor4":"c5bea1","textColor1":"f2ebc5","bgColor":"1d1c19","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rot-in-helvetica/1817449307","playParams":{"id":"1817449307","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10jlAt4UAG44QJ4t6xD9ar"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817449307/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1817449310","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1817449310?l=en-US"},{"id":"1355037497","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1355037497?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752813602736,"RTCI":0}}},"1817499720":{"id":"1817499720","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817499720?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1527402414-220278331","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"LNS001 -

Since her 2021 debut single “Upgrade,” the 20-year-old singer has collaborated with Jelly Roll, Teddy Swims, and BigXthaPlug; briefly relocated to Nashville, then LA; and landed a handful of hits about heartbreak and dangerous love. Despite her gritty voice and outlaw predilections, Murph refrained from delving too deep into her own personal story on her 2024 debut album <i>That Ain’t No Man That’s the Devil</i>. \n\nHer follow-up, <i>Sex Hysteria</i>, fearlessly unpacks her past. “I’m from Alabama, I’m ’bout 4’11”/I’ve got a shitty father, and I’d like to go to heaven,” she drawls candidly on intro “Gucci Mane,” which country-fries a subtle sample of its namesake’s “Lemonade.” In Murph’s musical melting pot, trap, pop, and country meld into a twangy, swaggering hybrid. She flexes her hip-hop chops alongside a few of her faves, holding her own with Lil Baby on the snarling “Best Behavior” and Gucci himself on “Donuts.” The doomed romance of “Heroin” falls somewhere between Lana and Loretta Lynn, while the Amy Winehouse-inspired “1965” offers up a winking satire of trad-wife femininity. But the rawest moment is “The Man That Came Back,” a stark piano ballad about her violent upbringing and her father’s attempts at redemption—transcending her trauma by writing her way through it.\n","short":"A brutally frank and wholly unique blend of trap, pop, and country."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sex-hysteria/1817707266","playParams":{"id":"1817707266","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1slf6g1SethO2KrA4cxgjq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817707266/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1548067332","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1548067332?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752874531387,"RTCI":0}}},"1817735146":{"id":"1817735146","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817735146?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alex-warren/1572671688","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7e/8f/f8/7e8ff88c-8319-d171-35a3-c1ab0720223b/Job3cbd966f-c023-4321-915c-8ba348f9600c-196413987-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384668503_2235089757-Time1751498978528.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9dd05b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b1503"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"9aaf5a","textColor2":"9dd05b","textColor4":"7eab48","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b1503","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/12/ee/6a/12ee6a9b-5962-833e-1f35-5a9369241081/d92a9298-0a0e-45d6-92f8-e2bcf947007d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292a2f","textColor2":"1a171c","textColor4":"363338","textColor1":"0a0c11","bgColor":"a6a3a8","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/cf/31/01/cf3101d0-3665-28a8-e7b1-9f39a1542243/Job11492f11-2d25-4019-9c8f-2844c824b446-196413986-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384668502_2235089758-Time1751497969523.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","edb1a6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b1503"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"80b05a","textColor2":"edb1a6","textColor4":"be9285","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b1503","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/57/bd/42/57bd42a5-5e85-175c-834b-0366608436f2/ac6c9a1f-14ee-4d6c-9c3a-37a4e0c65b85.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bf9180","textColor2":"d6a99f","textColor4":"b39086","textColor1":"e5aa98","bgColor":"252b21","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3e/fc/77/3efc77d7-552a-d253-539c-2e5c17788703/ea4f6ff1-7ec6-4a62-87b6-fda74bd354cf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bebec1","textColor2":"f5ccbc","textColor4":"cdaca0","textColor1":"e3e3e6","bgColor":"2a2b30","hasP3":true}},"name":"You'll Be Alright, Kid","artistName":"Alex Warren","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c7/1e/c9/c71ec9f8-f6fd-5374-0e5c-3419539618f4/075679607942.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"baa9a0","textColor2":"eea597","textColor4":"c4907b","textColor1":"e1c4c6","bgColor":"1c3d09","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s easy to imagine Alex Warren making a very, very different kind of music than the emotionally complex, deeply personal and revealing songs he wrote for his 2025 album <i>You’ll Be Alright, Kid</i>.

But Warren does away with deception and silliness on his debut, instead opting to write songs about big dreamers and lost souls—mostly keying in on the arduous road we face after heartbreak. \n\nOpener “Eternity” finds Warren looking for his true identity in the wake of a breakup, using his Christian faith to infuse the song’s imagery. “To be with you in paradise/What I wouldn’t sacrifice,” he practically pleads. Warren is at his most comfortable when taking on the role of balladeer, like on the ROSÉ-assisted “On My Mind,” where every cloud in the sky—and even the ticking of the clock—reminds him of the one that got away.\n","short":"The social media superstar plays it straight on his full-length debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/youll-be-alright-kid/1817735146","playParams":{"id":"1817735146","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6FyViQsaJnS1e5if4ouzGK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817735146/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1572671688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1572671688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752850162526,"RTCI":0}}},"1818142975":{"id":"1818142975","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818142975?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=145072812-1643131965","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Mannequin Love (Remixes) - EP","artistName":"Justice & The Flints","artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/36/b8/32/36b83270-adf1-7318-b66a-7a0ffafe1b63/5056556162551_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3500,"textColor3":"8a97b7","textColor2":"6aaadb","textColor4":"5588af","textColor1":"acbde5","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mannequin-love-remixes-ep/1818142975","playParams":{"id":"1818142975","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818142975/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"145072812","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/145072812?l=en-US"},{"id":"1643131965","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1643131965?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752813119302,"RTCI":0}}},"1818235707":{"id":"1818235707","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818235707?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Gospel","Music","Christian"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pastor-mike-jr/1082237789","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/36/ef/69/36ef6987-17f6-6a5a-15b9-089aa604f047/29b817d7-ca0c-4fc6-ac53-d072f6b25fd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"464447","textColor2":"2d2b2c","textColor4":"4c4a4c","textColor1":"252326","bgColor":"cbc7ca","hasP3":true}},"name":"Confetti & Conspiracies: The Amen Mixtape","artistName":"Pastor Mike Jr.","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/65/da/6d/65da6d72-ab0d-c8a8-7f2a-c995ab04890b/25SYMIM20115.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0bea0","textColor2":"dceece","textColor4":"b2c0a8","textColor1":"eeeac4","bgColor":"0b0c0e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Hip-hop-infused gospel about adversity and celebration."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/confetti-conspiracies-the-amen-mixtape/1818235707","playParams":{"id":"1818235707","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3n1ZcpEmjNKXc7M5VPmkZX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818235707/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1082237789","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1082237789?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752813072569,"RTCI":0}}},"1818352842":{"id":"1818352842","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818352842?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gene-tellem/1298070589","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Phantom Vibrations (Alt Mix / Tough City - Single","artistName":"Gene Tellem","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/19/f0/e9/19f0e957-2c54-1caa-cfc6-c420b787b120/4062548120110.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdbdbd","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a1a1a1","textColor1":"ebebeb","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/phantom-vibrations-alt-mix-tough-city-single/1818352842","playParams":{"id":"1818352842","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818352842/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1298070589","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1298070589?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752812974341,"RTCI":0}}},"1818353597":{"id":"1818353597","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818353597?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1662517336-464286100","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Vamos!

Opening track “Turns Out That I Am God,” which draws its thought-provoking title from a talk by the late spiritual writer and philosopher Alan Watts, finds the acclaimed singer-songwriter seizing control of her own life and encouraging listeners to do the same. Such heady themes abound on <i>All Things Light</i>, the follow-up to 2020’s <i>The Otherside</i> and Cam’s first solo project since contributing vocals, production, and songwriting to Beyoncé’s groundbreaking album <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. \n\nEarly single “Alchemy” gets trippy, with dizzying vocal harmonies and slightly discordant guitar playing off one another as Cam considers natural wonders like “patterns in the grass” and the cycle of “dust to flesh to bones to dust” that makes up human mortality. Other highlights include “Kill the Guru!,” a dark and dusky rebuke of new age grifters with easy answers, and “Hallelujah,” a deeply searching portrayal of seeking truth and light in a world gone mad.\n","short":"The veteran’s first solo album since contributing to COWBOY CARTER."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-things-light/1819581569","playParams":{"id":"1819581569","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Sj8iHrpEA4axsC3vSld9M"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819581569/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"975711021","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/975711021?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752874282120,"RTCI":0}}},"1820007249":{"id":"1820007249","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820007249?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Folk","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/noah-cyrus/333158887","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9e/c9/5b/9ec95b75-a44a-5cd4-4c7e-31bc59da8c15/22df6ed8-e858-4300-91c0-d80a9760091a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"232c31","textColor2":"232822","textColor4":"3a4443","textColor1":"050a0b","bgColor":"98b6c8","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e4/02/e0/e402e060-eeca-050d-1897-f82be0453451/c7a37e6f-525d-4270-80f2-b985b1708de1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"a7bfd4","textColor2":"aad1f4","textColor4":"94b5d3","textColor1":"c1ddf6","bgColor":"3d474e","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fd/63/14/fd6314d1-bdfe-e312-6dae-7590436c09c6/37c0a41d-d589-4162-8dad-92ee1317f3fb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"88a3c6","textColor2":"a5bed3","textColor4":"879bac","textColor1":"a6c8f3","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"I WANT MY LOVED ONES TO GO WITH ME","artistName":"Noah Cyrus","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8f/28/4d/8f284d5f-ad81-6ced-300b-a4ce531d8459/196873248394.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8ca4b6","textColor2":"a7c3d6","textColor4":"869dad","textColor1":"afcce2","bgColor":"030507","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On Noah Cyrus’ emotive second album, <i>I WANT MY LOVED ONES TO GO WITH ME</i>, she immerses herself in the rich tapestries of anthemic folk music and alt-country, recruiting a formidable list of guests to help her realize this bold vision. Blake Shelton comes through on the pedal-steel-heavy campfire duet “New Country,” and Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold brings some crunch to the swooning ballad “Don’t Put It All on Me.” Among these strong vocalists, Cyrus more than holds her own, tapping into harmonic power to create truly memorable moments throughout the project. \n\nElsewhere, she recruits cult indie-folk star Bill Callahan for album closer “XXX.” Though the veteran songwriter has one of the most recognizable voices in music, Cyrus serves as a perfect foil, tracking his low register with a soaring, confident performance. When their time runs out, they cue up a stirring fiddle solo to bring about the outro, offering up one last ode to an era Cyrus pays homage to with respect and her own unique twist.\n","short":"A star-studded immersion in anthemic folk music and alt-country."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-want-my-loved-ones-to-go-with-me/1820007249","playParams":{"id":"1820007249","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/26gGJnMKjkq2WeF8MH3alW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820007249/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"333158887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/333158887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752874259668,"RTCI":0}}},"1820237673":{"id":"1820237673","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820237673?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=424044507-1729615767","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Whiskey & Roses","artistName":"Yelawolf & J.

The Wu-Tang Clan legend’s solo debut, <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…</i>, is rightfully revered as one of the greatest rap albums of all time, a benchmark release for the mafioso rap that so many other MCs would attempt to emulate in the decades that followed. But aside from that, his albums from the late 2000s forward unlocked a sharper curatorial ear and are largely more consistent than his works that preceded them. Early Wu-Tang music had an indispensable feeling, and the rapper known as The Chef has found ways to recreate it without allowing it to feel stale.\n\n<i>The Emperor’s New Clothes</i> finds Raekwon delivering more of the lucid street raps that make him great: crystal clear portraiture of characters down to the details of their clothing or the amount of money in their pockets, fluid storytelling, and popping shit while depicting a life of luxury. He’s strongest here while flexing his skills alongside other elite MCs: He highlights multiple Wu-Tang Clan members, a change from his previous album <i>The Wild</i>. Along with strong verses by Inspectah Deck and Method Man, longtime comrade Ghostface Killah has three features, with their chemistry at its best on the luxurious album closer, “Mac & Lobster.”\n\nRaekwon and Nas (whose label, Mass Appeal, houses the release) both shine on “The Omerta,” and he welcomes coke-rap torchbearers Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine on “Wild Corsicans.” Rae also takes time for a couple moments of introspection. On “1 Life,” he employs a lush J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League soundbed while reflecting on his own experiences and offering a young’n advice about how to navigate a lack of integrity in the streets and the music industry: “This culture made me a man.”","short":"The Chef cooks up more of the lucid street rap that made him a legend."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-emperors-new-clothes/1822358576","playParams":{"id":"1822358576","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1hI8tHkf2aBl1zgjMblfck"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822358576/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"397104","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/397104?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752876150384,"RTCI":0}}},"1822545714":{"id":"1822545714","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822545714?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ateez/1439301205","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6d/55/e5/6d55e545-79b1-84ec-e0ae-fca1aee43e20/744e847e-5e4c-4fea-a456-18317d020759.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e3cece","textColor2":"f3eaea","textColor4":"dfc6c6","textColor1":"f9f4f4","bgColor":"8e3634","hasP3":true}},"name":"GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 'In Your Fantasy Edition'","artistName":"ATEEZ","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/67/41/06/6741061b-db7d-dccb-6200-0be18e0a7cf8/196873101224.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c37070","textColor2":"eb5451","textColor4":"c64744","textColor1":"e88788","bgColor":"331412","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"The day after the eight members of ATEEZ announced the signing of an additional seven-year contract at KQ Entertainment, the K-pop boy group released <i>GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 ‘In Your Fantasy Edition’</i>. While technically a repackage of ATEEZ’s June 2025 release <i>GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3</i>, the album includes mostly new tracks, including English and Korean versions of lead single “In Your Fantasy” and solo tracks for each member. \n\nATEEZ’s main producer, EDEN, and rapper-leader Hongjoong took songwriting lead on the 15-track album, including for “In Your Fantasy,” a pulsating, “SexyBack”-esque track that encourages the listener to give in to desire. The entire song leans into the unabashed sexiness of ATEEZ’s <i>GOLDEN HOUR</i> era, as do solo tracks like vocalist Seonghwa’s “Skin” (“The way she moves, wildfire/Exploding desire/Wanna see you go higher/It’s written on my skin”). Other solo tracks include Hongjoong’s “NO1,” Yunho’s “Slide to me,” Yeosang’s “Legacy,” San’s “Creep,” Mingi’s “ROAR,” Wooyoung’s “Sagittarius,” and Jongho’s “To be your light.”\n\nThe <i>In Your Fantasy</i> EP includes “Lemon Drop,” the summer hip-hop track that became the group’s first-ever Billboard Hot 100 entry following its initial release in June 2025. ATEEZ’s <i>GOLDEN HOUR</i> series is on the more subdued, sensual side of the group’s anthemic, EDM-trap-leaning discography, but the album trilogy is no less energetic for it, launching the powerful, performance-driven group into their next seven years. \n","short":"A revamped version of the K-pop group’s 2025 EP."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/golden-hour-part-3-in-your-fantasy-edition/1822545714","playParams":{"id":"1822545714","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2rBtlOpNMuE4u9imyZz0YL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822545714/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1439301205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1439301205?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752827639291,"RTCI":0}}},"1822653629":{"id":"1822653629","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822653629?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/red-leather/1611294049","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"RENO (ALL IN)","artistName":"Red Leather","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/7e/10/557e10a5-fcdd-e313-9e4d-9d89e8a902c3/199316150049_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7b8af","textColor2":"e3bca3","textColor4":"b99a85","textColor1":"e1e1d8","bgColor":"11130b","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reno-all-in/1822653629","playParams":{"id":"1822653629","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6xx3OFM5pcN9orjxumOoKG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822653629/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1611294049","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1611294049?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752876316770,"RTCI":0}}},"1822664085":{"id":"1822664085","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822664085?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Urbano latino"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-17","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/myke-towers/1210225867","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/84/4b/c0/844bc0b7-2013-4868-241c-81603e719a09/50e0dbbc-1fd8-4ebe-8754-b8d91fd5ba42.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b59ea0","textColor2":"6e9dd8","textColor4":"5b83ba","textColor1":"debfb8","bgColor":"101b43","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0c/78/39/0c7839e6-d33d-fc37-feda-39276235cc4a/42f097d5-f9e2-4171-baea-e387723c4fd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"23221e","textColor2":"050505","textColor4":"24231f","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"a19a89","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/d0/61/0fd061f1-e6e1-fe33-7c92-c3cca831e488/29e850a9-144c-47c2-a85a-2075d50f0812.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2d2d2d","textColor2":"090807","textColor4":"2d2e2d","textColor1":"090706","bgColor":"bdc8c9","hasP3":true}},"name":"ISLAND BOYZ","artistName":"Myke Towers","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/c9/f5/84c9f544-c586-8018-4fc9-b001f4c28cd7/5021732854643.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2400,"textColor3":"38332f","textColor2":"181b1b","textColor4":"383432","textColor1":"171916","bgColor":"bb9b91","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"By now, Myke Towers’ fans know that his artistry defies easy categorization. Even still, on 2024’s <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i> and its successor <i>LYKE MIIKE</i>, the Puerto Rican star summarily illustrated the two most prevalent sides of his catalog. The global pop of the former and the rugged hip-hop of the latter spotlit just how far he’d come from his Latin trap roots. For others lucky enough to be in his enviable position, that might be enough of a musical foundation to spend the rest of a career honing and tweaking. \n\nAnd yet the frequent departures that make up <i>ISLAND BOYZ</i> show Towers valuing fulfillment over mere contentment, providing another series of lenses through which to view him. That first word of his latest album’s title offers the most glaring hint as to its contents, a tropical assortment of inherently summery songs that significantly diversify his established hitmaking sensibilities. The distinctive dancehall reggae iterations of “ME HACES FALTA” and “SUNBLOCK,” as well as the airy Afrobeats escapades of “EXPECTATIVAS” and “PIÑA COLADA / LAS PALMAS,” capture the romantic drama of days spent with sun and sand as well as the sensual promises of nighttime. Others, like “TENGO CELOS,” the duet “SEÑORA” with Manuel Turizo, and the Quevedo-assisted “SOLEAO” share a sonic kinship of sorts with some of his most mainstream charting singles, albeit without relying on the safety of reggaetón’s guardrails. \n\n“BUCHANANS 18” and “POR UN QLO ASÍ” situate Towers in more recognizable musical circumstances, as does “NO QUIERE FLORES” with música mexicana star Gabito Ballesteros. However, even when he does veer towards the familiar, he often does so in order to defy expectations. “DE GYM,” for instance, could easily have taken a more straightforward thumping path instead of the twistier one it turns towards. The same applies to “SE REVELÓ,” which accents its frenzied merengue with reggaetón bursts. \n\nPerhaps more impressive is the way he lures other Latin acts into these different formats, be it with DFZM on “LA DESPEDIDA” or iZaak on “SURFERITA.” Nigerian singer Omah Lay does his part in the cultural exchange of “NO HAY BREAK,” produced by no less than the like-minded Jamaican genre-hopper Rvssian.\n","short":"Global pop gets a tropical infusion from the Latin star."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/island-boyz/1822664085","playParams":{"id":"1822664085","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YC3UkufiKRSwdBA1BDfHj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822664085/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752870143554,"RTCI":0}}},"1822666383":{"id":"1822666383","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822666383?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/odeal/1221904128","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8c/6a/58/8c6a58a1-3b60-9fcd-a74b-68c25e78cf31/aafd5d4a-8d86-4f8b-a715-3fabefb16e84.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aec0cc","textColor2":"c6dcf4","textColor4":"a9beca","textColor1":"cddef6","bgColor":"354724","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ac/b1/55/acb155eb-b32f-4b59-4d0e-fd13253e9180/efc2973c-e633-42af-bede-e03ac5b26bf2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4c981","textColor2":"f6e07c","textColor4":"d4c570","textColor1":"f6e692","bgColor":"4d573e","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Summer That Saved Me","artistName":"Odeal","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e3/80/99/e3809995-31f6-b4e4-46ce-babcb93aa3f5/199350910272.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2c96e","textColor2":"f7d567","textColor4":"d2bc5c","textColor1":"f7e57e","bgColor":"3e5930","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"After a childhood spent living across Europe, British Nigerian singer Odeal moved back to London in 2017, putting a stop to a phase of his life that had been largely defined by moving between countries and experiencing life’s joys and fluctuations from several locales. “I think what makes my music special is where the inspiration comes from,” Odeal tells Apple Music. “That shift—from being constantly exposed to the world to being limited—shaped the way I saw things and the way I made music.” Yet putting roots back down in London didn’t dull his sense of wonder and craft. \n\nSince 2017’s <i>New Time<i>, the singer has been making music that pays homage to the sweeping confessions and lilting melodic underpinning of neo-R&B influences within Afropop. In characteristic Odeal fashion, <i>The Summer That Saved Me<i> contends with the dynamics of modern romance, adding an unavoidable sense of cosmopolitanism to the mix. The aptly titled “London Summers” affectionately references the communal nature of his home’s warmer months. It all works in service of an intention to celebrate a recently renewed zest for life: “This summer was the first time I really had the freedom to move how I wanted—to go wherever, connect with different versions of myself, and just live,” he says. “This is a project about what it feels like to finally have that access to explore, to feel, and to be free, and every song on it is an extension of that energy.” Below, Odeal walks us through <i>The Summer That Saved Me<i>, track by track. \n\n<b>“Miami” (feat. Leon Thomas)</b>\n“‘Miami’ captures the beginning and the end of a certain moment in summer. It’s about someone I met out there [on my travels]. The first half of the song describes the moment we met: that infatuation and that spark. But the other half reflects what they gave to me: their presence and their honesty. It’s like they became my therapist without even knowing it.”\n\n<b>“London Summers”</b>\n“Summer in London brings out the best in people. There’s this collective mood shift. You see smiles, music in the air, parks packed, and a kind of joy that feels rare and real. This project has the feel of a summer spent around the world, but this track brings it home. It highlights London and how the city lights up when the sun comes out.”\n\n<b>“My Heart”</b>\n“While ‘London Summers’ and ‘Miami’ take a broader, more cinematic approach, capturing locations, energy, and movement, this song narrows the focus down to a single scene. It’s intimate, emotional, and raw. It’s that intense attraction, that heart-pulling moment where logic goes out the window. You’re just letting your heart take control because it still remembers.”\n\n<b>“Obi’s Interlude”</b>\n“This is the most vulnerable point in the project. Obi is what my mum calls me, and in Igbo, it means ‘heart.’ This track is me speaking from that place. No mask, no performance. Just me. It’s a moment where I’m trying to love with my full chest, trying to reach someone who’s been hurt, who’s scared, who keeps pulling away. There’s something painful about offering something real and still not being let in. Like there’s something deeper trying to stop two people from connecting.”\n\n<b>“Monster Boys”</b>\n“‘Monster Boys’ taps into that playful, confident energy. The delivery is light but intentional, and it brings that nostalgic energy of those older Odeal records into the present. It comes right after ‘Obi’s Interlude,’ which is heavy and vulnerable, so this track lifts the mood entirely, but it’s still part of the same journey. The chase isn’t just emotional; there’s also that sweet, exciting side when things start to feel like they could work.”\n\n<b>“Patience”</b>\n“It’s about learning to appreciate someone who’s taking their time—a woman who’s slow and intentional with how she moves. At first, it frustrated me. I wanted things to happen quickly, just to dive in. But over time, I started to understand and admire her patience. She’s careful, she’s grounded, and she’s not rushing into something just because it feels good at the moment. In the chorus, I refer to her as Delilah, drawing from the biblical story. Delilah made Samson change his ways and made him do things he wouldn’t normally do. In the same way, this woman’s patience made me slow down and rethink how I move.“\n\n<b>“In the Chair”</b>\n“It captures the tension between love and absence, the heartbreak of being far from someone who once felt like home. I’ve been moving, traveling the world, chasing purpose, but in doing so, I lost touch with someone I deeply cared for. This song is me finally owning up to that. I wasn’t present when it mattered most, and maybe that absence made her feel like I didn’t deserve her love. The painful part is that I still need it. I still believe in it.”</i></i></i></i></i></i>","short":"Odeal breaks new ground: “This is about how it feels to finally explore.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-summer-that-saved-me/1822666383","playParams":{"id":"1822666383","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02x8WhpXJ9lVDBJAxBxl3Z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822666383/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1221904128","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1221904128?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752860960919,"RTCI":0}}},"1823260371":{"id":"1823260371","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823260371?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":39,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/salute/969249942","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0b/fe/0b/0bfe0b32-167d-819e-d6d9-4addc4b48a5e/Job31f1ac1f-4b0c-4d94-8f43-61c77d0dd60b-197543162-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386776978_2252435924-Time1752601416653.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f6d2d1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c5c2c3","textColor2":"f6d2d1","textColor4":"c7aaa9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/3a/5a/063a5a9a-c063-b185-9b0e-0225ec092517/549b0983-9741-44aa-9bcd-93dadbc7e129.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e0dcd1","textColor2":"fbe8c5","textColor4":"dfccad","textColor1":"fbfbf2","bgColor":"725e4f","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/43/7d/8a/437d8abf-4457-37e1-cd3f-5f0137934fa6/Job2097b0d2-a941-43f1-a1cd-b7f39690e9ad-197543163-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386776984_2252435925-Time1752603257471.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c4bdc4","textColor2":"f7d6d2","textColor4":"c8aeaa","textColor1":"f2e9f2","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false}},"name":"TRUE MAGIC, DELUXE","artistName":"salute","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/54/9f/97/549f97a9-2707-f0d3-2cf7-aa94bd4fa9bc/5054429203479.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"bf99a6","textColor2":"dd989a","textColor4":"b37b7e","textColor1":"ecbdcd","bgColor":"0c090b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","short":"The DJ/producer’s glossy debut goes deeper with added instrumentals."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/true-magic-deluxe/1823260371","playParams":{"id":"1823260371","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5tagdDmG4ZUUSYqSNXQsl1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823260371/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"969249942","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/969249942?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867728397,"RTCI":0}}},"1823326810":{"id":"1823326810","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823326810?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Video Game","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ea-sports-college-football-marching-band/1757519200","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"EA SPORTS College Football 26: Halftime","artistName":"EA SPORTS College Football Marching Band","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/19/b7/1d/19b71d16-e9f1-bad2-cea2-764f4b92c9c1/780163675023.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bcbcbe","textColor2":"d2d1cb","textColor4":"acaba8","textColor1":"e6e6e6","bgColor":"14151c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ea-sports-college-football-26-halftime/1823326810","playParams":{"id":"1823326810","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Ndq2BEGValdiOgBCIdNSj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823326810/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1757519200","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1757519200?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752219458758,"RTCI":0}}},"1823699240":{"id":"1823699240","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823699240?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/president/1808681551","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/98/8d/da/988dda04-781b-5398-13f0-02f90649576c/5eb58a7a-6e63-4a47-a1c7-5695f45ded83.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a4a2a9","textColor2":"d4bda9","textColor4":"ad9b8b","textColor1":"c8c7cf","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"King Of Terrors -

The country superstar has more No. 1 hits than he can count on two hands, and also found happiness offstage with his wife and children, who serve as a primary inspiration for this follow-up to 2022’s <i>Where We Started</i>. Comfort doesn’t mean complacency, though, and on <i>About a Woman</i> Rhett digs more deeply into his personal experiences, sharing intimate stories about marriage, parenthood, and nostalgia for one’s youth.\n\n“What Could Go Right” is a tender portrait of friendship growing into love, inspired by Rhett’s own marriage. “Church” taps into Rhett’s longtime love of fellow singer-songwriter Eric Church, connecting the Chief’s music to youthful romance. “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman” is a slinky groove with twangy flourishes, reminiscent of earlier Rhett tracks like “It Goes Like This” and “Craving You.” The thematic and musical centerpiece of the record is “I Could Spend Forever Loving You,” a spare and sincere love song that’s sure to show up on wedding playlists. \n\nRhett first expanded upon <i>About a Woman</i> with the <i>From a Small Town</i> edition of the album, which shook up the original tracklist and added five new tunes. That iteration kicks off with the Tucker Wetmore collaboration “Small Town Girls,” a loose and groovy ode to women living the simple life. Lanie Gardner joins Rhett on an updated version of “What Could Go Right,” upping the romance with a duet-style performance. Rounding out the mix of new collaborations is Teddy Swims, who lends his powerful, soulful voice to an alternate take of fan favorite “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman.” \n\nThis third <i>(& a Good Ol’ Boy)</i> edition adds three more tracks, taking Rhett’s original vision for the album even further. Front-loaded at the beginning of the album, the trio of new songs begins with the Jordan Davis collaboration “Ain’t a Bad Life,” a sweet and rootsy celebration of country living that reinforces the LP’s familial theme. Blake Shelton joins Rhett on “Old Tricks,” an old-school rocker that gives both singers space to show off their ranges. And “Bottle with Your Name on It” should appeal to fans of Rhett’s more soulful side as he gets funky with some tight harmonies and wah-wah guitar. Below, Rhett talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Ain’t a Bad Life”</b>\n“Say what you will about collaborations in 2025—maybe it's oversaturated, maybe it's not. I just love to do collaborations with my friends, and Jordan has just become one of my really, really close buddies. The hook of the song is ‘Ain't a bad life for a good ol’ boy.’ Me and Jordan were in Arkansas last year duck hunting, and my brother-in-law was out there shooting video, and me and Jordan just got to goof off and do a bunch of the content for the song. I've been playing this song acoustic in soundcheck, and the song just gives me chills. It kind of gives me ‘What's Your Country Song’-like vibes, if you will.”\n\n<b>“Old Tricks”</b>\n“I wrote with my producer Julian Bunetta and a guy named John Ryan. It had always been a band and crew favorite, and we ended up getting Blake Shelton on this track. It’s kind of self-explanatory, but basically the hook of the song is ‘My old tricks don't work anymore.’ In college I could drink 10 beers a day and wake up ready to do it again. At 35, it takes two full days to recover from that. Blake hops on the second verse, and it, in such special Blake fashion, just made the song 150% better.”\n\n<b>“Bottle with Your Name on It”</b>\n“It is the sore thumb of the deluxe, if you will. I wrote it with Julian and John on the exact same trip [as ‘Old Tricks’], and we were literally trying to shoot for this Aerosmith ‘Dude (Looks Like a Lady)’ kind of vibe. We wrote this song. It's basically just about, ‘Hey, you haven't let loose in a while,’ talking about my wife. But the production is so sick, and it makes me want to punch through a brick wall.”\n\n<b>“Overdrive”</b>\n“A song like ‘Overdrive’ would be directly centered towards high school kids—and then people that even, maybe, were high school sweethearts or got back together later in life—to go to reminisce on how innocent that time was. And how just because you’re kind of young, dumb, and reckless at 16 doesn’t mean that you can’t also still be there when you’re 35 or 55.”\n\n<b>“Gone Country”</b>\n“I wish I could say that I had this crazy story of dating this girl that flew in from Chicago and all these things, but I don’t have that story. For me, that song came about, and I’ve shared this story a couple of times, but just being at [Nashville’s] BNA [airport] and realizing how massive our genre has become. For me, it’s always been massive, because it’s what I’ve done for a living and what I’ve been so inundated with. Even people that did not grow up country, they’re just like, ‘I really like this way of living.’ You know what I mean? And that’s sort of where the inspiration from that song came from.”\n\n<b>“Church”</b>\n“The first two Eric Church records—I remember getting my first truck at 16, and Eric Church then was [like] listening to Zach Bryan now. It was kind of underground. He was the outlaw. He would sing about words that you couldn’t say on mainstream radio, all this stuff. So, me and all my buddies, that was our favorite. So, the original way this song got pitched to me was, it ended in heartbreak, like the guy and the girl never saw each other again, but he always reminisced over that time that they bonded over Eric Church. And so I came in on the back half and just rewrote the bridge and the last chorus, because [my story with my wife] ended differently.”\n\n<b>“What Could Go Right”</b>\n“I’ve tried to write that song a million different times, and it has always come out extremely corny and extremely cheesy. And a couple of the guys in the group are dating. One’s married and has kids and all this kind of stuff. And I was telling them about this night that I had with [my wife] Lauren when I was like 21 years old. [We] both were in long relationships with other people, and both kind of ended our relationship with other people at the same time. But there was always, in the back of my mind, this wonder of, like, ‘I wonder if we could ever date again.’ You know what I mean? Because we dated a little bit in high school. That whole song, I was telling the guys on the bus this story, and my buddy John is just writing, taking notes, soaking it all in. And I went to go get some food, and I came back, and they had written the verse and the chorus, and they were like, ‘Does this do it for you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s amazing.’”\n\n<b>“I Could Spend Forever Loving You”</b>\n“I think when I dream of what me and Lauren are going to look like and be doing at 70 years old, all I see is a front porch and a river and a cup of coffee. You know what I’m saying? So, I think it’s always good to dream in your marriage. It’s always good to kind of dream about the future. It’s OK to regret the past. Don’t harp on it, but also, it’s fun to reminisce on the past. Your youth doesn’t have to die because you have kids. Your youth doesn’t have to die just because you’ve been married for 10 years. And it really is a testament to knowing how much love can grow if you’ll allow it.”\n","short":"The second expanded edition of his 2024 album adds three more

Fitness Mix","standard":"If taken as a command, the title of Armin van Buuren’s ninth album is a good reminder to anyone, especially those engaged in rigorous activity: <i>Breathe</i>. “Exercise is a great form of stress relief and helps achieve balance, both physically and mentally,” the Dutch trance pioneer tells Apple Music. <i>Breathe</i> is a guest-packed, 51-track shot of caffeine, and he includes a number of its tracks in his Apple Music Fitness Mix. “I designed this mix to not only inspire others to get into regular exercise, but also to double as a proper soundtrack for those workout sessions,” he says. “It immediately gives a kick of energy, setting the mood, and only rises in tempo and intensity—a great way for those exercising to push themselves to the limit.”\n\nBy the end of the set, “‘Late at Night,’ by Lilly Palmer and Maddix, has that drive that helps achieve that last set or round when fatigue has kicked in,” van Buuren says. “I also love ‘Taking Back Control’ by Adam Beyer. It comes in at that moment in a session where the first bit of tiredness bubbles up and, consequently, when the mind starts thinking about perhaps cutting a session short. This track—in sound and title—does an amazing job of replenishing the energy and motivation, and pulling focus back to the goal.”\n","short":"The trance icon mixes a set for athletes “to push themselves to the limit.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-july-2025-dj-mix/1824311105","playParams":{"id":"1824311105","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824311105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"17976294","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/17976294?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752597090801,"RTCI":0}}},"1824338876":{"id":"1824338876","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824338876?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/j-balvin/444520760","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e3/72/0e/e3720e8c-93b4-5c0e-0b7f-3c8e5a064962/Job494d308d-3c0c-43ea-b302-591c6bb6059a-196494725-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384830688_2236338665-Time1751567752662.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","18161d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ededeb"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"404344","textColor2":"18161d","textColor4":"444248","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ededeb","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4c/37/e6/4c37e616-d20d-7af8-4768-9cdede1371b1/4e4ef6bb-babd-4d99-ac7d-c01692e30dd1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c3940","textColor2":"242525","textColor4":"3a4145","textColor1":"131b1e","bgColor":"90b3c6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/97/5a/20/975a2007-bab9-d758-8589-f08f8f8316c5/Job40edd38a-abab-4caf-9828-436c52178dd1-196494726-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384830687_2236338664-Time1751569308154.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","32302f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ededeb"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"343433","textColor2":"32302f","textColor4":"595857","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ededeb","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/21/08/30/21083008-fd61-60b8-c0bb-fc913673ad25/df73e09f-eb41-41cf-a323-7854d07b72ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"0a0a0a","textColor4":"2c2c2c","textColor1":"0a0a0a","bgColor":"b5b5b4","hasP3":true}},"name":"Mixteip","artistName":"J Balvin","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/36/fc/bb/36fcbb49-7943-f7b9-00a8-1c01892a19e3/25UMGIM87725.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"383837","textColor2":"2c2c2b","textColor4":"545453","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"f5f5f3","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"Back in the summer of 2024, when J Balvin dropped the refocused and revitalized <i>Rayo</i>, he revealed to Apple Music that he had three more albums’ worth of material at the ready. Given how diverse that full-length was, the Colombian hitmaker hinted that what could follow might be similarly expansive from a genre perspective. Yet regardless of whether or not <i>Mixteip</i> contains any of those recordings, this relatively shorter follow-up seizes upon the flexibility of its titular format to show a range of styles over which he can shine and thrive.\n\nWell-timed with a certain cinematic superhero’s reboot, opener “Bruz Wein” harkens back to his rise during the Latin trap surge of the mid- to late 2010s as he proffers hazy, nocturnal bars. Naturally, his status as an elite reggaetonero ensures there are plenty of dembow-driven moments like “No Te Olvido,” the slinky single “Rio,” and the comparatively poppier “Zun Zun” with Lenny Tavárez and Justin Quiles. Subtly calling back to “La Canción,” the slo-mo “PQBL” shifts into a more balladic mode to match its heartbroken theme without sacrificing the rhythm.\n\nMore surprising are Balvin’s successful forays into genres less characteristic of his catalog, generally achieved through credible collaborations with known entities. Veteran salsero Gilberto Santa Rosa gradually guides him into a tropical space with the timely “Misterio” while Dominican merengue Omega raises the tempo considerably for their irresistible “KLK.” The unmistakably British hip-hop sound of “Uuu” benefits both from Stormzy’s prominent feature and the ease with which his host adjusts to the urgency of its beat.","short":"The Colombian hitmaker flexes his multi-genre muscles."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mixteip/1824338876","playParams":{"id":"1824338876","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/315R7c8EPwJiT11OS0t4Xk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824338876/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"444520760","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/444520760?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752836126973,"RTCI":0}}},"1824473650":{"id":"1824473650","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824473650?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kuniyuki-takahashi/269725287","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"We Are Together","artistName":"Kuniyuki Takahashi","artwork":{"width":3543,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/54/a9/eb/54a9ebd9-f744-5bf8-0bcc-e62872de5e61/4250101484797_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3543,"textColor3":"c5c7c6","textColor2":"d0c0a4","textColor4":"ab9f89","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"171f1c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-are-together/1824473650","playParams":{"id":"1824473650","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/578nh8ZsyB7z51xv3Gkfr2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824473650/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"269725287","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/269725287?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867623514,"RTCI":0}}},"1824736272":{"id":"1824736272","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824736272?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/robin-schulz/347433400","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Sugar Radio 200 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Robin Schulz","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e4/88/b2/e488b293-a478-4b11-4e1e-246dd7cfd035/7e978358-d8a1-4025-8168-ccbbd615728b.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbb5a7","textColor2":"e1d5c8","textColor4":"b8b1a6","textColor1":"f9dac9","bgColor":"13221c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sugar-radio-200-dj-mix/1824736272","playParams":{"id":"1824736272","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824736272/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"347433400","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/347433400?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752230173725,"RTCI":0}}},"1824748687":{"id":"1824748687","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824748687?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock & Roll","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/johnny-nasty-boots/1524694462","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"For Your Love -

As the Buffalo rapper builds his Black Soprano Family brand, he concurrently makes clear his determined aspirations towards earning a spot in the top-five-dead-or-alive vanguard of elite MCs. With the release of <i>Summertime Butch 2</i>, a sequel to his well-received 2024 project, he adds another audio document to the growing dossier comprising his craft. \n\nAfter letting Griselda comrade Westside Gunn get a few Flygod bars off on “Jasmine’s,” he proceeds to lay into the current state of rap music, lambasting the lyrical laziness and pop aspirations of a mercifully unnamed cluster of subpar artists. On “Told You So,” he deflects criticism from those who overvalue mainstream chart placements while cruising down his personalized path to hip-hop greatness. Later, he reaffirms both his dope-boy bona fides and his underground classics on “77 Club,” demonstrating a linkage with the past criminality that now thematically fuels his creativity.\n\nGuests like Bruiser Wolf and OT The Real operate at a high level alongside a never-complacent Benny on the Daringer-produced “Hood on Fire” and Nickel Plated’s “Gold Plated Leica,” respectively. Other collabs like the booming “In the Wall” with Bun B and “Why Would I” with G Herbo take him out of his well-established trap-house comfort zone, yet he adapts his knowledgeably streetwise flows with sweat-free dexterity over those beats. Naturally, he shows love for his BSF insiders, making space for Elcamino and Duckman on the cinematic “Pandoras.” \n","short":"Another stunning document in the Griselda rapper’s dossier."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/summertime-butch-2/1825212638","playParams":{"id":"1825212638","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/15Coiav9QHvI7TRvfouPXn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825212638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1281676587","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1281676587?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752867410824,"RTCI":0}}},"1825271176":{"id":"1825271176","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825271176?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arrc/1759086904","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"HOPE -

Yet the payoff to this prolific rap hustle became abundantly clear as his Brent Faiyaz collab “For Me” charted strong and foreshadowed his subsequent placement on XXL’s coveted Freshman Class list. His second album to move away from a long-held Zed-centric title scheme, <i>Rockstar Junkie</i> finds the Florida native settling into fame without departing radically from the sound that got him to this level.\n\nFrom the cinematic scene-setting of “Tubi Movie” and “Private Party” to the reward-reaping hedonism of “Kill the Scene” and “Zuper Sonic,” his nonchalantly melodic delivery suits his distinctive instrumental choices. Furthermore, the robust features list connects his recent past with his elevated present, with established stars like Quavo and Trippie Redd joining returning figures NoCap and ffwaty. Don Toliver contributes to the bleary-eyed vibe of “3am,” while Brooklyn drill don Sleepy Hallow adapts to the mellow mood of “Super Dirty.”","short":"The Florida rapper sees the payoff of his

Album","standard":"The day before the surprise release of Justin Bieber’s seventh album, a series of billboards popped up from Atlanta to Reykjavik—earnest black-and-white photos of the shirtless superstar posing with his wife, Hailey Bieber, and their infant son, Jack Blues, taken by the same photographer who shot the cover art for Kendrick Lamar’s <i>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</i>. In the months before, the 31-year-old was unusually candid, sharing esoteric demos and posting frankly about his struggles with mental health and fame: “Don’t you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already?” he wrote on Instagram in June. Beside the photos was a single word: SWAG.\n\nA lot has changed in the four years since the pop icon’s last record, 2021’s <i>Justice</i>—from a split with longtime manager Scooter Braun to the birth of his first child in August 2024. Meanwhile, it was rumored (correctly, it would turn out) that he’d been quietly working with producers like Dijon and Mk.gee, whose murky takes on ’80s pop and R&B had been buzzing in more alternative circles. Their influence informs much of the 21-track <i>SWAG</i>, whose emphasis on organic textures, reverb-heavy production, and dreamy vocals stands in contrast to the hyper-polished pop anthems of his past. \n\nHere, Bieber wipes the slate clean, countering aching love songs with wispy acoustic demos (“ZUMA HOUSE”), alt-rap experiments (cameos from Gunna, Sexyy Red, Cash Cobain, and, maybe most surprisingly, cloud rap legend Lil B), and a handful of endearingly silly skits featuring the comedian Druski as Biebs’ therapist. Over a moody, understated alt-pop palette, he delivers the most nuanced love songs of his career, addressing marriage in all its complications on tracks like “DAISIES” and “DEVOTION.” “When the money comes/And the money goes/Only thing that’s left/Is the love we hold,” he sings on “BUTTERFLIES,” which begins with a clip of a clash with paparazzi, flipping a vulnerable public moment into a sweet, soulful testament to the things that last. \n","short":"Organic textures, dreamy vocals, and the most nuanced songs of his career."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/swag/1825994646","playParams":{"id":"1825994646","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5vD5M5VW62LL78Ko8x0CVZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825994646/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"320569549","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/320569549?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752877424495,"RTCI":0}}},"1826124841":{"id":"1826124841","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826124841?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twice/1203816887","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a6/93/82/a6938256-ad5b-07c9-4337-893c3cf6083b/a9bc17ed-062f-4896-ae7f-aa43125f6ae1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"39435a","textColor2":"1b2335","textColor4":"3f4859","textColor1":"141d36","bgColor":"cedded","hasP3":true}},"name":"THIS IS FOR (DELUXE)","artistName":"TWICE","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fa/0a/5e/fa0a5ee0-649f-dd33-4c6d-1201c68b2ce3/8809928955216_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"383231","textColor2":"18181a","textColor4":"393333","textColor1":"171617","bgColor":"bda199","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In their first decade as a nine-member K-pop girl group, TWICE became masters at exploring new facets of their concept without ever losing the unwavering cheerfulness that defines it. For <i>THIS IS FOR</i>, TWICE’s fourth full-length album since their 2015 debut, the third-generation squad slides into a comparatively subdued cool-girl persona to explore overlapping themes of female empowerment and romantic frustration, artfully navigating the space between K-pop’s “girl crush” and “bubblegum pop” false binary. \n\nThe cool-girl persona is especially on display in <i>THIS IS FOR</i>’s title track, a high-energy song that starts with a chuckle and a shout-out: “This is for all my ladies who don’t get hyped enough/If you’ve been done wrong, then this your song, so turn it up.” TWICE makes room for feelings of otherness on “THIS IS FOR” before using the synth-pop bop “MARS” to expand on the theme: “Do you ever feel like/You don’t belong in the world?” The tale of tested confidence continues in the rolling rhythms of “G.O.A.T.,” a subunit song that has members Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung comparing themselves to a phoenix rising from the ashes in the aftermath of a breakup: “Got me on a roll, yeah, I breathe fire/Try to bring me low but I go higher.”\n\nReleased in TWICE’s 10th year as a K-pop group and in the immediate aftermath of the JYP Entertainment squad’s successful contributions to the <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> soundtrack, <i>THIS IS FOR</i> sees the group also preparing for their This Is For world tour. The 14-track, mostly English-language album includes five subunit songs that fit particularly well into a high-energy set list as an opportunity for non-participating members to rest. In addition to “G.O.A.T.,” they include “BATTITUDE” (Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, and Mina), “DAT AHH DAT OOH” (Sana, Jihyo, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu), “LET LOVE GO” (Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, and Tzuyu), and “TALK” (Nayeon and Jihyo).\n","short":"The K-pop veterans celebrate female empowerment on their fourth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/this-is-for-deluxe/1826124841","playParams":{"id":"1826124841","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4vk90WpE6wOlE3wCO0md1U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826124841/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1203816887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1203816887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752827616788,"RTCI":0}}},"1826452078":{"id":"1826452078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826452078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sunwoojunga/721478818","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"chan rahn - EP","artistName":"Sunwoojunga","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9c/b2/a7/9cb2a79a-df77-6b64-07d6-7da9eee2246e/cover_KM0023193_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"433430","textColor2":"160706","textColor4":"433634","textColor1":"160401","bgColor":"f6f3ed","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chan-rahn-ep/1826452078","playParams":{"id":"1826452078","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826452078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"721478818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/721478818?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752797030241,"RTCI":0}}},"1826578992":{"id":"1826578992","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826578992?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":33,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/central-cee/1085149646","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/a2/6d/18a26d37-2b59-540f-6fdf-d91e3662ba02/e5f0302d-842e-430e-85c1-46d1d48ce49b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"b19e9f","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a78d87","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"080101","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/88/ee/3888ee85-6d58-a7f6-db5b-c07c3db9e032/e217b8d1-9f4e-4676-ac7d-6477480d800b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"c7bdc0","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"aa8887","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0d1623","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d6/ff/02/d6ff0282-ff5f-0de8-7b94-477079fd145a/380ab1ac-a255-4366-abdd-c9eb6e082754.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"a59a9e","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a89189","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8e/f7/3b/8ef73bb7-3ddd-9ccf-1a52-8dec76297f77/4ef68361-e6c1-40e8-b45b-4ec96a1ccc15.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aa8a7b","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a97355","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030000","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8c/2f/ef/8c2fef2e-6c3f-e8c3-bba3-d609d1f6e28f/7f8eee40-c6b5-4cbc-b29e-e0542975f10c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"b5a8af","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a98c8e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"202736","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/15/13/ae/1513ae22-f27c-9525-8125-44f10a3fcaf7/0e00fb02-c1d0-4d49-98c6-128053bf0531.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bf87ad","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"af828a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2d123e","hasP3":true}},"name":"Apple Music Live: Central Cee","artistName":"Central Cee","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/b6/12/cbb612b1-6c28-f022-3612-8304400e1458/196873363103.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dac9c8","textColor2":"ebd4d2","textColor4":"d1bab8","textColor1":"f6e7e6","bgColor":"6a5151","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Apple Music Live","standard":"Fast-rising superstar Central Cee delivers a homecoming concert for the ages live at London’s famed O2 arena.

See: Scott singing in patois over an Afrobeats riddim alongside Tyla and Vybz Kartel (“PBT”), scatting in the style of Barrington Levy on “SHYNE,” and making his delivery extra gravelly for “FLORIDA FLOW.” But it’s also so much more. \n\nAs a sequel to the label’s seven-song introduction to the squad from 2019, <i>JACKBOYS 2</i> is, to borrow a well-worn cliché, its predecessor on steroids. The guesting MCs alone—Future, Playboi Carti, SahBabii, GloRilla, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Kodak Black—are near exclusively Rolling Loud-headliner-caliber acts. Which is not to mention non-rapping stunt appearances including ad-libbing from 21 Savage and Waka Flocka Flame, along with several storytelling interludes from Scott’s Texas OG, Bun B. \n\nThe intra-crew linkups are especially well-curated. The Cactus Jack team sounds great on pairings like “CHAMPAIN & VACAY” (Scott and Don Toliver), “CONTEST” (Scott and SoFaygo), and “ILMB” (Scott and Sheck Wes). Scott is indeed the tie that binds, but he’s a star who has no problem yielding the spotlight for standout solo showcases like SoFaygo’s “MM3” and Toliver’s “NO COMMENTS.” It’s an incredibly strong showing top to bottom, and with its mid-July 2025 release, it recalls the kind of summer blockbuster that should have fans that much more excited for an inevitable <i>JACKBOYS 3</i>.
