Album","standard":"Indie rock songwriter Indigo De Souza finds the deep mysteries of the unknown equal parts intriguing and terrifying on her fourth album, <i>Precipice</i>. She walks up to the edge and neither leaps nor retreats, but rather looks with a curiosity that moves from fascinated to morbid at a moment’s notice. Throughout <i>Precipice</i>, De Souza gazes at the future and gives its uncertainty her full attention. Take “Crying Over Nothing,” a playful shuffle that dazzles with shimmering synths and De Souza’s near falsetto. On the track, she recalls taking all day to respond to texts, the pain in moving on from a relationship, the physical ache that comes alongside the dissolution of love. She’s in limbo. Elsewhere, she urges herself towards some sort of equilibrium on standout cut “Be Like the Water.” Over handclaps, DIY percussion, and Rhodes piano chords, De Souza encourages her subject to move through this world with joy and adaptability, leaning on deceptively simple advice: “Be like the water/Go where you’re going.”","short":"The indie rocker faces the edge and revels in the full spectrum of emotion."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/precipice/1804207324","playParams":{"id":"1804207324","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vVrYkdm0bPgguWN8rQu8x"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804207324/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1047781911","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1047781911?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754032417804}}},"1805973333":{"id":"1805973333","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805973333?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dewayne/1113740182","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e4/f1/1a/e4f11a02-fbdc-5de1-f85e-a10a7a6f0e87/Jobc7d46269-41ff-4a20-91eb-4dc644e9f9f7-194016052-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380051691_2190355809-Time1748972577441.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","feddcb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5a1731"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cbc5c3","textColor2":"feddcb","textColor4":"ceb2a4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5a1731","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2a/48/82/2a48827c-6a32-6e45-67bc-46cf2385a0f4/804b06fc-0ba1-40ca-a9f0-d1fd41687402.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"323636","textColor2":"25160f","textColor4":"413833","textColor1":"121312","bgColor":"b0c0c3","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c4/96/46/c49646e1-9bf1-05d9-f376-45f8b793cc40/Job42ceeef6-e70e-4a7b-8a07-62fb82796812-194016053-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380051692_2190355810-Time1748973616295.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f6a68a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5a1731"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbc7c5","textColor2":"f6a68a","textColor4":"c8856f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5a1731","hasP3":false}},"name":"june","artistName":"DE'WAYNE","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a3/61/93/a36193cc-a6b8-d41b-55bb-b29f8866b1da/25CRGIM48283.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecdc7","textColor2":"edd5d4","textColor4":"c3aeac","textColor1":"fafdf6","bgColor":"1f0f0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/june/1805973333","playParams":{"id":"1805973333","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805973333/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1113740182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1113740182?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754021804537}}},"1806705948":{"id":"1806705948","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806705948?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cory-hanson/351550194","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I Love People","artistName":"Cory Hanson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5a/40/7e/5a407eb7-7b8d-5850-1f04-d05e30f78e1f/781484093022.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfcccd","textColor2":"e9b3e9","textColor4":"da97c2","textColor1":"dcf6f6","bgColor":"9f2727","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Both within and without his psych-rock outfit Wand, Cory Hanson has been on a lifelong quest to find harmony and ecstasy in a turbulent world that so often denies it. On his 2023 album, <i>Western Cum</i>, he sought it through epic high-voltage guitar odysseys, but on <i>I Love People</i>, the LA maverick lays off the six-string heroics and immerses himself in a soft-focus fantasia of Laurel Canyon gold sounds. With standout serenades like “Bird on a Swing,” “I Don’t Believe You,” and “On the Rocks,” Hanson resembles a rhinestone Rundgren, casting his pristine pop melodies in a countrypolitan patina, while solitary ballads like “Old Policeman” see him ease into the role of a last-call saloon troubadour vying for a spot on the Asylum Records roster circa 1973. But even when working in more formal classic-rock modes, Hanson’s idiosyncratic spirit still cuts through: the elegiac piano hymn “Lou Reed” pays tribute to the Velvet Underground trailblazer; however, Hanson seems less interested in romanticizing his musical innovations than his tai chi skills.","short":"The LA psych-rock maverick embraces Laurel Canyon gold sounds."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-love-people/1806705948","playParams":{"id":"1806705948","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5tVDbgwTS4P1ZciZRqKNVW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806705948/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"351550194","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/351550194?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1753816225682}}},"1806760885":{"id":"1806760885","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806760885?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cody-jinks/363412711","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/cf/6d/6a/cf6d6a36-ded4-47de-425a-a8e736bf637a/aa069293-b431-435a-9c97-f29ba1c1f15e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfc7c4","textColor2":"f1dbcd","textColor4":"c7b6ad","textColor1":"e8f0ea","bgColor":"1d252d","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/94/6f/6d/946f6d14-8c1a-ea32-9914-464ef04c2888/d0209bf1-32fa-4d46-b0cd-9c3c81efd715.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2e2e2e","textColor2":"401a1c","textColor4":"583a3b","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"b8b8b8","hasP3":true}},"name":"In My Blood","artistName":"Cody Jinks","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/00/2f/64/002f64e2-a42f-608d-edfb-75b04ddcf4a7/810065499745.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9c9c9","textColor2":"dddddd","textColor4":"b6b6b6","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"1b1b1b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Cody Jinks is proving to be one of outsider country music’s more prolific artists, releasing this LP just a year after dropping a trio of projects in 2024: the studio album <i>Change the Game</i>, a remastered rerelease of 2012’s <i>30</i> called <i>Backside of 30</i>, and the tribute album <i>Cody Jinks Sings Lefty Frizzell</i>. This is no collection of cutting-room-floor material, though, and it shows the grizzled Texan at the top of his game as a vocalist and a bandleader.

Jinks and his band the Tonedeaf Hippies don’t reinvent the wheel here, instead leaning into the hard-rock-informed Texas country that put him on the map. Highlights include “Lost Highway,” a dark and brooding meditation on life’s mysteries, and “Something Wicked This Way Comes,” a harmony-rich midtempo rocker that plays off the Ray Bradbury horror novel of the same name.

After the conceptual trilogy of their last three albums—2018’s <i>Only Love</i>, 2021’s <i>ULTRAPOP</i>, and 2023’s <i>Perfect Saviors</i>—they decided to focus on urgency over detailed lyrical cohesiveness. “It felt like a new era, like we were leaving something behind,” vocalist and de facto spokesperson Tony Wolski tells Apple Music. “In starting something new, we wanted it to come from a place that was animalistic.”\n\nAs such, <i>THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED</i> is brimming with rage—at consumerism, social media, political divisiveness, post-COVID isolationism, and general disappointment with the direction of society. “When you look at the world writ large, I just don’t understand how this would turn around,” Wolski says. “The levers that could change things in any meaningful way are the people who hold all the power, but they have none of the incentive. So, it’s an overtly negative record. But I do think there’s a glimmer of hope at the end—or at least a lack of hopelessness.”\n\nLike The Armed’s previous output, the record features a rotating cast of band members and guest musicians including Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, ex-Punch vocalist Meghan O’Neil, Michigan hardcore troupe Prostitute, Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou, Rough Francis drummer Urian Hackney, and many more. Below, Wolski comments on each track.\n\n<b>“Well Made Play”</b>\n“It’s a very severe opener. We like doing that on all our albums, but the execution is drastically different than our last few openers. I think the band is at its absolute strongest, physically, musically—everything—right now, so I feel like this has added power. Lyrically, it’s about how self-awareness has become the world’s scarcest resource. It’s about the hyper-celebritization of culture, and how that has sort of removed self-awareness from our skills. It’s like we’ve evolved beyond it or something.” \n\n<b>“Purity Drag”</b>\n“We wanted to front-load the album with brutality. We’re referencing East Bay hardcore on a lot of these songs, so we just wanted it to feel like one of those albums that we got when we were 14, 15, where it just doesn’t relent. I think this has a chorus you can shout along to, and the song is, I daresay, near danceable. But it has very cynical lyrics about leftist disappointment. It’s about seeing the convictions that you have reduced to social trends. It’s about seeing some of the worst type of people espousing your ideas from wildly sanctimonious perspectives and in very ineffectual ways that will never yield results.” \n\n<b>“Kingbreaker”</b>\n“Again, we wanted to front-load the album with rage. My cousin Kenny, who plays bass in the band, this was one of his demos. He originally titled it ‘Optional,’ which was funny because he meant that literally, like, ‘I don’t know if we need to do this.’ It’s basically one bass note shredding for two minutes, and we added a breakdown. Lyrically, the song is about isolation. Post-pandemic, I think we still haven’t pulled out of the fact that everyone lives incredibly siloed lives. The great reintegration that everyone talked about never really happened, at least spiritually.” \n\n<b>“Grace Obscure”</b>\n“This is the first bona fide punk song we’ve made in a minute. It’s a just a blistering tempo, a double-time shredder. Meghan O’Neil has been playing with us as a vocalist, and she was the singer of a band called Punch back when we were starting out. I would say that Punch is one of my favorite hardcore bands of all time, and I think that Meghan is probably my favorite hardcore vocalist ever. Her vocals are completely insane. This is one of the first songs that we’ve done with her taking front and center, which is really cool. You can hear some East Bay hardcore here, and the chorus is a not-too-subtle allusion to AFI.” \n\n<b>“Broken Mirror” (feat. Prostitute)</b>\n“Similar to ‘Kingbreaker,’ this started as a very primitive, emotionally driven demo. I recorded a super dumb caveman drumbeat. After recording that, I just hit record and made up the chord progression. And I didn’t tune the guitar. Then I came up with the vocals in five or six minutes. The goal was to reduce artistic expression to the most primitive, most immediate version of yourself. Lyrically, it’s very much inspired by a Protomartyr song called ‘Tarpeian Rock’ where they’re just yelling shit that needs to be thrown from the rock. Moe from Prostitute sings on this, and his voice has a lot more gravitas than mine. They’re probably the scariest, most important punk band right now.” \n\n<b>“Sharp Teeth”</b>\n“After five brutal songs, to just slam into a Red Hot Chili Peppers-ass song felt hilarious to me. It’s a classic Armed juxtapositional whiplash kind of thing. Urian and Kenny, the rhythm section on this song, hit this unbelievable, heavy groove. In contrast to the grooviness and levity of that instrumental, the lyrics are about the hands-down worst time in my entire life. I don’t want to talk about it, and I wouldn’t have even felt comfortable singing it, but the fact that Cara [Drolshagen] is singing this one felt therapeutic. It’s really dark subject matter over a really happy track.”\n \n \n<b>“I Steal What I Want”</b>\n“This one has been around for a long time. I think I wrote this and ‘AN ITERATION,’ which was on <i>ULTRAPOP</i>, around the same time. But sometimes we need to get better in order to make a song work. It was almost like a space rock thing originally, but it needed to hit harder. So we made it more rigid, and then Troy [Van Leeuwen] recorded those guitar leads that are like equal parts Robert Smith and Adrian Belew, and it just fucking clicked. Lyrically, it’s about trying to enjoy the end of the world and holding on to what you love as everything else falls apart. That idea might be super well-trodden and not particularly original, but holy shit, does it feel authentic to me right now.” \n\n<b>“Local Millionaire”</b>\n“I have the distinct memory of Kenny playing me this demo when we were recording the last album and thinking, ‘Oh, man, this song is going to be so fucking sick.’ Everyone needs a song for the haters, and this is our song for the haters. It’s about self-obsession and turning that obsession into hatred for people who you subconsciously see becoming the better version of you. The band METZ was breaking up while we were recording this, so we put those harmonized vocalizations in the background to pay tribute to them. They’re a fucking awesome band, and it feels like something they would do.” \n\n<b>“Gave Up”</b>\n“This is probably the most traditional Armed song on the record. I don’t mean that to diminish it, it just feels like it could live on some of our earlier records. It’s a classic Kenny song, and he made the initial prototype of what our compositions sound like. Lyrically, it’s about hollowing yourself out to fit in, which is I think something that every single person alive does and has done to some extent. But it gets out of hand when you turn yourself into an empty vessel for the opinions of others. It touches on rage-bait culture, the clout of consensus, and becoming a human Supreme T-shirt.” \n\n<b>“Heathen”</b>\n“I wrote this track, and it took me a minute to be courageous enough to share it with the rest of the band, because there’s a lot of conventional shit in it. But I’m glad I did. Patrick [Shiroishi]’s sax playing reminds me of Bowie’s <i>Blackstar</i>. Cara and I are both singing dozens of robot harmonies, which makes this weird, fragile, genderless voice. It’s melodramatic as fuck, but I think it’s a really cool moment in the context of this record in particular. On another of our records, it may have blended in more. It’s kind of an emotional soak after all this instantaneous rage.” \n\n<b>“A More Perfect Design”</b>\n“We wanted to have a track that just left it all out there. And we wanted to leave no doubt in someone who listened to this that we had given everything we had to it. Converge is one of my favorite bands, and what makes them so unique is the ability to perform in a way that captures that extreme emotion. A lot of extreme music is not successful in that way. It’s extreme, it’s fast, but it’s also clean and technical, and all that stuff can kind of zap the anger or angst. So, this song is very much effect over technique. No one was allowed to tune their instrument before we recorded this. It needed to be catharsis to the point of, like, ‘Oh, shit. Maybe we went too far.’”\n","short":"The punk collective’s “animalistic” sixth album: “It’s an overtly negative

EP","standard":"Born in Lima, Peru, Sofia Kourtesis moved to Germany at 17 with dreams of studying film, and to escape her former home’s conservative views. In a way, the Berlin-based producer approaches her music like a filmmaker, layering textures, field recordings, and emotion into lush songs that move and breathe. Her work blends the political with the personal, as on her 2023 debut <i>Madres</i>, which sampled anti-homophobia protest chants and was dedicated to her mother and the surgeon who saved her mother’s life. <i>Volver</i> is a statement of joy, defiance, and resistance, as Kourtesis celebrates the LGBT+ communities—especially trans women—who inspire her activism and art.\n\nThe bittersweet mood of “Corazón,” which laments distance, brightens with “Unidos,” a vivid disco-house collaboration with Daphni (aka Caribou’s Dan Snaith) turned mantra: “You got everything you need/You never let them get you down.” Layers of percussive rhythms keep spirits high on “Ballumbrosio,” its commanding groove and warm vocals conjuring scenes of communal joy, like people dancing around a fire. Kourtesis closes the EP with the bright and sweetly tender “Sisters,” a song about embracing her community, even from an ocean away.","short":"A statement of joy, defiance, and resistance."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/volver-ep/1810769843","playParams":{"id":"1810769843","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810769843/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"931699087","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/931699087?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754035839746}}},"1810807922":{"id":"1810807922","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810807922?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/madonna/20044","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/f9/be/dcf9bec0-a5c1-ed57-ec28-b70fe0afbe87/c2bc9663-adf1-4294-9685-179a5aa1b63c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d4d6","textColor2":"ececec","textColor4":"cdcdcd","textColor1":"f5f5f6","bgColor":"525252","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/b2/8d/b3b28d66-1a36-b595-aff0-02c48e73df76/7932831b-84a4-42ac-95c8-f588ec7f4006.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d1d1d1","textColor2":"eff1f1","textColor4":"cccece","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"414343","hasP3":true}},"name":"Veronica Electronica","artistName":"Madonna","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/53/48/d7/5348d71b-f4a4-ba61-2118-7c853d7f0e1f/603497812462.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"dfdfdf","textColor2":"f8f8f8","textColor4":"d9d9da","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"616163","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"During the extra-long recording process of her 1998 magnum opus, Madonna came up with an alter ego drawn from her confirmation name—a character she felt so strongly she nearly named the album after it, though ultimately she decided on <i>Ray of Light</i>. Her entrancing seventh album introduced electronica to the American mainstream and reignited the relevance of the 39-year-old new mother at a time when pop music was trending teenage and perky. It was a pivotal moment for the icon both spiritually and creatively, and she’s often cited the record as her proudest work. \n\nBack then, she planned to follow up the original album with a companion disc of harder-hitting remixes, though the project was ultimately sidelined due to <i>Ray of Light</i>’s runaway success. (The boundary-pushing original would become one of the best-selling albums by a woman of all time and earn Madonna three Grammys, including Best Pop Album.) More than two and a half decades later, the project has finally resurfaced with remastered versions of the original remixes and one previously unreleased demo (“Gone Gone Gone”) recorded during the <i>Ray of Light</i> sessions with the producer Rick Nowels. Here the classic album’s slinky singles are pushed even deeper, bringing songs like “Drowned World / Substitute for Love” and “Nothing Really Matters” from the chill-out lounge to the dance floor with pulsing edits from William Orbit, Sasha, BT, Victor Calderone, and the late Peter Rauhofer, aka Club 69. \n","short":"Remixes from 1998’s Ray of Light add depth to the pivotal album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/veronica-electronica/1810807922","playParams":{"id":"1810807922","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JgIGypHO489ni7EtpMmdz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810807922/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"20044","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/20044?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754003930374}}},"1811017804":{"id":"1811017804","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811017804?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/crungus/1726085623","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Hollow","artistName":"Crungus","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/53/7a/42/537a4207-1f22-7c67-9379-4e8590ca295c/199350417771.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d0a9","textColor2":"97c4ad","textColor4":"7fa492","textColor1":"fdfbca","bgColor":"1e2726","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hollow/1811017804","playParams":{"id":"1811017804","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2OjLXu2xlRzb9rm2kHxaT6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811017804/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1726085623","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1726085623?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171145639}}},"1811139336":{"id":"1811139336","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811139336?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/duke-dumont/257148267","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/d5/5f/69d55fe7-61f8-efff-1ce3-42b962d16460/f659c9dc-a033-4966-ba7b-0fb347793e7b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8b6d7","textColor2":"b0c0f6","textColor4":"91a3d2","textColor1":"cdd7fc","bgColor":"123046","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/d6/22/efd6222f-d80c-5985-7611-bbe835d6005e/895e728e-64fb-42b5-9fe9-7d3da7afc49d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"92b5cf","textColor2":"92c2f1","textColor4":"7da7cb","textColor1":"acd3f6","bgColor":"2a3c35","hasP3":true}},"name":"Union","artistName":"Duke Dumont","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3543,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f0/5a/91/f05a91ee-b7bb-e654-1c88-1ff0c847dc9e/25UMGIM60711.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3543,"textColor3":"172f2f","textColor2":"001608","textColor4":"173835","textColor1":"000a00","bgColor":"73c0ec","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When British producer Duke Dumont released his debut album <i>Duality</i> in April 2020, clubs and festivals around the world were closed down, leaving dance floors empty. The cover of his follow-up, <i>Union</i>, feels like a response to that absence: a candid shot from one of his shows, capturing a packed crowd mid-dance, arms raised in anticipation. More than a photo memory, it’s a testament to the communal power of live music. \n\nIf <i>Duality</i> nodded to the glory days of ’90s house, <i>Union</i> embodies the energy of a UK rave: harder, faster, clubbier—made to be played loud, start to finish. The title track jump-starts the adrenaline with a cinematic crescendo, seamlessly moving into “The Chant,” slow-burning electronica with a euphoric payoff. Later, “Hit Em” offers a momentary breather with mellow breakbeats before resuming sweat mode. Collaborations like the resilient “Ain’t Giving Up” with Clementine Douglas and the haunting “All My Life” with Panama highlight Dumont’s pop sensibilities, pairing vocals aching for connection with soaring melodies. <i>Union</i>’s most poignant instincts arrive on “Feels Like This,” where poet Tony Walsh sums up the spirit of it all: “Call it an energy, call it a vibe/Call it a spirit, we share it inside/And here on the dance floor, this spirit has chance for/The loving of living a life fit to dance for.”\n","short":"Come together with the producer’s euphoric second

Album","standard":"A decade on from their 2016 dance directive “Handclap,” Fitz and The Tantrums remain as committed as ever to the job of bringing our palms together to a snappy backbeat. The LA group’s sixth album, <i>Man on the Moon</i>, refines their post-Motown alt-pop aesthetic down to a science, presenting a virtual jukebox loaded with 14 potential singles that never relent in their hip-shaking and spirit-lifting intent. “OK OK OK” compacts all of The Tantrums’ signature traits—spine-cracking rhythms, blasts of brass, soul-revue energy, and, yes, handclaps—into an instant floor-filler that clocks in under two minutes flat, while the space-themed, string-laden title track hovers somewhere between Stax and the stars. And even when Fitz and co. tweak the formula here and there—be it with the Phoenix-like cosmopolitan pop of “Perfume” or the tropical R&B vibe of “Waste My Time”—the net result is the same: clothes drenched in sweat, dancing shoes worn down to the sole, and a smile smeared across your face.

Album","standard":"From the outside, it appeared that the 25-year-old actor turned singer was living her best life the past few years: releasing her debut album <i>Snow Angel</i> in 2023, starring as Regina George in the 2024 <i>Mean Girls</i> musical, making her 2024 Coachella debut with a surprise appearance from Kesha. But the way Reneé Rapp tells it, her life was privately a mess. “I think you’re at constant war with yourself, and you’re in constant competition with you and the best version of you,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “You are constantly feeling like you need to be doing more, like you need to be working harder, like you are not good enough, like you are just at the mercy of everyone and everything around you—and you are.”\n\nIn search of what had made her fall in love with music in the first place, Rapp pulled a hard reset: undergoing ketamine therapy, going off her birth control, disregarding the advice of guys who sit in boardrooms. The result is <i>BITE ME</i>, her second full-length album, and her most personal. Open-hearted ballads about relationships in all their messy drama (“Why Is She Still Here?”) are countered by devil-may-care disco jams about 40-hour one-night stands (“Kiss It Kiss It”). “Can I tell you a secret? I’m so sick of it all,” Rapp purrs on the joyfully sleazy “Leave Me Alone,” before throwing caution to the wind: “Come get wet in the deep end/T-t-t-take it off/C-c-c-cannonball!” (She also fires a not-so-subtle shot at the series she once starred in, <i>The Sex Lives of College Girls</i>.)\n\n“I set out to impress myself,” she tells Lowe. “I set out to make music I would want to listen to, and I set out to not compromise a single thing about my personality and be unwaveringly loud about it—and I did that.” Somewhere in <i>BITE ME</i>’s reckless abandon, Rapp found a sense of peace. “This album to me feels like ripping off all of your clothes, stripping naked and running down a street after you’ve been violently crying,” she says. “And you’re almost laughing because you’re like, ‘I’m done with this. I’m sick of this. I’m not letting this hold me.’”\n","short":"Her second LP finds peace in reckless abandon: “I set out to impress myself.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bite-me/1814463235","playParams":{"id":"1814463235","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ULnaZahd0zTGVUBVQO6mN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814463235/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1626560688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1626560688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754046055373}}},"1814652100":{"id":"1814652100","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814652100?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/morgan-wade/526632293","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b8/c0/1a/b8c01a74-fc3b-8e9f-b7da-b6e093c2529e/Job2fc9bf22-04b4-470e-89ea-7ce2d08f0410-193562204-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379179587_2181999464-Time1748455759180.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d2cdc0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"080809"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b5b2ab","textColor2":"d2cdc0","textColor4":"aeaaa1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"080809","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f9/e9/48/f9e9487b-4a99-eeb8-fa65-7895c036ccee/8a61021b-2165-40c1-a610-834f84035339.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dadada","textColor2":"ececec","textColor4":"cfcfcf","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"5c5c5c","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/dd/03/88/dd038828-09a3-2da1-c46e-5f04f05d2232/Job17e0e3f1-4c70-4fbb-95eb-56464c34cd02-193562205-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379179586_2181999465-Time1748457177244.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","030303"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"080809"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"201c1b","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"201d1a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"080809","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b4/8d/47/b48d4766-63ff-88e1-a848-42db1d4079f9/7e498d95-7ce2-40c9-9c46-dade812ad829.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cbc8bf","textColor2":"e5ded3","textColor4":"c4bdb5","textColor1":"efebe0","bgColor":"3e3a3d","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Party Is Over (recovered)","artistName":"Morgan Wade","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7d/61/dc/7d61dc75-7a66-2b78-8560-769ea92de474/196872890587.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"282426","textColor2":"0f0e13","textColor4":"2b2527","textColor1":"0c0d12","bgColor":"988479","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Like its predecessor, Morgan Wade’s fifth album is an intensely personal affair. The Virginia-born country singer-songwriter wrote all 11 tracks on <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> by herself, something she first did on 2024’s <i>Obsessed</i>, and the resulting album is a compelling listen. Produced by longtime collaborator and band member Clint Wells, <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> opens with its title track, which, despite its thematic connections to newer material on the LP, Wade wrote years earlier—“recovering” it from her vault of unreleased material, as the album title suggests. That tune is sweeping and anthemic, as Wade painfully considers feelings of love that last well beyond a relationship’s expiration date. \n\n“East Coast” is similarly wrenching, though it dips into Wade’s darker side as she imagines drowning herself to get the attention of an ex-flame. It’s not all down and out, though, like on “Parking Garage” when Wade finds comfort in another broken heart, and the bright and sweet “Stay,” in which she hopes to become a better person for “the one.” Wade closes the album with the vivid and emotional ballad “Hardwood Floor,” which tells of a woman struggling to become pregnant.","short":"Vivid and intensely personal songwriting across 11 tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-party-is-over-recovered/1814652100","playParams":{"id":"1814652100","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ftz2rq0jacN73sVzOqQs8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814652100/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"526632293","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/526632293?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754023852304}}},"1814944527":{"id":"1814944527","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814944527?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hudson-westbrook/1740125054","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ba/b4/68/bab46887-d8a2-0364-ce3e-4c52649c17b6/Job27af91fe-3026-494c-a4a2-c92994d2f006-192701961-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377479353_2165053621-Time1747436655920.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dc946b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"15271b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c08f53","textColor2":"dc946b","textColor4":"b47c5a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"15271b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/ea/b8/0aeab80f-0b7b-ebfc-82df-433ec7832227/6eb5bced-14f8-49d7-87b1-1ea325449546.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2d2a","textColor2":"141310","textColor4":"353430","textColor1":"0b0a08","bgColor":"bab8b2","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/57/35/ae/5735aef7-2bee-46c1-9cf3-33f1ed74d55a/Jobf753f87a-94e6-4cc1-9084-a7235c200600-192701960-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377479349_2165053623-Time1747435634921.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c5a68e","textColor2":"d6b75d","textColor4":"b69d4f","textColor1":"eac3ab","bgColor":"333418","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/bc/e8/ea/bce8ea6b-ca57-9b2d-06f8-e52a269efc15/c19c2d70-4c5d-48d2-9490-5381c5ee977a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfb07a","textColor2":"e5c296","textColor4":"c7aa82","textColor1":"eec98b","bgColor":"504c34","hasP3":true}},"name":"Texas Forever","artistName":"Hudson Westbrook","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/f9/56/e1f95687-e778-ee4b-f6b0-bbc6b293e1bb/093624831686.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b49972","textColor2":"f1a97c","textColor4":"c38c66","textColor1":"deba8b","bgColor":"0d190d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Hudson Westbrook wears his Texas influences on his sleeve on this full-length debut collection, paying tribute to his home state sonically and thematically across an ambitious 17 tracks. A quickly rising up-and-comer, Westbrook tells Apple Music that <i>Texas Forever</i> spans a formative period and reflects the growth he’s experienced since first coming onto the scene with his viral single “Take It Slow.”\n\n“There are some songs on here from a year and a half ago,” Westbrook says. “And you’re like, ‘This is the headspace I was in when I wrote that song.’ It’s so weird how life changes and how you look back on your album. It’s really cool, because I have the opportunity to show an era of who I am, and then there’s another era, and there’s another era.”\n\n<i>Texas Forever</i> opens with “Darlin’,” a soulful, deceptively sweet song about stealing someone’s girl. The title track likens Westbrook’s deeply rooted connection to his home state to a long-term relationship, and features some of his most image-rich songwriting. “Funny Seeing You Here” is a full-circle kiss-off to an ex-flame, with prominent fiddle and a fiery guitar solo upping the romantic drama. The album also features Westbrook’s hit single “House Again,” a clever and wrenching breakup song that plays with the distinction between a house and a home. Fellow up-and-comer Mackenzie Carpenter is the album’s sole feature, lending her agile lilt to the wistful midtempo ballad “Lie to Me.” Below, Westbrook shares insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Texas Forever”</b>\n“Loyalty to Texas would mean, to me, I’ll never run tracks in my songs. It’s going to be real drums, real everything. And if I can’t stop my live band in the middle of the show without a track playing, then I’m done making music. I don’t like tracks. And, of course, that goes for my lane. Do whatever you want, whatever, but not hating. Melodies matter a lot, and topics of songs. And loyalty to Texas is like, I’ll starch my jeans, but I’m not going to wear a cowboy hat everywhere I go. And then [I’ll take] any chance that I have to give back. There’s a certain thing that if you’re from Texas, you don’t say that you’re country. Nothing on my album is like, ‘I’m country.’ It’s like, ‘I’m drinking beer on a…’ It’s like, ‘Woke up this mornin’ in boots and jeans.’ It’s just topics, you know? And I think that’s my favorite thing to write.”\n\n<b>“House Again”</b>\n“We went from a house out in the country—we had five acres, six acres—and then we went to a golf course with a [small] front yard. And so, it felt like a house. My parents put stained concrete, and we had white tile instead, and you had our chaps hung on the wall, but there’s no room for chaps to be hung on the wall anymore. You know what I mean? It’s little things like that that I think make a house a home. You go stay in the bachelorette houses in Nashville, that ain’t a home. Your handprints in the sidewalk whenever you did that with all your family, mud tracks where you drove a four-wheeler through, or anything that’s humanly interacted with by a human. The house can’t interact back—we just make it a home, and we fill it out. I think that’s the difference between an IKEA sofa and a leather one that your grandma passed you down. Little things like that. So, that’s what makes a house a home to me.”\n\n<b>“Hill I’ll Die On”</b>\n“The whole album starts off with me stealing this guy’s girl. I’m calling her up, right? I’m calling her darling. He’s calling her up. And then, it kind of just goes through the whole story of boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, heartbreak, love, having fun, and then it ends on ‘Hill I’ll Die On.’ And I just remember after that song, nothing was planned. I didn’t have that tracklisting. I had no idea until I produced it, obviously. And I went into the studio, and at the end of it, I was like, ‘Y’all keep playing.’ And then they kept playing, and I was like, ‘All right, keep playing.’ And then I was like, ‘All right, y’all just rip.’ I just told the studio players, ‘Do whatever you want.’ And so, they just started playing towards the whole end. There’s like a whole minute outro. And then, I don’t know, I think also it represents everything that I am as a person.”","short":"The country singer wields his state pride: “It’s an era of who I am.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/texas-forever/1814944527","playParams":{"id":"1814944527","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Ob2sg38jCEu6s25riXlPe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814944527/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1740125054","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1740125054?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754022735080}}},"1815762387":{"id":"1815762387","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815762387?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dread-altar/1815762391","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Grim -

On this seventh full-length studio album from the Lawrence County, KY, native, Childers goes even bigger and bolder, recruiting superproducer and noted spiritual seeker Rick Rubin to helm a kaleidoscopic collection of wild, weird songs. <i>Snipe Hunter</i> opens with “Eatin’ Big Time,” a freewheeling rocker that takes its title from a phrase Childers and his band The Food Stamps deploy to mark milestones and celebrate successes. With a lyric as wild as his wailing vocal—there’s a verse about shooting and then skinning a man in a “motherfucking mansion”—it’s a fitting entry into this new world Childers built. “Bitin’ List” gets right to the point, opening with the line “To put it plain, I just don’t like you” while The Food Stamps sink their teeth into an old-time-adjacent arrangement. “Tirtha Yatra” pairs spiritual musings with a swinging beat, as Childers waxes poetic on the Bhagavad Gita. And longtime fan favorite “Oneida,” a staple of Childers’ live sets since 2017, gets its long-awaited studio treatment, bridging the gap between the burgeoning days of his career and this obvious high point.","short":"A big and bold swing—with an assist from the legendary Rick Rubin."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/snipe-hunter/1818393806","playParams":{"id":"1818393806","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/00rssxYxFqqdbuO1lz1Gxa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818393806/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"473667472","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/473667472?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754033246983}}},"1818471603":{"id":"1818471603","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818471603?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%24uicideboy%24/1081606072","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3b/9a/98/3b9a9803-5e42-95cd-7c29-b6d52ed2f84b/Job87f705cc-5e5d-432d-9530-3ec704b3a598-198866075-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389296872_2272896035-Time1753903780357.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","251c1a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c0bea1"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2c2f2a","textColor2":"251c1a","textColor4":"433b32","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c0bea1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c1/b9/db/c1b9db1a-7b27-5887-b3a3-844ad8db0cbd/Jobbca58bb1-4541-4a74-bacf-f8a3bb9b83a3-198866076-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389296873_2272896034-Time1753907976648.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"4a453b","textColor2":"2f261e","textColor4":"50473c","textColor1":"27231d","bgColor":"d4ccb2","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8b/f2/2c/8bf22cc6-03c2-eac5-e415-32ef8c3b79e8/2bfe119e-d190-4c41-8e28-f0eaf345ac30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bdb7a2","textColor2":"cfd0d2","textColor4":"b1b2b4","textColor1":"ded7bc","bgColor":"3b3a3c","hasP3":true}},"name":"THY KINGDOM COME","artistName":"$uicideboy$","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/73/c1/38/73c13888-eb24-8bd1-f7a2-997bacb84f79/199350860188.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2a251f","textColor2":"181817","textColor4":"38332e","textColor1":"060605","bgColor":"ba9f89","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The New Orleans-born cousins (Ruby da Cherry and Scrim) have little in the way of crossover hits or mainstream press. But since emerging on SoundCloud in 2014 with their depressive, Memphis-inspired blend of horrorcore, witch house, and emo rap, the duo’s nihilism has proved surprisingly potent—their Grey Day Tour was the third-highest-grossing rap tour of 2024. On their fifth album, <i>THY KINGDOM COME</i> (a modest catalog, until you count the additional nine mixtapes and 30-plus EPs they’ve released in just over a decade), $uicideboy$ mostly stick to their bread and butter: themes of addiction and abjection, morose yet baroque titles, and the rap game’s bleakest flexes. (“Smokin’ on shit that smell like body rot,” they chant on BONES collab “Now and at the Hour of Our Death.”) But occasionally, a bit of levity creeps in, be it a jubilant sample of a NOLA bounce classic (Big Freedia’s “Gin in My System”) on “Napoleon” or the ’80s-R&B gloss on the otherwise grim “Full of Grace (I Refuse to Tend My Own Grave).”","short":"The duo’s potent, nihilistic blend of

It’s easy to see why: Her catchy melodies are buried beneath layers and layers of guitar, the drums boom and crash, the basslines keep the ship afloat. Though she’s been compared to genre icons of yore like Slowdive and The Jesus and Mary Chain, she views herself more in the realm of dream-pop bands. “I love all those bands for sure, but I think the bands that I take the most influence from are definitely more dream-poppy bands,” she tells Apple Music. “So I grew up listening to a lot of Beach House, Cocteau Twins, and I definitely take inspiration from them, especially vocal-wise and how I sing in my music.” \n\nCacophonies of melodious noise surrounds Wisp on <i>If Not Winter</i>, and her voice manages to pierce through and rise to the top. Take “After dark,” which buzzes with crisp guitar lines and sloshing hi-hats. Her vocals move through the composition like a fever dream, yearning for something she can’t quite reach. This emphasis on emotion and lyrical prowess was a focal point for Wisp while creating the album. “I try to put as much emotion as I can into my own music, and I always try to write about something that is true to me and something that I'm feeling,” she says. “And that way it doesn't feel faked or it doesn't feel ingenuine to my sound.”","short":"The San Francisco artist is at the vanguard of

Album","standard":"Few pairings in modern hip-hop history have had the impact of Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist. More than just another timely rapper-producer duo project, 2020’s <i>Alfredo</i> differed in tone from the former’s critically acclaimed collabs with Madlib and the latter’s work with Action Bronson, Boldy James, and Earl Sweatshirt. However, capturing the unique magic of a confirmed classic a second time around has challenged many in this genre, as so many middling sequels show. In this case, though, both artists rise to the proverbial occasion with cinematic flair, changing the thematic crime scenery from mafioso to yakuza along the way.\n\nSimply titled <i>Alfredo 2</i>, their recorded reunion draws from a corresponding short film released ahead of the album drop, the narrative playing up their perceived distance only to bring them back together in dramatic fashion. Even without that context, these 14 songs showcase what makes their partnership so dynamic. Gibbs is downright gripping from the get-go, riding the gleaming groove of “1995” with cocksure bars likening him and his cohort to <i>Lethal Weapon</i> heroes Riggs and Murtaugh. That attitude persists on the defiant “Skinny Suge II” and the profane “Lemon Pepper Steppers,” both backed by airy, jazz-inflected production. \n\nHis way with words remains poetically brash, vividly detailing his point of view on cuts like “Gas Station Sushi” and “Mar-a-Lago.” Yet as good as these verses would sound even over some pretty basic boom-bap, Alchemist’s instrumentals elevate the proceedings without fail. His ability to cultivate and maintain a vibe is all but unparalelled, putting listeners at ease with the hazy comforts of “I Still Love H.E.R.” and “Jean Claude.” Elsewhere, he exercises an extraordinary restraint with the soul of “Shangri La,” never letting the samples overpower the MC.","short":"The magic is back!

After a staggeringly prolific run in the previous years (one album and six mixtapes in 2022, two albums and two mixtapes in 2023), YoungBoy released just one record in 2024. Days before the intended release of his seventh album, <i>I Just Got a Lot on My Shoulders</i>, he was arrested on a number of charges, and he spent much of that year in a Utah county jail before receiving a 27-month prison sentence after accepting a plea deal in a federal gun case that had been ongoing for years. It was the latest in a seemingly endless series of setbacks for the rapper, whose “Legal issues” section on Wikipedia is nearly as long as the one for “Career.”\n\nYoungBoy’s 2025 has so far been much brighter, beginning with his release on probation in April after years of house arrest. Then, on May 28, he was granted a presidential pardon, ending the lengthy legal battle that had hampered his career for half a decade. This explains the newfound swell of patriotism at play in the title of his eighth studio album, <i>MASA</i> (short for <i>Make America Slime Again</i>), as well as in the triumphant “XXX,” which opens with “The Star-Spangled Banner” wailed on electric guitar before YB crows: “The police watching, but they ain’t gonna stop me!” The album’s 30 tracks are brighter than its world-weary predecessor, veering between bouncy Louisiana street rap (“Diesel”) and power ballads (“Cold World”). But he finds room here and there for a bit of introspection regarding his recent years: “Never knew how hard it’d get/Never knew it’d come to this,” he singsongs on “Where I Been” before concluding: “After all, I’m amazed that I conquered it.”\n","short":"A much brighter 2025 for the rapper brings about his patriotic eighth

Album","standard":"In 2024, when Chino Pacas dropped <i>Que Sigan Llegando Las Pacas</i>, he couldn’t have had a bigger spotlight on him. A major-label full-length debut backed by Drake and Fuerza Regida, with prominent features from both, swiftly put the rising teenage star in an enviable position. Less than a year later, he returns with a sophomore album intended to further elevate his standing in the música mexicana scene and to better differentiate himself from the current profusion of viral sensations. \n\nIf <i>CRISTIAN</i> is any indication, Chino Pacas has a great deal to offer his listeners in the coming years. A robust follow-up with high-profile guests like Luis R Conriquez and Tito Double P, it situates the young artist within styles both familiar and favorable. There is, of course, an ample selection of corridos, beginning with “CHAMAQUITO” and carrying into even more defiant and evocative expressions like “ZUMBANDO” and the standout “FLOTA” with Neton Vega. On a different tip, the Banda Otro Pedo collab “NO ES UN JUEGO” gives his preferred approach a decidedly lusher, more ornate refresh. An apparent 180-degree shift, “GTO” takes him into a seemingly Bay Area-inspired hip-hop mode opposite Latin rap fixture Santa Fe Klan. \n\nWhere some artists of his generation might be inclined to simply stay in their lane, he makes subtler adjustments that justify his profile. On the beautifully arranged “ANOCHE,” he reveals a sensitive romantic side in wondrous contrast with the harder stuff. His earnest cover of Tropicalísimo Apache fave “OJITOS MENTIROSOS” not only comes naturally, but also indicates a knowledgeable appreciation for his predecessors. \n","short":"The teenage música mexicana star’s sophomore set raises the bar."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cristian/1825265240","playParams":{"id":"1825265240","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1g5DtpsRYh0UzdkxHEZY4F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825265240/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666295765","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666295765?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754023117836}}},"1825324020":{"id":"1825324020","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825324020?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/idyll/493009680","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Voyeur -

The second iteration of their collaborative mix project finds the pair serving up their personal favorite funk, soul, and R&B classics—with a few eyebrow-raising updates—as a healing balm for the troubles of the modern world.\n\n“The world is in need of good vibrations,” Snoopadelic tells Apple Music. “The Mothership Connection is making an <i>Emergency Landing</i>. Me and Green Lantern [are] taking you from P-funk to G-funk and everything in between, Death Row style!” That means the infallible work of Parliament-Funkadelic, Kool & The Gang, and Rick James, of course, along with updates from voices like October London, JANE HANDCOCK, and Diamond Ortiz. As a listening experience, <i>Live from the Mothership II</i> feels like what would be playing at either Snoop or Green Lantern’s homes. “The Mothership project is all about raising the vibration, taking you higher musically,” Green Lantern says. “Imagine a cool-ass house party in outer space—that’s us!”","short":"“Imagine a cool-ass house party in outer space—that’s us!”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-the-mothership-ii-emergency-landing-dj-mix/1826183840","playParams":{"id":"1826183840","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826183840/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"21769","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/21769?l=en-US"},{"id":"157056085","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/157056085?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1753443169555}}},"1826207042":{"id":"1826207042","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826207042?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-poppa/1454571030","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2c/82/72/2c8272c4-2539-bbfe-fb79-b035f9c7cb0c/eeb1353e-cb1d-485a-9e85-2f1b83737e45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dcccab","textColor2":"e8cdac","textColor4":"caad91","textColor1":"fff5cd","bgColor":"552b25","hasP3":true}},"name":"Almost Normal Again","artistName":"Lil Poppa","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/54/56/78/5456783a-8f45-b166-b366-34c40b9e11b3/25UMGIM82859.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f3026","textColor2":"220600","textColor4":"4e3426","textColor1":"0f0200","bgColor":"ffe9c0","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Signed to Yo Gotti’s CMG imprint, Lil Poppa specializes in a style where melodic rap and pain rap meet. Never one to shy away from tough subjects, the Floridian rapper continues down his artistic path through an emotional minefield with <i>Almost Normal Again</i>. Like its 2024 predecessor <i>WEE ARE WHO WE ARE</i>, this 16-track effort finds him in a reflective mode again, reminiscing, lamenting, and seeking peace. He chooses death over dishonor on “Bout My Respect” and offers a glimpse of betrayal on the moving “What I Seen.” While lessons from the streets and otherwise largely set the tone, some moments have an inherently poppier appeal than others, namely “I Hate You” and “Start Trippin (Shawty Fine).” Though the album is predominantly a solo affair, his handful of guests include Mozzy, who comes ready to commiserate on “Pain All Gone,” and Yungeen Ace, who brings his anguished expertise in their shared subgenre to “1 Hellavah Life.”","short":"The melodic Florida rapper explores both love and pain."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/almost-normal-again/1826207042","playParams":{"id":"1826207042","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0fisinfJxPnje3hk7H7gGn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826207042/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1454571030","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1454571030?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754060956149}}},"1826214433":{"id":"1826214433","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826214433?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sam-barber/1584802114","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5f/7d/da/5f7dda46-9d58-2ed5-9455-5f23af9ac3eb/Job917b759b-a3d9-4b2f-9f84-644f26eea06b-197439477-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386578682_2250848883-Time1752515953545.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","462e21"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"342620"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f3532","textColor2":"462e21","textColor4":"68564d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"342620","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/18/d6/1818d6f1-90b2-d6b7-18fd-e73559eea949/ff49f7a4-1e36-4408-88c8-bc19695181e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a7b3d4","textColor2":"dba59e","textColor4":"ba908e","textColor1":"c3d0f6","bgColor":"383c4e","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6b/bd/da/6bbdda3b-10fa-9858-beee-17a11b3c5cc9/Job360e3e3f-1a91-4405-986f-d1631ccc7a7f-197439476-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386578683_2250848882-Time1752514417641.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"443735","textColor2":"3c2a20","textColor4":"61534c","textColor1":"170704","bgColor":"f5f7fc","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b7/5c/69/b75c690c-a92a-9433-a7f4-55ebf3fb270b/392872df-58bc-4a61-9079-6e24ea20230d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bbbeca","textColor2":"dfd2b7","textColor4":"c1b49d","textColor1":"d7deef","bgColor":"4b3c36","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f5/62/5e/f5625e20-b511-ba3c-7916-ccb9eec773f4/b66a4bcd-8a66-482e-9162-4ebfac554fd5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5afd2","textColor2":"a7bceb","textColor4":"91a3cd","textColor1":"c0cbf2","bgColor":"3c4055","hasP3":false}},"name":"Music for the Soul","artistName":"Sam Barber","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/09/c4/1e09c4b3-065c-f3ce-3965-763e7bad7509/075679604385.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"393233","textColor2":"271a16","textColor4":"41393a","textColor1":"1c110d","bgColor":"aab6c8","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Though he first found fame through his viral hit “Straight and Narrow,” Sam Barber proves he’s anything but a flash in the pan on this EP, which follows his 2024 full-length debut <i>Restless Mind</i>.

Tron isn’t focused only on superstars, though: On that song in particular, he mentions veteran role player Kyle Kuzma. “77” pays tribute to Luka Doncic’s number and features a joyous throwback beat that plays with Detroit’s early techno roots.

Saweetie borrows the winding rhythms of Afrobeats for the sultry “i need some inspo,” slips Jersey club’s iconic bed-squeak sample into “pressure,” and flips a classic ’90s house anthem (Black Box’s “Everybody Everybody”) on “twinzzz,” a spiritual successor to her 2021 Doja Cat collab, “Best Friend.” K-pop superstars TWICE cameo on the tooth-rottingly sweet “superstars,” while she recruits “Bodak Yellow” producer J White Did It for “boffum,” an ode to maximalism: “Lady or a pimp?

Album","standard":"With the October 2024 release of <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i>, Tyler, The Creator seemed to explain that his three-year gap between albums had at least something to do with him trying to reconcile celebrity visibility with his personal life. After the pleas for privacy on some of that 2024 album’s most memorable tracks—not least acerbic single “Noid”—his pugilistic 1980s rapper cosplay on the cover of the subsequent semi-surprise release <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> appears a continuation of that sentiment.\n\nThe contents of this significantly shorter follow-up to the critically acclaimed, commercially successful full-length are quite intentionally a big step away from the array of revelations, rebukes, and storytelling that defined <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i>. Judging by the opening robotic commands of “Big Poe,” Tyler is dead set against baring his soul for his fans again, explicitly prioritizing danceability over “that deep shit” as the tenet behind <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i>. Then, as with fictionalized alter egos like Wolf Haley and IGOR, he assumes the song title’s identity as his latest character, embodying this hedonist with a stream of winking profanity over a bed of N.E.R.D-esque synth-rock. Later, the sub-bass-blasted “Stop Playing with Me” operates in a similar thematic and sonic space, inherently threatening yet undeniably catchy. \n\nIn a way, <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> spiritually calls back to The Notorious B.I.G.’s unapologetically reclaimed “Party and Bullshit” ethos, with music that resembles the funk and dance styles that the late Mr. Smalls would no doubt have vibed to during the 1980s and early 1990s. From the squelchy electro of “Sugar on My Tongue” through the retro R&B boogie of “Ring Ring Ring” and “Sucka Free,” the genre callbacks offer comforting grooves for Tyler to melt into. His oft-caustic voice transforms into an ephemeral texture on “Don’t You Worry Baby,” a seductive bit of bass and breaks nudged along by his quiet commands. \n\nYet, even at the times when he seems conspicuously absent from the festivities, as on “I’ll Take Care of You,” it’s really because he’s cultivated a jam he can admire from somewhere above the dance floor. Call <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> escapism if you must, but it sure feels hella good in this club.","short":"Tyler’s back, this time prioritizing danceability over

Album","standard":"Even on her major-label debut, 2016’s <i>Hero</i>, Maren Morris bent the rules of traditional country radio: She cursed, read men for filth, and, on breakthrough single “My Church,” bucked the title’s pious implication by declaring the radio, not the church, as her salvation. Since then, the Texas-born singer-songwriter (who moved to Nashville in her twenties at the behest of her pal Kacey Musgraves) has purposefully distanced herself from the Music City machine, mocking the industry’s conservatism on 2023’s “The Tree” and promoting 2024’s <i>Intermission</i> EP explicitly as pop. The five tracks from that EP appear alongside nine new ones on Morris’ fourth album, <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>—an even bolder departure from her country roots.\n\nFor both <i>Intermission</i> and <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>, Morris veered away from Music Row and towards a crack team of pop songwriters (among them Julia Michaels, Tobias Jesso Jr., and MUNA). There’s no mistaking lead single “people still show up” for anything like country; instead, Morris sounds funkier than ever over a slow-simmering Jack Antonoff groove in celebration of the safety net friends provide after a breakup. “I wrote it back in early 2023, before a lot of my personal life stuff was imploding,” Morris tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, referring in part to her 2024 divorce. “So it was almost like this premonition of a song.”\n\nCatharsis comes up often: On the ’80s R&B throwback “cry in the car,” Morris extols the virtues of weeping at the wheel, and on the Julia Michaels duet “cut!” all the therapy and yoga in the world can’t match the release of a good scream session. And though “too good” might be the record’s twangiest moment, it’s also the pettiest: “Bitch, you still owe me rent!” Morris yowls to an ex, hoping that the couch they’re crashing on these days is comfy. “I don’t want perfection from my idols,” she tells Lowe. “I want them to be honest, as much as they’re willing to be. I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”\n","short":"A bold step further into pop: “I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/d-r-e-a-m-s-i-c-l-e-deluxe/1828457935","playParams":{"id":"1828457935","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6qA8TnnCdZCoXzy0mDaZjk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828457935/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"262260873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/262260873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1754043480756}}},"1828459830":{"id":"1828459830","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828459830?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyla/1552925732","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/19/f4/6b19f4f5-6916-ba40-1d52-230e2b408410/7e61ca88-8e0c-464f-a01e-09fb3334101a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3d3b3a","textColor2":"3a2a21","textColor4":"5e524a","textColor1":"100d0c","bgColor":"f1f1f1","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/92/8e/ed/928eedb8-3134-1725-a83a-d96af6df854e/02571ddc-bf11-4b3c-adf5-0d21916e87a1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"423732","textColor2":"1a1716","textColor4":"3c3a38","textColor1":"21140e","bgColor":"c4c4c1","hasP3":true}},"name":"WWP - EP","artistName":"Tyla","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8e/dc/d6/8edcd6ad-068b-b33f-0f13-44e20e07bdbe/196873431987.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"5a493f","textColor2":"40271a","textColor4":"634e42","textColor1":"352015","bgColor":"eeebe6","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"“IS IT” four tracks to get you hyped for a Tyla full-length?
