R&B’s finest representative discovers his “true essence.”","standard":"There’s something satisfyingly circuitous about the title of Craig David’s ninth studio album, <i>Commitment</i>, neatly coinciding as it does with the 25th anniversary of his game-changing debut, <i>Born to Do It</i>. Sure, his life path may have been fated, but even destiny requires dedication. An unprecedented speed run of an entire career’s worth of achievements for just one album could easily be put down to luck; to be considered one of the most influential voices in R&B—revered and respected by audiences and industry peers alike—and still releasing records 25 years down the line, speaks more to his drive, work ethic, and passion than mere good fortune. The secret to his staying power, as David told fellow R&B star Estelle on a special episode of her Apple Music Radio show, is a little bit of both. “When it’s divine and you can feel it, you get out of the way and you let it be,” he said. “Just step in when you need to step in, lean in when you need to lean in, and the other times, get out of the way.”\n\nIt’s this “let go and let God” attitude that informs <i>Commitment</i>. David exercises the versatility of his buttery-soft vocals with soulful, self-reflective turns at everything from box-fresh garage cuts (album opener “Wake Up”) and heart-pumping, four-to-the-floor club beats (“Leave the Light On”) to stomping country-flavored dance pop (“In Your Hands”), and gentle, acoustic balladry (“Rain”). There’s also two standout collaborations which see David link with powerhouse R&B singer JoJo for the sultry groove “In It With You” and Afrobeats star Tiwa Savage on the mellow-toned title track. “As a big fan of JoJo, to hear her vocals on the record gave my inner child all the smiles,” said David, describing the track as “the type of song I just feel people wouldn’t necessarily expect…It’s hitting a slightly different pocket.” He flips expectations on “Commitment” too, crediting Savage for bringing a new perspective to the track. “I felt like the lyric of that song, she just landed it,” said David, comparing Savage’s contributions to singer-songwriter Muni Long’s work on “Obvious,” a deep cut from his 2022 release, <i>22</i>. “[Long] took it and she spun the song differently. I respected it, because her penmanship was like, ‘This is how we do things,’ and it was the same with Tiwa…I love it when people just do [their] thing.”\n\nThe sheer prolificity of David’s back catalog proves he is welcomed down any avenue he happens to wander and while <i>Commitment</i> puts the myriad influences he has collected over the years on full display, the album’s smooth cohesion rings with a note of unmistakable authenticity that centers around David’s confidence and self-knowledge as an artist. “When you’re young, parts of you are fragmented out. You’re trying to find yourself, and you give parts of yourself away, and you’re trying to fit in,” he said. “The hero’s journey is to go back out there in the wilderness and find all the pieces that you gave away and bring them all back in. That’s the true sentiment of what <i>Commitment</i> is about—being committed to find the true essence of who you really are. Once you get that, then your reference point is you.”","tagline":"New Album and

statement of joy, defiance, and resistance.","standard":"Born in Lima, Peru, Sofia Kourtesis moved to Germany at 17 with dreams of studying film, and to escape her former home’s conservative views. In a way, the Berlin-based producer approaches her music like a filmmaker, layering textures, field recordings, and emotion into lush songs that move and breathe. Her work blends the political with the personal, as on her 2023 debut <i>Madres</i>, which sampled anti-homophobia protest chants and was dedicated to her mother and the surgeon who saved her mother’s life. <i>Volver</i> is a statement of joy, defiance, and resistance, as Kourtesis celebrates the LGBT+ communities—especially trans women—who inspire her activism and art.\n\nThe bittersweet mood of “Corazón,” which laments distance, brightens with “Unidos,” a vivid disco-house collaboration with Daphni (aka Caribou’s Dan Snaith) turned mantra: “You got everything you need/You never let them get you down.” Layers of percussive rhythms keep spirits high on “Ballumbrosio,” its commanding groove and warm vocals conjuring scenes of communal joy, like people dancing around a fire. Kourtesis closes the EP with the bright and sweetly tender “Sisters,” a song about embracing her community, even from an ocean away.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Volver -

It’s like climbing Mount Everest: Why do you do it? For us, there might not even be a peak. But we enjoy the climb and the conquering of each step.”\n\nFor <i>Everest</i>, Hale and her bandmates—guitarist Joe Hottinger, bassist Josh Smith, and drummer Arejay Hale (Lzzy’s little brother)—traveled to Savannah, Georgia, to record with producer Dave Cobb, best-known for his work with country musicians Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson, and John Prine. “We did it in pieces over probably a year and a half or two years,” she says. “After writing the song ‘Everest,’ we realized that this album is about our personal mountain, our personal journey.” From rockers and ballads to ragers and back again, Hale took us on a track-by-track stroll up <i>Everest</i>.\n\n<b>“Fallen Star”</b>\n“This song was born from a riff that Joe was messing around with that we were calling ‘Reverse Jaws’ because it was kind of an inversion of the <i>Jaws</i> theme. Lyrically, the notion of the fallen star is about our relationship with our fans. It’s kind of a somber love ballad about missing them while we’re off the road, when you feel this tug toward this relationship. I never imagined we’d have so many amazing fans who tell us how this music has helped them.” \n\n<b>“Everest”</b>\n“This is our proverbial climb. This is the struggle. My brother and I have been doing Halestorm since I was 13 and he was 10. The 28th anniversary of the band is August 9 [2025], the day after the album is released. We started likening this band to people who climb Mount Everest, which is an equally crazy thing to do. There’s bodies along the way. You could die doing it. It’s the same with rock ’n’ roll—not many people make it through in one piece. Keeping your sanity, keeping away from things that could harm you or the band or your relationships, leaving a normal life behind to pursue this—it’s a crazy concept.” \n\n<b>“Shiver”</b>\n“I started out writing this song from the perspective of the guys in my band, trying to love me through all of my moods and my craziness. You realize there are times when you’re hard to love. And I’m so grateful for the boys in my band and the people around me that still believe in me through all of that. But once we finished the song, I realized it has kind of a double meaning. I love the life that I’ve chosen with every inch of my being. I’ve taken it so far that even if I wanted to give it up, I can’t.” \n\n<b>“Like a Woman Can”</b>\n“This song was inspired by an interview with Meryl Streep that I saw. She was talking mainly about being in the acting business, but she said this amazing thing: ‘For hundreds of years, women have learned the language of men. We know how to dress, we know how to act, we know how to make you love us. But for the longest time, many men have not tried to learn the language of women.’ So, this song is not a Mars vs. Venus song; it’s more asking Mars to try to understand us better. As a proud bisexual woman, that aspect comes into play, too. But it’s not an ultimatum. It’s just saying, ‘Why can’t you understand me in the same way a woman can?’” \n\n<b>“Rain Your Blood on Me”</b>\n“I’ve written anthems for the ladies before. That’s definitely part of my MO for almost every record, but this is our rager. It’s a song about being a woman in this business, and being a woman in general, and what it takes to let yourself be known and be seen. When we started playing in the bars, we’d be carrying equipment in, and people assumed I was the merch girl. And then, when we were shopping for labels, they would say, ‘Women in rock aren’t really a thing right now. And there’s already Amy Lee, so we’ve got one.’ So, you have to grab onto this defiance, this kind of fuck-you attitude and be like, ‘I’m going to do it anyway.’ It’s also maybe a little bit of a euphemism for period blood.” \n\n<b>“Darkness Always Wins”</b>\n“This was the first song we wrote for the album. Right before we got on a plane to go meet our producer, Dave Cobb, for the first time, Joe and I were sitting out on our porch, and we were just frustrated with the way the world is right now. No matter how hard you try to be a good human and put good things out there, it seems like evil always prevails and the good ones always go first. Joe said, ‘Why does the darkness always win, man?’ And I was like, ‘Write that down.’ Usually, when we write about something dark, I feel this internal responsibility to have a little light at the end of the tunnel. But the truth is, we don’t know if there will be a happy ending. All I know is that we have to get up and keep trying.” \n\n<b>“Gather the Lambs”</b>\n“We had a bed of music for this, and it was a little apocalyptic. But we were kind of stuck lyrically. Dave Cobb, in his infinite wisdom, said, ‘Let’s go on a field trip.’ We went to this old cemetery in Savannah, which is spooky in itself with all the Spanish moss. Dave suggested we look at some gravestones for inspiration, so the first verse of this song is almost directly from a gravestone we saw. The first line was, “Gather up the lamb of God, he’ll be here soon.’ The idea for the song became, ‘At the end of the world, who do you want to be with when it all goes down?’ For us, it’s each other. We know each other more than our own families do at this point. We’re like war buddies. Nobody will ever understand me like these guys do.” \n\n<b>“WATCH OUT!”</b>\n“This is such an angsty tune. It’s part pep talk for myself when I’m feeling like, ‘Can I actually do this? Can I get through whatever I’m going through?’ With every tour we do, I feel like I’m not the same person walking back in my door as I was when I walked out. It’s like you’re always putting on some new armor, but you want to show the world what you’ve got. It’s also kind of a warning. There have always been certain people in my life trying to make me into something that I’m not. So, I’m saying, ‘You never saw this coming. You have nothing to do with this.’” \n\n<b>“Broken Doll”</b>\n“The house studio we recorded at is right next to a river. Every now and again, we’d go out with acoustic guitars to see what magic we could capture. I had this title rolling around for a couple of days, and it ended up being almost a throwback ’90s thing. I got to kind of capture a little Courtney Love in this. But the subject matter is about getting older in this business and understanding that I’m not the new kid on the block anymore. Everything in this industry is changing, but I’m not going away. You’re going to be hearing a lot more from me.” \n\n<b>“K-I-L-L-I-N-G”</b>\n“This is a very ADHD type of song that was born in the studio from our rhythm section. Our guitar player was visiting his mom, who lived not too far away, and I heard the other guys jamming in the main room. I started putting a bunch of words together, just gibberish at first, but it ended up being a song about depression, and the confusion and loneliness that goes on with that. You see everyone around you as having their act together, but you see yourself as broken pieces. You’re trying to reignite yourself.” \n\n<b>“I Gave You Everything”</b>\n“This song is dedicated to some people in the business that I had trusted but ended up not having my best interests at heart. The blessing and the curse of me is that I will trust anyone until you give me a reason not to. Thankfully, I have some guys in my band that are the opposite, and they’ve always been protective of me with that. But I’ve been burned before, and when that happens, when that trust is broken, you feel like you’re kind of falling apart and have to put yourself back together and have the bravery to say, ‘I can’t allow you to be a part of this anymore.’ So, this was that song for me. It was very cathartic to talk about it.” \n\n<b>“How Will You Remember Me?”</b>\n“I’ve always wanted to write my own funeral song. With everything I’ve done in my life, if it was to all end tomorrow, what did I leave behind? My bandmates and I would also joke about, ‘Do you get to see stats?’ Like, after you die, do you get to see how many times you almost died, but didn’t? How many times did I almost fall through a grate on the side of the street? It started out as that kind of goofy conversation, but the real question is: How will you remember me? Ultimately, the only thing that matters is that you’re remembered, and that you left this world a little better than when you came into it.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Everest","playParams":{"id":"1811672700","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everest/1811672700","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5i8fhyMoVuH1O3pofbxywv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811672700/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3969358","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3969358?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754647302379,"RTCI":0}}},"1811897147":{"id":"1811897147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811897147?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Black Keys","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-black-keys/5893059","artwork":{"bgColor":"deded6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"080807","textColor2":"2b2a2b","textColor3":"333230","textColor4":"4f4e4d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d0/a4/2d/d0a42db4-4a20-7eba-645f-3a1abe36630d/093624832881.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"070708","gradient":{"color":"070708","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"1b1d20","textColor3":"343332","textColor4":"444646","textGradient":["ffffff","1b1d20"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3f/2a/f7/3f2af7fa-d2c3-66df-0d3c-48c2d8081270/Job368da169-c6be-4c32-8640-3765d6264e48-193673704-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379398939_2184089525-Time1748560649698.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"070708","gradient":{"color":"070708","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"bfc6bf","textColor3":"c5c4c1","textColor4":"9da39d","textGradient":["ffffff","bfc6bf"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8c/7d/be/8c7dbefc-d604-cc63-cb31-068f21985870/Jobea301bed-09fb-4dde-a831-4c315809e36a-193673705-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379398940_2184089524-Time1748562157000.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"cdcccb","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"23211f","textColor2":"31302e","textColor3":"454341","textColor4":"504f4d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c4/b2/cd/c4b2cdc9-6f20-1152-ae1c-478584ae5c33/fde95614-b3cf-48de-901f-7a9587fd587f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c9c8c8","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"191816","textColor2":"2d2c2a","textColor3":"3c3b39","textColor4":"4c4b4a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/44/0f/03/440f0363-a331-bbd1-66dc-2fb1539e1d1f/41f3e19e-42ff-49e4-86a8-ebe63a9330f0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"989490","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0c0c0d","textColor2":"171617","textColor3":"282727","textColor4":"312f2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/78/60/ac/7860aca5-949b-d290-4c01-d0990ef5e74a/75608d10-36b7-4fd6-830e-753900a969c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The sun comes out for the Ohio rockers, with a little help from some new friends.","standard":"After a tumultuous 2024 that saw The Black Keys cancel their tour, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney turned struggle into art on the duo’s aptly named 13th studio album—<i>No Rain, No Flowers</i>. “It totally kind of fucked our plans,” Carney tells Apple Music of the scrapped shows. “We took the time that we were going to be on tour, and we went back into Dan’s studio, and we just recorded a bunch of music.”\n\nThe other kids from Akron ultimately decided to build on the creativity of their last full-length. “<i>Ohio Players</i> was a deeply collaborative album we made with other musicians—I guess rock stars. Beck and Noel Gallagher. Heroes of ours, you know? And guys who’ve helped us out throughout the years in different ways,” Carney says. “For this new album, we just went one step further and we wanted to do some more collaborations, and we looked at some people who had worked with artists that we liked.”\n\nThat includes bringing on Lana Del Rey co-writer Rick Nowels (“No Rain, No Flowers,” “On Repeat,” and “Kiss It”) and Kacey Musgraves-favorite Daniel Tashian (“The Night Before,” “Babygirl,” “Man on a Mission,” and “All My Life”) as well as hip-hop producer Scott Storch (“Babygirl” and “Make You Mine,” the latter also with legendary songwriter Desmond Child). These fresh voices infuse Auerbach and Carney’s blend of rock with a bright passion (and more piano than usual)—but blues, disco, and psychedelia still all find purchase here. There's even room for throwback cuts like “Down to Nothing” and “A Little Too High,” plus some Nashville licks on “Neon Moon.”\n\nPerhaps the title track sums up their current journey best: “Live long enough, and you will be burned/But all these little messes/Are only little lessons we've learned.” Or, when life gives you rain, you make flowers.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"No Rain, No Flowers","playParams":{"id":"1811897147","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-rain-no-flowers/1811897147","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3GP6fZgniD9cydeW0nwEe4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811897147/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5893059","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5893059?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754648624438,"RTCI":0}}},"1812459380":{"id":"1812459380","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812459380?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sunny Sweeney","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sunny-sweeney/167976779","artwork":{"bgColor":"e0a061","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060606","textColor2":"060606","textColor3":"312518","textColor4":"312518","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8e/42/be/8e42be99-0e6a-91af-c61e-40d0987c94b5/195081496092.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Rhinestone Requiem","playParams":{"id":"1812459380","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rhinestone-requiem/1812459380","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Nit9x29jgmCyonO76jWzW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812459380/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"167976779","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/167976779?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754627240021,"RTCI":0}}},"1812517697":{"id":"1812517697","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812517697?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"JID","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jid/282841404","artwork":{"bgColor":"e6d3b6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"311b12","textColor2":"411a0b","textColor3":"554033","textColor4":"623f2d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/e1/66/7be166a3-92e6-c505-0802-9599973629ea/25UMGIM55109.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"eeeeee","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"c0c0c0","textColor4":"a0a0a0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3a/d3/2a/3ad32aba-2007-b7ec-39de-46e7f43da644/41d7f197-5214-441a-8469-3b707f3573f4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"020202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1f1ee","textColor2":"ced4f2","textColor3":"c1c1bf","textColor4":"a5aac2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d9/c6/eb/d9c6eba5-58ea-0c3d-fe39-17c2b9a3bf0f/8f0bc980-2fbf-4353-a2a8-8c04f3936f02.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"252525","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f0dfc1","textColor2":"f1c284","textColor3":"c7b9a1","textColor4":"c8a371","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/77/6f/d7/776fd715-0f38-42e7-43ef-58cecdb9b8a1/b1710fd2-0b6d-4016-99ae-15dcca0abadf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A bold new statement from the Dreamville storyteller.","standard":"There was a time when Dreamville’s talented artist roster seemed destined to remain perpetually in J. Cole’s formidable shadow. Yet those who followed the Atlanta-raised JID from his mixtape days and the Spillage Village <i>Bears Like This</i> era had to know he couldn’t be contained for long. Some three years after his ambitious and acclaimed <i>The Forever Story</i>—and just over a month since the guest-laden <i>GDLU (Preluxe)</i> EP—his fourth solo album obviously comes with heightened fan expectations. Borrowing its title from his late grandmother’s clever turn of phrase, <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> finds the technically proficient MC up for the existential challenge. \n\nThe unmistakable sound of Westside Gunn’s assertive bellows introduce the tremulous “YouUgly,” in which JID assails sales-obsessed fandoms while puffing out his chest and stacking his checks. Immediately afterwards, he’s officially back in his storytelling bag for “Glory,” an uproarious gospel variant with heavyweight production by Beatnick Dee and Lex Luger. Those narrative gifts of his persist on tracks like “Of Blue” and the dark yet peppy “Sk8,” building upon the solid foundation of tales told in his catalog thus far. \n\nElsewhere, he’s detailing a Machiavellian come-up plot on the motivational “WRK” and defeating self-doubt with gratitude on the uplifting closer “For Keeps.” Of course, JID’s guest list is stacked, with masterful rappers like Vince Staples and virtuosos like Thundercat in the mix. Yet even amid a Clipse posse cut like “Community” and momentous duets like “No Boo,” the consistently bold <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> stays undeniably his own.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"God Does Like Ugly","playParams":{"id":"1812517697","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/god-does-like-ugly/1812517697","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2tU04u3hxtziB4sOVJKak3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812517697/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"282841404","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/282841404?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754638761777,"RTCI":0}}},"1812865904":{"id":"1812865904","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812865904?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kayo Dot","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kayo-dot/94502415","artwork":{"bgColor":"38383a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dbe6f6","textColor2":"d0dce7","textColor3":"bbc3d0","textColor4":"b2bbc4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/39/69/41/39694145-3a23-b3a7-fa47-cae01f49cff9/2596.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Every Rock, Every Half-Truth Under Reason","playParams":{"id":"1812865904","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/every-rock-every-half-truth-under-reason/1812865904","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0vpHoAYzXCuQL6ktmKxjSw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812865904/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"94502415","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/94502415?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753956648165,"RTCI":0}}},"1813601929":{"id":"1813601929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813601929?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Liv Sin","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/liv-sin/1191565666","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ced4db","textColor2":"b3bac7","textColor3":"a4a9af","textColor4":"8f949f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/70/2f/b5/702fb5cb-8d2c-6e29-2d36-fa6d1ca282bf/199350633751.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"name":"Close Your Eyes","playParams":{"id":"1813601929","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/close-your-eyes/1813601929","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/41U6wQOkkwKWtFHeOdsEVc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813601929/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1191565666","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1191565666?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754627188237,"RTCI":0}}},"1814463235":{"id":"1814463235","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814463235?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Reneé Rapp","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rene%C3%A9-rapp/1626560688","artwork":{"bgColor":"f0f1f5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"3f251c","textColor2":"48271e","textColor3":"624e48","textColor4":"6a4f49","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d8/20/30/d82030c6-9b47-8638-3b72-1e18d5b09299/25UMGIM64791.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"e2ece6","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0d0a08","textColor2":"0c0c0c","textColor3":"373735","textColor4":"363837","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/d2/2b/b5d22b63-9d80-a970-1709-63a978b9857d/44555804-20c0-4094-994b-fe705966484b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"eaeeec","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0c0a08","textColor2":"100c09","textColor3":"383836","textColor4":"3c3936","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e1/4e/fa/e14efa80-24fd-fcd1-adc8-1103d0e064ce/63153580-5b8d-44fd-a9c8-be5c71538949.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3f312b","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ede3dc","textColor2":"e9cfbf","textColor3":"cabfb8","textColor4":"c7b0a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/04/a7/7d04a7ac-7b7c-1b55-6848-171b751cdc92/f0907c2d-e49f-4a24-8600-e679f6a4f573.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Her second LP finds peace in reckless abandon: “I set out to impress myself.”","standard":"From the outside, it appeared that the 25-year-old actor turned singer was living her best life the past few years: releasing her debut album <i>Snow Angel</i> in 2023, starring as Regina George in the 2024 <i>Mean Girls</i> musical, making her 2024 Coachella debut with a surprise appearance from Kesha. But the way Reneé Rapp tells it, her life was privately a mess. “I think you’re at constant war with yourself, and you’re in constant competition with you and the best version of you,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “You are constantly feeling like you need to be doing more, like you need to be working harder, like you are not good enough, like you are just at the mercy of everyone and everything around you—and you are.”\n\nIn search of what had made her fall in love with music in the first place, Rapp pulled a hard reset: undergoing ketamine therapy, going off her birth control, disregarding the advice of guys who sit in boardrooms. The result is <i>BITE ME</i>, her second full-length album, and her most personal. Open-hearted ballads about relationships in all their messy drama (“Why Is She Still Here?”) are countered by devil-may-care disco jams about 40-hour one-night stands (“Kiss It Kiss It”). “Can I tell you a secret? I’m so sick of it all,” Rapp purrs on the joyfully sleazy “Leave Me Alone,” before throwing caution to the wind: “Come get wet in the deep end/T-t-t-take it off/C-c-c-cannonball!” (She also fires a not-so-subtle shot at the series she once starred in, <i>The Sex Lives of College Girls</i>.)\n\n“I set out to impress myself,” she tells Lowe. “I set out to make music I would want to listen to, and I set out to not compromise a single thing about my personality and be unwaveringly loud about it—and I did that.” Somewhere in <i>BITE ME</i>’s reckless abandon, Rapp found a sense of peace. “This album to me feels like ripping off all of your clothes, stripping naked and running down a street after you’ve been violently crying,” she says. “And you’re almost laughing because you’re like, ‘I’m done with this. I’m sick of this. I’m not letting this hold me.’”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"BITE ME","playParams":{"id":"1814463235","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bite-me/1814463235","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ULnaZahd0zTGVUBVQO6mN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814463235/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1626560688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1626560688?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754657981995,"RTCI":0}}},"1814467058":{"id":"1814467058","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814467058?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Field Medic","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/field-medic/972432405","artwork":{"bgColor":"17181d","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"faebd8","textColor2":"9fc8d6","textColor3":"cdc1b2","textColor4":"84a5b1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/68/ab/2d68abcc-6975-4034-8da6-e423bf99dc3b/8721215441090.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Surrender Instead","playParams":{"id":"1814467058","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/surrender-instead/1814467058","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2TMcraJh8CGP7Ch7oHgX3z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814467058/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"972432405","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/972432405?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754627786592,"RTCI":0}}},"1814652100":{"id":"1814652100","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814652100?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Morgan Wade","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/morgan-wade/526632293","artwork":{"bgColor":"988479","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"0c0d12","textColor2":"0f0e13","textColor3":"282426","textColor4":"2b2527","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7d/61/dc/7d61dc75-7a66-2b78-8560-769ea92de474/196872890587.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"080809","gradient":{"color":"080809","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"030303","textColor3":"201c1b","textColor4":"201d1a","textGradient":["ffffff","030303"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/dd/03/88/dd038828-09a3-2da1-c46e-5f04f05d2232/Job17e0e3f1-4c70-4fbb-95eb-56464c34cd02-193562205-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379179586_2181999465-Time1748457177244.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"080809","gradient":{"color":"080809","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d2cdc0","textColor3":"b5b2ab","textColor4":"aeaaa1","textGradient":["ffffff","d2cdc0"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b8/c0/1a/b8c01a74-fc3b-8e9f-b7da-b6e093c2529e/Job2fc9bf22-04b4-470e-89ea-7ce2d08f0410-193562204-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379179587_2181999464-Time1748455759180.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"5c5c5c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fafafa","textColor2":"ececec","textColor3":"dadada","textColor4":"cfcfcf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f9/e9/48/f9e9487b-4a99-eeb8-fa65-7895c036ccee/8a61021b-2165-40c1-a610-834f84035339.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3e3a3d","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"efebe0","textColor2":"e5ded3","textColor3":"cbc8bf","textColor4":"c4bdb5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b4/8d/47/b48d4766-63ff-88e1-a848-42db1d4079f9/7e498d95-7ce2-40c9-9c46-dade812ad829.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Vivid and intensely personal songwriting across 11 tracks.","standard":"Like its predecessor, Morgan Wade’s fifth album is an intensely personal affair. The Virginia-born country singer-songwriter wrote all 11 tracks on <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> by herself, something she first did on 2024’s <i>Obsessed</i>, and the resulting album is a compelling listen. Produced by longtime collaborator and band member Clint Wells, <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> opens with its title track, which, despite its thematic connections to newer material on the LP, Wade wrote years earlier—“recovering” it from her vault of unreleased material, as the album title suggests. That tune is sweeping and anthemic, as Wade painfully considers feelings of love that last well beyond a relationship’s expiration date. \n\n“East Coast” is similarly wrenching, though it dips into Wade’s darker side as she imagines drowning herself to get the attention of an ex-flame.

Then a video Zimmerman casually uploaded—covering Black Stone Cherry’s “Stay” between truck builds—went viral, and by December 2020, he’d written his first song. Cue the record deal, the Morgan Wallen co-sign, the world tour, and the double-platinum debut full-length (2023’s <i>Religiously. The Album.</i>). But as he reminds you on the rowdy “New to Country,” he’s still the same whiskey-sipping, ATV-riding country boy, emphasizing in his raspy drawl: “Ain’t a thing changed ’round here but the money.”\n\nWritten fresh after a breakup, <i>Religiously</i> was rife with ballads about the pain of lost love. On its follow-up, Zimmerman sings a different tune. “When I first started writing songs, my life was like heartbreak,” he tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. “With this album, my life has been awesome. I’ve been touring all over the world. I’ve been writing songs. I’m taking care of my family.” There are still plenty of big-hearted ballads on <i>Different Night Same Rodeo</i>, though now they’re scattered between heartland rock jams like the KID LAROI duet “Lost” or “Backup Plan” with Luke Combs, on which Zimmerman delivers his own motivational sermon: “If you got a fire, don’t lose it/If you got a do-or-die dream, do it/If you got something to prove, go on and prove it.”\n\nMaking regular appearances throughout the album’s 18 tracks is Zimmerman’s trusty old Chevy Silverado, which he took out a loan to buy from his grandpa at 16. “All day, when I was in school, I was thinking about getting in my truck and jamming music,” he says. “It felt like freedom.” That same truck is ridden with memories on “Chevy Silverado,” a track he says took him three years to perfect. And on “Holy Smokes,” it’s where he falls in love for the first time, chain-smoking cigarettes in the church parking lot: “At 17, that’s what hallelujah was.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Different Night Same Rodeo","playParams":{"id":"1818193663","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/different-night-same-rodeo/1818193663","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2cPJrMHIIBkKarl6nxi11P"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818193663/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1551033783","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1551033783?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754637168596,"RTCI":0}}},"1818471603":{"id":"1818471603","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818471603?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"$uicideboy$","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%24uicideboy%24/1081606072","artwork":{"bgColor":"ba9f89","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060605","textColor2":"181817","textColor3":"2a251f","textColor4":"38332e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/73/c1/38/73c13888-eb24-8bd1-f7a2-997bacb84f79/199350860188.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"d4ccb2","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"27231d","textColor2":"2f261e","textColor3":"4a453b","textColor4":"50473c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c1/b9/db/c1b9db1a-7b27-5887-b3a3-844ad8db0cbd/Jobbca58bb1-4541-4a74-bacf-f8a3bb9b83a3-198866076-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389296873_2272896034-Time1753907976648.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"c0bea1","gradient":{"color":"c0bea1","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"251c1a","textColor3":"2c2f2a","textColor4":"433b32","textGradient":["000000","251c1a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3b/9a/98/3b9a9803-5e42-95cd-7c29-b6d52ed2f84b/Job87f705cc-5e5d-432d-9530-3ec704b3a598-198866075-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389296872_2272896035-Time1753903780357.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3b3a3c","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ded7bc","textColor2":"cfd0d2","textColor3":"bdb7a2","textColor4":"b1b2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8b/f2/2c/8bf22cc6-03c2-eac5-e415-32ef8c3b79e8/2bfe119e-d190-4c41-8e28-f0eaf345ac30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The duo’s potent, nihilistic blend of horrorcore, witch house, and emo rap.","standard":"The New Orleans-born cousins (Ruby da Cherry and Scrim) have little in the way of crossover hits or mainstream press. But since emerging on SoundCloud in 2014 with their depressive, Memphis-inspired blend of horrorcore, witch house, and emo rap, the duo’s nihilism has proved surprisingly potent—their Grey Day Tour was the third-highest-grossing rap tour of 2024. On their fifth album, <i>THY KINGDOM COME</i> (a modest catalog, until you count the additional nine mixtapes and 30-plus EPs they’ve released in just over a decade), $uicideboy$ mostly stick to their bread and butter: themes of addiction and abjection, morose yet baroque titles, and the rap game’s bleakest flexes. (“Smokin’ on shit that smell like body rot,” they chant on BONES collab “Now and at the Hour of Our Death.”) But occasionally, a bit of levity creeps in, be it a jubilant sample of a NOLA bounce classic (Big Freedia’s “Gin in My System”) on “Napoleon” or the ’80s-R&B gloss on the otherwise grim “Full of Grace (I Refuse to Tend My Own Grave).”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"THY KINGDOM COME","playParams":{"id":"1818471603","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thy-kingdom-come/1818471603","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7HxLze2RiYrM9f2un8HZUp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818471603/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1081606072","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1081606072?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754637391190,"RTCI":0}}},"1818936950":{"id":"1818936950","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818936950?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HEDONIST","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hedonist/1576946831","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c6c6c4","textColor2":"d68282","textColor3":"9e9e9d","textColor4":"ab6868","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/81/ec/f6/81ecf63f-6e06-ef70-c51c-26011c8e1265/199350931147.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Scapulimancy","playParams":{"id":"1818936950","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/scapulimancy/1818936950","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1FWm8eNbd4KcCLUZLQ7kbd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818936950/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1576946831","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1576946831?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754023332773,"RTCI":0}}},"1819112703":{"id":"1819112703","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819112703?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"mgk","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mgk/465954501","artwork":{"bgColor":"2b5574","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d9f3fc","textColor2":"c3dbe6","textColor3":"b7d3e1","textColor4":"a5c0cf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/05/2b/7c/052b7c26-11e8-f911-a344-a26486d83bc8/25UMGIM79102.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"497e9f","gradient":{"color":"497e9f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"3d0e1a","textColor3":"3f3c40","textColor4":"5c3a47","textGradient":["000000","3d0e1a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c5/25/ac/c525ac3c-160a-3299-689b-af63113d9555/Jobef4a8e8b-144b-458c-b145-e73bb2ff088b-195009363-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382096259_2208709398-Time1750121426254.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"497e9f","gradient":{"color":"497e9f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"c5e4f3","textColor3":"bcd7eb","textColor4":"a6cae3","textGradient":["000000","c5e4f3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/96/3a/09/963a090c-480e-c150-a8cc-3ec012440773/Job068b3db5-c6cc-4cc0-a825-58e06ff61cb9-195009362-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382096258_2208709399-Time1750120311121.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"33669d","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f2f9d3","textColor2":"c9e5fd","textColor3":"ccdbc8","textColor4":"abcbea","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/43/64/94/43649416-3212-448d-5077-5f4ef7f1c659/62abf4c4-87f7-480d-926f-1006804febbc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4b85bc","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"111314","textColor2":"101315","textColor3":"1d2a35","textColor4":"1c2a36","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e2/7e/28/e27e2894-353e-14e1-64f1-2ca489df3143/d5f0c43c-65a3-47f5-99d6-211258cc54e9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"537f99","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"070303","textColor2":"111314","textColor3":"161c21","textColor4":"1e292f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ec/90/87/ec9087fa-0529-a46b-f766-b643e09b840c/c8e47a4d-376b-4eca-9cfb-c00a5b9a9316.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly reinvents himself yet again.","standard":"The artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly announced his seventh album with a trailer narrated by…wait, is that really Bob Dylan?! “<i>lost americana</i> is a personal excavation of the American dream, a journey to find what’s been lost,” drawled the 84-year-old legend over clips of mgk smoking, riding motorcycles, and strolling the Vegas strip. “This album is a love letter to those who seek to rediscover: the dreamers, the drifters, the defiant. It’s a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention, and a quest to reclaim the authentic essence of American freedom.” Some wondered whether it was AI, but no, Bob’s just a fan. (He inexplicably posted a no-context clip of a 2016 mgk performance to his Instagram stories earlier this year.)\n\nThe 35-year-old is no stranger to the spirit of reinvention, having deftly transitioned over the course of his career from a gritty Cleveland rapper hustling mixtapes at the mall to the poster boy for the pop-punk revival. Where 2020’s <i>Tickets to My Downfall</i> and 2022’s <i>Mainstream Sellout</i> funneled his long-simmering angst into blink-182-esque riffs, on <i>lost americana</i>, he gets all James Dean: driving 135 MPH down a two-lane desert highway, chain-smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, heading nowhere fast. “Take me somewhere cheap/Where the livin’ is easy/Out of all their reach/Set my spirit free,” he sings on the Springsteen-esque “outlaw overture,” and on “cliché,” he coaxes a lover to ditch this two-bit town and get married in Vegas. He channels The Strokes on “sweet coraline” and interpolates Third Eye Blind’s “Semi-Charmed Life” on “starman,” but returns to his hip-hop roots on songs like “indigo” and “treading water,” opening up on the latter about the long road to redemption after a troubled year.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"lost americana","playParams":{"id":"1819112703","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lost-americana/1819112703","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/30aIA1FrouOX9kHxP4dEr6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819112703/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"465954501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/465954501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754656069487,"RTCI":0}}},"1819515284":{"id":"1819515284","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819515284?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Blessing Offor","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blessing-offor/274532732","artwork":{"bgColor":"edf2f4","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"22191d","textColor2":"37231f","textColor3":"4b4448","textColor4":"5b4c49","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ce/5e/a9/ce5ea92e-68c1-a671-d3c4-1cd4efaaa10e/25UMGIM74491.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"acb0b0","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"231b19","textColor2":"2c2729","textColor3":"3f3937","textColor4":"464244","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/90/11/a4/9011a4db-857f-ef5d-7d45-3b3d56a95fd1/9cb1fc46-ea31-4eef-8667-24516ba8f862.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Nigerian American singer follows his breakout LP with radiant pop-soul.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Real","playParams":{"id":"1819515284","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/real/1819515284","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Jaiy3v9v7pTkamkvTxO5l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819515284/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"274532732","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/274532732?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754644892799,"RTCI":0}}},"1819753683":{"id":"1819753683","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819753683?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Reign.","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/reign/1794344169","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":4096,"textColor1":"140c04","textColor2":"232c28","textColor3":"433d36","textColor4":"4f5653","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/72/87/c1728731-46f3-f3e7-6110-d1ea8de24c59/8721215625117.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4096},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Disfunctional_way -

Cue <i>Greetings from Your Hometown</i>, a mostly upbeat affair that strikes a delicate balance between past regret and future promise. Sandwiching the emotional core of the album between two surefire crowd-pleasers—galvanizing pop-rock anthem “I Can’t Lose” and the soft future-bass touch of Marshmello collaboration “Slow Motion”—the brothers Jonas nosedive into rumination before pulling up in a passionate glide through the boundlessness of romance. \n\n“Backwards” meanders around heartbreak, giving way to the minimalist production of self-aware lament “Loved You Better” and the title track’s sunny hopes for a brand-new start, forming a triptych of love and loss. Elsewhere, “Waste No Time” benefits from producer Ryan Tedder’s taste for suggestive rhythms and a quirky earworm melody, while “Heat of the Moment” and “Bully” borrow from alt-pop band MUNA’s dreamy pastel-colored palette (guitarist Josette Maskin is credited as a co-writer). Stripped to the bones, <i>Greetings from Your Hometown</i> holds the same heartfelt charm that first captivated Jonas Brothers fans and made them into household names, but the album’s glossy finish reflects the experienced artists they have become more than the wide-eyed young men they once were. Still, sometimes it takes a return to your roots to understand how much you’ve grown.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Greetings From Your

There are sly interpolations of Gucci Mane’s “I Might Be” and, in the case of the slinky “She Is My Drug,” Cher’s deathless anthem “Believe.” Fellow modern pop vanguard PinkPantheress throws in for the satisfying techno pulser “Kiss Me Thru the Phone Pt. 2,” a seeming reference to Soulja Boy’s ringtone-ready 2008 hit, while Naomi Campbell (yes, <i>the</i> Naomi Campbell) closes out “ms60” with a solid-gold monologue extoling the virtues of embodying the album’s title.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"BLACK STAR","playParams":{"id":"1821073090","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-star/1821073090","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/59PktWhvg6nGZJaxW0mVVV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821073090/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1292405220","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1292405220?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754649942645,"RTCI":0}}},"1821284605":{"id":"1821284605","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821284605?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Wisp","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wisp/1681331842","artwork":{"bgColor":"021d29","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d6e5e7","textColor2":"c2d7dd","textColor3":"acbdc1","textColor4":"9bb2b9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f3/b9/60/f3b960a0-e382-b6b1-0e72-8da5ae4f2b74/25UMGIM83155.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"001230","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"d7e7e8","textColor2":"cadcdf","textColor3":"acbdc3","textColor4":"a2b4bc","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a7/70/3e/a7703ec9-9b72-7aaf-00da-53ea8c959059/Jobacad1cd7-ed1d-43d3-a934-6a80640397a6-198207485-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387988976_2262767138-Time1753243319074.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"504f40","gradient":{"color":"504f40","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"a4c7d6","textColor3":"a0b3bc","textColor4":"83a5b3","textGradient":["ffffff","a4c7d6"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/67/f5/bf/67f5bf3f-af46-5254-9811-31adf2ba57c8/Jobad206a2b-ccf2-48c2-9c67-f662b58740f9-198207484-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387988975_2262767139-Time1753241479975.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor3":"a9a6a5","textColor4":"a29c8c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c3/44/f6/c344f6fd-d19a-ac74-2db1-9a1b45fb943c/0c0fd323-f070-49a1-8b50-1429f8d2c726.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dbdae1","textColor2":"c3bece","textColor3":"b2b1b7","textColor4":"9f9ca8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ad/e7/e0/ade7e080-6217-e7a0-9d75-99df4d376761/c0b000ef-7008-49df-bda5-c653b6572a60.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"283741","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"c5d2d7","textColor2":"aac0cd","textColor3":"a6b3b9","textColor4":"90a4b1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ff/cd/d8/ffcdd87c-1ceb-892e-5804-3d83806dbfd0/e27aa91d-9179-4ebc-9183-b53ae5bcc393.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The San Francisco artist is at the vanguard of the shoegaze revival.","standard":"San Francisco-raised songwriter Wisp has become the face of the shoegaze revival that has infiltrated the rock world in the mid-2020s. It’s easy to see why: Her catchy melodies are buried beneath layers and layers of guitar, the drums boom and crash, the basslines keep the ship afloat. Though she’s been compared to genre icons of yore like Slowdive and The Jesus and Mary Chain, she views herself more in the realm of dream-pop bands. “I love all those bands for sure, but I think the bands that I take the most influence from are definitely more dream-poppy bands,” she tells Apple Music. “So I grew up listening to a lot of Beach House, Cocteau Twins, and I definitely take inspiration from them, especially vocal-wise and how I sing in my music.” \n\nCacophonies of melodious noise surrounds Wisp on <i>If Not Winter</i>, and her voice manages to pierce through and rise to the top. Take “After dark,” which buzzes with crisp guitar lines and sloshing hi-hats. Her vocals move through the composition like a fever dream, yearning for something she can’t quite reach. This emphasis on emotion and lyrical prowess was a focal point for Wisp while creating the album. “I try to put as much emotion as I can into my own music, and I always try to write about something that is true to me and something that I'm feeling,” she says. “And that way it doesn't feel faked or it doesn't feel ingenuine to my sound.”","tagline":"New

hip-hop studio mastermind crafts a mix to “turn the gym into a club.”","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of modern music’s best DJs and producers to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—it brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This set, mixed by Murda Beatz (born Shane Lee Lindstrom), will keep you locked in to your next gym session—or any sort of exercise you might choose.\n\n“My goal was to create a Fitness Mix that I would work out to, turning the gym into a club,” the Ontario-born, LA-based hip-hop producer tells Apple Music. “I structured the mix to let the energy build with the workout. Having that perfect track is important when you start to burn out.”\n\nLindstrom, who’s worked with Drake, Migos, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj, says he’d use the mix “during an intense weightlifting workout or cardio day.” Including tracks from Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, Waka Flocka Flame, 2 Chainz, and tons more, the set closes with something new from the Murda Beatz lab: “‘Same Shit’ was the perfect way to end a workout,” he says. “The guitar solo at the end is how I like to leave the gym.”\n","tagline":"New Fitness Mix"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"name":"Fitness: Gym, August 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1824536453","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":35,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-gym-august-2025-dj-mix/1824536453"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824536453/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1053740960","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1053740960?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754633623567,"RTCI":0}}},"1824549679":{"id":"1824549679","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824549679?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"deadmau5","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deadmau5/78011850","artwork":{"bgColor":"09090c","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"cdcdcf","textColor2":"86b6ea","textColor3":"a6a6a8","textColor4":"6d93bd","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7c/d5/59/7cd559b3-45cd-5375-94e2-b8f85d5fab17/663918356838.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"name":"Error5 -

Also showing through is the influence of early 2010s Australian dance artists such as PNAU, Empire Of The Sun, and Miami Horror, particularly in songs such as “All I Am” and “iPod Touch.” “I guess that’s the palette or the world, but I also didn’t want to be too reverential,” she says. “That’s the music that was most inspiring to me when I started making music, but I’ve definitely wanted to make my own version of it.” Here, Wilson takes Apple Music through <i>I Love My Computer</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“London Song”</b>\n“This was not about anything at first, it was just a voice memo. I wrote the singing part with the extra lyrics, and by that point I had the title of the album and was like, ‘OK, I need to make this about my computer.’ And the way I twisted it was, almost all the places I’ve been overseas is because I made music on a laptop. And that’s what allowed me to go there. So that’s the way I reframed the random voice memo—I would go with you [to London], with my computer that has afforded me that luxury.”\n\n<b>“iPod Touch”</b>\n“When I was in high school, I got really into electronic music, but also pretty niche SoundCloud electronic music, and I didn’t have any friends that were into it. It felt like all my favorite songs were my secrets, ’cause I didn’t have anyone to share them with. In that song, there’s a reference to a Porter Robinson track from 2012 that was my favorite song when I was 12 or however old I was.”\n\n<b>“F**k My Computer”</b>\n“I use Ableton to produce my music. I was using other software before that, and when I landed on Ableton, I felt like it was the first interface I meshed with and I started becoming really fast. Sometimes, I think, ‘How could I get faster? How could I widen the bandwidth even more?’ It’s just a hardware limitation at this point, I just need to insert my brain into the computer. If we were just one entity, I wouldn’t have to lose ideas in translation.”\n\n<b>“CSIRAC”</b>\n“CSIRAC is the first computer in the world to ever [play digital] music. I felt like the album was missing more of a clubby, drummy, DJ moment, and I thought this could be that.”\n\n<b>“Delete”</b>\n“The song is about when you have a crush and you post a photo just for them to see it. It’s a little Gatsby-ish, like you put on this big show for just one person to see it. And then you’re like, ‘Have they seen it? Do they think I’m pretty?’ Then it’s the self-awareness of being like, ‘I’m so embarrassing!’”\n\n<b>“ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ”</b>\n“It’s a cat symbol. Internally we’ve been calling it ‘Cat Face.’ Or ‘Cat Interlude.’ It’s just an interlude to ‘All I Am.’ Originally, ‘All I Am’ had a long, progressive intro. But when it came to releasing it on its own, it felt too indulgent; it felt too much like two songs in one to work as a single. So I split that intro off to make it its own song.”\n\n<b>“All I Am”</b>\n“This was such a special song to make. It was a jam at Ben Lee’s house in LA with Ben, Jenna [McDougall, aka Hevenshe], Alex [Greenwald, Phantom Planet], and Maz [DeVita, WAAX]. We were literally recording anything. Then we had a break, and we had a little bit of a microdose, and had lunch, and then everyone got sleepy. We all got into this meditative state, and I just started looping certain parts of what we’d recorded and added my own elements on top of their audio, and it just built into this dance progression thing. I think a lot of the music I was listening to at the time, like PNAU, really leaked through in that second half of the session where I started working on it on its own.” \n\n<b>“Infohazard”</b>\n“I saw this artwork of this girl sitting next to a computer and she was cute, kind of Bratz doll style. And the text said, ‘Help, I’m online and I just saw a beheading.’ And I was like, ‘Oh yeah, that happened to me when I was a cute girl too.’ It just seemed like an interesting way to make light of what is probably a shared trauma amongst people of my generation. If not a beheading they’ve just been scrolling and been like, ‘Oh, I probably wasn’t meant to see that and I can’t forget about it now.’”\n\n<b>“Battery Death”</b>\n“I really wanted to have a halftime, more hip-hop-drums track so it wasn’t all just four-to-the-floor dance music. I think I was reading a lot about battery life, but no one was really talking about battery death. It just sounded like a funny title but worked in with the themes of the album.”\n\n<b>“Sing Good”</b>\n“It started as a gibberish jam, and I started mumbling, ‘I can’t really sing.’ I thought, that’s kind of funny. I don’t know if I’ve heard someone write about not being able to sing. I was writing music before I was producing it—like I say in the lyrics, I would get the lyric books of my favorite albums and be like, ‘What’s a verse? What’s a chorus? Oh OK, this is the formula,’ and that’s how I wrote about it. I would just write songs about going to the shops and stuff but never really show them to anyone ’cause I wasn’t a good singer.”\n\n<b>“It’s You” (with daine)</b>\n“daine was having a really bad day and we were trying to make music but they weren’t feeling super good. I was a little bit pushy—I was very gentle but I was like, ‘Let’s record something.’ So we just did this one little recording, this one gibberish take, and it ended up being the song. Later, when daine was feeling better, we put lyrics to it and rerecorded it. I’m so glad we pushed it that day.”\n\n<b>“All at Once”</b>\n“The verse at the end is about, I’m always at my desk in the dark, always working by myself late at night at the computer—that’s where I get the best work done a lot of the time. I wanted to send off the album with the last devotional nod to everything my computer had done for me, good and bad.

His mellifluous drawl and explicit lyrics coupled with surreally melodic instrumentals yield some of the most crowd-pleasing tracks of his career to date. From the irreverent strip club bounce of “BTA” to the smooth talk of “CHAINS ON” and “SUPER SLIME,” he’s in rare form as a trap libertine. Elsewhere, he shouts out Zone 6 on the more ominous “MOP STICK,” embraces baller status on “SNAKE,” and vibes with Latto on “WHAT’S HAPPENIN’.” Naturally, 21 Savage makes an appearance alongside Coupe on “ICED TEA,” but it’s the fresh Project Pat hook that takes the already elevated single to even higher heights.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"PARADISE","playParams":{"id":"1826145543","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paradise/1826145543","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3GVcT0ZaiYTX3ZVETuP1aD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826145543/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"898005271","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/898005271?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754637740086,"RTCI":0}}},"1826207042":{"id":"1826207042","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826207042?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lil Poppa","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-poppa/1454571030","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffe9c0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0f0200","textColor2":"220600","textColor3":"3f3026","textColor4":"4e3426","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/54/56/78/5456783a-8f45-b166-b366-34c40b9e11b3/25UMGIM82859.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ffeac1","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"080400","textColor2":"4a0d00","textColor3":"393226","textColor4":"6e3926","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b1/12/40/b1124070-8884-cf03-cf0d-44c427b5c7c8/Job6c2b03e5-3e5f-4186-9ef3-db04b0feba52-199166981-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389904429_2278170316-Time1754259890555.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"22201c","gradient":{"color":"22201c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"360900","textColor3":"3e3226","textColor4":"5e3627","textGradient":["ffffff","360900"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/7c/3e/11/7c3e1136-c0e5-e404-469b-f088b86c83d4/Jobf98bb9d5-dc8f-42da-b191-736901ff845d-199166980-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389904430_2278170317-Time1754258263327.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"552b25","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"fff5cd","textColor2":"e8cdac","textColor3":"dcccab","textColor4":"caad91","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2c/82/72/2c8272c4-2539-bbfe-fb79-b035f9c7cb0c/eeb1353e-cb1d-485a-9e85-2f1b83737e45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The melodic Florida rapper explores both love and pain.","standard":"Signed to Yo Gotti’s CMG imprint, Lil Poppa specializes in a style where melodic rap and pain rap meet.

Both of ’em.”","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Pop"],"name":"HELLA PRESSURE - EP","playParams":{"id":"1827566285","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hella-pressure-ep/1827566285"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827566285/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1318085504","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1318085504?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754637045918,"RTCI":0}}},"1827591312":{"id":"1827591312","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827591312?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Daniel Pemberton","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-pemberton/2628067","artwork":{"bgColor":"dec313","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1d1111","textColor2":"091d28","textColor3":"433511","textColor4":"333e24","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5f/c8/4a/5fc84adb-46ca-1784-2e51-df568c15588c/903.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"68420d","gradient":{"color":"68420d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"02273a","textColor3":"3a340a","textColor4":"324a30","textGradient":["ffffff","02273a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/53/9f/15/539f1544-48bc-2643-5489-acb8c3b7d21d/Job13f44914-2f59-4d41-a20d-3b380c22507e-198081501-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387754713_2260677987-Time1753135788090.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"68420d","gradient":{"color":"68420d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"012536","textColor3":"342e03","textColor4":"32492b","textGradient":["ffffff","012536"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/67/0c/65/670c650e-193d-6933-403b-7d0dd4cdbc52/Job37e5ed8e-6c4e-4ca6-9b6d-fd027af06b58-198081500-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387754714_2260677988-Time1753134731531.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"3a4762","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"bdcdf7","textColor2":"a1c0f8","textColor3":"a3b2d9","textColor4":"8ca8da","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/29/d8/64/29d864cb-ee40-723d-09e6-e6171551bd1c/ea0e4b49-ac99-4bf3-abcd-56998f60844c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Playful, jazzy action cues for the animated sequel.","tagline":"New Soundtrack"},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Original Score"],"name":"The Bad Guys 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","playParams":{"id":"1827591312","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":40,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-bad-guys-2-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1827591312","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0OOruSDLvleGc47uqRcbWm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827591312/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2628067","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2628067?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754577455600,"RTCI":0}}},"1827604681":{"id":"1827604681","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827604681?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Pokémon","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pok%C3%A9mon/19261630","artwork":{"bgColor":"f5b37e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0507","textColor2":"060808","textColor3":"3b281f","textColor4":"362a20","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/01/e1/54/01e1549a-fedf-5af5-0c9c-51468fcb5522/8721215781943.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"dde6c4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"080909","textColor2":"070909","textColor3":"32352e","textColor4":"32352e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c0/1c/c1/c01cc1b5-3635-2106-dd75-6b8950934f5d/30247dbb-0cc3-43e8-a11c-921ae0153463.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Children's Music"],"name":"2025 Pokémon World Championships -

The record marks Freedia’s first foray into straight-up gospel music, borrowing its name from her hometown’s Pressing Onward Baptist Church and dedicated to her late partner Devon Hurst, who passed away earlier this year. But as with Freedia’s thrilling and all-encompassing career, <i>Pressing Onward</i> contains surprises at every turn; alongside the raucous hip-house of “Take My Hand” and the bounce-inflected “Highway to Heaven,” there’s some of her most melodically straightforward music to date in the slow-burning “Church.” Along with guests like Billy Porter and Tamar Braxton, Freedia is joined by a full gospel choir on the majority of<i>Pressing Onward</i>’s 14 tracks, and the resulting effect is a maximalized version of the sonic joy-whirlwind that Freedia has built her career on creating.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Gospel","Music","Christian","Jazz","Contemporary Jazz"],"name":"Pressing

bold step further into pop: “I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”","standard":"Even on her major-label debut, 2016’s <i>Hero</i>, Maren Morris bent the rules of traditional country radio: She cursed, read men for filth, and, on breakthrough single “My Church,” bucked the title’s pious implication by declaring the radio, not the church, as her salvation. Since then, the Texas-born singer-songwriter (who moved to Nashville in her twenties at the behest of her pal Kacey Musgraves) has purposefully distanced herself from the Music City machine, mocking the industry’s conservatism on 2023’s “The Tree” and promoting 2024’s <i>Intermission</i> EP explicitly as pop. The five tracks from that EP appear alongside nine new ones on Morris’ fourth album, <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>—an even bolder departure from her country roots.\n\nFor both <i>Intermission</i> and <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>, Morris veered away from Music Row and towards a crack team of pop songwriters (among them Julia Michaels, Tobias Jesso Jr., and MUNA). There’s no mistaking lead single “people still show up” for anything like country; instead, Morris sounds funkier than ever over a slow-simmering Jack Antonoff groove in celebration of the safety net friends provide after a breakup. “I wrote it back in early 2023, before a lot of my personal life stuff was imploding,” Morris tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, referring in part to her 2024 divorce. “So it was almost like this premonition of a song.”\n\nCatharsis comes up often: On the ’80s R&B throwback “cry in the car,” Morris extols the virtues of weeping at the wheel, and on the Julia Michaels duet “cut!” all the therapy and yoga in the world can’t match the release of a good scream session. And though “too good” might be the record’s twangiest moment, it’s also the pettiest: “Bitch, you still owe me rent!” Morris yowls to an ex, hoping that the couch they’re crashing on these days is comfy. “I don’t want perfection from my idols,” she tells Lowe. “I want them to be honest, as much as they’re willing to be. I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Country"],"name":"D R E A M S I C L E

hip-hop greats find common ground amid contrast.","standard":"When Larry June and The Alchemist get together, the results are invariably magical. Two West Coast hip-hop mainstays, their 2023 joint album <i>The Great Escape</i> and a few surrounding one-offs clarified just how marvelously the Bay’s healthiest MC could vibe with LA’s infamous beat artisan. While that project’s featured guests were overwhelmingly comprised of ALC familiars, the duo’s 2025 follow-up welcomes a relative newcomer to that particular scene as its third headliner: 2 Chainz. Having established his reputation primarily with trap producers, the Georgia native reached a certain level of ubiquity by working beyond subgenre borders, which contextualizes his presence on <i>Life Is Beautiful</i>. As his biggest fans assuredly know, he and June are in no way strangers, appearing together on the latter’s <i>Spaceships on the Blade</i> and <i>The Night Shift</i>, albeit not over Alchemist beats.\n\nCommonalities and contrasts between the two rappers make <i>Life Is Beautiful</i> a uniquely satisfying listening experience. “Colossal” recalls 2 Chainz’s <i>Most Expensivest</i> exploits, his luxe litany of decidedly un-humble brags pleasantly incongruous with June’s signature lifestyle index involving fresh-squeezed juices, vintage timepieces, and automotive excellence. At times, they suit one another like a well-balanced cocktail, trading unapologetically profane bars for more methodical and measured ones on “I Been” and “Any Day.” Elsewhere, their shared maturity differentiates them from the brand-name-dropping rap pack, their grown-folks motivations informing the flexes of “LLC” and the title track. Devoid of distractions from outside guests, both artists’ skills and quirks come to the fore over Alchemist’s breathtaking, often sublimely soulful, instrumentals.","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Life Is Beautiful (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1828816937","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-02-07","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-is-beautiful-deluxe/1828816937","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2eKy2HAQ2J3WY4Q4rVCha2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828816937/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"675391681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/675391681?l=en-US"},{"id":"435300447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/435300447?l=en-US"},{"id":"28446224","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/28446224?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754650434228,"RTCI":0}}},"1829478594":{"id":"1829478594","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829478594?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Laura Karpman","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laura-karpman/73511181","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"3e2013","textColor2":"481a0c","textColor3":"654d42","textColor4":"6c483d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a8/23/0a/a8230ad0-145b-dea0-d93b-70802055f2a3/780163674828.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"name":"Duster (Original Series Soundtrack)","playParams":{"id":"1829478594","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":26,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/duster-original-series-soundtrack/1829478594","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ljhGzOnHXtIupNqP9Se12"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829478594/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"73511181","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/73511181?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754627309961,"RTCI":0}}},"1829508142":{"id":"1829508142","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829508142?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chuckyy","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chuckyy/1703210537","artwork":{"bgColor":"2f1b1a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f2ecd8","textColor2":"f7a550","textColor3":"cbc2b2","textColor4":"cf8945","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/f7/8c/12f78c26-ad49-1aea-6803-4efd78430ec4/55925.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"0d0d0d","gradient":{"color":"0d0d0d","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"cfb0b3","textColor3":"b9aea8","textColor4":"aa8f91","textGradient":["ffffff","cfb0b3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/1e/f4/08/1ef408e5-76c3-c92a-019e-924860b82729/Jobb2a26d81-b11d-4f61-baa4-d0fcaf270498-199350449-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390276049_2280989324-Time1754437610400.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"0d0d0d","gradient":{"color":"0d0d0d","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e56c48","textColor3":"b2a281","textColor4":"bc583c","textGradient":["ffffff","e56c48"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/81/b3/d4/81b3d4d4-2c9a-dae9-b463-44dcdf7351d1/Jobff26f847-045c-415f-8cd0-88a83cb02ce4-199350448-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390276048_2280989325-Time1754436167218.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chicago’s reigning horrorcore MC is frighteningly versatile.","standard":"Though the title of Chuckyy’s 2025 album may suggest something haunted, supernatural, or in line with his obsession with all things scary, <i>I Live, I Die, I Live Again</i> also speaks to his resilience as a rapper. Chicago’s favorite horror rapper began dropping music in 2023, and very quickly managed to build a career indebted to, but not reliant on, horrorcore rap icons of yore. With <i>I Live, I Die, I Live Again</i>, he’s created a project that both leans into these aesthetics while introducing a wide swath of new genre exercises, including styles close to home (drill) and far out in left field (alt-pop). “My World” fits firmly into the latter, featuring a New Wave-inspired hook from EKKSTACY and a torrent of bars from Chuckyy that fit loosely over the propulsive punk-leaning groove. Even when the vibes shift, though, Chuckyy remains devoted to his signature themes of loss, alienation, and determination.","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"I Live, I Die, I Live Again (Resurrected)","playParams":{"id":"1829508142","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-06","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-live-i-die-i-live-again-resurrected/1829508142","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6JqKTBpbRpGZ9RMUlPCbM2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829508142/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1703210537","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1703210537?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754631095059,"RTCI":0}}},"1829519174":{"id":"1829519174","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829519174?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Eli Iwasa","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eli-iwasa/950037128","artwork":{"bgColor":"ece3e3","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"261914","textColor2":"2f2420","textColor3":"4e413d","textColor4":"554a47","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3c/35/87/3c358760-6d99-6294-12f0-67947b50d976/ddc0c773-3395-4505-8b81-23adfc960310.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"ececec","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"2c211e","textColor2":"382a24","textColor3":"524947","textColor4":"5c514c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/96/f9/18/96f91828-4754-d10d-e8c8-86ce83bd68a4/f0ca74a9-0b98-471e-b29b-e2a943d99369.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"2d2321","textColor2":"34241e","textColor3":"534c4a","textColor4":"594c47","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c4/8b/6b/c48b6b46-31cb-10c6-04b0-137998dba514/87952f43-2a50-4b1d-97dd-e69231fbb487.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"130805","textColor2":"1c100b","textColor3":"3f3633","textColor4":"463c38","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/72/2f/ec/722fec71-635b-8960-678b-f5d7ef83be1b/45089089-0b1c-47cf-9f10-3bcc3405152a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"130804","textColor2":"1e120e","textColor3":"3f3633","textColor4":"473e3a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/99/6b/70/996b70c9-a6a5-f3d1-ef9d-aca887414b3b/10f9d3a0-f856-4def-82b5-e1a06491005b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Brazilian DJ gracefully finds the links between disco and house.","tagline":"New DJ Mix"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"name":"Beats in Space 173: Eli Iwasa (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1829519174","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beats-in-space-173-eli-iwasa-dj-mix/1829519174"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829519174/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"950037128","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/950037128?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754650313407,"RTCI":0}}},"1829564653":{"id":"1829564653","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829564653?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1b1c24","textColor2":"312b2f","textColor3":"494a50","textColor4":"5a5558","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/07/ea/56/07ea56fe-f4f2-358e-aa82-e3f2b28c34ba/25UMGIM96101.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"name":"The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder: Season 3 (Music from the Series)","playParams":{"id":"1829564653","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-season-3-music/1829564653","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6P5wTFTi16WbBOcjR0oWR1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829564653/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754614986993,"RTCI":0}}},"1829651203":{"id":"1829651203","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829651203?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"JayO","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jayo/1468250276","artwork":{"bgColor":"40106d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4dc21","textColor2":"daaa24","textColor3":"c3b330","textColor4":"bb8b32","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fe/f6/23/fef6238f-f07d-d7f9-a56e-448e02bc0f14/25UMGIM85954.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"name":"Hue EP -

A major-label full-length debut backed by Drake and Fuerza Regida, with prominent features from both, swiftly put the rising teenage star in an enviable position. Less than a year later, he returns with a sophomore album intended to further elevate his standing in the música mexicana scene and to better differentiate himself from the current profusion of viral sensations. \n\nIf <i>CRISTIAN</i> is any indication, Chino Pacas has a great deal to offer his listeners in the coming years. A robust follow-up with high-profile guests like Luis R Conriquez and Tito Double P, it situates the young artist within styles both familiar and favorable. There is, of course, an ample selection of corridos, beginning with “CHAMAQUITO” and carrying into even more defiant and evocative expressions like “ZUMBANDO” and the standout “FLOTA” with Neton Vega. On a different tip, the Banda Otro Pedo collab “NO ES UN JUEGO” gives his preferred approach a decidedly lusher, more ornate refresh. An apparent 180-degree shift, “GTO” takes him into a seemingly Bay Area-inspired hip-hop mode opposite Latin rap fixture Santa Fe Klan. \n\nWhere some artists of his generation might be inclined to simply stay in their lane, he makes subtler adjustments that justify his profile. On the beautifully arranged “ANOCHE,” he reveals a sensitive romantic side in wondrous contrast with the harder stuff. His earnest cover of Tropicalísimo Apache fave “OJITOS MENTIROSOS” not only comes naturally, but also indicates a knowledgeable appreciation for his predecessors. \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Música Mexicana"],"name":"CRISTIAN (Deluxe Version)","playParams":{"id":"1830108356","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-02","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cristian-deluxe-version/1830108356","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1K7s2ph3qP2lmfe6nH9e9n"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830108356/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666295765","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666295765?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754634264396,"RTCI":0}}},"1830201628":{"id":"1830201628","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830201628?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"DJ Spinz","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-spinz/253695275","artwork":{"bgColor":"58f708","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0b0b","textColor2":"262245","textColor3":"1a3a0a","textColor4":"304d39","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/24/e1/03/24e10337-a963-2880-1c19-f972249ae331/5bc98b3a-0e12-4ba3-bad9-23f318f86605.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"58f708","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0b0b0b","textColor2":"161431","textColor3":"1a3a0b","textColor4":"234129","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/03/b1/e0/03b1e0c6-fbae-1da2-4858-1a0d6d7f09a7/29f7f048-4eb9-4d08-b6a9-f6b7cb4a6bc5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"f9cedb","hasP3":true,"height":2732,"textColor1":"0b0b0b","textColor2":"271b4b","textColor3":"3a3234","textColor4":"513f68","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/df/a2/12/dfa212ba-8bb3-7834-57a8-10f2a600af84/864ae1d2-69ab-4203-bcd5-c457175e1b10.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"f6d9e0","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"4a4264","textColor4":"544f52","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ad/77/a7/ad77a7ba-ecd0-91ed-1ec3-336890f5ca96/303f20b9-d540-4e6d-8a87-5947e43b1c79.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f87be0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"141228","textColor2":"1e173c","textColor3":"41274d","textColor4":"492b5d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c2/85/04/c28504a1-8391-1a61-450d-df937b4eaa87/bec65fc1-70b4-4cee-a624-bc3bbc24b762.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"f8ceda","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"09060a","textColor2":"251d3c","textColor3":"392e34","textColor4":"4f405b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cf/cf/ef/cfcfef59-892b-e196-70be-5438fae41953/efbfb390-b6ad-44fc-bab7-b7fbe6ef7183.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"ffd0ea","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"0d0b0e","textColor2":"303030","textColor3":"3d323a","textColor4":"595055","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e7/43/1a/e7431a24-e8f7-2ddc-8762-d2fd99914dd9/2127ae91-a598-4fd7-b7b7-e2e39c6d2217.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Atlanta-based producer and DJ delivers a mix of tracks he’s loving.","standard":"This summer, Atlanta-based DJ and producer DJ Spinz is looking forward to spending “good times with good people” whether they’re at a BBQ, a pool party, or on a boat.

The sultry second single “Strip It Down” is still one of Bryan’s sexier tunes, while the Karen Fairchild collaboration “Home Alone Tonight” ups the romantic ante with a “will they, won’t they”-style duet about two heartbroken strangers connecting at a bar. “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” is textbook wholesome Bryan, and is the EP’s rootsiest, most purely country song.

Those who’ve tracked his hitmaking journey to the top will no doubt express a fondness for his 2010s run, which soundtracked Atlanta’s rise with countless rap talents, several of whom remain bona fide stars to this day. Hosted by DJ Spinz, another ATL fixture responsible for more than a few of the area’s biggest singles, the painstakingly curatorial <i>A Futuristic Summa</i> taps back in with many of the rappers, producers, and most importantly the vibes of that very era—albeit with some modern touches.\n\nThe party sensibility begins early on with peppy cuts like “I Want It All” and “They Wanna Have Fun,” the latter featuring Gucci Mane with a gratifyingly nostalgic flow. The 808 bump that built so much Southern hip-hop bursts through on the Freaknik-conjuring “Butterflies (Right Now),” where Quavo’s unmistakable voice glides between the breaks. As things progress and the beats shift, a plethora of Atlanta artists popular in the 2010s make noteworthy appearances, including Skooly, Young Dro, and Yung Booke, as do fresher faces like BunnaB and YKNIECE.\n\nThe highlights are plentiful, like when Brick Squad Monopoly’s Waka Flocka Flame comes through on “Clap” or when he joins the aforementioned Quavo on the shimmering “Drip BBQ.” Rocko steps up to challenge those faking their fortunes on “Make It Make Sense,” while 2 Chainz flaunts his legit wealth on “I Like That.” When Young Thug shows up on “Birthday,” it’s a big deal in and of itself. Further capturing the magnitude of this musical event, the late-in-the-game R&B jam “Partying & Drinking” introduces Young Metro’s most faithful cohorts 21 Savage and Future, with Waka also in the mix again.\n\nWhile the vocalists who cycle in and out of <i>A Futuristic Summa</i> captivate and compel, a big part of what makes this project so meaningful is the collaborative nature of the instrumentals. 2010s heroes like Bobby Kritical, Zaytoven, and Honorable C.N.O.T.E. play vital roles in Metro’s bespoke production supergroup. Sometimes their presences are identifiable by the respective tags that dotted and defined seminal mixtapes; other times their contributions feel more like Easter eggs. These artists were integral not just to the success of trap, but of other regional mutations like futuristic swag, revived here on “Issa Party” with Fast Life Yungstaz and Shop Boyz alums.\n","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Metro Boomin Presents: A Futuristic Summa (Hosted by DJ Spinz)","playParams":{"id":"1830374691","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-01","trackCount":24,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/metro-boomin-presents-a-futuristic-summa-hosted-by-dj-spinz/1830374691","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48UcYpGBpoNhEJriPfZFWJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830374691/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"670534462","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/670534462?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754627346846,"RTCI":0}}},"1830535998":{"id":"1830535998","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830535998?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sasha Keable","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sasha-keable/325850892","artwork":{"bgColor":"1d1d12","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"e0a074","textColor2":"ce9b61","textColor3":"b98660","textColor4":"ab8151","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/ef/c3/c9efc3c0-001d-c306-c99a-4d7ba2870082/196873160948.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"283120","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f6bb78","textColor2":"f8944c","textColor3":"cda066","textColor4":"ce8043","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/55/d4/87/55d4873e-41be-c4d4-1ad9-1e4773961837/15f72fe6-0a06-486a-9043-a5bd39985911.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"463428","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f6c79c","textColor2":"f9bd8e","textColor3":"d3a985","textColor4":"d5a279","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/40/77/25/40772539-5dbc-fc9d-3635-9e18a40bce9c/6e9491e0-fc4d-46f9-97fa-04c60f9976ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B star on her fifth EP: “It made me feel like, ‘All right, you are enough.’”","standard":"It’s not uncommon for artists to find catharsis, resolution, and therapy in making music. For Sasha Keable, though, it was therapy that led her to songwriting. “I put myself into therapy when I was six years old,” the Londoner tells Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis. “If my therapist didn’t hand me a book and go, ‘You need to start writing,’ there would be no Sasha [the artist]. She was like, ‘Start writing.’ I was so angry. I would just poke holes in the pages, trying to stab the book, whatever. So dark. Then after a while, the stabbing turned into kind of drawings. Then the drawings turned into words, then poems, then it started to turn into songs. And that was literally how my brain then started working through stuff.” \n\nGiven that songwriting foundation, it’s not surprising that Keable’s fifth EP, <i>act right</i>, is a work of bold honesty and expression. It’s also one where she can feel she’s making the music she wants to make, in the way she wants to make it—which hasn’t always been the case. The R&B singer-songwriter’s deep and nimble vocals first drew attention with her featured spot on Disclosure’s 2013 club cut “Voices,” but she’s dismissive of her debut EP <i>Black Book</i>, released the same year, and its 2014 follow-up <i>Lemongrass and Limeleaves</i>. “They’re not bad,” she says. “It feels like 20 million years ago. It just feels like it was so much of other people trying to dictate how I made music all the time. That was something that really didn’t resonate with me.” Two more EPs followed—<i>Man</i> in 2019 and 2021’s <i>Intermission</i> in 2021—but, again, Keable found herself yearning for more independence and she cut loose from her label and the teams around her. “Just after <i>Intermission</i>, I literally left everyone.” she says. “I was like, ‘No, I’m not doing this. I need to just set my own pace and work out what it means.’”\n\nWhat it means on <i>act right</i>, her first EP in four years, is turning a betrayal suffered into seven heart-grabbing songs. Lean, efficient production allows the impact of her words to simmer in the spaces as she portrays a journey from devastation to healing. On “FEEL SOMETHING,” she’s helpless and reckless in the aftershock (“Feels like I’m driving 95 with no lights on/No seatbelt on a terminated licence”) and struggling to let go of a bad thing during the angry and fragile “heartbeat”—but the tears clear on the title track, leaving the bitter clarity of seeing someone for who they really are. Optimism floods through “WHY” as Keable manifests what love should be, creating a standard to hold future relationships to. Like the whole EP, it’s a work of purpose and belief, the sound of an artist expressing her truest self—and feeling satisfied with who that person is. “My main thing is being able to create music for myself, music that fuels me, music that keeps me excited, music that gets me up in the morning,” she says. “I was not going through a good time writing [<i>act right</i>]. I guess [it’s] music that literally made me feel like, ‘All right, you are enough.’”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"act right","playParams":{"id":"1830535998","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/act-right/1830535998","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4YVaV9ViXndugkvyBOBGxX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830535998/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"325850892","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/325850892?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754651394158,"RTCI":0}}},"1830597627":{"id":"1830597627","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830597627?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gunna","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gunna/1236267297","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1f21","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cdced1","textColor2":"bdcad2","textColor3":"aaabae","textColor4":"9da8af","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/1e/0c/391e0c06-1536-a90f-7c49-06b9289c37e1/075679606358.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e0e3e5","textColor2":"c0cbd5","textColor3":"babcbe","textColor4":"a0aab1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/91/45/5f/91455fab-2c5f-2fe3-ef88-0e988bc8925e/Jobde1be0c1-f08c-4b95-a3cc-99cf17fe7bfc-199340778-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390258076_2280839326-Time1754428437360.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"121113","gradient":{"color":"121113","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"c1d2d9","textColor3":"b6b9bb","textColor4":"9dabb1","textGradient":["ffffff","c1d2d9"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/30/24/57/30245737-e47a-3ee8-fbbe-fb3affd812d8/Job49e523bd-67c6-4546-8d14-00598b500233-199340779-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390258075_2280839327-Time1754430117690.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"020303","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cac5c4","textColor2":"d0c0b5","textColor3":"a29e9d","textColor4":"a79a91","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5a/54/27/5a542752-b7b7-09ca-f347-4ff3eb66008f/9e42f6cc-5db2-4f05-8763-45ec98ebf883.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cdb9a9","textColor2":"d29d80","textColor3":"a7978a","textColor4":"ab8169","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/6b/1d/956b1d46-7375-e386-63e8-34b4a9ac910a/1309839e-c54f-446e-a4e5-7761b983192d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The grand culmination of the rap star’s decade-long run.","standard":"With an album title like <i>The Last Wun</i>, speculation is bound to fly about Gunna’s future with—or without—his longtime label home YSL Records. Perpetuating his penchant for portraiture, the Cubist cover art conspicuously obscures his face even more so than on 2024’s <i>One of Wun</i> and further adds to the mysteriousness of these proceedings. Still, considering the repeated successes he’s enjoyed over the past decade, both solo and with hitmakers like Drake and Lil Baby, this sprawling set makes for an impressive send-off, one indicative of his commitment to quality. \n\nVictory laps don’t always yield the best results, but <i>The Last Wun</i> stands apart, staying consistently interesting throughout its more than two dozen songs. “pushin P” fans don’t have to wait long for new meme-ready moments like “let that sink in” and “just say dat,” though later cuts like the defiant “cfwm” and “him all along” are well worth sticking around for. His moneyed, jet-setting lifestyle matches a perpetual grindset mentality, evident on “showed em” and “on me.” Still, he remains a hedonist at heart, feeling faded yet tenacious on “again” and similarly invested in his pleasure on “gp.”\n\nRepeat Gunna collaborator Offset once again proves a worthy foil on “at my purest,” while Nechie adds some much-appreciated plug talk on “i can’t feel my face.” But as Gunna clearly looks towards the next stages of his career, his international tastes begin to intentionally solidify through some of his other feature choices. No fewer than three Nigerian stars make appearances here, with Burna Boy’s silky-smooth one on the explicitly salacious “wgft” contrasting with Wizkid’s romantic contribution to the subtler “forever be mine” and Asake’s more melodic placement on the luxe “satisfaction.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"The Last Wun","playParams":{"id":"1830597627","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":25,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-wun/1830597627","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6l2aad6LJghHkbd0KX1f7w"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830597627/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1236267297","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1236267297?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754642706285,"RTCI":0}}},"1830609950":{"id":"1830609950","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830609950?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hunny Bee","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hunny-bee/1651258768","artwork":{"bgColor":"190d2a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6b571","textColor2":"db953d","textColor3":"ca9363","textColor4":"b47a39","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5e/13/48/5e134861-5214-8940-8f24-d5943d22f60c/dff30fc4-8a16-4f84-a800-25a271fe5eff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"Uh Huh Hunny, Vol. 2 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1830609950","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":44,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/uh-huh-hunny-vol-2-dj-mix/1830609950"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830609950/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1651258768","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1651258768?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754652081235,"RTCI":0}}},"1831044542":{"id":"1831044542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831044542?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bryson Tiller","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryson-tiller/642591128","artwork":{"bgColor":"091215","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4dccc","textColor2":"c2dbdc","textColor3":"b8b4a7","textColor4":"9db2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/f3/91/32f39154-b2ea-d39b-20fc-b039eb739760/196873461342.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cad2cb","textColor2":"cca882","textColor3":"a5aba6","textColor4":"a6896c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/ac/7d/8bac7d7c-3d43-daee-fa0f-fa55b4a008b5/3a414f76-61bf-462a-83cc-40daf17d384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e8af7b","textColor2":"de9c65","textColor3":"bd8f66","textColor4":"b58054","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/70/4e/8b/704e8bdd-3aef-f88b-d033-90d0b2f99d30/82e6f7e6-51b9-4a62-8610-1b56692192b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The multi-hyphenate sheds his vices on part one of his double album effort.","standard":"With Bryson Tiller’s 2024 self-titled LP, the Louisville crooner crafted a genre-bending departure from his comfort zone, experimenting with the soundscapes of dancehall, drill, and pop next to his signature mixture of hip-hop and R&B. Tiller fully embraced himself and where he was at within his artistry, so much so that he decided to take a hiatus from music after its release to pursue his passion for video game design. Released as the first installment of the double album, <i>The Vices</i>, Tiller lets go of shortcomings and starts a new chapter of his ever-evolving sound.\n\nAs he does across the majority of his discography, the singer-songwriter toes the line between singing and rapping; however, on <i>The Vices</i> he leans less into the moody trap-soul tracks that defined his career and launched him into superstardom. Instead, he dives deeper into the rap-heavy side of his musicality, delivering sharp flows and gritty, energetic bars over dynamic productions from Charlie Heat, Gravez, Teddy Walton, and Hitmaka.\n\nTiller is unapologetic as he revels in his impulsive nature, waxing poetic as he brags about his lifestyle (“First Place,” “200 Bands,” “Make Life Easy”) while navigating the ups and downs of his situationships (“No Sharing,” “More Than Money,” “Last Call”), and even contemplates letting go of his player ways (“Burnout”). Tiller isn’t alone as he ventures through partying and romance. He gets some help from Bossman Dlow, Rick Rock, Piles, T-Pain, BabyDrill, Luh Tyler, and Bun B, who are along for the ride.\n\nOn the closing track “Finished,” Tiller addresses his naysayers and critics who doubt his ability to surpass his 2015 debut album <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. His resilience in the face of criticism is evident as he confidently asserts: “I’ll be done with this shit when I’m done/I ain’t lookin’ for the number one /Just money and the shit keep comin’/Kept goin’, kept wrist V or nothin’/Ain’t fallin’ off, bitch, you funny.”","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Solace & The
