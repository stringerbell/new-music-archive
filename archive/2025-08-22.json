Brown simplifies his sound without sacrificing eccentricity and nuance.","standard":"After years spent grinding on the DIY circuit under aliases like Mother Marcus and Riley on Fire, the Baltimore musician (born Marcus Brown) took on the Nourished by Time moniker in 2019. He broke through with 2023’s <i>Erotic Probiotic 2</i>, his first album as Nourished by Time—a swirl of lo-fi synth-pop, post-punk, funk, and R&B that made capitalist critique sound cool. On his second full-length (released on XL Recordings, as was his 2024 <i>Catching Chickens</i> EP), Brown simplifies his sound without sacrificing its freewheeling eccentricities and lyrical nuance. Here, songs about love reveal themselves as songs about surviving and finding meaning in an alienated, oppressive modern world. “Know he’s got a purpose/But he’s always working/Tryna beat the system/Manifest a vision,” he sings on “9 2 5,” which transmutes day-job drudgery into piano-house euphoria. Here and there, shimmers of beauty and absurdity shine through the cracks, like a story of a half-baked psychic reading on “Idiot in the Park.”","tagline":"New

the difference between his introspective and poppier sides.","standard":"Jordan Davis is a country wild card, zigging where others often zag and sticking to his musical roots regardless of what sounds are dominating country radio. The Shreveport, Louisiana-born singer-songwriter continues that streak on this third full-length, which follows his 2023 album <i>Bluebird Days</i>, a project that spawned four No. 1 country hits. Produced by Paul DiGiovanni, <i>Learn the Hard Way</i> splits the difference between the quieter, more introspective bent of <i>Bluebird Days</i> and the poppier sound of Davis’ debut <i>Home State</i>, offering a fuller sense of his musical ambitions. \n\nHighlights on <i>Learn the Hard Way</i> include “Bar None,” a melodic, soulful account of moving on from heartbreak, and “Jesus Wouldn’t Do,” an introspective ballad about owning imperfection and loving one’s neighbor. Davis taps a couple of friends to join him on the outing, too, with acclaimed singer-songwriter Carly Pearce lending her voice to the heartfelt duet “Mess with Missing You” and blues-rock guitar slinger Marcus King contributing to the funky, swampy “Louisiana Stick,” which pays tribute to Davis’ home state.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Learn The Hard

was more”: The band on their self-assured fourth album.","standard":"Following the widescreen dream pop of 2021’s <i>Blue Weekend</i>, Wolf Alice felt some sonic skin shedding was in order for their fourth album. “We were thinking about what we were doing in a much more calculated way,” bassist Theo Ellis tells Apple Music’s Matt Wilkinson. “I don’t know whether it’s age or whether it’s having done this for the fourth time, but less was more with this record.”\n\nRecorded in LA with Adele/Paul McCartney producer Greg Kurstin, <i>The Clearing</i> finds the North London four-piece stripping back the alt-rock fuzz and shoegazey FX that had characterized their earlier releases for a more classic sound. One with a warm analog glow and rich FM radio-friendly melodies that positions them closer to ’70s soft rock than the 2010s indie scene from which they broke out.\n\nListen closely, and there are nods to that golden era bubbling up throughout <i>The Clearing</i>: drummer Joel Amey’s “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”-cribbing shuffle on “Leaning Against the Wall,” the ELO/Beach Boys chug that drives “Bread Butter Tea Sugar,” and guitarist Joff Oddie switching between breezy strumming, intricate fingerpicking, and searing melodic lines like <i>Rumours</i>-era Lindsey Buckingham.\n\nSuch echoes reflect the band’s listening habits: a stack of records on heavy rotation in the studio that included Fleetwood Mac, George Harrison, and folk-rock outliers Pentangle.\n\n“This time, we weren’t afraid to give references. Maybe in the past I felt that I didn’t want to give them because then it would sound like that,” singer Ellie Rowsell says of the band’s touchstones when making <i>The Clearing</i>. “But now I felt much braver to say, <i>this</i> is my reference. I knew that it was going to sound like us because I understood what we were a bit more.”\n\nThe wide-open space afforded by <i>The Clearing</i>’s musical palette allows Wolf Alice’s finest set of songs to date to shine. Whether it’s “Just Two Girls’” sparkling, disco-flecked pop, Rowsell’s hushed reflections on aging and motherhood on “Play It Out” or “White Horses”—a remarkable interpolation of folk and krautrock that startles without having to turn everything up into the red.\n\n“Maybe there are people who are scared of rock music that is soft. ‘Soft rock’ has felt like something I should never say out loud up until now,” reflects Rowsell. “I don’t care. I’m interested in music that you can play live that is energetic and performative without having to be all distortion pedals and shouting and fast and loud. I like that stuff still, but there’s certain songs that we have in our set where I’m like, ‘Why is this an “up” part of the set when it’s just a good acoustic guitar?’ Or, ‘How come I feel like I am giving 100 percent when I’m not stomping around on stage screaming in people’s faces?’”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Clearing","playParams":{"id":"1812904249","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-clearing/1812904249","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2kKc3Yid0YR3SSbeQ3x5kV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812904249/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"589384117","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/589384117?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755870584672,"RTCI":0}}},"1813408033":{"id":"1813408033","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813408033?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Crabs","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-crabs/40873943","artwork":{"bgColor":"cadcf0","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"0d0f07","textColor2":"2f3619","textColor3":"333836","textColor4":"4e5744","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a4/9b/92/a49b92aa-8c64-0fbc-6ed0-0aa7ef469dd3/54341.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Years at the Unknown","playParams":{"id":"1813408033","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/years-at-the-unknown/1813408033","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/03c8u11lRWQsCeACNPHksC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813408033/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"40873943","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/40873943?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752813288395,"RTCI":0}}},"1813516732":{"id":"1813516732","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813516732?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Molly Tuttle","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/molly-tuttle/864763421","artwork":{"bgColor":"020307","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e8bd62","textColor2":"f2b476","textColor3":"ba9850","textColor4":"c2905f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/83/8b/f1/838bf152-3f41-0401-32a8-35d0c662f995/075597896367.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"020305","gradient":{"color":"020305","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f4b479","textColor3":"ba994f","textColor4":"c39162","textGradient":["ffffff","f4b479"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/46/1b/6c/461b6c03-3655-180e-bc6c-338439bca008/Job55a4a8a9-db7d-42b3-a580-69530a1900e9-192443429-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376902877_2159668924-Time1747173122735.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"020305","gradient":{"color":"020305","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f1b880","textColor3":"ba9b4f","textColor4":"c19468","textGradient":["ffffff","f1b880"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3e/f5/a3/3ef5a359-4b46-03b5-5591-1a52a2a5d0fe/Jobfd823888-a349-4d3d-852b-ac23a5399810-192443430-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376902878_2159668925-Time1747174257983.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"584f48","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f9f4f0","textColor2":"faceb8","textColor3":"d9d3cf","textColor4":"dab5a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/08/57/8c/08578cab-d92e-88fe-87da-4f7060e0a70d/478bd964-10b6-4df2-b637-5968fb16bc79.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"685a45","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"fccd93","textColor2":"f9c991","textColor3":"deb683","textColor4":"dcb381","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/42/c0/7e/42c07e6f-38f6-1062-505f-8f3e822e7046/2cd1c0cf-35e7-4a97-aeab-4e7f4eadab7d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Bluegrass that honors tradition while exploring modern twists.","standard":"Expect the unexpected from Molly Tuttle, the California-hailing ascendant bluegrass star who’s seemingly determined to push the genre’s boundaries on her fifth full-length, <i>So Long Little Miss Sunshine</i>.

Even as Tuttle showcases her expert picking skills on tunes like the fiery opener “Everything Burns” and the kaleidoscopic “Oasis,” <i>So Long Little Miss Sunshine</i>’s straightforward loveliness recalls Kacey Musgraves’ own country-pop crossover <i>Golden Hour</i>, as Tuttle’s high register soars above the soft throb of “Golden State of Mind” and sways across the simple balladry of penultimate track “No Regrets.” The result is a confident record that splits the difference between traditionalism and modernity without losing an ounce of its creator’s winsome ingenuity.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"So Long Little Miss Sunshine","playParams":{"id":"1813516732","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/so-long-little-miss-sunshine/1813516732","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/66H97i02fAu4oFUYUGxIhr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813516732/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"864763421","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/864763421?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836594100,"RTCI":0}}},"1813912755":{"id":"1813912755","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813912755?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lainey Wilson","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lainey-wilson/907166363","artwork":{"bgColor":"110500","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c9c19a","textColor2":"dd9b45","textColor3":"a49b7b","textColor4":"b47d37","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/e3/10/d5e31058-a88d-d041-3c62-cdf238fe8027/4099964174717.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"271200","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"dca55e","textColor2":"dd9c4c","textColor3":"b8874b","textColor4":"b8803c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e9/c4/fb/e9c4fb11-24ae-619a-3e24-0da640d0b8e6/Job402c1442-8126-43d9-b7f5-5a5290cf19db-200622658-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392622717_2300135814-Time1755632381720.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"0e0700","gradient":{"color":"0e0700","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dc9338","textColor3":"ad9b74","textColor4":"b8792d","textGradient":["ffffff","dc9338"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/82/d5/86/82d5860e-6df4-9a02-e103-e698106b406a/Joba0c55837-0f70-4386-a54d-c93519d6da16-200622659-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392622718_2300135815-Time1755633761307.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1dfe4","textColor2":"d59e74","textColor3":"c4b6ba","textColor4":"ae8260","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8c/53/37/8c53378e-1b19-91e1-2db8-9cb2a147266b/8ca64003-84bd-4e78-8c54-b142f8131ef8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ae8467","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b0202","textColor2":"180b05","textColor3":"2c1c16","textColor4":"362318","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dc/e2/c2/dce2c2f6-0519-099b-65ad-cb8835f0122d/cab56ae1-a3bb-44de-8218-49315ea53908.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An expanded edition with five new tracks to mark a whirlwind 2025.","standard":"Lainey Wilson couldn’t have chosen a more fitting title for her fifth studio album. The wildly beloved country singer-songwriter’s rise to fame has surely been a whirlwind, catapulting the small-town Louisiana native from relative obscurity to stardom in just a few short years. That success was not earned overnight, though, as Wilson had put in nearly a decade of work before breaking out with <i>Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’</i> in 2021. “I felt like my life was changing at 190 miles an hour and I was just trying to keep one foot on the ground,” Wilson tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But I think those 10 years of nothing happening for me prepared me for my life changing super fast.”\n\n<i>Whirlwind</i> is Wilson at the height of her powers, mixing pop, rock, and soul into her already inimitable brand of traditionally informed country. Highlights include the title track, a light and groovy celebration of reckless love, and “Devil Don’t Go There,” a heartbreak ballad that lets Wilson lean into the emotive side of her versatile voice. The Miranda Lambert duet “Good Horses” connects two generations of country spitfires, with dusky production to emphasize the singers’ undeniable vocal chemistry. Wilson’s band sounds better than ever, too, which she attributes to years spent touring relentlessly and working toward a shared dream. “They are ride or die,” she says. “I mean, these guys are the ones that ate dirt with me. And I think it’s really important to keep the people close that you ate dirt with. They know you, they know how bad you want it. They want it just as bad. They love you for you. They sacrifice so much to be out there on the road with you.” Below, Wilson gives insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Whirlwind”</b>\n“I finally found a guy that gives me a run for my money. And he’s my biggest cheerleader. He’s just a good person. And he knows how important chasing down a dream is, because even when he was a little boy, football was his life. He did it and he tried out for the Steelers and made the team. And so he achieved what he set out to do. And so he knows. We met at a time where he was still playing with them, but then it all changed. So it was weird. It was like his life was changing as my life was changing and we were going different directions. So, yeah, life for us is a whirlwind.”\n\n<b>“Middle of It”</b>\n“We had actually just got nominated for Entertainer of the Year for the CMAs. And I had not been at my house in Nashville, and I didn’t have furniture in my house for months. We don’t need a couch, we’re not here. So my friends The Heart Wranglers came over and they just said, ‘Let’s do a heart check.’ And they’re like, ‘What’s going on? Where are you at? How you feel? Where’s your head?’ I sat on the floor and I just said, ‘I feel like I’m just smack-dab in the middle of it. It’s a blur to me where it started, where it’s going to end up. I just can’t hardly tell.’ And then we just started talking about how that’s really what all this is about anyway. That’s the beauty of it.”\n\n<b>“Whiskey Colored Crayon”</b>\n“That song actually came from a word exercise that my co-writer [Josh Kear] did. I’ll probably get this wrong, but every morning before he writes songs, he writes a list of things. And say the first list that he wrote was ‘things that I hate’ and maybe it’s lettuce or greens or whiskey or whatever. And then he writes a list of random things, things that you can use to create. He mix-mashed these words and he was like, ‘Well, I’ve got this whiskey-colored crayon,’ and we got to thinking about the storyline of this. And we came up with, ‘Okay, let’s think about a young student, the colored crayon part. Okay, and how could we tell a story about a little boy who goes through some things at home that most people don’t know about?’ We created the story. And for me, again, putting myself into the shoes of somebody else takes me out of my mess for a minute and gives me a fresh and new perspective. And I left that songwriting session, after we told this story, just feeling grateful.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Whirlwind

Irish indie-folksters on their debut: “We’re just three lads giving it a whack.”","standard":"Kingfishr say their approach to being a band can be summed up by the words in the chorus of their woozy, stirring ballad “Shot in the Dark”: “If it all falls apart/At least we enjoyed it.” “There’s something cathartic about that phrase,” vocalist and guitarist Eddie Keogh tells Apple Music. “The likelihood of a band taking off and becoming something that you can make a living off is so incredibly slim. For the moment, we seem to be able to keep ourselves afloat, which is obviously the dream.”\n\nThe sense of a group seizing their moment runs right through <i>Halcyon</i>, an album that elegantly sways from rousing indie-rock sing-alongs to expansive ballads to contemplative Celtic folk, and it all comes back to how the Irish trio came to be doing this in the first place. “The nucleus of the band formed around the fact that we studied engineering in the west of Ireland and that was our plan in life, and that was where we were headed,” Keogh continues. “Then over lockdown, we got cold feet about entering the real world and we were like, ‘Fuck it, we’ll try and write some music here,’ and it all started to happen almost accidentally.”\n\n<i>Halcyon</i> is a document of Kingfishr’s first few years—a period in which their fanbase has rapidly expanded and they have become the latest Irish stars on the cusp of a big breakthrough—its songs ranging from some of their earliest compositions to tracks written during its recording. “Ultimately, we’re just three lads giving it a whack,” states Keogh. “I don’t think music has to be anything more than that.” <i>Halcyon</i> is the sound of Kingfishr riding that wave, one that thrillingly recaptures the euphoria of their live shows. Keogh and bandmates Eoghan “McGoo” McGrath (banjo) and Eoin “Fitz” Fitzgibbon guide us through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“Man on the Moon”</b>\nEddie Keogh: “There was a period of time there where I was really fucking struggling with the whole people telling me what the craic was. You start off as a musician, as an artist, with this idea that it’s pure and who gives a fuck about the man or any of this stuff. ‘Man on the Moon’ was about losing myself somehow and the potential of what it could be—the big lights, the big stars in your eyes, that kind of thing. The idea of putting a bullet in the man on the moon is essentially killing the thing that made you want to make music in the first place and then having that moment of clarity and being like, ‘Fucking hell. What the fuck are we doing here, boys?’ and finding your way back to just the three of us, playing tunes for the love of it and having a good time, and bringing people on board that also just want to have fun.”\n\n<b>“21”</b>\nEK: “This is one of the tracks that was written during the recording of the album. We were staying in an Airbnb in Dublin, recording in a place called The Clinic. We’d just signed with an American label, Atlantic, and all the stuff was going on in LA with the fires, and I guess that story was floating around in our heads. We went home and Fitz came up with a riff.”\nEoin Fitzgibbon: “Without even thinking about it, it started falling out of us, in some sort of a flow state.”\nEK: “That’s always the most fun, when you’re flying through it and it’s all coming at you.”\n\n<b>“Gloria”</b>\nEK: “‘Gloria’ was about 12 months before the album recording. It was written during a pretty tumultuous time in the band. The industry has a reputation of being this kind of monster and it can be that if you’re not very sure of yourself and you don’t have a good frame around you and a good support group. We signed up to the label, people who wanted the best and still do want the best for us, but ultimately, the junction between commerce and art is very dangerous waters. ‘Gloria’ is about sacrificing pieces of yourself artistically for the sake of wanting to be a big artist and wanting to be successful. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing, to want to be a big band or whatever, but that’s what the song is about. It’s having to make those decisions and then deciding when enough is enough, and when you have to maintain artistic integrity.”\n\n<b>“I Cried, I Wept”</b>\nEK: “This is about the same thing. We’re in a very different space now, in terms of our currency in certain conversations. I think that both sides, from the label’s perspective, they’ve definitely proven a couple of points to us that I don’t think we were too happy about. But it’s like, ‘You were right on this point eventually.’ We both learned a lot about each other. Working relationships are like that. But ‘I Cried, I Wept’ is the same thing, giving pieces of yourself up to making certain decisions.”\n\n<b>“Next to Me”</b>\nEK: “‘Next to Me’ is about the girlfriend. I have a lovely girlfriend on the go, and it won me a lot of brownie points in the relationship, as you can imagine. It was funny. We were recording ‘Killeagh’ and we went away for a weekend, took a couple days off and came back into the recording session up in Dublin…”\nEF: “The three of us were in the live room and I went, ‘Anything happen over the weekend?’ and the both of them turned to me and were like, ‘We have girlfriends now.’”\nEK: “There was no big plan between myself and McGoo. Fitz has been going out with his girlfriend for a couple of years now but myself and McGoo both got girlfriends the same weekend.”\nEF: “They’re changed men.”\nEK: “Changed for the better.”\n\n<b>“Diamonds & Roses”</b>\nEK: “This is an ode to the death of celebrity. Gone are the days of the ivory towers. I think characters like Prince or Michael Jackson, these larger-than-life figures, I’m not sure they could exist today. Maybe The Weeknd is a little bit of an outlier there. But during the writing, we were talking about it and Lewis Capaldi really broke the ceiling for me on who could be a pop star at that level. It was such a refreshing take on that side of popular culture. He’s a lad who’s very classically Scottish and just wants to drink pints and get stuck in. I was thinking about that, and the song was essentially about what it means to try to garner some public attention in the digital age, and how everything is kind of on its head, and maybe that’s what art is all about.”\n\n<b>“Flowers-Fire”</b>\nEK: “This was the first song we released. It was written in a couple of parts when we were still in university and we were living together. It’s about a relationship I was in years ago that was pretty topsy-turvy. It was my first proper relationship, but it’s about maybe having regrets about how it ended. You know when you’re 17, 18 and you have no idea how to talk to girls, even if you’re in a relationship with one. You don’t understand them at all, and then you end up making absolute bags of it, and then you’re just stood around, being like, ‘Ah shite, I made a fucking tit of myself here.’”\n\n<b>“Caroline (rework)”</b>\nEK: “This has a bit of a reference to the Seamus Heaney poem <i>Mid-Term Break</i>. He comes home from school and his brother’s died and he talks about coming into the wake and seeing him. The second verse of ‘Caroline’ was directly inspired by that. We wrote it in the room but didn’t know what it was because it didn’t fit the metric of a lot of the other songs that we had. We played it for a friend of mine, kind of absentmindedly, and he was like, ‘What the fuck is that?’ From there, we were like, ‘Oh, maybe it might be a good idea to explore this side of things.’ ‘Caroline’ really gave us the width, creatively, to do ‘Shot in the Dark’ and then ‘Killeagh,’ as well, spawned from that. ‘Caroline’ is probably the crux of the album, as it pertains to us spreading our wings creatively.”\n\n<b>“Killeagh”</b>\nEF: “I played hurling in Killeagh for 20 years, it was my whole world until I started music and realized there was more to life. A friend of mine asked if we’d write a song for the hurling club because a lot of other clubs around Ireland have songs to sing when they win a final, but we didn’t have any. I begrudgingly agreed that if they got into the final, we’d throw something together, and they did. We threw this thing together in 15 to 20 minutes, recorded a quick video, sent it to a couple of people on WhatsApp, and then threw it up on TikTok. It spread around quite quickly on WhatsApp, but we didn’t think we’d ever release it. It was kind of half a joke. It wasn’t until Patrick’s Day this year that it really took legs. I guess people respond to the community element about it. It reminds people that they belong to some sort of community, or how important that could be. It’s really taken on a life of its own from where it came from, a drunken bet I made. It’s been number one in Ireland for weeks.”\n\n<b>“Ways to Change”</b>\nEoghan McGrath: “This came from a progression I was working on in the studio and, like a lot of our songs, you seize it and it takes off from there.”\nEK: “It’s funny, early on, I would refer to ‘Flowers-Fire’ as being a pop-punk song, and I know that sounds a bit fucking mad, but I feel like ‘Ways to Change’ is a similar thing. You could do the old Midwest emo voice to it and it would make sense.”\n\n<b>“Shadow”</b>\nEK: “I’d had some experiences at a Viking village with a group of my friends—which we won’t go into—and you know, there were some shadows. Carl Jung talked about shadow and integrating your personality and that part of becoming an adult or a fully formed, mature person, is dealing with the parts of yourself that you don’t want to believe exist. Nobody wants to think they’re a bad person, but we’re all pretty bad eggs deep down if we get the chance. Coming to terms with that and making sure that you know that you can be a terrible person, or keeping that in check, is important. ‘Shadow’ is a song about my personal experience with that.”\n\n<b>“Blue Skies”</b>\nEK: “This is about a girl I was friends with who took her own life in Spain a couple of years ago. It came out of the blue. I was quite close with her, but a lot of my friends would’ve been way closer, and it affected us all pretty deeply, because we had just left college, everyone was spreading their wings with all this excitement around it, and then this thing happened and it put a bump in the road. You think about the memories you had, that you associate with that person, and you look at them in a different light. We all thought everyone was having a good time, but obviously there were undercurrents there. ‘Blue Skies’ is a memory of that.”\n\n<b>“Shot in the Dark”</b>\nEK: “When we met the label, we were flown to England and we came back, we’re all exhausted, and we were talking about how essentially, we’d be back in jobs in six months. We were like, ‘Look, we’ll give it a whack. It’ll be great story for the grandkids.’ We were talking and I had a guitar in my hand, and we just started playing along and this song fell out of the conversation, essentially. Like, who really gives a shit? You’re only here for a very short time. You might as well try the things that you want to try. Even if they go wrong, at least you’ll know.”\n\n<b>“Eyes Don’t Lie”</b>\nEF: “This was the first thing we wrote. Back when myself and Eddie were living in the same house and McGoo was just down the road. I’d left my guitar on the bed with this really weird tuning. Then Eddie walked in and started doing something without really knowing that he was in a different tuning and it ended up being the picking pattern for the start of ‘Eyes Don’t Lie.’ From there, we wrote the thing. We thought it was crap, as we’d thought everything we’d written previously to that was crap. Then we started playing this one for a couple of friends and their first response was, ‘You didn’t write that, it’s definitely a cover.’ That was the first time we were like, ‘Oh, this is something.’ This song is quite an important one for us as a band.”\n\n<b>“Someday”</b>\nEK: “This is a little bit idealistic, like an ‘Imagine’ by John Lennon situation, to believe that someday we’ll all get on. The sentiment is a bit Utopian and it’s not meant as a literal thing. It’s just pretty hopeful in the sentiment because a lot of our songs are very fucking sad. It’s nice to have a bit of a silver lining somewhere!”\n\n<b>“Schooldays”</b>\nEK: “This is about how part of me believed I was going to peak in college because I ended up being a bit of a Van Wilder character who just drank and drank and drank, and dropped out of college and came back and they went, ‘Ooh, don’t you want to leave the college lifestyle someday?’ It’s a reflection on the boys that gave me a hard time in school. It’s also a reflection on me, maybe in college. I think it’s probably the most expansive idea, lyrically.”","tagline":"New Album and

cathartic exploration of the foray into adulthood.","standard":"When Conan Gray announced the arrival of his fourth studio album <i>Wishbone</i>, he shared in a statement that he wrote the album in secret. While touring his 2024 album <i>Found Heaven</i>, he would finish shows and sketch demos with zero stakes attached. He showed the songs to Dan Nigro, who helped Gray record his first album, <i>Kid Krow</i>, way back in 2020. The tracks, created with the sort of vulnerability only achievable when writing without an audience in mind, ended up becoming the bones of <i>Wishbone</i>, Gray’s cathartic exploration of his foray into adulthood. \n\nWith his signature blend of beautiful vocals and earworm melodies, Gray opens up his diary to sing about the way romance has changed his life—for better and for worse. The powerful “This Song” finds Gray admitting that it’s easier for him to sing about love for his unspecified partner than it is to utter the words face to face. “Romeo,” on the other hand, begins with a playful horn intro before slide guitar and a shuffling rhythmic groove betray the poison at the heart of his feelings: “You took away my will to live,” he admits. \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Wishbone","playParams":{"id":"1816089441","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wishbone/1816089441","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Q0kTJx8DrQd8RJW9L7eIN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816089441/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168567308","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168567308?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755846719160,"RTCI":0}}},"1816172823":{"id":"1816172823","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816172823?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mac DeMarco","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mac-demarco/501437762","artwork":{"bgColor":"feb613","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"0f1a17","textColor2":"141e17","textColor3":"3f3916","textColor4":"433c16","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/1d/52/101d52d0-ab69-03af-2c04-6952fc0906ce/00198704459184_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"99b0ca","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"05060c","textColor2":"202129","textColor3":"232832","textColor4":"383e49","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/7c/67/187c6729-dbe7-893e-bd4d-bfd72262114f/9d8e1aad-b969-4c30-935f-a8e308939312.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The chillest chiller in indie rock refines his deceptively simple art.","standard":"Like the so-called slackers of early-’90s alt-rock (Beck, Pavement, etc.), Mac DeMarco’s sleight of hand is to make beautiful music without apparently trying—a chiller so chill he doesn’t write songs so much as wait for them to come snuggle up in his lap. <i>Guitar</i> is his most quietly striking album since the landmark <i>Salad Days</i>, stripping the slimy synth textures and bubbling drum machines out of his early sound to reveal sparse, paper-thin soft rock whose eerie melodies and gently jazzy chord progressions have more in common with ’40s-era pop like The Ink Spots and The Platters than anything from the underground (“Sweeter,” “Nightmare”). “Miracle, reveal yourself to me,” he sings at the beginning of “Holy,” channeling the meditative stillness of a John Lennon demo or early-’70s Al Green.

The suite of 12 pieces, describing and reflecting on a characteristic of each month, was commissioned in 1875 by the magazine <i>Nouvellist</i>. Each piece was originally preceded by lines from a selection of Russian poets. Tchaikovsky responded to the idea with enthusiasm and not a little self-effacement: “I will try not to disgrace myself and hope to please you,” he wrote to the publisher.\n\nBeginning in January with roaring fire to keep the biting Russian winter at bay, Tchaikovsky moves on to the bustle of a February parade, the promise of spring, the long nights of summer, and autumn’s plentiful harvests. And, finally, the magic of a Christmas, all but guaranteed to be white. But these pieces are much more than simple portraits, says Lim. “They bring back forgotten feelings from deep within the heart,” he says, “memories that briefly return to the present, only to blur and fade again.” \n\nYunchan Lim’s recording of <i>The Seasons</i> combines majesty and poetry, plugging into the work’s essential innocence of character. Not an easy task, as the Korean pianist tells Apple Music Classical: “This work must never be played in a generic, student-like manner,” he advises. “To truly move someone’s heart demands endless hours of deep, heartfelt practice.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Solo Instrumental","Romantic Era","Piano"],"name":"Tchaikovsky: The

With themes of heartbreak, self-destruction, and redemption, <i>Own Worst Enemy</i>—as its title suggests—is a more personal outing than its predecessor, which is also reflected in the album’s more expansive production. The record opens with “Morning Bail,” a deceptively sweet song about waking up in the drunk tank after a rowdy night out. “Never Call Again” finds Adcock showing the gentler side of his often gruff voice, with drawn-out pedal steel flourishes adding a gauzy feel to the love song. The lone guest on <i>Own Worst Enemy</i> is Roswell, Georgia-raised Vincent Mason, who joins Adcock on “Almost Gone,” a down-and-out ballad about the one that got away.

Though 2013’s <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i> certainly wasn’t his debut, it nonetheless brought the Baton Rouge rapper into the spotlight, where he’s remained ever since. Some seven years passed between the third and fourth installments, a time period in which the very same style of melodic, personal street rap he helped pioneer proliferated via a new generation of hip-hop artists. Of course, he kept busy that whole time with a rigorous and steady run of releases in the 2020s, making the arrival of <i>Luca Brasi 4</i> both momentous and of the moment in ways some other vet’s sequels are not.\n\nFrequently imitated by others, Gates’ signature style from the “2 Phones” and “I Don’t Get Tired” era remains undisputedly his own on tracks like “Bread Straight” and “Hard for Pt 2.” All about his business, he makes his position known to those who want in the game on “Stir the Pot,” his mid-song flow flip a more-than-modest flex. His defensively caustic wit comes through on “Stutter,” and he softens up for the thuggishly romantic pair “I Love This Bitch” and “Satellites 2.” Yet he still bears scars befitting a pain-rap progenitor on “Factory Reset” and “Disappoint Me,” the latter with rising rapper Hurricane Wisdom in tow. Other guests include fellow Louisiana native YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who brings his trademark charms to “I Am,” and Atlanta upstart YKNIECE, who eagerly matches Gates’ potent profanity on “BBO (Simon Says).”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Luca Brasi 4","playParams":{"id":"1820405800","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-13","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/luca-brasi-4/1820405800","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MrBg0bmBOii342VanrH6v"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820405800/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"298383551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/298383551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755770069881,"RTCI":0}}},"1820542978":{"id":"1820542978","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820542978?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Royel Otis","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/royel-otis/1537647213","artwork":{"bgColor":"ac9b8b","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"0d0b04","textColor2":"0b1214","textColor3":"2d281f","textColor4":"2b2e2b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1b/bf/a2/1bbfa200-28fb-828e-479a-273f36d2eac4/25UMGIM58665.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"f6efe7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"282016","textColor2":"2b2c2b","textColor3":"51493f","textColor4":"545350","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/3d/de/8a3dde4c-3072-c367-4915-755f878ff984/829f4078-9777-40db-8b45-ba53beaf7b42.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"bcc2c2","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"070b08","textColor2":"262b2a","textColor3":"2b302d","textColor4":"444948","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/26/ec/b9/26ecb916-8a45-8b74-c5ff-d662a00d0765/27e403c9-3663-4b97-ae73-e9d59adf5ef7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"87827e","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"020303","textColor2":"060b0a","textColor3":"1c1c1b","textColor4":"202321","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/20/7d/f7/207df7c4-93c3-c06c-b231-80ce99a05b0f/93ba0091-29bb-4857-be10-c844e9117c47.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The duo’s second album was written without “walls or boundaries.”","standard":"A lot has changed for guitarist Royel Maddell and vocalist/guitarist Otis Pavlovic—collectively, Sydney duo Royel Otis—since their 2024 debut album, <i>PRATTS & PAIN</i>. On the back of that record and viral covers of Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s “Murder on the Dancefloor” and The Cranberries’ “Linger” they were propelled headfirst into a blur of overseas touring, high-profile festivals, and late-night TV appearances. That constant roadwork shaped album number two, <i>hickey</i>. “We were definitely more aware of how songs would come across when we played them live,” Maddell tells Apple Music. “We spent so much more time in front of crowds.” The experience, adds Pavlovic, contributed to the “simplicity” of the songs on <i>hickey</i>.\n\nSimple the songs may be, but sonically the album is a more diverse and textured effort than its predecessor, be it in the lush vocal harmonies of “come on home,” the joyous synths in “who’s your boyfriend,” the ’90s slacker vibe of “moody,” the ’80s-inspired pulse of “say something,” or the sumptuous, floating guitars that color “dancing with myself.” A by-product of what Pavlovic says was a desire to “not have any walls or boundaries with whatever we were trying to make,” the diversity also stems from the rich array of collaborators: Amy Allen (Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Styles); Jungle’s Lydia Kitto and Josh Lloyd-Watson; Omer Fedi (Lil Nas X, Sam Smith); Blake Slatkin (SZA, Justin Bieber); and Julian Bunetta (Teddy Swims, One Direction). \n\nThroughout, the duo’s dreamy musical optimism is contrasted by Pavlovic’s melancholy vocals, a neat vehicle for one of the album’s key themes, also inspired by the realities of life on the road. “There’s a few songs about saying goodbyes and missing people,” says Maddell. “I guess we were losing relationships.” Here, Maddell and Pavlovic walk Apple Music through <i>hickey</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“i hate this tune”</b>\nRoyel Maddell: “We wrote those lyrics for a different song, sitting in a pub drinking Guinness when we were recording <i>PRATTS & PAIN</i>. We made this instrumental track in Palm Springs with Blake and Omer and were trying to think of vocals, and then Otis started singing the lyrics we did in the UK.”\nOtis Pavlovic: “For some reason there’s a few songs, probably for both of us, that come on and remind us of a specific time or person. Can’t listen to it.”\nRM: “You love the song but you can’t not think of that time or person.”\n\n<b>“moody”</b>\nRM: “It’s kind of about a toxic relationship, not a girl in particular. The guy, the person singing, is the moody one as well ’cause they’re constantly saying something negative. We wrote that with Amy Allen.”\n\n<b>“good times”</b>\nOP: “That was the first song we did with Josh from Jungle. It just came out of an old demo we had. When you first meet someone and do a session, you’ve got to just break the ice and do something, and it’s the first idea we worked on. It is uplifting but then in the chorus it says, ‘In good times I doubt myself in front of you.’”\nRM: “It sounds fun but it’s negative.”\n\n<b>“torn jeans”</b>\nRM: “We did that with Chris Collins, and it was three guitar lines that I had and we just ended up weaving some vocals and stuff over it.”\nOP: “Just admiring someone’s torn jeans.”\nRM: “Just admiring the imperfections.”\n\n<b>“come on home”</b>\nRM: “It’s kind of about being far away from someone. Not really having control of where you are or where you could be. That was with Josh and Lydia from Jungle as well. Those harmonies are very Lydia-ish.”\n\n<b>“who’s your boyfriend”</b>\nRM: “The chords are really standard but we wanted to make them as least standard as possible, so added a capo to the guitar and tried to play them as weird as possible so it’s hard for people to figure out. Sonically, we were going for a mix between modern Cure and Joy Division. I don’t think we got anywhere close to either but that’s what we were going for.”\n\n<b>“car”</b>\nOP: “We did that one with Omer and Blake. We were talking about being with someone and trying to end [the relationship], but also not.”\nRM: “Not wanting the good parts to end.”\nOP: “[And] doing it in cars, which is something we’ve both experienced before, trying to break up in a car.”\nRM: “It’s weird wanting to break up with someone in a car because it’s claustrophobic and you’re in this small room. Why didn’t you just do it outdoors?”\n\n<b>“shut up”</b>\nOP: “We did this one with Blake Slatkin. It was the last song we did on the album. It came as a Hail Mary. That one is saying you don’t want someone to go away. Just shut up, don’t go away.”\nRM: “It’s also super dreamy, so it’s funny calling it ‘shut up.’”\n\n<b>“dancing with myself”</b>\nRM: “We went in wanting a disco Fleetwood Mac.”\nOP: “We wrote it in sections and you can kind of tell.”\nRM: “It’s [about] letting yourself be free and not worrying about what other people are thinking.”\n\n<b>“say something”</b>\nRM: “When we were planning on working with Blake and Omer, they asked what kind of song we want to make and as a joke, I said, ‘Take on Me’ by a-ha. That drumbeat is kind of a reference to ‘Take on Me.’”\n\n<b>“she’s got a gun”</b>\nOP: “We were doing it with Josh after working on ‘good times,’ just seeing what happens with it, throwing ideas down over the bassline. And I remember for the chorus we slowed the song down and sung stuff really slow to see what would happen, and the chorus melody came out of it. I don’t think we would have had that without doing that.”\n\n<b>“more to lose”</b>\nOP: “We’ve attempted to put melodies over that piano line since the start of the band.”\nRM: “Five years! We did it with Julian Bunetta and Omer. We were in Julian’s place in Calabasas, having fun making cocktails, and I just started playing it on the piano. Every time I sit at a piano I play it and just pray someone comes up with something. And that’s what happened.”\n\n<b>“jazz burger”</b>\nRM: “Jazz burger is a real thing. It’s from Jitlada in LA, this Thai restaurant, and you can get different levels of spiciness. We only went with four out of 10. It was so spicy my chest became mutated. I had this lump on my chest that was like a rhinoceros horn. And then we got ice cream and went back into the studio and made that.”\nOP: “Royel and I had just come from Sydney and said goodbye to some friends and some relationships.” \nRM: “It’s probably the realest song [on the album] with the fakest name; the most unrelated name.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"hickey","playParams":{"id":"1820542978","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hickey/1820542978","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7iX7uCkSNnkuIMwbjl8Jpf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820542978/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1537647213","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1537647213?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755858092166,"RTCI":0}}},"1821217649":{"id":"1821217649","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821217649?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Martin Todsharow","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/martin-todsharow/189670126","artwork":{"bgColor":"0c2126","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d0c1a6","textColor2":"d5b190","textColor3":"a8a18d","textColor4":"ac947b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ff/88/59/ff88591e-5eb8-a976-a157-107c1e2b4cd1/810123166848.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"name":"Fall for Me (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)","playParams":{"id":"1821217649","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":27,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fall-for-me-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film/1821217649","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6TCs5HSQkcW7GAj5CRcaad"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821217649/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"189670126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/189670126?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754299250410,"RTCI":0}}},"1821391661":{"id":"1821391661","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821391661?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"bgColor":"a20000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f1dad2","textColor3":"eccbcb","textColor4":"e2aea8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/74/5b/65/745b6535-0343-b491-ad4c-ed74651a2bc4/4251804173872_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Downtempo","Music","Electronic","Electronica"],"name":"Chill Pill Volume VII","playParams":{"id":"1821391661","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chill-pill-volume-vii/1821391661","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0tk5NIDZBLVUWpp9WDKAdJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821391661/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836770594,"RTCI":0}}},"1821548637":{"id":"1821548637","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821548637?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jon Batiste","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jon-batiste/211400086","artwork":{"bgColor":"515050","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f9f9f9","textColor2":"f4f4f4","textColor3":"d7d7d7","textColor4":"d3d3d3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/40/97/da/4097da6d-65e8-ea8e-e6d0-6ca112e720e1/25UMGIM84494.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"0b0b09","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e0e2e4","textColor2":"c9bfbb","textColor3":"b6b7b8","textColor4":"a39b97","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/84/74/59/8474593e-a37c-1542-f7c1-1242a62ab930/a7c97494-1c13-4ede-a8f5-6e9e3ad3b647.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"848484","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"020202","textColor2":"030303","textColor3":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"1d1d1d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0e/47/f5/0e47f512-c333-9cdc-383e-ae4eb8d7b7ee/68bb996a-3297-4396-8bca-c656d39b2faf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An artist in full control, making sure everyone around him has a good time.","standard":"Jon Batiste may be playing for big money on his 2025 album, but the soulful collection betrays an artist less stressed about cleaning up at the poker table than about making sure everyone sitting around him is having a good time. Take the opening duet “LEAN ON MY LOVE,” which features Batiste and Andra Day singing their hearts out above organ swells, a shuffling drum groove, and inviting handclaps. The track sounds like an Al Green lost cut as the vocalists croon: “You can lean on my love when there’s no one to hold you.” Elsewhere, the Louisiana songwriter invites Randy Newman to lend his vocals to “LONELY AVENUE,” which takes the Ray Charles classic and reimagines it as a bluesy piano ballad. Newman may be singing of love lost and endless heartbreak, but sadness has never sounded so sweet.

As profane and narcotized as he wants to be, Rio sounds reinvigorated on the raunchy “Ghetto Love Story” while hustler cuts like “Big Ben” and “Thug Talk” showcase his scheming side.

R&B star assembles Hollywood’s finest for a theatrical concept album.","standard":"Teyana Taylor’s fourth studio album commands an A-list cast of Hollywood talent (collectively owning an Oscar, seven Emmys, three Golden Globes, and a Tony) helping the multitalented singer-songwriter to bring the intimate, complicated world of <i>Escape Room</i> to life. A charged R&B drama unfolds between scene-setting interludes narrated by stars including Taraji P. Henson, Sarah Paulson, Kerry Washington, Regina King, and Issa Rae, as Taylor demolishes the fourth wall and opens the audience up to a front-row view of life in metamorphosis.\n\nThe narrative that plays out across <i>Escape Room</i> runs parallel to events in Taylor’s own life, finding herself and falling in love again following her separation and subsequent divorce from former Brooklyn Nets player, Iman Shumpert. Opening track “Fire Girl” deploys a distorted vocal sample and lilting, Spanish guitar which lights a blazing trail of raw emotion that stretches the entire expanse of the album. “Long Time” simmers with regret, the KAYTRANADA assist “Open Invite” burns up with pure desire, while “In Your Skin” melts devotion. Although a turbulent ride at times, the gentle acoustic ballad “Always,” which strums the record out—ending on a message to their mother, read aloud by Taylor’s children—makes for a smooth landing, bringing the curtain down on a happy ending.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Escape Room","playParams":{"id":"1822650564","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/escape-room/1822650564","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Aya7D6bm5P2iRrlnNsFQf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822650564/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"216698214","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/216698214?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755876866550,"RTCI":0}}},"1823280509":{"id":"1823280509","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823280509?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cassandra Jenkins","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cassandra-jenkins/628623818","artwork":{"bgColor":"06130f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e3e1dc","textColor2":"d8957b","textColor3":"b7b7b3","textColor4":"ae7b65","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ba/21/cb/ba21cb91-a6c2-a508-45d8-ee55d9783207/55761.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"081410","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e0ded8","textColor2":"d6947a","textColor3":"b5b5b0","textColor4":"ad7a64","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2d/19/05/2d190528-6058-ebf8-2ee7-119f81cb6ec0/Job35b6cd2e-4dcf-452a-a635-054f81c2a294-200094002-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391644378_2292079806-Time1755116640877.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1b1918","gradient":{"color":"1b1918","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"081009","textColor3":"241f1a","textColor4":"27241a","textGradient":["ffffff","081009"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bf/43/0e/bf430e82-5464-6493-ddb7-8f161c8fc542/Job12579ffb-aa1c-4640-85e7-c6f43834eb66-200094001-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391644379_2292079805-Time1755114905204.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"My Light, My Massage Parlor","playParams":{"id":"1823280509","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-14","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-light-my-massage-parlor/1823280509","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3FLsOaOV0kmfeN6k2m9Eli"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823280509/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"628623818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/628623818?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755800076914,"RTCI":0}}},"1824543088":{"id":"1824543088","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543088?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mariah the Scientist","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mariah-the-scientist/1475275447","artwork":{"bgColor":"e485aa","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070b0a","textColor2":"090a0a","textColor3":"33232a","textColor4":"35232a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2c/06/86/2c068675-4814-c770-8da6-aaf1cc3fbdd0/196873376462.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"db91ad","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"060908","textColor2":"070908","textColor3":"312429","textColor4":"312429","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d5/4d/32/d54d32af-6651-6e7a-8d19-17f1619a6793/aa570ee5-28e3-4d14-be23-4145af9301dd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"813e49","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fadac0","textColor2":"f8cdd4","textColor3":"e2bba8","textColor4":"e0b0b8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b8/34/f8/b834f86a-69fc-fd30-d28b-9172c32bc421/ae14df6f-e01a-4e09-bde9-736f40660244.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"a27285","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"120d0e","textColor2":"130d0f","textColor3":"2f2126","textColor4":"302127","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/14/48/b8/1448b8d8-798b-ced8-8170-f24168c211f0/ed224432-9088-4fa5-bce0-687ba26dcb7a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“I tried new vibes.” Album four harkens back to smoother, sexier times.","standard":"“This is a warning: Your time is up,” announced Mariah the Scientist in the trailer for her fourth album, <i>HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY</i>. “We will not be led by heartless womanizers. We are more than soldiers. We are heartbeats in a world of hollow men, defenders of a cause worth living and dying for. This is for the lovers.” Since her debut album, 2019’s <i>MASTER</i>, romantic drama has been the Georgia native’s muse, as she unpacks the complexities of disappointment and desire with an old soul and a light touch.\n\nDrawing from the classics of ’80s R&B, when slow jams by the likes of Sade and Babyface ruled the radio, <i>HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY</i> harkens back to a smoother, sexier time, though there’s a tinge of melancholy to singles like “Burning Blue” and the Kali Uchis duet “Is It a Crime.” The pair of singles represent the 27-year-old singer’s biggest hits to date. “I tried new things with my voice,” she tells Apple Music. “I tried new vibes. New perspectives.”\n\nAs for what’s changed personally since 2023’s <i>To Be Eaten Alive</i>—after four years of her highly publicized relationship with Young Thug, during most of which he was incarcerated, the rapper was released in October 2024. Mariah delves into the situation on “Sacrifice,” the wistful opening track. “When you love somebody, you make sacrifices,” she says. “There was a point in time when there was a lot of distance in my relationship, and I feel like I had to make that sacrifice.” Amidst the sea of love songs floats one self-reliance anthem: “All along, it was me, myself, and I,” the self-professed loner sings on “More.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY","playParams":{"id":"1824543088","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hearts-sold-separately/1824543088","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0gZVv6enPZhdDz7vrzwhZP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543088/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1475275447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1475275447?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755873846408,"RTCI":0}}},"1824543248":{"id":"1824543248","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543248?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joey Valence & Brae","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joey-valence-brae/1643989506","artwork":{"bgColor":"464746","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e2e1e2","textColor2":"ec87bc","textColor3":"c3c2c3","textColor4":"ca7aa4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0e/f0/e7/0ef0e779-f0cb-b783-d381-1133eb4736dc/196873327051.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"101d3b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dedbe1","textColor2":"c2c4d2","textColor3":"b5b5c0","textColor4":"9fa2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/52/eb/9d/52eb9d02-0d1b-73b1-da01-01a8ebb8d264/e73cb4c7-10ee-43fa-bca2-6c686c39a8b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"HYPERYOUTH","playParams":{"id":"1824543248","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hyperyouth/1824543248","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4QzLpl3oZx1P1BnhvkkAYW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1643989506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1643989506?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836584817,"RTCI":0}}},"1825240698":{"id":"1825240698","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825240698?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Yo-Yo Ma, Leonidas Kavakos & Emanuel Ax","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=275557-31304425-137760419","artwork":{"bgColor":"17190e","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"e4bf93","textColor2":"daa888","textColor3":"bb9e78","textColor4":"b38b70","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/50/85/4d/50854da3-c075-a502-a3ed-1b349bb0e6d8/196872891591.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"191a0f","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"dc9a6e","textColor2":"de955a","textColor3":"b5805b","textColor4":"b77c4b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0d/dd/51/0ddd51ed-fa10-71ff-84c1-373d73bef308/Job9f1c198f-b65f-4b84-9544-b6e74f940ed2-200533882-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392451943_2298696279-Time1755552522827.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"151109","gradient":{"color":"151109","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d5ac90","textColor3":"b39568","textColor4":"b18f76","textGradient":["ffffff","d5ac90"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cf/9a/c8/cf9ac816-45b5-dab1-853c-64bd0ca8ad9b/Job8eadf45d-164e-4e4d-80c1-9d6f531d7375-200533883-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392451944_2298696280-Time1755554002145.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d6bfa9","textColor2":"b0b8c6","textColor3":"ab9987","textColor4":"8d939e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dc/a5/71/dca57158-f3a7-5c4e-a54a-b361c23e63aa/a7363b90-ef2d-4892-a463-10bf7cfe87b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Symphonic and chamber Beethoven powered by boundless elegance.","standard":"This is the fourth release in the <i>Beethoven for Three</i> series, whereby luminaries Leonidas Kavakos, Yo-Yo Ma, and Emanuel Ax present Beethoven’s symphonies in chamber form. The idea has proved so much more than a quirky experiment. So often, Beethoven’s underlying textures are lost in the orchestral fog where detail can be sacrificed on the altar of effect. But here we get to enjoy it all: Beethoven’s Haydn-esque drama and wit, and his extraordinary development of motifs and themes. All three musicians play with superb control and impeccable ensemble.\n\nBut while Symphony No. 1 is this album’s headline work, there are some original works to enjoy too. Among them is one of Beethoven’s most famous chamber masterpieces, the “Ghost” Trio No. 5 in D Major, with its haunting, shimmering slow movement that lends the piece its name. The outer movements each possess a delightful energy that, like the symphony, have an effortless grace.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Chamber Music"],"name":"Beethoven for Three: Symphony No. 1 — Op. 70, No. 1 \"Ghost\" — Op. 11 \"Gassenhauer\"","playParams":{"id":"1825240698","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-for-three-symphony-no-1-op-70-no-1-ghost/1825240698"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825240698/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"275557","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/275557?l=en-US"},{"id":"31304425","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31304425?l=en-US"},{"id":"137760419","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137760419?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836341025,"RTCI":0}}},"1825252381":{"id":"1825252381","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825252381?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kid Cudi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kid-cudi/273058501","artwork":{"bgColor":"5a7c86","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"020202","textColor2":"090c0d","textColor3":"131a1c","textColor4":"192225","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/47/88/e3/4788e353-69d2-ad1b-3c64-cf5084028e1f/25UMGIM90824.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"2b4651","gradient":{"color":"2b4651","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"161615","textColor3":"141b1e","textColor4":"262c2d","textGradient":["ffffff","161615"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cd/ee/44/cdee44d7-9b92-d37d-5c71-f0958fd609e5/Job8fbff331-98e0-49ae-8a28-809235a193e1-196824048-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385417943_2241209271-Time1751937486628.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2b4651","gradient":{"color":"2b4651","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ddf3ea","textColor3":"cfd7d0","textColor4":"bdd4cf","textGradient":["ffffff","ddf3ea"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f4/6d/a2/f46da2b3-7418-543e-fb63-8078bece23ef/Job180024ea-e2f5-4916-91bf-46f877bfd253-196824047-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385417944_2241209270-Time1751936367868.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"060915","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"93c9d3","textColor2":"98bbc7","textColor3":"76a3ad","textColor4":"7b97a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/8d/b8/b68db835-2ef6-9d30-f88f-51cec903aedf/dea8805a-e1a7-40dd-a7b2-6b87e5e827fe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"7d8d91","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"111517","textColor3":"191c1d","textColor4":"272d30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/06/ce/68/06ce68ee-510d-a66d-3a7e-eb003352838f/6c6d7aaa-c738-4340-9433-0e1c33943cd2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A hip-hop lifer takes a big swing at pop: “I felt I needed to make a creative leap.”","standard":"When Kid Cudi spoke with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2022, Cudi was contemplating closing the door on music entirely. “The Kid Cudi stuff, I think I want to put it on the back burner and chill out with that,” he said. “I think I want to be done with it.” Fifteen years deep into his uncompromising career, he’d scored a handful of megahits, pioneered the melody-driven style that’s defined the past 15 years of hip-hop, and secured his spot among the blog era’s Mount Rushmore. Then he got bored.\n\nThree years later, Cudi’s reinspired and happier than ever, following up 2024’s pair of trap-inspired albums—<i>INSANO</i> and <i>INSANO (NITRO MEGA)</i>—with a record he bills as his first-ever pop album. “I just felt like I needed to drastically make a creative leap in my career,” he tells Lowe in 2025. “I mean, people know that I’m a risk-taker, and I felt like the last five years, I hadn’t really been pushing myself.” Approaching his 11th solo album, <i>Free</i>, he asked himself a question: “What does the world not have right now that I can provide?”\n\nThe answer, it turns out, was hope. The Cleveland native has never shied away from vulnerability, candidly sharing his struggles with depression over the years. On <i>Free</i>, the newlywed (he married Lola Abecassis Sartore in June 2025) testifies that it does, in fact, get better. Here he swings for the fences with pop-punk chords, massive hooks, and the occasional dubstep drop as he fights for happiness in the face of fear. “Turns out I had control of my own Truman Show,” he howls over the driving beat of “Truman Show.” And on the lighters-in-the-sky anthem “Neverland” (which he sang to his wife on their wedding day) he swoons: “My heart’s skipping/The scales tipping/It’s called living/And I could get used to it.” \n\nIntroduced to the world at the age of 24, the 41-year-old rapper never pictured himself making it this far. “When I was younger, I never imagined myself in my forties—I didn’t see past 30 for me,” he tells Lowe. “And it’s just a beautiful thing to have this album as a direct representation of the joy and peace that I feel.” He recalls being overcome with emotion when recording “Salt Water,” which he closes by addressing his audience directly: “Yes, my life has been one hell of a ride,” he says, ditching his signature melodies for spoken word. “There was a time where happiness was a very far-off and distant thing for me to acquire. But I made it out of that darkness. I saw the light.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Free","playParams":{"id":"1825252381","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/free/1825252381","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2GD42iPt0jtcudvlMksV1d"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825252381/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"273058501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/273058501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755845949157,"RTCI":0}}},"1825435148":{"id":"1825435148","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825435148?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Deftones","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deftones/1092903","artwork":{"bgColor":"ece9e4","hasP3":false,"height":1500,"textColor1":"030a05","textColor2":"22311c","textColor3":"313731","textColor4":"4a5644","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e3/04/cf/e304cf55-06c7-8b6c-34d3-95b2706c79a8/093624832232.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1500},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"bec0bf","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"090909","textColor2":"1b1b1b","textColor3":"2d2d2d","textColor4":"3b3c3c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/d0/02/95d002a2-b07f-27d5-12cb-103e3e243569/c51bb260-69df-42e7-8f7f-2b34d7067f9d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"838383","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"010101","textColor2":"050505","textColor3":"1b1b1b","textColor4":"1e1e1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/31/67/91/31679143-7fbf-1f48-337f-e86a49475fb4/8bba5961-4f08-4ec8-b770-c18330755928.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"5b9260","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"141413","textColor2":"131413","textColor3":"222d22","textColor4":"222d22","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5a/d3/25/5ad3252d-973e-4be3-5095-c0120db25a02/301bb5a3-bffd-441c-b583-1c866bcb5d87.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Sacramento band continues to cement their legend on album 10.","standard":"If the title of Deftones’ 10th album seems provocative, that’s because it’s supposed to. “I like the exclusivity of the name,” vocalist Chino Moreno tells Apple Music. “It feels restricted, maybe naughty. It has all these connotations. But it was the name of the folder on my desktop where I would put stuff while we were working on all the songs.”\n\nWritten and recorded over two and a half years in Nashville, Joshua Tree, and Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu, <i>private music</i> sees Moreno, guitarist Stephen Carpenter, drummer Abe Cunningham, and keyboardist/turntablist Frank Delgado reteaming with producer Nick Raskulinecz, who helmed their 2010 album <i>Diamond Eyes</i> and 2012 album <i>Koi No Yokan</i>.\n\nThe album’s first single and leadoff track, “my mind is a mountain,” came out of a studio jam. “It was one of those songs like ‘Change,’” Carpenter says, referencing the band’s signature tune from 2000’s <i>White Pony</i>. “We were just in the room messing around, and it started forming.” “I love the fact that it’s bombastic,” Moreno adds. “There’s a push and pull in that song that I really love. It’s heavy, but the one way that we collectively always describe our band is, no matter what style of music it is, we always like to feel that you can nod your head to it. This song has that head-nod thing.”\n\n“i think about you all the time” came out of a quiet moment Moreno had on the beach near Shangri-La. “I remember getting up in the morning, walking down the street, jumping in the ocean, coming back in my swim trunks and sitting there in my bare feet with the guitar and just start playing,” he says. “That night, I made a cup of coffee and said, ‘Nick, let’s record that thing I did this morning.’”\n\n“milk of the madonna” is a thunderous Deftones banger, with Moreno’s emotional tenor soaring over the band’s swirling, writhing tempest. “infinite source” was the first song written for the album: Carpenter came up with the original idea in Nashville before he, Moreno, and Cunningham completed it on tour. As Moreno points out, <i>private music</i> has staying power. “Nothing feels like it was a snapshot of that time and now we’re in a different place,” he says. “Two and a half years after their inception, the songs still feel very much immediate.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"name":"private

On a whim in 2024, Hobert started writing songs with her roommate and best friend Gracie Abrams—several of which would end up on Abrams’ 2024 sophomore album <i>The Story of Us</i>, including “That’s So True,” the album’s biggest hit. Hobert’s own breakout single, May 2025’s “Sue me,” went viral for its borderline unhinged lyrics about hooking up with an ex (“I’m sorry that your dog died/Sorry that I’m, like, your dream bride”).\n\nThree months later, her debut album, <i>Who’s the Clown?</i>, establishes the once-reluctant singer-songwriter as one of pop’s most hilarious and unconventional new voices, gleefully blurring the lines between cool and cringe with songs that play out like voice memos from your funniest friend. She’s drunk in the Uber on “Sex and the city,” bored at the A-list party on “Chateau” (“Shit, how’d I even get in? And I’d love to get out”), and roasting her endless mirror selfies on “Thirst Trap.” And though Hobert seems allergic to taking herself too seriously, profundity slips through the cracks on songs like “Phoebe,” where she makes peace with insecurity while binge-watching <i>Friends</i>.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Who's the Clown?","playParams":{"id":"1826574954","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whos-the-clown/1826574954","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6unMpOoIJqsLxuoTEFqdfP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826574954/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1812750994","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1812750994?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755852813874,"RTCI":0}}},"1827094081":{"id":"1827094081","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827094081?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Walker Hayes","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/walker-hayes/382876655","artwork":{"bgColor":"ac9279","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"110a04","textColor2":"24180d","textColor3":"30251b","textColor4":"3f3022","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/da/be/ad/dabead55-962d-87e7-6dcb-519d521b0897/196873371733.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Heavy, introspective moments balanced with calling-card party anthems.","standard":"The song that lends its title to this fifth studio album from Walker Hayes is a far cry from his biggest hit, the 2021 smash “Fancy Like.” Instead of living it up at Applebee’s, “17 Year Old Problems” finds Hayes navigating the pitfalls of middle age as he sings frankly about burying his late father and learning to care for his aging mother while lamenting the breezier days of his youth. It’s a heavy moment on an especially introspective project, though one Hayes is sure to balance with the kind of lighthearted, genre-blurring party anthems that first put him on the map. \n\nOpening track “Neon Lights” falls into that latter lighter category, with its poppy production and Hayes’ rap-sung delivery. Kane Brown joins Hayes on “Song for My Son,” another tender moment on which both singers consider their relationships to their fathers as they try to be parents themselves. Pop/R&B artist Nic D lends an assist on “Mayonnaise,” a slick come-on with banjo and a hip-hop beat, while Colbie Caillat duets with Hayes on “Adderall,” a deceptively sweet takedown of consumerism

noble continuation of the rapper’s Samurai lore.","standard":"On 2024’s <i>Samurai</i>, Lupe Fiasco gave his fans exactly what they wanted. Reuniting with longtime producer Soundtrakk (of “Kick, Push” and “Superstar” fame) for their second consecutive full-length collaboration, following <i>DRILL MUSIC IN ZION</i>, he kept his high-level rap songcraft at the fore on the acclaimed album. This EP-length companion expands upon that project somewhat, with some additional material including a few choice remixes featuring his Samurai Tour opening act, singer Troy Tyler. \n\nAt first, the reworked version of the title track seems a rather nuanced revisiting, yet its final minute and a half gives the groove a more pronounced R&B feel with Tyler’s take on the hook. A similar thing happens with “Bigfoot,” where their vocal interplay elevates an already surging chorus. As for the newer songs, “SOS” delivers the masterly lyricism that people expect from Lupe, his running commentary and intricate metaphors buoying the divinely jazzy, ATCQ-esque beat.\n","tagline":"New

discursive bars from one of rap’s most unique.","standard":"In the decade since 2015’s <i>I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside</i> dropped, Earl Sweatshirt transformed from Odd Future’s mumbly alumnus into one of the most unique hip-hop artists of his generation. The acerbic idiosyncrasies and deceptively lethargic flow that made the ruminative rapper so compelling early on in his run metamorphosed over time to place him in an even less categorizable stratum. More recent work, like 2022’s <i>SICK!</i> or the following year’s <i>VOIR DIRE</i> with The Alchemist, found him seemingly examining and embracing the possibilities of brevity, doing more by saying less and keeping his projects as concise as they are insular.\n\nIn line with that apparent methodology, <i>Live Laugh Love</i> contains songs that are often quite brief, filling the space provided by his curatorial left-field beat selections with pithy, incisive bars and comparatively looser vocal riffs. Some of these producers have been by his side for a while, namely Black Noi$e and Navy Blue who, respectively, contribute to roughly half the tracks. Apart from a sole instrumental from underground climber Child Actor—the murkily soulful <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i> nod “Heavy Metal aka ejecto seato!”—the remainder come from Theravada, a New York-based artist who Earl’s fans may recall from <i>SICK!</i>’s “Tabula Rasa.” The first four songs here benefit from his beats—from the squirmy filter funk of “gsw vs sac” through the percussive jolts of “Gamma (need the <3).”\n\nYet regardless of who happens to be behind the proverbial boards, <i>Live Laugh Love</i> is anchored by Earl’s unconventional appeal and discursive proclivities. “INFATUATION” mixes metaphors as if they were recipes, serving up tastily reconstructed wordplay seasoned with heady poetry. Among the longest songs here, “Live” cautiously raises one of the album’s oft-revisited trope dissections—dying on a hill—before spiraling downwards with a beat-flip to match the mood. The slightly redacted “CRISCO” offers up a fractured narrative flecked with graphic imagery, while “WELL DONE!” subversively flexes in different directions than most rappers could even attempt. On the closing “exhaust,” he comments on both work ethic and something far more personal, vacillating between civil splits and parting words of wisdom, albeit with the occasional Erykah Badu interruption.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Live Laugh Love","playParams":{"id":"1828396279","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-laugh-love/1828396279","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/45aldsXQsGrQxpst6z2hfR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828396279/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"445693504","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/445693504?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755857950314,"RTCI":0}}},"1828403729":{"id":"1828403729","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828403729?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Testament","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/testament/157139","artwork":{"bgColor":"66473b","hasP3":false,"height":1440,"textColor1":"f6c574","textColor2":"debe8d","textColor3":"d9ac68","textColor4":"c6a67d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dc/e9/4a/dce94a72-cb83-3957-0d0b-9bf2682c2fa4/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1440},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"121212","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d9d9d9","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"b1b1b1","textColor4":"a1a1a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/04/c9/8a04c92f-fbad-001f-f6c6-523fb91f4b9b/c49e88b9-ccf5-4706-9006-0429d6715f2f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Para Bellum","playParams":{"id":"1828403729","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/para-bellum/1828403729"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828403729/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"157139","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/157139?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836675597,"RTCI":0}}},"1828492285":{"id":"1828492285","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828492285?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ghostface Killah","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ghostface-killah/462455","artwork":{"bgColor":"2045a8","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fffffb","textColor2":"dce6ef","textColor3":"d2d9ea","textColor4":"b7c6e1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2b/63/25/2b632544-83d4-534a-caff-ff804e75f785/199538353167.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A sequel that lives up to the legacy of a beloved Wu-Tang Clan solo project.","standard":"Ghostface Killah captured lightning in a bottle with <i>Supreme Clientele</i>, his supernatural 2000 sophomore solo effort. The album is heralded as a classic, as both his best and as one of the greatest to come from the Wu-Tang Clan. Months after the album’s 25th anniversary, he released a sequel that satisfyingly lives up to the original, part of the seven-record Legend Has It campaign by Nas’ Mass Appeal Records.\n\nRecreating the feeling of the 2000s is one thing, but it’s another to actually have old records from decades ago that still hit—and several of the songs here, like “Windows” and the second single, “Metaphysics,” are gems that Ghost has kept in the vault for decades while awaiting the right occasion. Aside from literal relics, Ghost is still in touch with his strengths that made the original so great. “Iron Man” and “Georgy Porgy” are stuffed with his distinctive brand of frenetic, cinematic street storytelling, recollecting robberies with raps as agile as they’ve been in years. Other songs take their time: “4th Disciple” somberly stretches the final moments with a comrade after a deadly shootout, and “The Trial” creates a scene with Raekwon, Method Man, GZA, and Reek da Villian as characters in a courtroom. \n\n“Break Beat” and “Beat Box” faithfully emulate the aesthetic of the ’80s hip-hop that he grew up in. And Ghost still knows his way around a soul sample, sometimes letting them play all the way through to extract every ounce of emotion from them. On “The Zoom,” he raps alongside sampled vocals by Lionel Richie, painting a peaceful scene of reading <i>Roots</i> author Alex Haley at the pool, with a gorgeous woman by his side. “This shit touch my soul,” he says at the start of the song. “You know I got an old soul.” That might be the case, but his rhymes are ageless.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Supreme Clientele 2","playParams":{"id":"1828492285","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/supreme-clientele-2/1828492285","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SHlsKruygN9cOfAnaLxvM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828492285/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"462455","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/462455?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755857480457,"RTCI":0}}},"1828649659":{"id":"1828649659","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828649659?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gustavo Dudamel, Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela & Jorge Glem","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=173392443-265052582-320515949","artwork":{"bgColor":"c7c87f","hasP3":false,"height":1600,"textColor1":"18211a","textColor2":"1a301b","textColor3":"3b422e","textColor4":"3d4e2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/de/bb/59/debb5936-6d78-3fd8-822a-b798d2dd6dc2/5059449232379.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1600},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"302a19","textColor3":"404420","textColor4":"4e4a2d","textGradient":["ffffff","302a19"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/60/2f/77/602f7718-586e-09b0-67aa-bd961849633c/Job2213e14c-2655-455b-912e-083d9b055b07-200525801-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392436667_2298563810-Time1755547318976.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"161d14","textColor3":"32401c","textColor4":"3b3e21","textGradient":["ffffff","161d14"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e6/36/1b/e6361bca-5239-58db-6320-7509c26368d8/Jobfd7a6f50-745d-4d6e-8dcb-291dc9583532-200525800-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392436666_2298563809-Time1755546228292.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"151517","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e4cbbe","textColor2":"cfc7c4","textColor3":"baa69d","textColor4":"aaa3a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/a8/3b/b8a83b8c-6d68-5442-4a4e-0fad32b08342/afa071d1-2e31-43d1-8acd-f19cb380ace8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Dudamel on music that offers “bridges between our people and our cultures.”","standard":"This album showcases three colorful Latin American works, all composed for the Pan-American Initiative which Gustavo Dudamel instigated in 2021 as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dudamel describes the Initiative to Apple Music Classical as “a message of union, discovering the bridges and similarities between our people, our music, our landscapes, and our cultures”. With its release in 2025, the album also marks the 50th anniversary of El Sistema, Venezuela’s program of music education for children through which Dudamel himself developed as a musician, and which created the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra that Dudamel conducts in vibrant and atmospheric performances of all three works.\n\nFirst, and most substantial in terms of length and sheer variety of music, is <i>Odisea</i>, Gonzalo Grau’s concerto for Venezuelan Cuatro (a smaller-scale version of the standard guitar). This imagines a journey from Venezuela’s east coast, where the composer’s birthplace, Cumaná, is located, to Dudamel’s hometown of Barquisimeto in the country’s western-central region. In one continuous movement, the music carries the listener through colorful and well-contrasted episodes, some dance-like and enlivened by hand-struck percussion (particularly the golpe drum which appears at several key moments in the concerto), others beguiling and atmospheric. This eventually culminates in Grau’s evocation of the hubbub of an “encrucijadas,” one of Venezuela’s crossroads where the sounds and noises of street vendors and musicians collide, effectively heralding the striking (often literally!) cadenza in which the soloist, Jorge Glem, demonstrates the extraordinary versatility of his instrument.\n\nEven more “off the beaten track” is Ricardo Lorenz’s <i>Todo Torreno</i>, described by Dudamel as “a journey in Venezuela in a very old, rustic car.” As Dudamel explains, Lorenz’s “very virtuoso” music well-matches its subject: “you feel the wild but beautiful landscape of the journey, driving on roads that are not comfortable but which take you to magical, paradise-like places.” Tuned percussion and brass join in Lorenz’s string-led scoring to suggest both the jolts of the rough terrain and the exhilarating dance rhythms of the region.\n\nFinally, we have <i>Danzón No. 9</i> by the Mexican composer Arturo Márquez, who reaches beyond his own country to refer to an old Cuban salón dance. The work is a wash of orchestral color and Latin American rhythm, a thunderous opening fanfare giving way to an oasis of calm that shows Márquez’s mastery of subtle atmosphere. The opening drama soon returns, before a seductive, sweeping theme that forms the piece’s heart, with street rhythms and sounds growing in intensity around it.\n\nDudamel says his relationship with Márquez “goes to my childhood” when he was a violinist: “I remember being in the National Children Orchestra of Venezuela, and in one of these workshops we received this music of Mexican composer called <i>Danzón No. 2</i>. I was in love. We all fell in love. We were seduced by the beauty of the music of Arturo Márquez.\n\n“Márquez and I have a beautiful friendship also because of his commitment to music education, to social transformation through music,” continues Dudamel; “I think this Danzón is a celebration of that.” Which surely is the spirit of this entire album, together with its life-affirming joy in the color and passion of the Latin American heritage which Dudamel shares both with these composers and now passes to us.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral"],"name":"Odyssey","playParams":{"id":"1828649659","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":3,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/odyssey/1828649659","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Ej0pNYQItE3NI5WZtzf15"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828649659/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"173392443","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/173392443?l=en-US"},{"id":"265052582","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/265052582?l=en-US"},{"id":"320515949","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/320515949?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755867461828,"RTCI":0}}},"1828695925":{"id":"1828695925","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828695925?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"John Glacier","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/john-glacier/1357334840","artwork":{"bgColor":"6b4c87","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"edd0c7","textColor2":"cccdf5","textColor3":"d3b5ba","textColor4":"b8b3df","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bd/3d/54/bd3d544b-d18d-da04-5650-5960a41514ca/889030044877.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"One of UK rap’s most inventive talents expands her debut with five tracks.","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Like A Ribbon (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1828695925","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-14","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/like-a-ribbon-deluxe/1828695925","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ifCu57pDvXzOE4AkAR3Dp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828695925/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1357334840","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1357334840?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755840076305,"RTCI":0}}},"1828715997":{"id":"1828715997","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828715997?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"SSSLIP","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ssslip/1670124832","artwork":{"bgColor":"d9fef7","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"111414","textColor2":"111414","textColor3":"394341","textColor4":"394341","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2b/a4/66/2ba466c7-1cb4-b73c-a772-3bb81d27ab65/5063817003225_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Bass","Music","Electronic"],"name":"SSSLIP04 -

2022 pairing <i>FACE</i> and <i>MOB</i>. Firmly in his independent bag, he maintains the high quality of those standout projects on <i>Codeine Cowboy</i>, a narcotized trip that accentuates the themes found in his existing body of work while going deeper on other routes. Early on, fans will gravitate to streetwise cuts like “American Psycho” and “Kick the Cup Campaign.”\n\nOver time, however, a clear desire to explore R&B vibes crops up, particularly notable on “Nobody’s Perfect” and the JMSN collab “Don't Misuse Me.” Though his guests here represent an assortment of locales, those with close ties to Michigan (such as Lil Yachty on “Wavy Crete” and Veeze on “Half Sleep”) provide some of the most memorable features. Detroiters G.T. and Samuel Shabazz show up with their A-games for the faded “I Know” and the breezier “Sin Aire,” respectively, with the latter returning for thought-provoking closer “1 On 1 Talk With God.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Codeine Cowboy","playParams":{"id":"1830114202","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/codeine-cowboy/1830114202","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2qKLRkLcQeq5Pa79KJgsf8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830114202/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"689177365","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/689177365?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755846792896,"RTCI":0}}},"1830367392":{"id":"1830367392","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830367392?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Smashing Pumpkins","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-smashing-pumpkins/1646302","artwork":{"bgColor":"885a23","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f9f6f4","textColor2":"f3eee9","textColor3":"e2d7ca","textColor4":"ddd0c1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/22/b5/2b/22b52b54-ef4f-c21b-c5d7-58ab9dd68394/25UMGIM78104.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Machina / The Machines Of God (25th Anniversary Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1830367392","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2000-02-29","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/machina-the-machines-of-god-25th-anniversary-edition/1830367392","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3q1oMROgi4TdSS9jsK6zzA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830367392/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1646302","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1646302?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755872024006,"RTCI":0}}},"1830591137":{"id":"1830591137","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830591137?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Offset","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/offset/3973268","artwork":{"bgColor":"161d21","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"eff3da","textColor3":"c6c8c8","textColor4":"c4c8b5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e5/ee/45/e5ee4547-df2b-6754-9532-fdddaa12e8e6/25UMGIM92350.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"a3a68a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"171512","textColor2":"1a1510","textColor3":"33322a","textColor4":"363228","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a5/ae/3d/a5ae3d3d-bc4e-a52c-1cbf-f724577f707d/b8544c9e-5434-4256-bda3-79e6a6b30535.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"313536","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f1f3dd","textColor2":"e9f0de","textColor3":"cacdbb","textColor4":"c4cbbd","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/79/41/c9/7941c992-e846-326f-d33c-52da5bbf7b4d/a5f74c18-ed11-4a67-9fe2-2af5bbfffd36.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The rapper on his second post-Migos solo album: “Adversity made me focus.”","standard":"The past few years have been trying for the former member of Migos, which officially disbanded in 2023 after the tragic death of Takeoff in 2022. But hardship has shaped Offset’s path from the beginning, going back to his incarceration during Migos’ big break in 2013. “With me personally, adversity made me focus,” the 33-year-old rapper tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “I’ve learned to just brush it off.”\n\nHis debut solo album, <i>FATHER OF 4</i>, arrived in 2019, but 2023’s <i>SET IT OFF</i> marked Offset’s first venture with Migos in the rearview. On his third solo album, the rapper born Kiari Cephus sets aside his alias to dig a little deeper. “I named my album <i>KIARI</i> because it’s like me looking at myself in the mirror—my real life, how far I’ve come and what I’ve done, the good and the bad, the mistakes,” he tells Ebro. After seven years of marriage, Offset’s ex-wife, Cardi B, filed for divorce in August 2024. Through the drama, he sought solace in the booth. “I just wanted to focus on the music,” he tells Ebro. “And as soon as I did it, I seen the results.”\n\nThe 18 tracks of <i>KIARI</i> show Offset at his most soul-searching, without sacrificing the technical precision he’s been known for since his scene-stealing turn on 2016’s “Bad and Boujee.” Moody samples add to the gravity, from the flip of Nina Simone’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” on “Pills” to “Bodies” with JID, which throws a curveball by interpolating Drowning Pool’s “Bodies.” (“I like the element of surprise on the records,” Offset told Ebro of the collaboration.)\n\nOn “Move On,” Offset officially closes the book on his relationship with Cardi: “I’m trying to move on in peace,” he sings on the hook. As for a future reconciliation with Quavo for a Takeoff tribute album, Offset tells Ebro, “It’s possible. We just building us first.” Still, he scatters tributes to Takeoff throughout <i>KIARI</i>, recollecting the trio’s early days on “Prada Myself” and recruiting John Legend for the poignant hook of “Never Let Go”: “I lost my brother, but I gained an angel.”\n","tagline":"New

Dallas MC’s third album leans into duets with A-list country stars.","standard":"You could say that BigXthaPlug has always been country, from his deep Dallas drawl to the cowboy hat he rocked in the video for one of his earliest hits, 2022’s “Texas.” But his first official foray into country as a genre was in April 2025 with “All the Way,” a duet with rising country star Bailey Zimmerman featuring trap drums and steel guitar. With his hypnotic voice and over-the-top charisma, BigX has spent the past few years establishing himself as a bona fide star. But “All the Way” was the biggest hit to date for both BigX and Zimmerman.\n\nThroughout the 2020s, the lines between country and rap have blurred: Morgan Wallen and Lil Durk scored a hit with their 2021 collab “Broadway Girls,” onetime rappers like Jelly Roll and Post Malone have been embraced by Nashville, and the biggest song of 2024 was Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a twangy rework of an old ringtone rap hit. With his third album, <i>I Hope You’re Happy</i>, BigX straddles that line with a foot firmly planted in each terrain. Besides a pair of interludes, each track features a duet with a country star, mostly centered around country music’s favorite topic: heartache.\n\nSpeaking to Thomas Rhett on Apple Music Radio, BigX explained his methodology for choosing the album’s nine features: “The way I went about it, I looked for anybody who I felt like had some type of soul in them.” Hence the assist from Jelly Roll on the bittersweet “Box Me Up,” or the bluesy hook from Darius Rucker on the title track. Alabama’s Ella Langley is gorgeously petty on “Hell at Night,” an ode to taking the low road. (“It’s just one of those situations where you could tell two people was going through some of the same things, just in their own separate ways,” said BigX of the collaboration.) But on the Thomas Rhett duet “Long Nights,” BigX takes a moment to appreciate how far he’s come: “I thank God like every day, ’cause, shit, he helped me find my purpose/I was hurting/I went from hearing shots to hearing fans behind those curtains/So I know that it’s working.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Country"],"name":"I Hope You're Happy","playParams":{"id":"1831400122","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-hope-youre-happy/1831400122","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4llPc4sijqW69zcet6TAEC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831400122/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1482508209","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1482508209?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755875061528,"RTCI":0}}},"1831680666":{"id":"1831680666","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831680666?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Um Jennifer?","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/um-jennifer/1688153538","artwork":{"bgColor":"eeead5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"222221","textColor2":"5d1612","textColor3":"4b4a45","textColor4":"7a4139","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/22/40/8a/22408aa9-22f3-7d94-43a8-59bac4a66707/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Um Comma Jennifer Question Mark (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1831680666","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/um-comma-jennifer-question-mark-deluxe/1831680666","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/74VE3HjW9PgNHsKRxGwIF1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831680666/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1688153538","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1688153538?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755840295674,"RTCI":0}}},"1831856693":{"id":"1831856693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831856693?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Coco Jones","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coco-jones/401400095","artwork":{"bgColor":"e6edf7","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"312a28","textColor2":"322f2f","textColor3":"555151","textColor4":"565557","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/15/50/f5/1550f501-73b7-9b26-d73f-10463f4c35ac/25UM1IM06369.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4f8bd4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0f","textColor2":"110d0f","textColor3":"182536","textColor4":"1d2736","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/75/d9/70/75d97049-74f7-4a97-d585-fd3506147195/9109315c-313a-4747-a004-d9ff74289371.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"To be specific: Why not eight more tracks on the rising R&B star’s debut?","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Why Not More?

Watching prolific producers like Pharrell Williams, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Rick Rubin build beats from scratch, he went from fan to student, poring over album credits and eventually teaching himself to make beats by reverse-engineering J Dilla tracks. By the early 2010s, the Haitian Canadian producer had fused his love of hip-hop with a growing fascination for house music, emerging from the underground with viral edits of Janet Jackson and Teedra Moses songs, all driven by his signature drum swing. Following in the footsteps of his early heroes, KAYTRANADA became a master collaborator: His first three studio albums featured voices from PinkPantheress and Tinashe to Kali Uchis and even Williams himself. \n\nOn <i>AIN’T NO DAMN WAY!</i>, KAYTRANADA lets his production do all the talking. Stripped back to hypnotic loops, slick rhythms, and far-flung samples, the album is for total dance immersion—the kind that makes time slip away in the club. The chunky retro beat of “SPACE INVADER,” paired with a refrain from Latrelle’s Neptunes-produced “My Life” (“Gotta get away sometimes”), sets an escapist tone. Stutters and glitches ripple through tracks like “CHAMPIONSHIP,” “TARGET JOINT,” and “GOODBYE BITCH!” as if you’re catching him mid-DJ set. His blending of styles and eras transforms the ’80s Afro-boogie of Steve Monite’s “Things Fall Apart” into contemplative poolside house, while rapper Cappadonna’s 1998 song “Black Boy” becomes a resilient disco jaunt. Even the soulfully reassuring croons of “DON’T WORRY BABE / I GOT U BABE” serve as a Trojan horse for a slow-burning banger. The party carries on until the TLC-sampling closer “DO IT (AGAIN!),” both a playful last call and an invitation to run it back all over again. \n","tagline":"New

project, <i>I Just Got a Lot on My Shoulders</i>. He followed that up in the beginning of 2025 with a compilation, <i>More Leaks</i>, a gift to fans while his legal problems resolved themselves. The tape was a bridge to <i>MASA</i>, his highly anticipated 2025 studio effort that arrived at the end of July. YoungBoy quickly got back to his old tricks of flooding the marketplace, though, as just two weeks later he returned with <i>DESHAWN</i>, hosted by none other than DJ Khaled.\n\nThe mixtape is a victory lap of sorts, a way for YoungBoy to get back in the rhythm of cooking up new music like everyone else cooks up meals. While <i>MASA</i> found YoungBoy reflecting on his legal battles and struggles to forgive himself for previous sins, he’s optimistic though rightfully guarded on its follow-up. Opener “AI Marley” features wise words from the project’s host, with Khaled declaring, “More money, more solutions,” while on “La Vida Loca” his excitement is nearly palpable when he raps, “Check the timing on my watch, I think my moment be right now.”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"DESHAWN","playParams":{"id":"1832629322","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deshawn/1832629322","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1kBZ0CgBB3hqPCENxpKTNl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832629322/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168822104","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168822104?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755846819072,"RTCI":0}}},"1832783290":{"id":"1832783290","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832783290?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chance the Rapper","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chance-the-rapper/563355119","artwork":{"bgColor":"04172f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c9e0f1","textColor2":"35eb8e","textColor3":"a1b8ca","textColor4":"2bc07b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/43/85/df/4385df77-7e17-809f-9280-a0eb016418f5/5063778733858_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"625e35","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7f6f4","textColor2":"efeeea","textColor3":"d9d8ce","textColor4":"d3d1c6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/19/08/58/1908581e-a382-bcfb-c732-f879a3342136/9c2f796a-873c-440d-ba51-b0396e8bb443.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chance faces reality with trademark wit, poignance, and wordplay.","standard":"Since his debut mixtape, 2012’s <i>10 Day</i>, launched 18-year-old Chancelor Bennett to indie stardom, fans have watched the Chicago native grow up in real time—from stoner on high school suspension to precocious hometown hero to God-fearing family man. “I lived an adulthood at a really young age,” Chance, now 32, tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I was touring and traveling and supporting multiple family members, businesses, friends, everything. I’m damn near a child star, you know what I’m saying?” Marking the journey were three studio mixtapes now deemed classics and an official debut album, 2019’s <i>The Big Day</i>, on which Lil Chano from 79th stepped with purpose into the roles of husband, father, and adult.\n\nThe Chance who opens his sophomore album by declaring, “Surprise! It’s the boy who lived,” is not the same man from six years prior; since then, there was the acrimonious split from his longtime manager in 2020, then the 2024 announcement that he and his wife were separating after five years of marriage. On <i>STAR LINE</i> (named after Marcus Garvey’s Black Star Line, an oceanic shipping line in the Back-to-Africa movement), he faces reality head-on, addressing not just his own struggles but those of the world with his trademark wit, poignance, and double-take-worthy wordplay. “Politically, internationally, the world is going through it,” he tells Lowe. “And we’re really getting to see the elasticity and the bandwidth of moral fiber. Everything is getting stretched to its limits.”\n\nThough Chance draws inspiration from recent travels to Ghana and Jamaica, <i>STAR LINE</i> is grounded in his hometown of Chicago, from whose culture he draws lines to Black culture across the diaspora. Here, the juke drums on “Speed of Light” co-mingle with the Rastafarian roots of “Tree,” the futurist dancehall of “Burn Ya Block,” and the Afrobeats rhythms of “Space & Time.” He shares the spotlight with Chicagoans past and present—from ’90s heroes Do or Die to up-and-comers like BabyChiefDoIt—and slips in slick interpolations of local anthems both beloved and esoteric. (Real heads will catch the reference to BBU’s “Chi Don’t Dance” on the Jamila Woods duet “No More Old Men.”) And on the soulful “Back to the Go,” Chance shakes off a series of stumbles, packs his bags, and heads back home: “Been around the board/Now I’m back to the Go.”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"STAR

Levine on their eighth album: “It’s been the full-circle journey.”","standard":"Four years after their last full-length, Maroon 5 returns with their eighth studio album, showcasing what makes the group a mainstay in the pop-rock world. “I think it’s been the full-circle journey so far, as far as the ways in which we made music and how we did it and where it took us, the waves that we rode, and now coming back to feeling like it’s time to get back to the basics of what made it work in the first place,” singer Adam Levine tells Apple Music.\n\nOn <i>Love Is Like</i>, Levine took a different approach than usual during his writing process. “I was so reluctant to get help, kind of like I used to be, but then I had these new phone-a-friend-type resources that I had never had before, so I was like, ‘Let’s call someone and get a little help,’” he says. “There was one line of one song that I hit a fuckin’ brick wall, and I was like, ‘J Kash, can you help me write this line?’” (The hip-hop producer co-wrote seven of the album’s ten tracks.)        \n\nBuoyed by three singles (the upbeat and jazzy “All Night,” the suave LISA collab “Priceless,” and the subdued “California”), <i>Love Is Like</i> boasts two more high-profile collaborations as Lil Wayne and Sexyy Red add verses to the title track and “I Like It,” respectively. The band’s typical laidback danceability is present and accounted for, with a few retro vibes thrown in, like on “Burn Burn Burn.”\n\nOf course, here, Levine and co. do attempt to define what love is actually like. From “It’s been a little crazy here/We been a little anxious, you know” (“Hideway”) to “I know this behavior is beneath us both/But I think the fucked-up thing is how it brought us closer now” (“Jealousy Problems”), it’s messy, all-consuming, and confusing—a departure from the black-and-white sensibilities dotting the rest of their catalog. “It’s funny because the music that we wound up making feels really fresh and cool,” Levine says. “For better or worse, we’re proud of the thing we wound up having released because it’s just different.”\n","tagline":"New
