But the story behind her third album, <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i>, released two months later, suggests otherwise.\n\n“I didn’t think I was going to make another record so quickly, and when all these ideas started landing, I knew I needed to do this before I could do anything else,” CMAT tells Apple Music of the follow-up to 2023’s <i>Crazymad, for Me</i>. “It was a very hard album to make for a number of reasons, and it’s a very heavy subject matter. What we were trying to pull off was so difficult that I had a really hard time making it. But that being said, I’m really proud of it,” she says.\n\nIt’s a big album. While “Take a Sexy Picture of Me” provided the perfect—and well-deserved—pop crossover, complete with viral TikTok dance, CMAT was keen to stay true to her roots and go “full country” on songs like “When a Good Man Cries.” CMAT recorded the album in New York, addressing themes of grief, loss, and “the ambition to be bigger and more important than you currently are,” both in terms of herself and her native Ireland. “In general, I have to work on things on the road when they’re in their infancy,” she says. “But place-wise, I think this album was born of grief and loss and sadness and stuff, and things being put into perspective for me in a way that they hadn’t been before. All of this suffering I endured making it, and now I’m bearing the fruits.” Read on as CMAT talks through <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i>, one track at a time.\n\n<b>“Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy”</b>\n“I definitely needed something to open up the record that wasn’t my voice. A lot of this album is criticizing Ireland, which is something I love more than anything else in the world. So, I wanted something that captured my love for it and to show people I wasn’t coming from a snotty place. One day, I randomly came across a documentary, and this scene happened. Billy Byrne is about to free a lot of pigeons, and this is a phone call that he makes from a telephone box that’s in the middle of a beach. He sums up everything that I love about Ireland: its weirdness, its beauty, and its warmth.”\n\n<b>“EURO-COUNTRY</b>\n“‘EURO-COUNTRY’ is a bit of a Frankenstein song—I wrote bits of this years ago for a completely different thing. I knew the album was going to be called <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i> and then I thought, ‘I’d love a title track for this record.’ Usually, it’s the other way around. The line ‘I feel like Kerry Katona’ came because I have a real fascination with beautiful blondes who are destroyed by the press. I’ve written about Princess Diana and Anna Nicole Smith in the past, and I think Kerry is another one of those women that was rinsed by the British press, completely fucking unfairly. I really do admire her, and I think she’s very strong.”\n\n<b>“When a Good Man Cries”</b>\n“I’m really glad the way those two songs run into each other. That’s one of the most successful bits of the album. I needed to go full country immediately, so everyone knew what the record was. This is me going in on myself because I made an ex-partner cry. He hadn’t done anything wrong. There’s this thing in third-wave feminism, which is, I feel, now outdated, where women should be like men. Making a man cry is turning a trope on its head. I repeat ‘Kyrie Eleison’ [‘Lord have mercy’] over and over again at the end, which is a reference to my favorite song of all time, ‘The Donor’ by Judee Sill, in which she’s begging God for another chance to become a good person.”\n\n<b>“The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station”</b>\n“‘The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station’ is a meditation on irrational hatred and intolerance. It’s based around me getting annoyed every time I saw a poster of Jamie Oliver because when we were on tour, we’d eat a lot of sausage rolls from his branded delis. I don’t actually have any beef with Jamie Oliver, so I’m kind of like, ‘Ciara, you need to stop being a bitch. He’s got kids.’ And then there's a stream-of-consciousness section in the bridge where I’m going through my own history to try and figure out how I became such a bitch. I think it’s good to be self-critical—I don’t think anyone should ever rest on their laurels when it comes to kindness and their capacity for it. We should all be trying way harder.”\n\n<b>“Tree Six Foive”</b>\n“This song has been around for two years, and it used to be called ‘365,’ but there’s a little artist called Charli xcx who released a song with the same name, which is enormous. So, I was like, ‘I can't call it that, so I’ll just call it what it is in my phonetic spelling.’ It’s about looking back on my history again and thinking about a time where I made the decision to try and not to be treated badly anymore. I wanted it to be a proper flashback of a song. Even though I don’t have these feelings anymore, it’s a former version of myself that’s doing bad foreshadowing. A stupid song written by a stupid person to illustrate the person that I used to be, I guess.”\n\n<b> “Take a Sexy Picture of Me”</b>\n“If I’m making an album that is so much about capitalism, the cruelty of the modern condition, and how lack of community has made everyone be an asshole, I had to do one song where I was like, ‘I have also been a victim of this.’ The thing that had been rattling around in my head the most was last year, when we were doing festivals, and there were all the comments being nasty to me over my physical appearance and my weight. I remember saying, ‘Let’s make this the most accessible-sounding, biggest, fattest pop song so that loads of people are forced to listen to the most uncomfortable lyrics I’ve ever written.’ Under no circumstances did I think it was going to go anywhere near as big as it did, with Julia Fox doing a little TikTok dance to it, but I knew it would pop off in some way.”\n\n<b>“Ready”</b>\n“A lot of people in my life really loved this song, but I didn’t know how I felt about putting it on a record because it felt too optimistic and poppy. And I still don’t really know how I feel about the song, but I really like the place that it occupies in the record. It’s about somebody who is giving up after a period of complete stagnation. I wrote it in a COVID-y time. I’m saying I’m so bored of having depression that I’m going to do something self-destructive but fun because I don’t care anymore.”\n\n<b>“Iceberg”</b>\n“This is a song about my best friend Bella. It’s funny, we’ve been best friends since we were 14, and I’m a pop star and she’s a lawyer. She’s the most studious, hardworking person in the world. When she got her job which she’d worked towards her whole entire life, I saw the pressures of this ambition and this full-time work completely beat her down for a while. And she started to go in on herself. I found it really funny that she thought that I wouldn’t know she was suffering. This is the thing in female friendships that I think is so beautiful—you cannot pull the wool over my eyes. I know who you are. There’s a joking line in the beginning of it where I’m like, ‘Where did you go, crazy girl boss?’”\n\n<b>“Coronation St.”</b>\n“I wrote bits of this when I was 23. Leaving something to sit and marinate in one form for seven years is something I like doing, so it’s like I’m in collaboration with a former version of myself. It’s about jealousy, being stagnant, and feeling like I didn’t get everything I thought I was owed by life. I wanted to capture that deadness and feeling of having nothing happening in your life and really double down with hindsight just how harrowing it was. I used to do a weird job managing and cleaning apartments in Manchester, and one of them overlooked the set of <i>Coronation Street</i>. I found it mad that it was fake buildings. I was like, ‘Wow, even Coronation Street’s not real.’”\n\n<b>“Lord, Let That Tesla Crash”</b>\n“Weirdly, this is the least profound song on the record. It’s about loss. My friend died, and I had to write the story of us in it because it was the first time I lost someone I was really close with. You make friends with people without thinking much about it, just enjoying their company. And then, when they’re gone, you realize what the point of them was. I only realized how much he meant to me when he died, and so much about his death annoyed me. I felt quite stupid being a touring musician/pop-star person because I was like, ‘What's the point in this?’ And then, I went to see the flat we both lived in together, and there was a charger and a Tesla parked outside it, and I remember being so angry about that.”\n\n<b>“Running/Planning”</b>\n“I wasn’t going to bring this song to the studio, but we made a draft of it in one night, which sounds almost exactly the same as it does now. It was so instinctive and so immediate. This is another song about ambition, drive, and the downsides of it. I was thinking about how there’s a treadmill of life that you get on when you’re in a heterosexual relationship. You date for a couple of years and then you get engaged, get married, and then you have a baby and live the rest of life. There’s a transactional element to romantic relationships that muddies something that’s otherwise quite beautiful. And also, societal pressures to conform. With conformity comes the weird prejudices against people who don’t [conform]. Carving your own path and going against it makes your life so hard.”\n\n<b> “Janis Joplining”</b>\n“‘Janis Joplining’ is a name I’ve given to being self-destructive. What’s weird is that’s not what the song’s about. I just thought it was a good line. Maybe it’s a bit salacious, but I had a crush on a guy who was married, and I realized a lot of it was born of seeing him and his wife interact with each other. Actually, what I was longing for was the community they had formed and their intimacy. It ends the record because after everything I’ve just spoken about, what I want is this egalitarian relationship and to comfortably talk intimately with everyone in the world, and if I can’t have it, then I self-destruct and go Janis Joplining. I wanted to end on a note that sounds like I think I have a solution to all the problems I’ve just spoken about for 45 minutes.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"name":"EURO-COUNTRY","playParams":{"id":"1802736479","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/euro-country/1802736479","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6p8GFQi9D44s9ODeml47ag"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802736479/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1506697965","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1506697965?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756446317948,"RTCI":0}}},"1803439076":{"id":"1803439076","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803439076?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Andrew Montana","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/andrew-montana/1314750133","artwork":{"bgColor":"c9938e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"040507","textColor2":"040506","textColor3":"2b2122","textColor4":"2b2121","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ac/80/7c/ac807c70-0f81-fa63-b2cb-88fc6e235bdb/193436421034_HereByTheWillows.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Here by the Willows","playParams":{"id":"1803439076","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/here-by-the-willows/1803439076","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2mgintYmq9K5v5Rzs3Q8fP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803439076/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1314750133","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1314750133?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756467057143,"RTCI":0}}},"1804332601":{"id":"1804332601","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804332601?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Blackbriar","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blackbriar/1226343661","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"cdc7c5","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"a49f9e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4e/82/87/4e82879d-d2b4-3442-56d0-e8c01859105f/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"A Thousand Little Deaths","playParams":{"id":"1804332601","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-thousand-little-deaths/1804332601","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3elW9joazZ1HAu5EfbatIN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804332601/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1226343661","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1226343661?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755836383158,"RTCI":0}}},"1807286924":{"id":"1807286924","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807286924?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Nourished by Time","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nourished-by-time/1484747428","artwork":{"bgColor":"79000b","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"fffffd","textColor2":"fea096","textColor3":"e4cbcc","textColor4":"e3807a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/27/54/3b2754c7-1b32-2fde-d7e3-cf34a4932259/191404155172.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"7d828c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"08090c","textColor2":"0f1216","textColor3":"1f2126","textColor4":"25292d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/43/e2/f9/43e2f991-e28c-dc04-0eb4-3c19e9583c05/d715f567-9408-483d-9f54-db80e688213e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Marcus Brown simplifies his sound without sacrificing eccentricity and nuance.","standard":"After years spent grinding on the DIY circuit under aliases like Mother Marcus and Riley on Fire, the Baltimore musician (born Marcus Brown) took on the Nourished by Time moniker in 2019. He broke through with 2023’s <i>Erotic Probiotic 2</i>, his first album as Nourished by Time—a swirl of lo-fi synth-pop, post-punk, funk, and R&B that made capitalist critique sound cool. On his second full-length (released on XL Recordings, as was his 2024 <i>Catching Chickens</i> EP), Brown simplifies his sound without sacrificing its freewheeling eccentricities and lyrical nuance. Here, songs about love reveal themselves as songs about surviving and finding meaning in an alienated, oppressive modern world. “Know he’s got a purpose/But he’s always working/Tryna beat the system/Manifest a vision,” he sings on “9 2 5,” which transmutes day-job drudgery into piano-house euphoria. Here and there, shimmers of beauty and absurdity shine through the cracks, like a story of a half-baked psychic reading on “Idiot in the Park.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"The Passionate Ones","playParams":{"id":"1807286924","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-passionate-ones/1807286924","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Y3SsoA0yibZh5946vXgKS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807286924/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1484747428","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1484747428?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460907408,"RTCI":0}}},"1808081778":{"id":"1808081778","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808081778?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Beaches","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-beaches/1150145182","artwork":{"bgColor":"daaa8e","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"03040a","textColor2":"271c1a","textColor3":"2e2525","textColor4":"4a3931","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e9/fd/5f/e9fd5f59-1ce1-c002-7411-961ffc932267/199350181986.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"e6d8ca","gradient":{"color":"e6d8ca","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"271c1a","textColor3":"2d2524","textColor4":"4b3931","textGradient":["000000","271c1a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b8/4f/4a/b84f4a50-734e-aeb9-470e-80b2be252189/Job93a765df-4e52-4339-9859-4ec37df9beef-200475280-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392328277_2297774917-Time1755506191688.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"e6d8ca","gradient":{"color":"e6d8ca","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"342623","textColor3":"2d2829","textColor4":"55413a","textGradient":["000000","342623"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a4/fe/a0/a4fea06c-f8a5-c755-254c-3dc9b6d8aed8/Job70dca52b-4222-47a3-bd8d-f2eca69c3f6a-200475279-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392328278_2297774918-Time1755504840372.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"102b53","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c6d1e4","textColor2":"b6bccf","textColor3":"a1b0c7","textColor4":"959fb6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ac/6c/40/ac6c4009-aabb-eec0-54a8-f934824b8d4c/325f1fd4-6d9a-4ed9-a566-4f36450b7368.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"10101c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e2d3d1","textColor2":"cccccf","textColor3":"b8acad","textColor4":"a7a7ab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d9/e3/8a/d9e38a0e-7494-2512-1f4a-2745bca0bf1a/0d3a3e02-4abf-490f-8ac7-2ad34742fdb6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The viral Toronto glam rockers embrace goth romanticism.","standard":"“Heartbreak, gold mine,” Jordan Miller sings at the start of “Touch Myself,” a paean to irrepressible desire that appears partway through The Beaches’ third full-length album. And with those three words, she provides a perfectly succinct snapshot of The Beaches’ trajectory since 2023, when the viral post-breakup anthem “Blame Brett” thrust the Toronto band into the Top 40 pop charts on both sides of the border. With <i>No Hard Feelings</i>, The Beaches continue to navigate the emotional minefield of young-adult love with their sense of humor and candor intact. \n\nBut if their early releases saw them rocking out with ’70s glam swagger, <i>No Hard Feelings</i> casts their fine-tuned pop sensibilities in an ’80s goth romanticism, with the shimmering guitars and yearning hooks of tracks like “Touch Myself” and “I Wore You Better” hitting the heretofore untapped sweet spot between Robert Smith and Taylor Swift. And where The Beaches’ breakout single was about trying to move on from a relationship, <i>No Hard Feelings</i>’ emotional centerpiece—the synthy soft-rock stunner “Lesbian of the Year”—is a bittersweet account of leaving your past behind completely, with Miller giving voice to keyboardist/guitarist Leandra Earl’s experience of coming out. \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"No Hard Feelings","playParams":{"id":"1808081778","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-hard-feelings/1808081778","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5eQYimKiQfEGaUGtnOlRUZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808081778/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1150145182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1150145182?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460909845,"RTCI":0}}},"1809104243":{"id":"1809104243","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809104243?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Vicious Rumors","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vicious-rumors/267998482","artwork":{"bgColor":"1d0a01","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c7ca94","textColor2":"cdca73","textColor3":"a5a477","textColor4":"a9a35c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/9b/2a/a09b2a5c-8c83-8966-f465-8ff0926170a9/4001617098097.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"The Devil's Asylum","playParams":{"id":"1809104243","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-devils-asylum/1809104243","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4U7NMaExSJO02zodYFgkAf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809104243/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"267998482","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/267998482?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756441529455,"RTCI":0}}},"1810514672":{"id":"1810514672","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810514672?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Laufey","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laufey/1504424880","artwork":{"bgColor":"5f7f96","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"040404","textColor2":"121313","textColor3":"161d21","textColor4":"21292d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/84/cb/c7/84cbc7b4-0b88-038a-87c8-3fa6f5df09cd/199350437694.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"0f0505","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e4ccaf","textColor2":"cbb9a6","textColor3":"baa48d","textColor4":"a59586","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cb/02/35/cb0235d3-74c6-76d4-65be-8794519695bf/e7c1ad85-adee-487a-b219-07f8a6499d17.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e9eae5","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0f0802","textColor2":"1a1205","textColor3":"3a352f","textColor4":"443d32","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e6/76/06/e67606ea-0a35-1521-31c0-885535ba832c/cebefa01-98df-48fd-a863-563e58e5cb31.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"404b5f","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"eee7db","textColor2":"ecd3ae","textColor3":"cbc8c2","textColor4":"cab89e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8c/19/dc/8c19dc3c-ee67-934b-42a5-f77065aeba17/9cd8249c-ecf1-4cb4-8519-4c80251636b6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“I wanted to be careful about staying true to myself,” says the pop classicist.","standard":"“Ultimately—and I only discovered this after the whole album was written—this album is about opening yourself up to a lover, or a person, or the entire world, giving them every single part of yourself,” Laufey tells Apple Music about her third album, <i>A Matter of Time</i>. “It’s about acknowledging that it’s just a matter of time until you find out every single part of me.” She began working on the project while touring behind her breakthrough album <i>Bewitched</i> in 2024, inspired by a host of factors—particularly balancing her hectic schedule as an in-demand pop star with falling in love for the first time. \n\nLaufey worked on <i>A Matter of Time</i> with her longtime collaborator Spencer Stewart and new creative partner Aaron Dessner (of The National and Big Red Machine, and a regular collaborator of Taylor Swift’s). “It was that new experience that I was craving for an album,” she says. “I wanted to be so careful for this album about staying true to myself, and staying true to my roots, and staying true to my philosophy, which is ultimately keeping jazz music and classical music alive through my own music.

It was a welcome reminder that, for all his success as a heartland raconteur and blue-jeaned balladeer, Adams is a hard-rocker at his core. That raucous spirit resounds loud and clear on the title track of <i>Roll With the Punches</i>, which recaptures the arena-conquering glory of Adams’ mid-’80s classics with its crunchy guitar riff, booming mid-tempo stomp, and anthemic call-and-response refrain.\n\nAdams’ 16th album is a totem to his timeless storytelling and ageless energy, with his famous rasp finding its natural habitat in the jangle-pop jaunt “Make Up Your Mind,” the organ-powered soul strut “A Little More Understanding,” and the raunchy roadhouse blues of “How’s That Workin’ For Ya?” But Adams’ romantic side comes shining through on the ready-made wedding slow dance “Two Arms to Hold You” and the achingly nostalgic finale “Will We Ever Be Friends Again.”","tagline":"New

was more”: The band on their self-assured fourth album.","standard":"Following the widescreen dream pop of 2021’s <i>Blue Weekend</i>, Wolf Alice felt some sonic skin shedding was in order for their fourth album. “We were thinking about what we were doing in a much more calculated way,” bassist Theo Ellis tells Apple Music’s Matt Wilkinson. “I don’t know whether it’s age or whether it’s having done this for the fourth time, but less was more with this record.”\n\nRecorded in LA with Adele/Paul McCartney producer Greg Kurstin, <i>The Clearing</i> finds the North London four-piece stripping back the alt-rock fuzz and shoegazey FX that had characterized their earlier releases for a more classic sound. One with a warm analog glow and rich FM radio-friendly melodies that positions them closer to ’70s soft rock than the 2010s indie scene from which they broke out.\n\nListen closely, and there are nods to that golden era bubbling up throughout <i>The Clearing</i>: drummer Joel Amey’s “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”-cribbing shuffle on “Leaning Against the Wall,” the ELO/Beach Boys chug that drives “Bread Butter Tea Sugar,” and guitarist Joff Oddie switching between breezy strumming, intricate fingerpicking, and searing melodic lines like <i>Rumours</i>-era Lindsey Buckingham.\n\nSuch echoes reflect the band’s listening habits: a stack of records on heavy rotation in the studio that included Fleetwood Mac, George Harrison, and folk-rock outliers Pentangle.\n\n“This time, we weren’t afraid to give references. Maybe in the past I felt that I didn’t want to give them because then it would sound like that,” singer Ellie Rowsell says of the band’s touchstones when making <i>The Clearing</i>. “But now I felt much braver to say, <i>this</i> is my reference. I knew that it was going to sound like us because I understood what we were a bit more.”\n\nThe wide-open space afforded by <i>The Clearing</i>’s musical palette allows Wolf Alice’s finest set of songs to date to shine. Whether it’s “Just Two Girls’” sparkling, disco-flecked pop, Rowsell’s hushed reflections on aging and motherhood on “Play It Out” or “White Horses”—a remarkable interpolation of folk and krautrock that startles without having to turn everything up into the red.\n\n“Maybe there are people who are scared of rock music that is soft. ‘Soft rock’ has felt like something I should never say out loud up until now,” reflects Rowsell. “I don’t care. I’m interested in music that you can play live that is energetic and performative without having to be all distortion pedals and shouting and fast and loud.

expanded edition with five new tracks to mark a whirlwind 2025.","standard":"Lainey Wilson couldn’t have chosen a more fitting title for her fifth studio album. The wildly beloved country singer-songwriter’s rise to fame has surely been a whirlwind, catapulting the small-town Louisiana native from relative obscurity to stardom in just a few short years. That success was not earned overnight, though, as Wilson had put in nearly a decade of work before breaking out with <i>Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’</i> in 2021. “I felt like my life was changing at 190 miles an hour and I was just trying to keep one foot on the ground,” Wilson tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But I think those 10 years of nothing happening for me prepared me for my life changing super fast.”\n\n<i>Whirlwind</i> is Wilson at the height of her powers, mixing pop, rock, and soul into her already inimitable brand of traditionally informed country. Highlights include the title track, a light and groovy celebration of reckless love, and “Devil Don’t Go There,” a heartbreak ballad that lets Wilson lean into the emotive side of her versatile voice. The Miranda Lambert duet “Good Horses” connects two generations of country spitfires, with dusky production to emphasize the singers’ undeniable vocal chemistry. Wilson’s band sounds better than ever, too, which she attributes to years spent touring relentlessly and working toward a shared dream. “They are ride or die,” she says. “I mean, these guys are the ones that ate dirt with me. And I think it’s really important to keep the people close that you ate dirt with. They know you, they know how bad you want it. They want it just as bad. They love you for you. They sacrifice so much to be out there on the road with you.” Below, Wilson gives insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Whirlwind”</b>\n“I finally found a guy that gives me a run for my money. And he’s my biggest cheerleader. He’s just a good person. And he knows how important chasing down a dream is, because even when he was a little boy, football was his life. He did it and he tried out for the Steelers and made the team. And so he achieved what he set out to do. And so he knows. We met at a time where he was still playing with them, but then it all changed. So it was weird. It was like his life was changing as my life was changing and we were going different directions. So, yeah, life for us is a whirlwind.”\n\n<b>“Middle of It”</b>\n“We had actually just got nominated for Entertainer of the Year for the CMAs. And I had not been at my house in Nashville, and I didn’t have furniture in my house for months. We don’t need a couch, we’re not here. So my friends The Heart Wranglers came over and they just said, ‘Let’s do a heart check.’ And they’re like, ‘What’s going on? Where are you at? How you feel? Where’s your head?’ I sat on the floor and I just said, ‘I feel like I’m just smack-dab in the middle of it. It’s a blur to me where it started, where it’s going to end up. I just can’t hardly tell.’ And then we just started talking about how that’s really what all this is about anyway. That’s the beauty of it.”\n\n<b>“Whiskey Colored Crayon”</b>\n“That song actually came from a word exercise that my co-writer [Josh Kear] did. I’ll probably get this wrong, but every morning before he writes songs, he writes a list of things. And say the first list that he wrote was ‘things that I hate’ and maybe it’s lettuce or greens or whiskey or whatever. And then he writes a list of random things, things that you can use to create. He mix-mashed these words and he was like, ‘Well, I’ve got this whiskey-colored crayon,’ and we got to thinking about the storyline of this. And we came up with, ‘Okay, let’s think about a young student, the colored crayon part. Okay, and how could we tell a story about a little boy who goes through some things at home that most people don’t know about?’ We created the story. And for me, again, putting myself into the shoes of somebody else takes me out of my mess for a minute and gives me a fresh and new perspective. And I left that songwriting session, after we told this story, just feeling grateful.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Whirlwind (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1813912755","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whirlwind-deluxe/1813912755","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4jzl02ZBUX359L5VlqLNCQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813912755/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"907166363","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/907166363?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756461012568,"RTCI":0}}},"1814455404":{"id":"1814455404","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814455404?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"This I Owe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/this-i-owe/1792045951","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ece3ce","textColor2":"cedff1","textColor3":"bdb6a5","textColor4":"a5b3c0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bf/a8/ed/bfa8ed7a-a2e0-ecdc-05d5-88faa6cd6fb7/199350593659.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Alchemists","playParams":{"id":"1814455404","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alchemists/1814455404","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1zXEIMSXq8watWZ5YYQNmr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814455404/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1792045951","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1792045951?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1749195255181,"RTCI":0}}},"1814683632":{"id":"1814683632","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814683632?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Margo Price","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/margo-price/383027971","artwork":{"bgColor":"dbdbdb","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070707","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"414141","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/61/da/6f/61da6f5e-ccc0-df05-ab86-5943fd9c8690/25CRGIM49665.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"e7e7e8","gradient":{"color":"e7e7e8","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"282829","textColor3":"424242","textColor4":"4f4f50","textGradient":["000000","282829"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/1c/26/25/1c26255f-3fbb-ea0f-e934-42976c1bbd1d/Jobc17a3916-50a8-4694-8ee8-96328aea512a-198706257-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388954553_2270172507-Time1753752344047.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"e7e7e8","gradient":{"color":"e7e7e8","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"282828","textColor3":"424242","textColor4":"4e4e4e","textGradient":["000000","282828"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/08/3c/ff/083cff8d-0ef8-f79b-d302-a79456d74fe9/Job85d6608a-0fde-4e8d-a841-3c047b6c4e2e-198706256-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388954552_2270172508-Time1753750370642.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"878789","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"030303","textColor2":"060504","textColor3":"1d1d1d","textColor4":"201f1f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c4/3c/43/c43c43e5-adac-93b6-cff8-5b0f7a65f9f1/a753c7ce-3c02-4409-baf0-1eb6dc33a87d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The left-of-center country firebrand has never pulled a punch.","standard":"Country firebrand Margo Price has never pulled a punch, a quality that likely inspired the title of this fifth studio album and follow-up to the two-part <i>Strays</i>. Known for her fiery lyrics and even more electric live performances, Price, now nearly a decade out from her groundbreaking debut album <i>Midwest Farmer’s Daughter</i>, is a pillar of left-of-center country, paving the way for like-minded artists like Sierra Ferrell and Tyler Childers, the latter of whom appears on this album.\n\nThough she’s a longtime Nashville resident, <i>Hard Headed Woman</i> marks the first time Price has recorded a project in Music City, setting up shop with Grammy-winning producer Matt Ross-Spang (Old Crow Medicine Show, Jason Isbell) at famed Music Row outpost RCA Studio A. Sonically, the record doesn’t deviate far from Price’s previous output, though there’s a confident ease in these performances that is more palpable here than on older projects.\n\nIt opens with a prelude, harmony vocals setting the stage for lead single “Don’t Let the Bastards Get You Down,” a keep-your-head-up anthem Price co-wrote with Rodney Crowell, the late Kris Kristofferson, and her husband/frequent collaborator Jeremy Ivey. Singer-songwriter Jesse Welles joins Price on “Don’t Wake Me Up,” an off-kilter rocker that eschews the chaos of the modern world in favor of dreamy idealism. The Childers collaboration “Love Me Like You Used to Do” is another high point, bringing the pair of beloved artists together for a last-call ballad about keeping the spark alive. \n","tagline":"New

country hitmaker leans into humor and humility.","standard":"Russell Dickerson has never shied away from playful humor, so it’s fitting that the country hitmaker would poke a little fun at himself with the title of his fourth studio album. Accordingly, <i>Famous Back Home</i> is a fun and energetic listen, once again setting Dickerson apart from the current trend of down-and-out heartbreakers popularized by artists like Zach Bryan and Morgan Wallen. That said, Dickerson does open the album on a more serious note, lending his smooth croon to a wistful narrative about lost romance on “Dust.” “Happen to Me” is driving and melodic, with a sweet nod to the Cyndi Lauper classic “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” at its chorus. The title track, which closes out the LP, is an emotional high point, as Dickerson celebrates the home life he’s built with his family over the trappings of fame and commercial success. The album also includes the first two outside cuts he has recorded: the heartfelt anthem “Sippin’ on Top of the World” and the tender, reflective Vince Gill collaboration “Never Leave.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Famous Back

overnight success story writes his second chapter: “I’ve lived a little more.”","standard":"The speed and suddenness of Zach Top’s rise to stardom isn’t lost on him. The country sensation’s debut album, 2024’s <i>Cold Beer & Country Music</i>, earned Top an ever-growing legion of fans, who love the Washington-born singer-songwriter’s traditionally informed, ’90s-tinged sound and his undeniable chops as a singer and player. On this sophomore outing, Top loosens up his approach, dipping into the sunny sounds of Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney while celebrating living the life he’d dreamed of as an aspiring singer-songwriter. “With this record, it’s like I’ve lived a little more, and so I have a little more to say,” Top tells Apple Music. “There’s just a little more depth to it, I think. It goes a couple layers deeper than the first record, which I love and I’m very proud of it. But I think there’s more meat on the bone with <i>Ain’t In It for My Health</i>.”\n\nLead single “Good Times & Tan Lines” splits the difference between Buffett’s beachiness and Alan Jackson’s no-frills twang, with blessedly traditional production from Top’s longtime collaborator Carson Chamberlain that puts fiddle and steel front and center. Other highlights include the tequila-soaked heartbreaker “Flip--Flop,” which shows off Top’s playful sense of humor, and closing track “Honky Tonk Till It Hurts,” a love letter to country music with shades of ZZ Top (no relation). Below, Top shares insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Between the Ditches”</b>\n“My parents have been very supportive, but definitely aren’t shy about telling me I’m being an idiot if I’m being an idiot. So, there’s that. I’m close with all my siblings, and very thankful to have good relationships with all of my family. Then I’ve got some good old friends that knew me before, who haven’t changed their attitude toward me because of any sort of success and whatnot.”\n\n<b>“Flip--Flop”</b>\n“With anything that’s kind of like a goofy song, it is a fine line where it starts to get way off into cornball/cheese world. So [I like] having a song that actually says a little something still but can have that humor. I’m very sarcastic, try to be funny, cutting up, joking all the time.”\n\n<b>“South of Sanity”</b>\n“I played a couple shows with Red Clay Strays. We’d already done our show and they were going on after us, and I was supposed to go up and do a song with them. I got a call with some bad news and I was sitting over on the side of the stage or standing in the wings, one song left, and then I was going out, and I’m trying not to bawl my eyes out. Then it’s like, ‘Put your phone back in your pocket, take a drag on a cigarette, and let’s go sing.’ Where it started, I had a marriage that didn’t work out. When I first moved here I was married, and yeah, I messed that up. So that’s part of that song too.”\n\n<b>“Lovin’ the Wrong Things”</b>\n“When you’re dreaming about [making] it, you’re just thinking about the bright lights and the thousands of people that are out there. And that’s such a small fraction of the actual work. Your schedule can get out of hand, you can get run into the ground and worn out and then start looking for a way to cope with it, I guess. A lot of times there’s a lot of options that aren’t necessarily terribly healthy. Free drinks all night up on the stage until you realize it don’t help you sing and play. I think that’s a perfect representation of, I assume, what I feel like a lot of young artists do. They catch a little success, then all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Holy cow, we’re lit. There’s no rules. It’s wide open. Just go hog wild. Go crazy.’ Then that can damage the thing that got you that little bit of success in the first place, which is rather short-sighted.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Traditional Country","Music","Country"],"name":"Ain't In It For My Health","playParams":{"id":"1819596977","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aint-in-it-for-my-health/1819596977","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5q893GwwooRNMeDHmPXYi7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819596977/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1350125124","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1350125124?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460977080,"RTCI":0}}},"1819861154":{"id":"1819861154","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819861154?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sabrina Carpenter","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sabrina-carpenter/390647681","artwork":{"bgColor":"e0dbe2","hasP3":false,"height":3700,"textColor1":"180d0c","textColor2":"2d2528","textColor3":"403637","textColor4":"51494d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cc/bc/ef/ccbcefb5-cf3a-1c55-0173-c37602827c7a/25UMGIM81699.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3700},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"e2dde6","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"110605","textColor2":"170d0c","textColor3":"3b3132","textColor4":"403638","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a8/53/84/a8538406-a7d3-64bf-1a64-426bce9dfd98/Joba4b2d1b7-9556-4e57-a024-c5c960f1ac9f-201335645-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393990595_2311286094-Time1756324108868.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2c1818","gradient":{"color":"2c1818","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f1e9ef","textColor3":"cec0be","textColor4":"cbbfc4","textGradient":["ffffff","f1e9ef"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/5c/88/8f/5c888f42-6cf1-878f-0084-8a6cf40f0cd0/Job12e61ab8-28ed-46a9-8f0b-3540fc33ca8b-201335644-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393990594_2311286093-Time1756320052125.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"030204","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dde5f9","textColor2":"c6cfe3","textColor3":"b2b7c8","textColor4":"9fa6b6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7a/38/07/7a380769-9579-a39a-810f-2f9d0294aa47/60b1c7c1-168d-4695-a27b-95696adea888.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c5cfda","textColor2":"cbc8b5","textColor3":"a1a9b2","textColor4":"a6a394","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/96/c1/8b96c179-54a4-0152-b385-97a2654ff243/45ffdb0e-eb22-444e-ade7-ffd67fa6ff06.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Sharp-witted, disco-tinged pop that oozes self-deprecating charisma.","standard":"The former Disney Channel child star spent the decade after her debut single, 2014’s “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying,” patiently finding her voice. Her persistence finally paid off in 2024, when the absurdly catchy singles “Espresso” and “Please, Please, Please” launched Sabrina Carpenter into a whole new realm of pop stardom. Her sixth album, August 2024’s <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>, reintroduced the pint-sized singer as a sharp-witted diva with a honeyed voice and a fondness for campy innuendo—and earned Carpenter her first two Grammys (Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Solo Performance).\n\nJust over a year after <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>’s release, the biggest breakout pop star of 2024 fires off its follow-up, <i>Man’s Best Friend</i>, which carries on her streak of concise 12-track records that draw from her love of ’70s disco and ooze snarky, self-deprecating charisma. “Oh, boy,” Carpenter chuckles to begin lead single “Manchild,” which taps the usual co-writers (Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen) for a country-tinged ode to the incompetent, unavailable men she can’t seem to shake. \n\nRomantic disappointment prevails, though the 26-year-old maintains her sense of humor as she wishes an ex a lifetime of celibacy on “Never Getting Laid” and drunk-dials old flames on the twangy “Go Go Juice.” Steeped in the nostalgic sounds of her heroes (Dolly Parton, the Carpenters, ABBA, the Bee Gees), Carpenter’s lyrics approach the drudgery of modern dating with a wink and a well-timed dirty joke. “I promise none of this is a metaphor,” she sings on the New Jack Swing-inspired “House Tour,” then she carries on: “I just want you to come inside.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Man’s Best Friend","playParams":{"id":"1819861154","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mans-best-friend/1819861154","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1aqg30bNvLSWgShZgX4oop"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819861154/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"390647681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/390647681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756469286559,"RTCI":0}}},"1819968191":{"id":"1819968191","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819968191?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ava Max","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ava-max/1265164818","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":2600,"textColor1":"cfab39","textColor2":"d09d9b","textColor3":"a5882d","textColor4":"a67e7c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5a/98/2e/5a982e54-9019-f9e7-4545-9a4ea37e01f4/075679605184.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2600},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ececee","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"080809","textColor2":"372921","textColor3":"363637","textColor4":"5b504a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f1/ca/dc/f1cadc4c-9702-dc33-2b66-5020b694fe7e/278a1619-5ce9-470e-b5d6-479e173b9a9a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f5b7ab","textColor2":"f4ae8b","textColor3":"ca998f","textColor4":"ca9175","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ed/7f/d7/ed7fd793-cb17-7eb7-dfe3-8375cb58b0ed/a0066f43-cf38-4e2a-bc80-b78a31e10727.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The vocal dynamo wraps songs of empowerment in sassy electro-pop.","standard":"There’s some heavy reverse psychology at play in Ava Max’s third album, from the fake petition posted on DontClickPlayOnAvaMax.com (which led to a snippet of an unreleased single) to Max’s bewildering disappearance from social media in the weeks leading up to its release.

On the back of that record and viral covers of Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s “Murder on the Dancefloor” and The Cranberries’ “Linger” they were propelled headfirst into a blur of overseas touring, high-profile festivals, and late-night TV appearances. That constant roadwork shaped album number two, <i>hickey</i>. “We were definitely more aware of how songs would come across when we played them live,” Maddell tells Apple Music. “We spent so much more time in front of crowds.” The experience, adds Pavlovic, contributed to the “simplicity” of the songs on <i>hickey</i>.\n\nSimple the songs may be, but sonically the album is a more diverse and textured effort than its predecessor, be it in the lush vocal harmonies of “come on home,” the joyous synths in “who’s your boyfriend,” the ’90s slacker vibe of “moody,” the ’80s-inspired pulse of “say something,” or the sumptuous, floating guitars that color “dancing with myself.” A by-product of what Pavlovic says was a desire to “not have any walls or boundaries with whatever we were trying to make,” the diversity also stems from the rich array of collaborators: Amy Allen (Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Styles); Jungle’s Lydia Kitto and Josh Lloyd-Watson; Omer Fedi (Lil Nas X, Sam Smith); Blake Slatkin (SZA, Justin Bieber); and Julian Bunetta (Teddy Swims, One Direction). \n\nThroughout, the duo’s dreamy musical optimism is contrasted by Pavlovic’s melancholy vocals, a neat vehicle for one of the album’s key themes, also inspired by the realities of life on the road. “There’s a few songs about saying goodbyes and missing people,” says Maddell. “I guess we were losing relationships.” Here, Maddell and Pavlovic walk Apple Music through <i>hickey</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“i hate this tune”</b>\nRoyel Maddell: “We wrote those lyrics for a different song, sitting in a pub drinking Guinness when we were recording <i>PRATTS & PAIN</i>. We made this instrumental track in Palm Springs with Blake and Omer and were trying to think of vocals, and then Otis started singing the lyrics we did in the UK.”\nOtis Pavlovic: “For some reason there’s a few songs, probably for both of us, that come on and remind us of a specific time or person. Can’t listen to it.”\nRM: “You love the song but you can’t not think of that time or person.”\n\n<b>“moody”</b>\nRM: “It’s kind of about a toxic relationship, not a girl in particular. The guy, the person singing, is the moody one as well ’cause they’re constantly saying something negative. We wrote that with Amy Allen.”\n\n<b>“good times”</b>\nOP: “That was the first song we did with Josh from Jungle. It just came out of an old demo we had. When you first meet someone and do a session, you’ve got to just break the ice and do something, and it’s the first idea we worked on. It is uplifting but then in the chorus it says, ‘In good times I doubt myself in front of you.’”\nRM: “It sounds fun but it’s negative.”\n\n<b>“torn jeans”</b>\nRM: “We did that with Chris Collins, and it was three guitar lines that I had and we just ended up weaving some vocals and stuff over it.”\nOP: “Just admiring someone’s torn jeans.”\nRM: “Just admiring the imperfections.”\n\n<b>“come on home”</b>\nRM: “It’s kind of about being far away from someone. Not really having control of where you are or where you could be. That was with Josh and Lydia from Jungle as well. Those harmonies are very Lydia-ish.”\n\n<b>“who’s your boyfriend”</b>\nRM: “The chords are really standard but we wanted to make them as least standard as possible, so added a capo to the guitar and tried to play them as weird as possible so it’s hard for people to figure out. Sonically, we were going for a mix between modern Cure and Joy Division. I don’t think we got anywhere close to either but that’s what we were going for.”\n\n<b>“car”</b>\nOP: “We did that one with Omer and Blake. We were talking about being with someone and trying to end [the relationship], but also not.”\nRM: “Not wanting the good parts to end.”\nOP: “[And] doing it in cars, which is something we’ve both experienced before, trying to break up in a car.”\nRM: “It’s weird wanting to break up with someone in a car because it’s claustrophobic and you’re in this small room. Why didn’t you just do it outdoors?”\n\n<b>“shut up”</b>\nOP: “We did this one with Blake Slatkin. It was the last song we did on the album. It came as a Hail Mary. That one is saying you don’t want someone to go away. Just shut up, don’t go away.”\nRM: “It’s also super dreamy, so it’s funny calling it ‘shut up.’”\n\n<b>“dancing with myself”</b>\nRM: “We went in wanting a disco Fleetwood Mac.”\nOP: “We wrote it in sections and you can kind of tell.”\nRM: “It’s [about] letting yourself be free and not worrying about what other people are thinking.”\n\n<b>“say something”</b>\nRM: “When we were planning on working with Blake and Omer, they asked what kind of song we want to make and as a joke, I said, ‘Take on Me’ by a-ha. That drumbeat is kind of a reference to ‘Take on Me.’”\n\n<b>“she’s got a gun”</b>\nOP: “We were doing it with Josh after working on ‘good times,’ just seeing what happens with it, throwing ideas down over the bassline. And I remember for the chorus we slowed the song down and sung stuff really slow to see what would happen, and the chorus melody came out of it. I don’t think we would have had that without doing that.”\n\n<b>“more to lose”</b>\nOP: “We’ve attempted to put melodies over that piano line since the start of the band.”\nRM: “Five years! We did it with Julian Bunetta and Omer. We were in Julian’s place in Calabasas, having fun making cocktails, and I just started playing it on the piano. Every time I sit at a piano I play it and just pray someone comes up with something. And that’s what happened.”\n\n<b>“jazz burger”</b>\nRM: “Jazz burger is a real thing. It’s from Jitlada in LA, this Thai restaurant, and you can get different levels of spiciness. We only went with four out of 10. It was so spicy my chest became mutated. I had this lump on my chest that was like a rhinoceros horn.

The track sounds like an Al Green lost cut as the vocalists croon: “You can lean on my love when there’s no one to hold you.” Elsewhere, the Louisiana songwriter invites Randy Newman to lend his vocals to “LONELY AVENUE,” which takes the Ray Charles classic and reimagines it as a bluesy piano ballad. Newman may be singing of love lost and endless heartbreak, but sadness has never sounded so sweet.

A charged R&B drama unfolds between scene-setting interludes narrated by stars including Taraji P. Henson, Sarah Paulson, Kerry Washington, Regina King, and Issa Rae, as Taylor demolishes the fourth wall and opens the audience up to a front-row view of life in metamorphosis.\n\nThe narrative that plays out across <i>Escape Room</i> runs parallel to events in Taylor’s own life, finding herself and falling in love again. Opening track “Fire Girl” deploys a distorted vocal sample and lilting, Spanish guitar which lights a blazing trail of raw emotion that stretches the entire expanse of the album. “Long Time” simmers with regret, the KAYTRANADA assist “Open Invite” burns up with pure desire, while “In Your Skin” melts devotion. Although a turbulent ride at times, the gentle acoustic ballad “Always,” which strums the record out—ending on a message to their mother, read aloud by Taylor’s children—makes for a smooth landing, bringing the curtain down on a happy ending.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Escape Room","playParams":{"id":"1822650564","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/escape-room/1822650564","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Aya7D6bm5P2iRrlnNsFQf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822650564/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"216698214","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/216698214?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756468989603,"RTCI":0}}},"1823652390":{"id":"1823652390","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823652390?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Romain Collin","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/romain-collin/508631996","artwork":{"bgColor":"264a56","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"8fe3fa","textColor2":"62dafa","textColor3":"7ac4d9","textColor4":"56bdd9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/47/b8/70/47b87056-0c20-8f94-90fd-f6cc0549d625/199538116632.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Contemporary Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"name":"Live","playParams":{"id":"1823652390","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live/1823652390","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3kD0yi0AaFQwfVJNKP6mTX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823652390/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"508631996","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/508631996?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756466991927,"RTCI":0}}},"1824543088":{"id":"1824543088","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543088?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mariah the Scientist","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mariah-the-scientist/1475275447","artwork":{"bgColor":"e485aa","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070b0a","textColor2":"090a0a","textColor3":"33232a","textColor4":"35232a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2c/06/86/2c068675-4814-c770-8da6-aaf1cc3fbdd0/196873376462.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"db91ad","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"060908","textColor2":"070908","textColor3":"312429","textColor4":"312429","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d5/4d/32/d54d32af-6651-6e7a-8d19-17f1619a6793/aa570ee5-28e3-4d14-be23-4145af9301dd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"813e49","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fad3bb","textColor2":"f8c7aa","textColor3":"e2b5a4","textColor4":"e0ac96","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/01/4e/ce/014ece7e-9f0f-e738-cb77-a7e4f0c1a42b/0a8ab72d-ad5a-4d1f-9124-9837797f88bd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"a27285","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"120d0e","textColor2":"130d0f","textColor3":"2f2126","textColor4":"302127","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/14/48/b8/1448b8d8-798b-ced8-8170-f24168c211f0/ed224432-9088-4fa5-bce0-687ba26dcb7a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“I tried new vibes.” Album four harkens back to smoother, sexier times.","standard":"“This is a warning: Your time is up,” announced Mariah the Scientist in the trailer for her fourth album, <i>HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY</i>. “We will not be led by heartless womanizers. We are more than soldiers. We are heartbeats in a world of hollow men, defenders of a cause worth living and dying for. This is for the lovers.” Since her debut album, 2019’s <i>MASTER</i>, romantic drama has been the Georgia native’s muse, as she unpacks the complexities of disappointment and desire with an old soul and a light touch.\n\nDrawing from the classics of ’80s R&B, when slow jams by the likes of Sade and Babyface ruled the radio, <i>HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY</i> harkens back to a smoother, sexier time, though there’s a tinge of melancholy to singles like “Burning Blue” and the Kali Uchis duet “Is It a Crime.” The pair of singles represent the 27-year-old singer’s biggest hits to date. “I tried new things with my voice,” she tells Apple Music. “I tried new vibes. New perspectives.”\n\nAs for what’s changed personally since 2023’s <i>To Be Eaten Alive</i>—after four years of her highly publicized relationship with Young Thug, during most of which he was incarcerated, the rapper was released in October 2024. Mariah delves into the situation on “Sacrifice,” the wistful opening track. “When you love somebody, you make sacrifices,” she says. “There was a point in time when there was a lot of distance in my relationship, and I feel like I had to make that sacrifice.” Amidst the sea of love songs floats one self-reliance anthem: “All along, it was me, myself, and I,” the self-professed loner sings on “More.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"HEARTS SOLD SEPARATELY","playParams":{"id":"1824543088","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hearts-sold-separately/1824543088","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0gZVv6enPZhdDz7vrzwhZP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543088/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1475275447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1475275447?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460963577,"RTCI":0}}},"1825252381":{"id":"1825252381","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825252381?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kid Cudi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kid-cudi/273058501","artwork":{"bgColor":"5a7c86","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"020202","textColor2":"090c0d","textColor3":"131a1c","textColor4":"192225","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/47/88/e3/4788e353-69d2-ad1b-3c64-cf5084028e1f/25UMGIM90824.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"2b4651","gradient":{"color":"2b4651","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"161615","textColor3":"141b1e","textColor4":"262c2d","textGradient":["ffffff","161615"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cd/ee/44/cdee44d7-9b92-d37d-5c71-f0958fd609e5/Job8fbff331-98e0-49ae-8a28-809235a193e1-196824048-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385417943_2241209271-Time1751937486628.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2b4651","gradient":{"color":"2b4651","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ddf3ea","textColor3":"cfd7d0","textColor4":"bdd4cf","textGradient":["ffffff","ddf3ea"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f4/6d/a2/f46da2b3-7418-543e-fb63-8078bece23ef/Job180024ea-e2f5-4916-91bf-46f877bfd253-196824047-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385417944_2241209270-Time1751936367868.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"060915","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"93c9d3","textColor2":"98bbc7","textColor3":"76a3ad","textColor4":"7b97a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/8d/b8/b68db835-2ef6-9d30-f88f-51cec903aedf/dea8805a-e1a7-40dd-a7b2-6b87e5e827fe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"7d8d91","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"111517","textColor3":"191c1d","textColor4":"272d30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/06/ce/68/06ce68ee-510d-a66d-3a7e-eb003352838f/6c6d7aaa-c738-4340-9433-0e1c33943cd2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A hip-hop lifer takes a big swing at pop: “I felt I needed to make a creative leap.”","standard":"When Kid Cudi spoke with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2022, Cudi was contemplating closing the door on music entirely. “The Kid Cudi stuff, I think I want to put it on the back burner and chill out with that,” he said. “I think I want to be done with it.” Fifteen years deep into his uncompromising career, he’d scored a handful of megahits, pioneered the melody-driven style that’s defined the past 15 years of hip-hop, and secured his spot among the blog era’s Mount Rushmore. Then he got bored.\n\nThree years later, Cudi’s reinspired and happier than ever, following up 2024’s pair of trap-inspired albums—<i>INSANO</i> and <i>INSANO (NITRO MEGA)</i>—with a record he bills as his first-ever pop album. “I just felt like I needed to drastically make a creative leap in my career,” he tells Lowe in 2025. “I mean, people know that I’m a risk-taker, and I felt like the last five years, I hadn’t really been pushing myself.” Approaching his 11th solo album, <i>Free</i>, he asked himself a question: “What does the world not have right now that I can provide?”\n\nThe answer, it turns out, was hope. The Cleveland native has never shied away from vulnerability, candidly sharing his struggles with depression over the years. On <i>Free</i>, the newlywed (he married Lola Abecassis Sartore in June 2025) testifies that it does, in fact, get better. Here he swings for the fences with pop-punk chords, massive hooks, and the occasional dubstep drop as he fights for happiness in the face of fear. “Turns out I had control of my own Truman Show,” he howls over the driving beat of “Truman Show.” And on the lighters-in-the-sky anthem “Neverland” (which he sang to his wife on their wedding day) he swoons: “My heart’s skipping/The scales tipping/It’s called living/And I could get used to it.” \n\nIntroduced to the world at the age of 24, the 41-year-old rapper never pictured himself making it this far. “When I was younger, I never imagined myself in my forties—I didn’t see past 30 for me,” he tells Lowe. “And it’s just a beautiful thing to have this album as a direct representation of the joy and peace that I feel.” He recalls being overcome with emotion when recording “Salt Water,” which he closes by addressing his audience directly: “Yes, my life has been one hell of a ride,” he says, ditching his signature melodies for spoken word. “There was a time where happiness was a very far-off and distant thing for me to acquire. But I made it out of that darkness. I saw the light.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Free","playParams":{"id":"1825252381","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/free/1825252381","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2GD42iPt0jtcudvlMksV1d"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825252381/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"273058501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/273058501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756467535049,"RTCI":0}}},"1825256499":{"id":"1825256499","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825256499?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ThxSoMch","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/thxsomch/1643389156","artwork":{"bgColor":"e9dfdd","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0d0b0c","textColor2":"181111","textColor3":"393535","textColor4":"423a3a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a7/8b/f5/a78bf54f-2f1c-bac8-3e64-c5201dfe9338/075679604125.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"93e2f4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"020000","textColor2":"1b2b33","textColor3":"1f2d30","textColor4":"334f59","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/dc/5b/b5dc5b65-e34e-9dd5-6704-8702f4a638fc/281a4de8-1637-495a-8579-8444d353e077.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Toronto artist makes moody emo-pop with a New Wave edge.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Sound Of You Laughing","playParams":{"id":"1825256499","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sound-of-you-laughing/1825256499","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7BD7GUC2SLrEbmhnNQfoO8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825256499/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1643389156","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1643389156?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756471889458,"RTCI":0}}},"1825435148":{"id":"1825435148","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825435148?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Deftones","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deftones/1092903","artwork":{"bgColor":"ece9e4","hasP3":false,"height":1500,"textColor1":"030a05","textColor2":"22311c","textColor3":"313731","textColor4":"4a5644","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e3/04/cf/e304cf55-06c7-8b6c-34d3-95b2706c79a8/093624832232.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1500},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"bec0bf","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"090909","textColor2":"1b1b1b","textColor3":"2d2d2d","textColor4":"3b3c3c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/d0/02/95d002a2-b07f-27d5-12cb-103e3e243569/c51bb260-69df-42e7-8f7f-2b34d7067f9d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"838383","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"010101","textColor2":"050505","textColor3":"1b1b1b","textColor4":"1e1e1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/31/67/91/31679143-7fbf-1f48-337f-e86a49475fb4/8bba5961-4f08-4ec8-b770-c18330755928.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"5b9260","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"141413","textColor2":"131413","textColor3":"222d22","textColor4":"222d22","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5a/d3/25/5ad3252d-973e-4be3-5095-c0120db25a02/301bb5a3-bffd-441c-b583-1c866bcb5d87.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Sacramento band continues to cement their legend on album 10.","standard":"If the title of Deftones’ 10th album seems provocative, that’s because it’s supposed to. “I like the exclusivity of the name,” vocalist Chino Moreno tells Apple Music. “It feels restricted, maybe naughty. It has all these connotations. But it was the name of the folder on my desktop where I would put stuff while we were working on all the songs.”\n\nWritten and recorded over two and a half years in Nashville, Joshua Tree, and Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu, <i>private music</i> sees Moreno, guitarist Stephen Carpenter, drummer Abe Cunningham, and keyboardist/turntablist Frank Delgado reteaming with producer Nick Raskulinecz, who helmed their 2010 album <i>Diamond Eyes</i> and 2012 album <i>Koi No Yokan</i>.\n\nThe album’s first single and leadoff track, “my mind is a mountain,” came out of a studio jam. “It was one of those songs like ‘Change,’” Carpenter says, referencing the band’s signature tune from 2000’s <i>White Pony</i>. “We were just in the room messing around, and it started forming.” “I love the fact that it’s bombastic,” Moreno adds. “There’s a push and pull in that song that I really love. It’s heavy, but the one way that we collectively always describe our band is, no matter what style of music it is, we always like to feel that you can nod your head to it. This song has that head-nod thing.”\n\n“i think about you all the time” came out of a quiet moment Moreno had on the beach near Shangri-La. “I remember getting up in the morning, walking down the street, jumping in the ocean, coming back in my swim trunks and sitting there in my bare feet with the guitar and just start playing,” he says. “That night, I made a cup of coffee and said, ‘Nick, let’s record that thing I did this morning.’”\n\n“milk of the madonna” is a thunderous Deftones banger, with Moreno’s emotional tenor soaring over the band’s swirling, writhing tempest. “infinite source” was the first song written for the album: Carpenter came up with the original idea in Nashville before he, Moreno, and Cunningham completed it on tour. As Moreno points out, <i>private music</i> has staying power. “Nothing feels like it was a snapshot of that time and now we’re in a different place,” he says. “Two and a half years after their inception, the songs still feel very much immediate.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"name":"private music","playParams":{"id":"1825435148","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/private-music/1825435148","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1gmWnG5TeRj91Tdm2lpEvJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825435148/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1092903","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1092903?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460884015,"RTCI":0}}},"1825845185":{"id":"1825845185","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825845185?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Michael Spyres, Maxim Emelyanychev, Hugh Cutting, Il Pomo d'Oro, Beth Taylor, Joyce DiDonato, Fatma Said & Laurence Kilsby","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=326733769-1032547436-577225572-506416675-1465896834-17757077-1486606112-423827070","artwork":{"bgColor":"93a2b1","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"050505","textColor2":"060506","textColor3":"222427","textColor4":"222428","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/73/68/fd/7368fd84-787e-9648-3ae9-de6a208a9f30/5021732369420.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e7ecf1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0d0e","textColor2":"110e0f","textColor3":"393a3b","textColor4":"3c3b3c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7a/46/50/7a4650cd-cdf1-785f-7021-06bdcf9a1f41/d4e21603-1fce-49c6-8d67-3600887effe3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Joyce DiDonato on Purcell’s opera: “It's funny, it's engaging… it has everything.”","standard":"<i>Dido and Aeneas</i> has been described, with good cause, as “the only flawless operatic tragedy ever written”. Maxim Emelyanychev’s interpretation references the spectacular style of theatrical entertainment favored in Henry Purcell’s London to compelling effect. His dramatic vision of the work, foreshadowed in the Overture by a bass line underpinned by two thunderous violones, intensifies the work’s all-too-human drama. While he ratchets up the despair that begins with Dido’s premonition that her love for Aeneas is doomed, and ends in her rejection and death from a broken heart, he also revels in the boisterous rhythms of the show’s dance numbers, its many fleeting changes of mood, and moments of delicious entertainment.\n\nJoyce DiDonato, who sings the role of Dido, agrees. “I loved doing this with Maxim because he’s my kind of collaborator,” the US mezzo-soprano tells Apple Music Classical. “He brings so much integrity to the standard of historical performance practice, yet he lives so freely in the moment. And he’s not trying to reproduce the ‘correct’ version. He brings <i>Dido</i> into the 21st century, blood and guts and alive and improvised and spontaneous. And I felt that all the time on stage with him. He makes it comes alive for audiences today.\n\nBut this <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> comes to full-blooded life thanks in equal part to DiDonato’s majestic performance as the Queen of Carthage, by turns tormented, lovestruck, imperious, raging, resigned to fate, abandoned, crushed. She owns the vocal armory and profound psychological insights needed to express the heart-melting confession, “Peace and I are strangers grown,” done with a whisper in her first aria, to explode with blistering scorn when breaking with Aeneas, and unfold an unforgettable lament in “When I am laid in earth.” DiDonato’s Dido is every inch the monarch, superior in rank to the Trojan prince who sails into her realm yet rendered utterly powerless by her overwhelming love for him.\n\n“Purcell presents Dido above all as a woman,” says DiDonato. “We see the woman first—someone who has to assume and perform the duties of a queen. And so her emotional landscape is under the restraints of royalty. But he introduces us to her as a woman, and I think that’s so important. When we get to the end of the opera, and she sings, ‘Remember me,’ we see her as a friend, as a woman, as a lover, as a human being, not as a queen. She's not asking to be remembered in a legacy kind of way. It’s ‘remember <i>me</i>,’ not ‘remember my title.’ For me, that has always been key for this character.”\n\nPerforming and recording the role of Didon in Berlioz’s epic five-act opera <i>Les Troyens</i> provided DiDonato with invaluable insights into Dido’s character that she carried into her interpretation of Purcell’s more concise telling of the queen’s story. “Coming to Purcell’s score for the first time, I already knew her, I knew all of the flesh and the muscles and the ligatures around her. I loved the economy of Purcell’s composition, I loved the specificity of it. But I think I was more successful this first time out in the role because I had the entirety of Berlioz in mind. I think the genius of <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> is that it’s funny, it’s engaging, it’s a little bit camp, it has everything. When Purcell clears the way for Dido’s first statement, you immediately know who she is and have the sense of where this tale is going. There’s that brief moment of light with her and Aeneas, and then everything just crashes. The economy of how you have to navigate the music is so pure, and it works so strongly because of everything that he surrounds her part with.”\n\nThe luxury casting of Michael Spyres as Aeneas, the warrior destined by the gods to found Rome, adds credence to the queen’s infatuation; likewise, Fatma Said brings a rare expressive depth to the part of Belinda, Dido’s consoling confidante. Beth Taylor’s searing Sorceress and Hugh Cutting’s Spirit enliven the opera’s supernatural business, while Laurence Kilsby launches the sailors’ chorus with a contrasting dose of high-camp humor. The period instruments and choristers of Il Pomo d’Oro, marshaled with consummate flair by Emelyanychev, combine to bring a dazzling array of colors and characters to a tale that takes less than an hour to tell.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Baroque Era","Opera"],"name":"Purcell: Dido and Aeneas, Z. 626","playParams":{"id":"1825845185","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":37,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/purcell-dido-and-aeneas-z-626/1825845185"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825845185/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"326733769","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/326733769?l=en-US"},{"id":"1032547436","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1032547436?l=en-US"},{"id":"577225572","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/577225572?l=en-US"},{"id":"506416675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/506416675?l=en-US"},{"id":"1465896834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1465896834?l=en-US"},{"id":"17757077","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/17757077?l=en-US"},{"id":"1486606112","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1486606112?l=en-US"},{"id":"423827070","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/423827070?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756456490996,"RTCI":0}}},"1825903903":{"id":"1825903903","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825903903?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Blood Orange","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blood-orange/440698865","artwork":{"bgColor":"704a44","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6e8dc","textColor2":"e4e5ec","textColor3":"dcc8bd","textColor4":"cdc6ca","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/15/b5/61/15b56142-10d6-f9d3-f29d-e0e0d123061d/196873161457.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"242217","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cbd1e8","textColor2":"b3b9c7","textColor3":"a9aebe","textColor4":"969ba3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/44/a9/f5/44a9f5af-e3e5-1e9d-6f74-3d96e88ef5f7/7e830049-528c-4a51-8942-766c9f9d588f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ada282","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"070505","textColor2":"060506","textColor3":"28241e","textColor4":"28241f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/26/48/27/264827cb-0e0c-1a12-97c6-349c296bfcc2/ce30e29b-0919-4773-8782-3631013e5a22.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"On his fifth album, Dev Hynes sublimely examines the concept of home.","standard":"In the seven years since Dev Hynes last released an album as Blood Orange, the English musician wasn’t exactly twiddling his thumbs. After 2018’s searching <i>Negro Swan</i>, the scene veteran released a mixtape (<i>Angel’s Pulse</i>) and an EP (<i>Four Songs</i>), composed soundtracks for film and TV, and hopped on records with Lorde, Turnstile, and Vampire Weekend. All the while, he contemplated the future of Blood Orange. “I’m always making music,” Hynes tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. But before he could release it, he had to answer his own questions: “Why should it exist? What’s the point?” Then Hynes’ mother died in 2023, and the direction for the fifth Blood Orange album, <i>Essex Honey</i>, became clear. \n\nSet in the county outside London that Hynes once called home, it’s a sublime examination of what “home” even means, refracted in the prism of his elegant hybrid of hazy pop, feather-light funk, and ghosts of post-punk and New Wave. Echoes of distant music memories forge pathways into the past: “Regressing back to times you know/Playing songs you forgot you owned/Change a memory, make it 4/3,” Hynes sings on “Westerberg,” its title a nod to The Replacements’ lead singer and its hook a play on the band’s 1987 track “Alex Chilton.”\n\nMore Easter eggs are buried in the bass grooves, sax solos, distorted guitars, and orchestral swoons—a Durutti Column sample on “The Field,” an Elliott Smith interpolation sung by Lorde on “Mind Loaded,” a line about writer’s block delivered by Zadie Smith on “Vivid Light.” The prevailing mood is liminal, surrendered between past and present, though in Hynes’ hands, purgatory sounds heavenly.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"Essex Honey","playParams":{"id":"1825903903","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/essex-honey/1825903903","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5RUma3H9uzDLXxwT7JzTel"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825903903/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"440698865","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/440698865?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460091534,"RTCI":0}}},"1826976969":{"id":"1826976969","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826976969?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Divine Earth","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/divine-earth/1794152733","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a4e82","hasP3":false,"height":3434,"textColor1":"fff8f3","textColor2":"dfd8d4","textColor3":"ced6dc","textColor4":"b4bcc4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/dd/78/76/dd787624-d938-f975-6b2e-07096703a4ca/5060180327217.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3434},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"LAVENDER - EP","playParams":{"id":"1826976969","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lavender-ep/1826976969"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826976969/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1794152733","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1794152733?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756442585144,"RTCI":0}}},"1827094081":{"id":"1827094081","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827094081?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Walker Hayes","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/walker-hayes/382876655","artwork":{"bgColor":"ac9279","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"110a04","textColor2":"24180d","textColor3":"30251b","textColor4":"3f3022","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/da/be/ad/dabead55-962d-87e7-6dcb-519d521b0897/196873371733.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Heavy, introspective moments balanced with calling-card party anthems.","standard":"The song that lends its title to this fifth studio album from Walker Hayes is a far cry from his biggest hit, the 2021 smash “Fancy Like.” Instead of living it up at Applebee’s, “17 Year Old Problems” finds Hayes navigating the pitfalls of middle age as he sings frankly about burying his late father and learning to care for his aging mother while lamenting the breezier days of his youth. It’s a heavy moment on an especially introspective project, though one Hayes is sure to balance with the kind of lighthearted, genre-blurring party anthems that first put him on the map. \n\nOpening track “Neon Lights” falls into that latter lighter category, with its poppy production and Hayes’ rap-sung delivery. Kane Brown joins Hayes on “Song for My Son,” another tender moment on which both singers consider their relationships to their fathers as they try to be parents themselves. Pop/R&B artist Nic D lends an assist on “Mayonnaise,” a slick come-on with banjo and a hip-hop beat, while Colbie Caillat duets with Hayes on “Adderall,” a deceptively sweet takedown of consumerism and hustle culture.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Pop"],"name":"17 Problems","playParams":{"id":"1827094081","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/17-problems/1827094081","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02epJ6msSRbMcoCbZGLV1h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827094081/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"382876655","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/382876655?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756461777937,"RTCI":0}}},"1828103000":{"id":"1828103000","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828103000?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mau y Ricky","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mau-y-ricky/1096068683","artwork":{"bgColor":"3e3e3c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f49fb7","textColor2":"f797b3","textColor3":"d08c9f","textColor4":"d2859b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/f3/54/05f354df-eb64-aa56-8154-633ee2c37736/198830944547.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"69a8a7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1f0c08","textColor2":"1a110e","textColor3":"2e2b28","textColor4":"29302d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a7/87/ac/a787ac7b-eff2-2667-2adf-870b043e21e5/dd2e099f-550c-45d7-9ac5-1743efe795f1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Venezuelan duo unlocks new global pop chambers.","standard":"Ever since their 2017 single “Mi Mala” hit, the Venezuelan duo Mau y Ricky have remained righteously entertaining artists in Latin pop.

The acerbic idiosyncrasies and deceptively lethargic flow that made the ruminative rapper so compelling early on in his run metamorphosed over time to place him in an even less categorizable stratum. More recent work, like 2022’s <i>SICK!</i> or the following year’s <i>VOIR DIRE</i> with The Alchemist, found him seemingly examining and embracing the possibilities of brevity, doing more by saying less and keeping his projects as concise as they are insular.\n\nIn line with that apparent methodology, <i>Live Laugh Love</i> contains songs that are often quite brief, filling the space provided by his curatorial left-field beat selections with pithy, incisive bars and comparatively looser vocal riffs. Some of these producers have been by his side for a while, namely Black Noi$e and Navy Blue who, respectively, contribute to roughly half the tracks. Apart from a sole instrumental from underground climber Child Actor—the murkily soulful <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i> nod “Heavy Metal aka ejecto seato!”—the remainder come from Theravada, a New York-based artist who Earl’s fans may recall from <i>SICK!</i>’s “Tabula Rasa.” The first four songs here benefit from his beats—from the squirmy filter funk of “gsw vs sac” through the percussive jolts of “Gamma (need the <3).”\n\nYet regardless of who happens to be behind the proverbial boards, <i>Live Laugh Love</i> is anchored by Earl’s unconventional appeal and discursive proclivities. “INFATUATION” mixes metaphors as if they were recipes, serving up tastily reconstructed wordplay seasoned with heady poetry. Among the longest songs here, “Live” cautiously raises one of the album’s oft-revisited trope dissections—dying on a hill—before spiraling downwards with a beat-flip to match the mood. The slightly redacted “CRISCO” offers up a fractured narrative flecked with graphic imagery, while “WELL DONE!” subversively flexes in different directions than most rappers could even attempt. On the closing “exhaust,” he comments on both work ethic and something far more personal, vacillating between civil splits and parting words of wisdom, albeit with the occasional Erykah Badu interruption.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Live Laugh Love","playParams":{"id":"1828396279","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-laugh-love/1828396279","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/45aldsXQsGrQxpst6z2hfR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828396279/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"445693504","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/445693504?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756476403710,"RTCI":0}}},"1828648304":{"id":"1828648304","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828648304?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"TWICE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twice/1203816887","artwork":{"bgColor":"515341","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"ebe174","textColor2":"e3da9f","textColor3":"ccc56a","textColor4":"c6bf8c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/56/90/52/569052f6-765f-d987-ad02-a192a1911788/5021732888624.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e9e6e0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"221916","textColor2":"31231d","textColor3":"4a423f","textColor4":"554a44","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ee/8e/cc/ee8ecc65-f87d-56ec-28ce-3043190cca00/5a72dd49-3fb7-4c8c-805a-f0367a16f465.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The K-pop girl group’s sixth full-length Japanese album.","standard":"TWICE gained wider global recognition in the summer of 2025 following their feature on the smash-hit soundtrack for <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i>, but the real-life girl group known for bops like “TT,” “What Is Love?,” “FANCY,” and “The Feels” was already one of the most successful K-pop acts of all time. Debuting in 2015 out of the idol survival show <i>Sixteeen</i>, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu are popular worldwide for their bright discography, catchy choreo, and prolific output. <i>ENEMY</i>, their second full-length album release of 2025, is specifically targeted at Japan, where Korean idol music is a part of the mainstream pop scene and TWICE is incredibly popular. (Three of the group’s members, Momo, Sana, and Mina, are from Japan.) \n\n<i>ENEMY</i> is TWICE’s sixth full-length Japanese album, following 2018’s <i>BDZ</i>, 2019’s <i>&TWICE</i>, 2021’s <i>Perfect World</i>, 2022’s <i>Celebrate</i>, and 2024’s <i>DIVE</i>. The album’s rock-infused title track stretches the boundaries of TWICE’s self-described “color pop” sound while still fitting seamlessly into the group’s tradition of self-empowerment songs. “Even a flower cannot bloom without swaying,” members Dahyun and Chaeyoung rap in Japanese on the second verse of the pop-rock song about persisting through hardship. \n\nThough <i>ENEMY</i> flirts with other sounds across its nine tracks—like cheerful summer bop (“Up to you”), laidback electropop (“FINE”), meandering jazz-pop (“Love is more”), and sweet acoustic ballad (“Glow”)—it returns to J-rock for album-ender “Like 1,” a sentimental song composed by Taku and Toru, members of the veteran Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK. The track’s lyrics were written by TWICE leader Jihyo, leaving listeners on a poignant, ambiguous note: “Know there will come a time/For a bittersweet salute (I wanna)/Stay in this moment now/But we don’t get to choose.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["J-Pop","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"ENEMY","playParams":{"id":"1828648304","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-26","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/enemy/1828648304","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/18v5nf750qcff18B0a6WmG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828648304/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1203816887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1203816887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756429359732,"RTCI":0}}},"1828649659":{"id":"1828649659","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828649659?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gustavo Dudamel, Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela & Jorge Glem","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=173392443-265052582-320515949","artwork":{"bgColor":"c7c87f","hasP3":false,"height":1600,"textColor1":"18211a","textColor2":"1a301b","textColor3":"3b422e","textColor4":"3d4e2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/de/bb/59/debb5936-6d78-3fd8-822a-b798d2dd6dc2/5059449232379.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1600},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"302a19","textColor3":"404420","textColor4":"4e4a2d","textGradient":["ffffff","302a19"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/60/2f/77/602f7718-586e-09b0-67aa-bd961849633c/Job2213e14c-2655-455b-912e-083d9b055b07-200525801-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392436667_2298563810-Time1755547318976.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"161d14","textColor3":"32401c","textColor4":"3b3e21","textGradient":["ffffff","161d14"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e6/36/1b/e6361bca-5239-58db-6320-7509c26368d8/Jobfd7a6f50-745d-4d6e-8dcb-291dc9583532-200525800-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_392436666_2298563809-Time1755546228292.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"151517","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e4cbbe","textColor2":"cfc7c4","textColor3":"baa69d","textColor4":"aaa3a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/a8/3b/b8a83b8c-6d68-5442-4a4e-0fad32b08342/afa071d1-2e31-43d1-8acd-f19cb380ace8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Dudamel on music that offers “bridges between our people and our cultures.”","standard":"This album showcases three colorful Latin American works, all composed for the Pan-American Initiative which Gustavo Dudamel instigated in 2021 as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dudamel describes the Initiative to Apple Music Classical as “a message of union, discovering the bridges and similarities between our people, our music, our landscapes, and our cultures”. With its release in 2025, the album also marks the 50th anniversary of El Sistema, Venezuela’s program of music education for children through which Dudamel himself developed as a musician, and which created the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra that Dudamel conducts in vibrant and atmospheric performances of all three works.\n\nFirst, and most substantial in terms of length and sheer variety of music, is <i>Odisea</i>, Gonzalo Grau’s concerto for Venezuelan Cuatro (a smaller-scale version of the standard guitar). This imagines a journey from Venezuela’s east coast, where the composer’s birthplace, Cumaná, is located, to Dudamel’s hometown of Barquisimeto in the country’s western-central region. In one continuous movement, the music carries the listener through colorful and well-contrasted episodes, some dance-like and enlivened by hand-struck percussion (particularly the golpe drum which appears at several key moments in the concerto), others beguiling and atmospheric. This eventually culminates in Grau’s evocation of the hubbub of an “encrucijadas,” one of Venezuela’s crossroads where the sounds and noises of street vendors and musicians collide, effectively heralding the striking (often literally!) cadenza in which the soloist, Jorge Glem, demonstrates the extraordinary versatility of his instrument.\n\nEven more “off the beaten track” is Ricardo Lorenz’s <i>Todo Torreno</i>, described by Dudamel as “a journey in Venezuela in a very old, rustic car.” As Dudamel explains, Lorenz’s “very virtuoso” music well-matches its subject: “you feel the wild but beautiful landscape of the journey, driving on roads that are not comfortable but which take you to magical, paradise-like places.” Tuned percussion and brass join in Lorenz’s string-led scoring to suggest both the jolts of the rough terrain and the exhilarating dance rhythms of the region.\n\nFinally, we have <i>Danzón No. 9</i> by the Mexican composer Arturo Márquez, who reaches beyond his own country to refer to an old Cuban salón dance. The work is a wash of orchestral color and Latin American rhythm, a thunderous opening fanfare giving way to an oasis of calm that shows Márquez’s mastery of subtle atmosphere. The opening drama soon returns, before a seductive, sweeping theme that forms the piece’s heart, with street rhythms and sounds growing in intensity around it.\n\nDudamel says his relationship with Márquez “goes to my childhood” when he was a violinist: “I remember being in the National Children Orchestra of Venezuela, and in one of these workshops we received this music of Mexican composer called <i>Danzón No. 2</i>. I was in love. We all fell in love. We were seduced by the beauty of the music of Arturo Márquez.\n\n“Márquez and I have a beautiful friendship also because of his commitment to music education, to social transformation through music,” continues Dudamel; “I think this Danzón is a celebration of that.” Which surely is the spirit of this entire album, together with its life-affirming joy in the color and passion of the Latin American heritage which Dudamel shares both with these composers and now passes to us.","tagline":"New Album and

think sharing our stories is the first step in feeling less alone or broken. making this album has done that for me—and i hope listening to it can do that for you. thank you & enjoy :) \n\nps: this album is executive produced by the lovely V Ron—thank u for creating the sonic universe of this album.</i>","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"people

the real Tiwa Savage: “This is the most vulnerable I’ve been on a record.”","standard":"As the title of Tiwa Savage’s <i>This One Is Personal</i> suggests, the Queen of Afrobeats is in rare form across her fourth studio album. “It’s the most vulnerable I’ve ever been on a record,” Savage tells Apple Music. “Every single record resonates with an experience I’ve gone through. It took two years for me to do this record.”\n\nThough she recorded the project in various locations around the world, she limited features to just Skepta, taves, and James Fauntleroy, opting instead to give herself the space to reflect on love, heartbreak, and faith as she’s experienced it. “It was a very dark time for me, and it was very therapeutic too,” she says. Below, Savage explains just how <i>This One Is Personal</i>, taking us through the album track by track.\n\n<b>“I’m Done”</b>\n“This is one of those piano-led records, where it’s just piano and vocals. It was very important for me to open the project with this, just to set the tone and almost to get it out of the way. It was hard for me to record this, too, because every single line was personal. But ‘I’m Done’ is a ballad. It’s emotional.”\n\n<b>“Angel Dust”</b>\n“This song is about a toxic relationship. Angel dust is a drug, so in this song I’m talking about a relationship where I know I’m kind of addicted to the relationship, but it’s not necessarily good for me.”\n\n<b>“You4Me”</b>\n“This is probably one of the lighter records on the album. I love the sample of the Tamia record, ‘So Into You.’ It’s one of my favorite R&B records of all time. I wanted to lean into this genre a lot more; it was very important for me to do a sample because I love records that are sampled well. ‘You4Me’ is a great summer record, a girl fantasizing about a guy that she has feelings for.”\n\n<b>“On the Low”</b>\n“‘On the Low’ is about something that I’ve experienced where you are seeing someone, but you guys are keeping it on the low, for whatever reason—maybe two celebrities or two people that shouldn’t be together, but they found themselves together; being in a relationship that we kind of want to keep on the low, but I don’t know if I really want to, but I know that that’s the best thing. And I was happy to get Skepta on the record. I think this is the first time we’ve heard him rap in a more romantic way.”\n\n<b>“Holding It Down”</b>\n“‘Holding It Down’ is an experience or relationship, I would say, where you guys are together, but you don’t want to give yourself titles of boyfriend or girlfriend or couple—you are in a situationship. [This is] me saying that I’m not doing this for entertainment. I’m holding this down because there’s a lot of sexual chemistry between us.”\n\n<b>“10%”</b>\n“This was a real-life experience. I was in the studio recording and I got a call from someone that I was with at the time. He was like, ‘Yo, pull up, come through.’ And I literally stopped my session. I was feeling like a bad girl at that time—every girl has that person that can bring out that wild side of them—and I was basically just driving to this guy’s house and my phone was on 10%. I was just praying that my phone doesn’t die before I get there because I’ll have to call him when I’m downstairs. I didn’t have a charger or nothing in the car. So yeah, ‘10%’ is a fun, sexy record.”\n\n<b>“Twisted”</b>\n“One of the last songs I recorded on the project. My heartbreak from the first record, ‘I’m Done,’ was so bad, it left me in such a bad state that the next person I got with, my heart was hardened. I found myself even being toxic and being the same person that broke my heart to this [new] person. And this poor guy was accepting of everything, and I was just like, ‘Yo, this is twisted.’ But it was kind of like, ‘OK, I’ve been treated so bad and I’m just out here just being the toxic person.’”\n\n<b>“Scared of Love”</b>\n“It’s self-explanatory. I’m scared of love now. I feel like it’s just hard for me to give that part of me like I did before, because I got burnt. So, ‘Scared of Love’ is like, ‘Should I really be scared? But then when I’m with you, I’m not scared. When I’m with you, I feel like I can conquer the world—but then I’m also scared of that because of the power that we have together.’”\n\n<b>“Pray No More”</b>\n“The title kind of makes you think I’m saying ‘pray no more,’ which is contradictory to what the song is about. I’m a very spiritual person. I love God. I have fear of God, of Jesus Christ. I think it’s very important to always pray. But in the song, what I’m saying to the guy is, ‘You don’t have to pray for me anymore, you already have me. So you can pray to God for money or work or career, but when it comes to my heart and my loyalty and just me being there for you, me being your ride-or-die, you got me.’”\n\n<b>“Addicted”</b>\n“This song gives that ’80s vibe, the drums. It’s such a cool midtempo record. Again, it’s talking about being addicted to a love, being addicted to something that is not necessarily cool for you. It’s a follow-up for ‘On the Low.’ Being so addicted to something that you’re just like, ‘How long can I keep this a secret?’ Because eventually people are going to find out.”\n\n<b>“This One Is Personal (Interlude)”</b>\n“You know when you’re in love and it doesn’t work out, and then you go through that disbelief phase and you’re just like, ‘What? How can you do this to me? I’m that bitch. I’m that girl. You’re nothing without me.’ And your friends are also echoing like, ‘Yeah, girl, you don’t need him.’ This was my moment of trying to encourage myself and pick myself back up again.”\n\n<b>“Will I Run Again?”</b>\n“The song is basically like, ‘When will I learn my lesson? And how will I learn my lesson if I keep repeating the same [mistake]? And will I run again? Will I be able to fly again? Will I be able to get through this?’”\n\n<b>“For One Night”</b>\n“This song is talking about a situation where you found yourself having a one-night stand, but you don’t want it to be a one-night stand. You’re like, ‘Can we pretend this isn’t just for one night?’ But it is for one night. But in that moment, you’re telling yourself, ‘Can we just pretend like there’s nobody else in the world? Let’s just pretend like this isn’t just going to go away. This isn’t just for one night.’”\n\n<b>“You’re Not the First (You’re Just the Worst)”</b>\n“‘You’re not my first, you’re just the worst…’ Again, talking about the relationship, saying, ‘You’re not the first person to break my heart, you’re just the worst one and you’ve just done it in the worst way.’”\n\n<b>“Change”</b>\n“This is such a special record to me because I’m saying, ‘I want to change for you. Whatever is going to make you love me, I want to [do that].’ But people might think that I’m talking about a guy, but ultimately, I’m talking about God. Because after all was said and done, the only person I could run to was God. And I was just like, ‘Listen, God, I’m here now. I’m in this hole, I’m in this dark space. So many challenges—heartbreak, whatever it is, career—and what do I have to do? What do I have to change to reconcile with you, to come back into your love?’ Because God is the ultimate love and it’s just changing for God, who is truly love.”\n","tagline":"New Album and

on his second post-Migos solo album: “Adversity made me focus.”","standard":"The past few years have been trying for the former member of Migos, which officially disbanded in 2023 after the tragic death of Takeoff in 2022. But hardship has shaped Offset’s path from the beginning, going back to his incarceration during Migos’ big break in 2013. “With me personally, adversity made me focus,” the 33-year-old rapper tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “I’ve learned to just brush it off.”\n\nHis debut solo album, <i>FATHER OF 4</i>, arrived in 2019, but 2023’s <i>SET IT OFF</i> marked Offset’s first venture with Migos in the rearview. On his third solo album, the rapper born Kiari Cephus sets aside his alias to dig a little deeper. “I named my album <i>KIARI</i> because it’s like me looking at myself in the mirror—my real life, how far I’ve come and what I’ve done, the good and the bad, the mistakes,” he tells Ebro. After seven years of marriage, Offset’s ex-wife, Cardi B, filed for divorce in August 2024. Through the drama, he sought solace in the booth. “I just wanted to focus on the music,” he tells Ebro. “And as soon as I did it, I seen the results.”\n\nThe 18 tracks of <i>KIARI</i> show Offset at his most soul-searching, without sacrificing the technical precision he’s been known for since his scene-stealing turn on 2016’s “Bad and Boujee.” Moody samples add to the gravity, from the flip of Nina Simone’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” on “Pills” to “Bodies” with JID, which throws a curveball by interpolating Drowning Pool’s “Bodies.” (“I like the element of surprise on the records,” Offset told Ebro of the collaboration.)\n\nOn “Move On,” Offset officially closes the book on his relationship with Cardi: “I’m trying to move on in peace,” he sings on the hook. As for a future reconciliation with Quavo for a Takeoff tribute album, Offset tells Ebro, “It’s possible. We just building us first.” Still, he scatters tributes to Takeoff throughout <i>KIARI</i>, recollecting the trio’s early days on “Prada Myself” and recruiting John Legend for the poignant hook of “Never Let Go”: “I lost my brother, but I gained an angel.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"KIARI","playParams":{"id":"1830591137","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kiari/1830591137","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6TAosyqS0VOSBzYnfKk0O6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830591137/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3973268","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3973268?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756468930754,"RTCI":0}}},"1831293444":{"id":"1831293444","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831293444?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Christopher Rau","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/christopher-rau/291049539","artwork":{"bgColor":"e9d430","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"161616","textColor2":"161616","textColor3":"403c1b","textColor4":"403c1b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/14/2a/7b142aad-dfc2-b0ec-406c-879d4cd87607/4251804174527_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"name":"Hoodrec003 -

With his hypnotic voice and over-the-top charisma, BigX has spent the past few years establishing himself as a bona fide star. But “All the Way” was the biggest hit to date for both BigX and Zimmerman.\n\nThroughout the 2020s, the lines between country and rap have blurred: Morgan Wallen and Lil Durk scored a hit with their 2021 collab “Broadway Girls,” onetime rappers like Jelly Roll and Post Malone have been embraced by Nashville, and the biggest song of 2024 was Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a twangy rework of an old ringtone rap hit. With his third album, <i>I Hope You’re Happy</i>, BigX straddles that line with a foot firmly planted in each terrain. Besides a pair of interludes, each track features a duet with a country star, mostly centered around country music’s favorite topic: heartache.\n\nSpeaking to Thomas Rhett on Apple Music Radio, BigX explained his methodology for choosing the album’s nine features: “The way I went about it, I looked for anybody who I felt like had some type of soul in them.” Hence the assist from Jelly Roll on the bittersweet “Box Me Up,” or the bluesy hook from Darius Rucker on the title track. Alabama’s Ella Langley is gorgeously petty on “Hell at Night,” an ode to taking the low road. (“It’s just one of those situations where you could tell two people was going through some of the same things, just in their own separate ways,” said BigX of the collaboration.) But on the Thomas Rhett duet “Long Nights,” BigX takes a moment to appreciate how far he’s come: “I thank God like every day, ’cause, shit, he helped me find my purpose/I was hurting/I went from hearing shots to hearing fans behind those curtains/So I know that it’s working.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Country"],"name":"I Hope You're Happy","playParams":{"id":"1831400122","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-22","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-hope-youre-happy/1831400122","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4llPc4sijqW69zcet6TAEC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831400122/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1482508209","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1482508209?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756476413952,"RTCI":0}}},"1831649025":{"id":"1831649025","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831649025?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Estoc","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/estoc/1432053778","artwork":{"bgColor":"f7eb69","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1d1604","textColor2":"393019","textColor3":"484018","textColor4":"5f5529","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dc/39/7b/dc397b08-fe17-c774-2e4b-9b0ffbf6af77/1e2b0611-5a89-4cec-939c-4b152dcb1c2a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"bb8ff7","hasP3":true,"height":3840,"textColor1":"09080c","textColor2":"0b090f","textColor3":"2d233b","textColor4":"2e243d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/bd/3a/09/bd3a0919-9823-7184-5d20-8f15ab54e8ff/ae21f8c5-40de-4092-bd01-28bc0a666a47.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"ad7ef5","hasP3":true,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"241a30","textColor4":"251b32","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cd/e8/67/cde86741-6959-6fdc-853d-0f9179ce389b/6650e8e1-9f1f-44c6-bfa0-80db6b3816cf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"fcf583","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"595227","textColor4":"5d552f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/29/02/24/2902243a-c638-bf76-551a-7ea5af340a2d/fa562cfe-7d73-471d-a723-093ea3614a78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"eeb361","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"241c06","textColor2":"27200e","textColor3":"4c3a18","textColor4":"4f3d1f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d0/7b/97/d07b97cc-590b-9aab-b458-e7a6c377e247/28593675-2153-4996-bdc9-bcc69ade0c9c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"ecc774","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textColor1":"28220b","textColor2":"363116","textColor3":"4f4320","textColor4":"5a4f29","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0d/66/3e/0d663e69-2db3-63a1-6e20-e7ae416f4a57/8b5db990-0955-4632-911b-5ba42a53f819.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"ebb26a","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"150f04","textColor2":"1d170a","textColor3":"3f3019","textColor4":"46361d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/58/75/fd/5875fdbc-3754-bd8b-93ad-db54538fff24/b1cf7445-b7a4-4bb3-ab3f-f99f811777c3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Philly producer takes her mix in a beguilingly moody direction.","standard":"The beauty of the Early Hours mix is that it exists in a liminal zone—are you winding down after being up all night, or are you just rising to meet the sun?

A lot of artists have moved to Lagos from Port Harcourt, from Benin, from whatever they come from, and they’ve been able to take their craft to the rest of the world.” \n\nAcross <i>ÈKÓ GROOVE</i>’s 14 tracks, SPINALL acts as a bridge between the different artists, soundscapes, and belief systems that have built Lagos’ reputation as a multicultural port of call without sacrificing the melodic foundation that helped propel Afrobeats to global fame. “I’m hoping that Lagos can shine, but I also want to remind people that there’s a groovy side of Lagos,” he says. \n\nIn keeping with the forward-thinking tradition there, the ambition that powers <i>ÈKÓ GROOVE</i> births collaborations that cut across genres: There’s a soulful fusion of reggae and R&B in “STRUGGLE,” a playful incursion into Afro-house on “EXCITED,” and a nod to amapiano on “LIVING.” “Even though <i>ÈKÓ GROOVE<i> talks about Lagos, it was crafted for the world,” SPINALL says. “It was crafted for music fans and music lovers all over the world.” Below, SPINALL talks us through <i>ÈKÓ GROOVE</i>, track by track. \n\n<b>“ÈKÓ GROOVE” (feat. Ayinde Bakare)</b>\n“‘EKO GROOVE’ features the legend, Mr. Ayinde Bakare. I wasn’t born when he was here, but history told me that he was one of a kind. He was in Lagos, did a show, and he made a little prelude to a song where he was giving all these great accolades to Lagos. I look at Lagos today, that’s what it is. Lagos is the dream city for anyone who wants to be great. People come to Lagos to get married, people come to Lagos to have kids. People come to Lagos for work. People come to Lagos for a new story. I felt like that song needed to be brought back to life. So, I sampled it, and I had it on the album as the first track just to give Lagos the respect it deserves. I did a lot of dazzling with the guitars on the first track just to add some groovy elements to it.”\n\n<b>“WANT YOU” (feat. JayO & DESTIN CONRAD)</b>\n“I started working on ‘WANT YOU’ in 2024 with P.Priime. He had come over to the studio in Lagos, and we were just brainstorming on what we were going to do. The beautiful thing about P.Priime is that he gets what I’m trying to do. Then I reached out to DESTIN CONRAD. I sent it to DESTIN, and in like a day, he sent me back one of the hardest verses I’ve ever heard. I’ve done some R&B records in the past, like “Jabole” featuring Ycee and OXLADE, so this is my continuity into making soulful R&B records. I really love R&B music.”\n\n<b>“EARLY” (feat. Victony)</b>\n“Victony and I have done a lot of records in the past. None of them had seen the light of day, but ‘EARLY’ is the first one that we finally agreed to put out. ‘EARLY’ is quite sexual. We’re talking about some grown folks’ business, about what we like to do early in the morning. The beat was produced by Blaise, who brought light into the world with this one. Blaise is another person that I’ve worked with in the past on ‘Loju,’ featuring Wizkid. We made ‘EARLY’ about six months ago, but we went back, worked on it, moved things around, and the song is sounding crazy. This is one of the records I can’t wait for people to listen to.”\n\n<b>“STRUGGLE” (feat. Summer Walker, Buju Banton & Jaz Karis)</b>\n“I went to Jamaica on what was supposed to be a vacation. It ended up becoming a full-on studio session. Buju Banton is a legend and an icon. He’s someone who has stood for the truth and always lends his voice when it comes to speaking for people who have been through stuff. During the session, we were talking about things that are wrong with the world, and that was how this song was given birth to. Then, I reached out to Jaz Karis. I was thinking an R&B voice mixed with Buju Banton’s raw vocals would be insane.\n\n“I wanted to get as many people from different parts of the world to talk about struggle. Summer Walker came to mind. We have a Jamaican on the record, we have a Nigerian on the record, we have somebody from the UK on the record, and we have someone from the US on the record. I produced it, and I’m glad that everybody loved it.”\n\n<b>“AUNT MARY” (feat. ShineTTW & DarkoVibes)</b>\n“I made ‘AUNT MARY’ when we went to Ghana. In my head, I feel like Ghanaians are Nigerians’ cousins. Shout-out to DarkoVibes and Shine TTW. Shine’s vocals are incredible; there’s no genre Shine cannot jump on and kill it.”\n\n<b>“FORWARD” (feat. Tay Iwar)</b>\n“I don’t think I can ever stop working with Tay. I don’t see it happening anytime soon. For me, the goal here is to put out music we can be proud of when we look back years from now. I’ve met people who told me all kinds of stories of what they’ve gone through with my songs. My songs have been there for people when they were going through some of their darkest times, when they’re celebrating, when they’re winning, when they’re going through life itself. That’s the importance of music. ‘FORWARD’ is one of the records that makes me feel proud to be doing what I’m doing. It also talks about having a positive mental attitude towards the things that we’re doing. We should always look forward, no matter what the situation is in our work and life. Think forward, and that’s what I’m doing with this song.”\n\n<b>“WAITING” (feat. taves & JayO)</b>\n“Shout-out to Type A and TMXO. I made this song with them. When we were producing ‘WAITING,’ JayO was not a part of it. I already had JayO on a song, and I didn’t intend to put him on this other song. ‘WANT YOU’ (the song we did with JayO) was great, but when I was making this one, I sent it to him randomly. He sent the verse back, and I felt like it was perfect for the song. Taves is an amazing human being, and he’s full of so much talent.”\n\n<b>“KEROSENE” (feat. Young Jonn)</b>\n“This is the smash hit of this album. [It’s] doing amazing numbers on TikTok, on streams, and in real life. Young Jonn and I come from the same production angle, and it was a no-brainer that we were going to make a hit record.”\n\n<b>“LOJU” (feat. Wizkid)</b>\n“Big shout-out to the dog Wizkid. Wiz always tries something new each time we work together. If you look at the discography that we’ve made in the past, we don’t have a song where we did the same thing. I respect Wiz a lot because of his efforts in making sure that he protects the genre. He really cares about the growth and success of Afrobeats. From a leader of my class to a leader of his class, it’s a no-brainer that we will make something that can stand the test of time.”\n\n<b>“EXCITED” (feat. Ami Faku, Heavy-K & Niniola)</b>\n“Now, this is one song that people need to pay attention to. One of my favorite people in the entire south of Africa is Ami Faku. That’s my sister, I feel like my mother gave birth to her because we have real heart-to-heart conversations. Everybody who knows me well knows that Niniola is my music industry wife. Niniola is someone who has stood on the hills of Afro-house before Afro-house became what it is today. These are people who are not doing music to be praised or to be worshipped. These are talents who are doing music just because that’s what God has sent them into this world to do. If you look at my past albums, you’ll see Niniola’s touch on every single one. Shout-out to Heavy-K. He’s an amazing producer and a legend in the South African music business.”\n\n<b>“MIAMI” (feat. Olamide & T.I.)</b>\n“Everybody knows I love Olamide—that’s my family. Olamide and I made this in Lagos, but I reached out to my partners at Epic Records. They sent it around, and T.I. showed interest. T.I. recorded this song twice. The first one, I was already excited. When I told him we’re about to put out the album, he said he wanted to listen to the song again. Then he gave me a brand-new verse, which is even crazier than what it was before.”\n\n<b>“ONE CALL” (feat. Omah Lay & Tyla)</b>\n“Shout-out to Omah Lay. That’s another brother of mine. I’ve been trying to work with Tyla, and this was the song that really connected it. It’s people’s favorite.”\n\n<b>“LIVING” (feat. Murumba Pitch & Tony Duardo)</b>\n“Murumba Pitch is a duo that I rate. I think they’re bringing something totally different into the music game, and I’m a big fan of their work. I’ve been to their home in South Africa. ‘LIVING’ is one of my favorites on the album, too. Shout-out to me for always thinking out of the box.”\n\n<b>“PSALM 23” (feat. Teni)</b>\n“I made this song with Teni the day I was told I was playing Coachella. Teni was kneeling to say, ‘Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.’ So, I said, ‘Teni, you are coming with me. We are both going to Coachella.’ I flew Teni and Fireboy DML to Coachella. ‘PSALM 23’ is a song that speaks to my spirituality, but more importantly, I want God to punish all my haters. I want God to deal with them because I’ve literally done nothing but good, but they want to be devils so bad. So, I’m using the word of God to send God a reminder not to forget to deal with them.”</i></i>","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"name":"ÈKÓ GROOVE","playParams":{"id":"1831841730","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/%C3%A8k%C3%B3-groove/1831841730","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2F8tF7YFS8ZJCJ57x9Xi8z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831841730/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"813737832","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/813737832?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756460259114,"RTCI":0}}},"1831903462":{"id":"1831903462","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831903462?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"IVE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ive/1594159996","artwork":{"bgColor":"7bb8ea","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"141316","textColor2":"131416","textColor3":"283440","textColor4":"273540","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/67/12/6f/67126f11-d708-33be-7052-d54b2bff3168/199538397024.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"9bc6eb","gradient":{"color":"9bc6eb","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"131416","textColor3":"283441","textColor4":"283541","textGradient":["000000","131416"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c0/7d/b1/c07db19e-c941-7168-3e1b-63057303aa10/Job5abf3261-9b5b-42ef-a8d1-a3d36886fe81-201117631-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393550370_2307867247-Time1756122455238.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"9bc6eb","gradient":{"color":"9bc6eb","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"131416","textColor3":"263440","textColor4":"283540","textGradient":["000000","131416"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/07/66/68/076668c4-8702-c2fa-f92b-c7680c23f1bf/Job0f893c14-0204-4a90-ae9b-bf8370ef4774-201117630-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393550371_2307867246-Time1756120795838.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d5d3d0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"201c1a","textColor2":"291c1c","textColor3":"44403e","textColor4":"4c4040","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f7/aa/a4/f7aaa467-0e45-6c35-a7dd-849e6743f490/ba999c0a-ad14-4984-831a-a94a94c25618.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The K-pop group trades big choruses for dreamier, more low-key sounds.","standard":"<i>IVE SECRET</i> is the second Korean mini album of 2025 for IVE, the K-pop girl group known for hits like “LOVE DIVE” and “After LIKE.” As the title suggests, the six-track album is an exploration of the lesser-known, complex emotions behind the glossy facade of the fourth-generation team, composed of members Gaeul, Yujin, Rei, Wonyoung, Liz, and Leeseo. \n\nSonically, this means a more subdued sound for IVE. Gone are the soaring choruses of “I AM” and “REBEL HEART.” Instead, dreamy lead single “XOXZ” builds to a rap-chant chorus of the title slang, created to mean “I love you, good night, see you in my dreams.” IVE pairs the low-key chorus with a lulling, melodic “ooh-ooh, ooh,” a subtle and powerful reminder of their vocal prowess. \n\nThe album’s “secret” theme is more explicit in tracks like “Dear, My Feelings,” a song about looking back at old diary entries with fondness, and “♥beats,” a laidback electropop bop about love explored on a digital landscape. Wonyoung participated in writing the lyrics for “XOXZ,” while Liz co-wrote the lyrics for “Midnight Kiss,” a midtempo pop ballad about missing a lover. \n","tagline":"New Mini

Nashville singer-songwriter adds six new tracks to his 2024 album.","standard":"Riley Green’s third album opens with some sage advice. On “That’s a Mistake,” a warm and tender track with ’90s Tim McGraw vibes, Green runs through a laundry list of minor miscalculations—forgetting to get an oil change, perpetually running late—before revealing the kind of misstep that leaves a lasting impression: a romantic one. It’s an understated opening to Green’s boldest release yet, one that finds the Alabama-born star pushing himself as both a songwriter and a vocalist. Standout tracks on the record, which follows 2023’s <i>Ain’t My Last Rodeo</i>, include “Turnin’ Dirt,” a laidback ode to blue-collar life, and “Don’t Mind If I Do,” an emotional duet with country singer-songwriter Ella Langley. The record wraps with the hit song “Worst Way,” a soulful solo write that shows off Green’s sultry side.\n\nGreen wrote four of the album’s 18 tracks by himself, telling Apple Music that he’s unlocked a new level of artistry since reframing his approach to his songwriting process. “When I was a kid, I always thought [writing a song] was a lucky thing,” Green says. “You had those one-hit wonders, and to write a hit song seemed like, ‘Well, sometimes you just get lucky, or you get in the right room, or have the right idea.’ And when I started thinking about songwriting as something that you could get better at, like a skill, it really changed my whole mindset on it. It just motivated me to write better songs and write songs that people connect with.” Below, Green shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“That’s a Mistake”</b>\n“I grew up listening to a CD from front to back. I don't know that everybody does that anymore, but it's certainly a way I like to do it. And I always try to schedule my songs on my album for that reason. But it's just such an easy listen. I can remember when the song—it sounds like it ends. I didn't want it to end, and then it keeps going. And the whole time I was just into it. And it's tough, with a song that's kind of down or midtempo like that, to keep somebody's ear that whole time. But I just love that song and the vibe of it. And I thought that was a cool way to start the record off, and then, we bring it back down at the end.”\n\n<b>“Turnin’ Dirt”</b>\n“It's a strange thing when you cut outside songs, for me, because I haven't really done that a lot. I write so much of my own music. But I cut songs that sound like something I would write, that I just didn't write. ‘Turnin’ Dirt’ is one of those. It sounded like I wrote that song. People would argue with you that I wrote it, probably.”\n\n<b>“Chip Off the Ol’ Block”</b>\n“I love writing songs that are common sayings, especially Southern country sayings. So ‘Chip Off the Ol' Block’ is writing a song about my dad and the ways that we're similar, writing in a fun, lighthearted way. But I wanted to do it like The Band, Levon Helm, something kind of swampy. There's a song Lynyrd Skynyrd had called ‘Made in the Shade,’ and it is that kind of thing. So, I'm glad it came out that way and it's got a different feel than a lot of stuff I have, too.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Mind If I Do” (feat. Ella Langley)</b>\n“All the duets that I really loved growing up, you always wondered, ‘Is there something going on?’ or whatever. And I think, as a fan, you like for stuff to be true. When you hear a song, it's a love song, and that's what made George [Jones] and Tammy [Wynette] so big, I think, is that all their songs were about what was really going on. And then, when they split, George is still writing these lovesick heartbreak songs. So for me and Ella to have two songs we do that are doing that much, I'm sure there's a lot of rumors and speculation, but it's cool, man. It's cool to see people react and have emotion to something that you write. More than anything, that's what's enjoyable about it.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Don't Mind If I Do (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1832730457","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":24,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-mind-if-i-do-deluxe/1832730457","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1zYMNgeczOfopUj0mDK8Nx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832730457/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"662432971","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/662432971?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756468053583,"RTCI":0}}},"1832945623":{"id":"1832945623","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832945623?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"AB6IX","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ab6ix/1463405847","artwork":{"bgColor":"5d9792","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"010909","textColor2":"0f120a","textColor3":"142525","textColor4":"1e2c25","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3f/f9/5d/3ff95d8d-218f-6b54-afd9-8cd51b1cc60a/5021732956217.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"UPSIDE DOWN - EP","playParams":{"id":"1832945623","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-25","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/upside-down-ep/1832945623"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832945623/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1463405847","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1463405847?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756437022154,"RTCI":0}}},"1833006180":{"id":"1833006180","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833006180?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hayley Williams","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hayley-williams/256673270","artwork":{"bgColor":"151517","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d9dcdd","textColor2":"c6c8c9","textColor3":"b2b4b5","textColor4":"a3a4a6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/25/67/85/2567853a-dfde-a051-6ab6-3ae574d49639/57942.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d2c66f","textColor2":"9da3dc","textColor3":"aba25c","textColor4":"8186b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/03/94/4e/03944e07-eee8-2bd4-ebf1-10ef4bfb9a65/3fa32938-7fad-4dd8-b562-1af29c47aa9d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Paramore star takes full advantage of her newfound independence.","standard":"As the frontwoman for pop-punk heroes Paramore, Hayley Williams has spent her entire professional life in the major-label system, having first signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 when she was just 15. But following the worldwide arena tour for Paramore’s 2023 album, <i>This Is Why</i>, the contract expired, and she returned to her concurrent solo career as a fully independent artist for the first time, completely unburdened by the weight of commercial expectations—and from any conventional notions of what even constitutes a proper album. In August 2025, she dropped a whopping 17 new tracks online at random, inviting fans to create their own playlist permutations. “I really did want to shirk the responsibility,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe at the time. “I was kind of interested in other people’s perspective, also, because there’s just a point where you’re in the eye of that storm, you’re making things, you’re going through shit, and you can’t possibly have perspective.”\n\nHowever, four weeks after that initial data dump, Williams finalized her own version of the tracklist and officially corralled those songs under the title of <i>Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</i>. You can understand why sequencing these tracks was such a daunting task: <i>Ego Death</i> feels a lot like listening to five-disc CD changer stocked with ’90s faves on shuffle mode, bounding between fuzzy Breeders-styled odes to anti-depressants (“Mirtazapine”), No Doubt-like tropical-pop mash notes (“Love Me Different”), and pure Alanis-worthy catharsis (“Hard”); she even works the chorus of Bloodhang Gang’s “The Bad Touch” into the grungy folk dirge “Discovery Channel,” transforming the original’s horndog hook into a raw expression of animalistic lust. \n\nBut while <i>Ego Death</i> draws from a kaleidoscopic pop palette, Williams’ punk-rock heart beats loudly throughout, as she takes side-eyed shots at the Nashville establishment on the deceptively breezy title track, while using the gothic trip-hop backdrop and deadpan Lana-esque vocal of “True Believer” to paint a damning portrait of so-called Christians who “pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all the children.” As a parting gift, Williams appends <i>Ego Death</i>’s original 17 loosies with the previously unreleased “Parachute,” which seamlessly folds Williams’ punk past and alt-pop present into a triumphant closer that sounds like Chappell Roan working up the nerve to stage-dive into the pit at Riot Fest.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party","playParams":{"id":"1833006180","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-28","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ego-death-at-a-bachelorette-party/1833006180","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0U0Qv2jYtsgGxFDpQJKAxQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833006180/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"256673270","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/256673270?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756467161745,"RTCI":0}}},"1833057985":{"id":"1833057985","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833057985?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Abbie Gamboa & Aodhán King","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1479895581-666060823","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"c9cccf","textColor2":"c6c5d6","textColor3":"a1a3a5","textColor4":"9e9dab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/5c/b0/475cb082-0ef8-d243-e779-ad6b11623847/25SYMIM21982.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"8ec2c9","textColor3":"a3a6a5","textColor4":"719ba1","textGradient":["ffffff","8ec2c9"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/44/62/21/44622119-2d4d-6cde-1917-51b08ba8b0ab/Job4ab19a79-eefc-4aae-847d-55b02a6e5f0c-200829470-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393037895_2303607794-Time1755810195528.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d5a552","textColor3":"999d98","textColor4":"aa8442","textGradient":["ffffff","d5a552"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a0/78/f2/a078f207-2cef-584b-3194-fe96fd4208a5/Joba5cbad95-de70-4bd7-ba40-931cbc92f8f5-200829469-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393037894_2303607795-Time1755806148290.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"name":"THROWING PAINT","playParams":{"id":"1833057985","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/throwing-paint/1833057985","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4LIjsirtkdowvJezJBwCOy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833057985/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1479895581","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1479895581?l=en-US"},{"id":"666060823","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/666060823?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756467383820,"RTCI":0}}},"1833067380":{"id":"1833067380","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833067380?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Panter Bélico","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/panter-b%C3%A9lico/1633626628","artwork":{"bgColor":"bfb977","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060708","textColor2":"030804","textColor3":"2b2a1e","textColor4":"292b1b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/03/59/71035985-0441-3695-68fb-4b11cf3d69d4/196873519968.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"110808","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e6cbb0","textColor2":"edc398","textColor3":"bba48e","textColor4":"c09d7b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/98/f4/7d/98f47dbe-96ea-c2d6-a701-e24631c2c308/35c4789e-4cf0-4452-b37a-98d966237dc9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"From corridos to romantic fare, his solo journey continues.","standard":"Roughly a year after <i>CORAZÓN ERRANTE</i>, Panter Bélico returns with a dozen more songs that continue his impressive solo artist journey.

Robust corridos like “Coordinando Gente,” “La Gallada Pesada,” and “Los Fietes” share space with romantically inclined fare “Colombiana” and the Chuyito team-up “Amor De Locos.” A credit to his chosen genre, he conveys the gravity of cartel life on “El Primero” before immediately switching to the deeply heartfelt “Que Emoción.” While much of the album centers around him, the back half contains a number of notable collaborators who add to the proceedings’ charms. Gabito Ballesteros makes for a worthy foil on “MONTHS,” a wistful acceptance of love’s loss experienced over time.

LA rapper contemplates grief and the strength of community bonds.","standard":"As an integral part of Southern California’s bountiful, diverse rap scene, D Smoke knows how important community is. These tight relationships inform his 2025 LP, <i>Wake Up Supa</i>, which reflects the strength of his neighborly bonds within the context of grief and trauma; the project is also a journal of the Inglewood spitter coming to terms with the death of his mother. On the opening title track, Smoke observes how tragedy can take “the wind out the whole city.”\n\nThe line may be about a number of significant deaths that have occurred in the city, or it might simply be about the collective grief from his friends and family after he lost his mom. Regardless, there’s a comfort in this openness. Even during his lowest moments, D Smoke finds support in the strength of his bonds. Take the triumphant, uplifting “Chin Up,” which finds the rapper imploring anyone going through it to keep pushing. It’s advice for anyone struggling, but also for himself: “And even if you get knocked down right when you get up, better keep your chin up.”","tagline":"New

Griselda Records don builds up his 4th Rope empire.","standard":"Though Westside Gunn’s attention these days seems largely focused on growing his 4th Rope pro wrestling brand, he can’t seem to stay away from the mic in 2025. With two new releases already under his championship belt, as well as noteworthy collabs with the likes of Doechii and JID, the auspicious arrival of <i>HEELS HAVE EYES 2</i> ensures that Griselda’s head honcho stays inextricable from the year’s rap conversation. \n\nWhile the kayfabe-centric series’ initial installment featured no less than WWE’s Ted DiBiase on its cover, this considerably lengthier sequel swaps in Virgil, another iconic in-ring figure whose memorable late-’80s/early ’90s storylines had him either aligned or at odds with the Million Dollar Man. Such choices reflect the world-building his fans have come to expect from him, and returning producers like Conductor Williams and Denny Laflare on deck reinforce the lineage this project plays in his wider discography. Its title reflecting the titular superstar’s shocking bad-guy turn, “HEEL CENA” finds Gunn canonically shrouded in villainous boasts and deeply jazzy vibes. The gloomy “GLOWREALAH” calls back to several thematic hallmarks in his lyrical mix, while “MANDELA” brightens things up without sacrificing his signature fixations. \n\nA handful of Griselda familiars come through with fly verses of their own, from veritable veteran Benny the Butcher on the ominous “POWER HOUSE HOBBS” to the more recent affiliate Brother Tom Sos on “AMIRA KITCHEN.” Both narco rap go-to Stove God Cooks and Buffalo mainstay Eastside Flip feature on “BRIKOLAI VOLKOFF,” the former with a profane hook and the latter with a characteristically freestyle coda. And as for that parting Hulk Hogan homage on “LOVE YOU PT. 2,” you know Flygod had to do it. \n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"HEELS HAVE EYES 2","playParams":{"id":"1834589867","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-28","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heels-have-eyes-2/1834589867","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7oXDJH6q9NOxB0QyOiG4ko"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834589867/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829760702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829760702?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756476396530,"RTCI":0}}},"1834886306":{"id":"1834886306","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834886306?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Key Glock","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/key-glock/1199258326","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f09b66","textColor2":"e28b63","textColor3":"c68258","textColor4":"bb7555","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e6/55/46/e6554678-cc50-fb0d-82a1-9be43cdeff27/198704688249_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"222222","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1bd95","textColor2":"f39b6b","textColor3":"c79e7e","textColor4":"c9835c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e3/4c/a3/e34ca3e1-d614-5a39-b688-1e4c9fcdb335/e493ba20-492f-40d2-aedb-c5f82d2bb017.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A stack of new tracks packs out a special edition of the rapper’s 2025 LP.","standard":"There’s a short list of things South Memphis rapper Key Glock never finds himself without: Money.

The mood on the expanded edition is grown and sexy and reflective but still down to turn up, from the Evelyn “Champagne” King-sampling “Drop Your Love” to “This Right Here,” on which CiCi recruits a verse from Latto and a beat (and some familiar ad-libs) from Jazze Pha, who produced her earliest hit (“1, 2 Step”) 21 years prior.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"CiCi (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1834972515","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-25","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cici-deluxe/1834972515","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Ty7FKJeL2TyYDccUl9JyC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834972515/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"14317116","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/14317116?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756468927141,"RTCI":0}}},"1834998924":{"id":"1834998924","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834998924?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Luis R Conriquez","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luis-r-conriquez/1252271456","artwork":{"bgColor":"180d27","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cf9de1","textColor2":"f04cdf","textColor3":"aa80bc","textColor4":"c53fba","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/21/66/73/21667324-8450-ee4a-7d7b-7a4a9889cfec/196873543963.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b8b6bc","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b0f10","textColor2":"2f221e","textColor3":"2e3032","textColor4":"4a403d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c9/1e/e3/c91ee3e8-1a1f-4178-b347-3d0b41fd50ee/a84a83c8-700c-417e-8a12-38a0c55fd04c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Corridos Bélicos star boldly diverges from all expectations.","standard":"With his <i>Corridos Bélicos</i> album series and countless collaborations with many of the genre’s leading lights, Luis R Conriquez became one of the most ubiquitous Mexican artists of the 2020s. With <i>Meneo</i><>, however, he casts off música mexicana’s stylistic restrictions to try his hand at a variety of other forms. These forays into hip-hop, reggaetón, and more may strike some of his die-hard fans as odd. Still, as more and more of his peers push into sounds beyond the ones that brought them fame and fortune, the move seems worth the strategic risk, especially given the quality of these results. From the thumping Anuel AA collab “Relojito Cartier” to the far funkier “Beliwestcoast” with Esau Ortiz, he executes at such a high level that even his haters might have to concede. Notably, he dabbles in dembow on a few different occasions here, including with Dominican stars El Alfa and Chimbala on the title track and the like-minded Victor Mendivil on “Wanda.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"name":"Meneo","playParams":{"id":"1834998924","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-28","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/meneo/1834998924","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Kf6rAG1vw7aPVdygnZEHp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834998924/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1252271456","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1252271456?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756467554793,"RTCI":0}}},"1835576492":{"id":"1835576492","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835576492?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Eminem","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eminem/111051","artwork":{"bgColor":"8d053d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"faa706","textColor2":"fda10b","textColor3":"e48611","textColor4":"e78215","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/43/17/1a/43171a1a-be7d-faf4-b8e3-75a0e0c8b181/25UM1IM24229.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"320011","gradient":{"color":"320011","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e4991e","textColor3":"da9c15","textColor4":"c67a1e","textGradient":["ffffff","e4991e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2a/27/24/2a2724f2-c5c4-d1c6-f01d-ef726d19defc/Jobc8c6bafb-1e6f-4cde-b056-46db3808e02f-201269277-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393860293_2310286061-Time1756267304331.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"320011","gradient":{"color":"320011","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dc9012","textColor3":"d28d17","textColor4":"c57415","textGradient":["ffffff","dc9012"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/39/cd/eb/39cdeb55-0f1d-fd4c-c87f-3346d050c93c/Jobbdd7f9c8-f3c3-409c-8d03-7b5221f8bf76-201269276-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393860052_2310286062-Time1756266108520.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"eaa928","textColor2":"e09622","textColor3":"be8a23","textColor4":"b77b1f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f2/4d/21/f24d2176-c222-f40a-ba4c-2246b2059d11/47711e91-12f2-45a1-ad3c-7ca553df3b8f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"040407","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ccd5da","textColor2":"c0cacd","textColor3":"a4abb0","textColor4":"9aa3a5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8c/36/e6/8c36e66d-84e6-75fd-4d9e-92288c2c161d/922f595c-2bef-4338-b611-af98b4247933.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The doc’s soundtrack features the first release of “Stan” in Spatial Audio.","tagline":"New Soundtrack"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"STANS (The Official Soundtrack)","playParams":{"id":"1835576492","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-26","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stans-the-official-soundtrack/1835576492","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5DV2liMHX5AqtiLqy3Qu1b"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835576492/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"111051","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/111051?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756476470028,"RTCI":0}}},"1835726721":{"id":"1835726721","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835726721?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joey Bada$$","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joey-bada%24%24/577261450","artwork":{"bgColor":"dfe0e0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"2e2c23","textColor2":"382b25","textColor3":"515048","textColor4":"594f4b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/87/05/04/87050482-1f16-8d12-9038-eb015dac5e46/196873464527.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“This thing is a competitive art form.” The Pro Era spitter returns.","standard":"False narratives about the so-called decline or demise of New York rap have cropped up so often over the past two decades that, to one of the city’s hip-hop natives, it can feel downright conspiratorial. So it couldn’t have come as much of a surprise that someone like Joey Bada$$ would eventually step up to address the current iteration of this tiresome talking point. After all, the Pro Era figure made his name by both reveling in and refurbishing the hometown sounds of the golden age, building with his crew while seeing his own star rise. \n\n“This thing is a competitive art form,” he tells Apple Music. “For people who’s really passionate about this and passionate about moving that pen, we understand that.” His 2025 opening move “The Ruler’s Back” and its subsequent rap ripostes “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Pardon Me” made his position known and, on some level, put him at perceived odds with certain Los Angeles denizens. “I believe I’m at my best when I’m feeling the heat of another pen,” he says, explaining how the perceived rivalry fueled his craft.\n\nBut regardless of any animosity or gossip generated amid that back-and-forth, it all led to the release of <i>Lonely at the Top</i>, a mixtape that fully transitions the <i>1999</i> rapper into his present era. The Chuck Strangers-produced opener “DARK AURA” provides a proper reintroduction, leading swiftly into the confident alliance of Joey with Westside Gunn on the ornate “SWANK WHITE.” In line with the flexibility of the project’s format, the beats sometimes surprise, as with the R&B groover “3 FEET AWAY” and the Neptunes-esque throwback “SUPAFLEE.” Yet even when he’s in more familiar musical territory on “HIGHROLLER” or the Statik Selektah-helmed “BK’S FINEST,” he never sounds stale. \n\nNYC pride pervades the project, occasionally amplified by locally sourced guests like A$AP Ferg, Rome Streetz, and Pro Era pal CJ Fly. Given Joey’s lyrical swipes at the West Coast that led to this moment, the presence of TDE mainstay Ab-Soul on “STILL” seems less like a conciliatory olive branch than a slightly subversive act of artistic solidarity, one made even more meaningful by Rapsody’s concurrent feature. “I mean, I’ll say we was trolling, but we had to show people that you can do this,” he says. “And it could be love afterwards—and during, even.” \n","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Lonely At The
