London’s rock disruptors recorded the follow-up to 2022’s <i>Supernova</i> in Vermont with producer Rich Costey (Foo Fighters, Muse, LINKIN PARK), but they started writing the bulk of it at home. “We always go into sessions with more ideas than too little,” says bassist Georgia South. “We thought, ‘We don't care what people think about it, we’re just going to write how we feel that day and push ourselves in places where we’ve never gone before and not question it.’”\n\nDespite two hit albums, plus Mercury, MOBO, and BRIT nominations under their belts, the feeling of not quite belonging hasn’t gone away for Nova Twins. Perhaps it’s a good thing: Georgia South and Amy Love—who met as teenagers and crafted their unique sound that’s unafraid to bounce across genres—bring their own energy and do things their way. “I think it still feels like we’re outsiders, and I wonder if we’ll always feel like we’re the underdog trying to climb to the top,” says South. “When you try and do something different and you look different to the old social norms, you’re always going to feel like that. We try to open the door to as many people as we can and show people a different way. You don’t have to look or sound like what’s trendy, and you can have your own voice, your own sound, and it can work for you with resilience and persistence. We’ve always had this weird sense of thinking anything’s possible.” Read on as Nova Twins take you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Glory”</b>\nGeorgia South: “This was the last song we wrote. It’s euphoric and ethereal and it sounds quite different from what we’ve done before. We were exploring themes of chaos and beauty, and I feel like it has that juxtaposition where it opens up with this ethereal, glorious chorus and then just smashes with the chaos. It sums up the album really well as an opener.”\nAmy Love: “<i>Supernova</i> was very much a time where we had to fight and be strong. With this one, I think we had time to reflect and then talk about it. We’re exploring a slightly more honest side, and people can hopefully relate to some of it.”\n\n<b>“Piranha”</b>\nAL: “The world feels like a scary place, so we wanted a song that reflects on the times and embodies that tension, but also flips it on its head. There’s power in numbers, and if we unify, we have a bigger voice. ‘Piranha’ is a song for strength, but it also touches on the murky waters and what we’re going through right now.”\nGS: “Violence against women is continuing, especially with trans women at the moment in the UK. We definitely feel proud that this album’s empowering women and that when we step onstage, they can feel our energy and they exchange it right back at us. It’s always beautiful to see women at the front screaming and going for it and feeling their power in that moment.”\n\n<b>“Monsters”</b>\nAL: “I feel like at some point or another, your mental health will challenge you, whether something in your life has caused you trauma or you realize something about yourself. Everyone can relate to that. When we write, we’re always looking inwards or at what we’re feeling that day, hoping that it will reach our audience in a meaningful way. We were chatting to Sade’s producer Robin Millar, who’s amazing. He was reflecting on the song and he was like, ‘You can be the strongest person in the world, you can be the fastest person in the world, you can be the smartest person in the world, but this controls everything. It doesn’t matter and you can get in the way of yourself.’ It’s definitely a point of reflection and growth, and there’s something freeing about that song.”\n\n<b>“Soprano”</b>\nGS: “I think ‘Soprano’ is part of the beauty on the album. It’s like the light and joy, and we wanted to definitely have moments like that. It’s all about female solidarity, women coming together and having this girl gang. I think in this industry, people love to pit women against each other and make people feel like shit on the red carpet. It’s ridiculous. In life, women love to huddle together and confide in each other, finding friendship and strength. So this song is to celebrate that.”\n\n<b>“Drip”</b>\nAL: “We both came up with the tune. G sent this really cool drum-’n’-bass-style music that was so high in energy and so sassy. I got it and I started spitting some lyrics on it and we tweaked it together. The world’s heavy, yes, but we’re still young girls and we like to have fun. We enjoy exploring our sexual nature, understanding our bodies, and we’re definitely growing in that sense as well. When we’re on tour, we’re so disciplined: We don’t drink and we have to stay focused to be able to perform the type of show we do. So when we get home, the odd now and then, we want a blowout and just have one of those ratchet nights.”\n\n<b>“N.O.V.A”</b>\nGS: “We really wanted our audience to feel included, so this is for them to sing back with us. Amy’s lyrics are really cool—it’s a testament to both our heritages and exploring who we are. It felt like a celebration, and I think it’s going to be a massive party when we play it live.”\nAL: “As we grow, we’re understanding balance a lot more. If you have the most euphoric experience, there’s going to be a comedown, and if you feel really, really low, there’s only one way you can go. I feel like we’re both darker people probably by nature, but we love to laugh, so this is about having that balance. The album started off a bit dark ’cause that’s how we were feeling, so we were like, ‘We should pull ourselves out of this. Let’s just inject fun, the stuff that we love to do and the simple things in life that bring us joy.’” \n\n<b>“Sandman”</b>\nAL: “Surrealism and escapism are very important. You need to switch off. Sometimes you just want to dip yourself into another world. And sometimes in that world, you deal all the cards. In Nova’s world, we generally like to be the power and the strength.”\nGS: “I think the theme of the album came from this song. We took the title <i>Parasites & Butterflies</i> from the lyrics. We did think of other titles for the album. One was <i>The Bridge Between Beauty and Chaos</i>, but we were like, ‘How are you going to abbreviate that?’”\n\n<b>“Hummingbird”</b>\nAL: “I find this song quite difficult to talk about. I’ve lost my mum and my nan, and they were the people who raised me, and I wanted a song that paid homage to them. Me and Georgia came up with this beautiful song that explains how you feel after grief. Loads of people suffer with loss, and that can be the loss of a relationship as well. It’s about that point after grief and you’re missing someone, but also accepting it and seeing the beauty in them being at peace. Death is a taboo in the West, and we’re all going to experience it at some point. The more we open up about it, maybe we can find solace in each other’s experiences and not feel so isolated when it happens.”\n\n<b>“Parallel Universe”</b>\nGS: “This is about the internet. It’s a dark place and there are corners of it where we think, ‘Don’t look at the comments.’ I’m training myself to not go on Instagram in the morning. It can be really toxic. When you look at young children who have accounts and there’s bullying in schools because of social media, it’s out of control and I don’t know how we can backpedal. Luckily, when we grew up, it wasn’t so massive to be online all the time. We actually got to go to the park after school and hang out. So we want to make people aware of how online bullying can affect anyone. Even if you seem super confident, one negative comment can still come into play and you have to shut them out and drown them out because they’re just being stupid.”\n\n<b>“Hide & Seek”</b>\nGS: “This is about one of those relationships where you’re playing cat and mouse with this intense love, but also you have resentment, and you keep flicking between the two. And neither one of you is the enemy at all, you’re kind of equal. At some point you have to just decide whether you have to let each other go or not, because you do love each other, but you’re hurting each other at the same time.”\n\n<b>“Hurricane”</b>\nAL: “This is another one about strength. There’s obviously a generation of men who prefer women not to be strong, but we’ve come so far, we want careers, we want more than just what was offered to us. As we start to get into those places and those positions, sometimes you do feel like some men can be intimidated. I guess there must be strong men out there. It’s quite funny ’cause I’ve recently had a breakup. I was like, ‘Am I too strong?’ Georgia’s always like, ‘You need a confident man.’ If someone can’t handle this, then I’d rather be alone. But a stay-at-home husband would be great—he can water the plants while I’m on tour.”\n\n<b>“Black Roses”</b>\nGS: “I don’t remember at what point we wrote this song, but we juggled it to put it at the end of the album ’cause we thought it’s a big tune. I think it’s sassy and quite Halloween-y. The ending is very epic, so it’s a good way to wrap up the album as well.”\nAL: “It definitely has that kind of sass: We’re leaving the black roses everywhere and infiltrating places. I guess in this context it does sound like a relationship when someone messes you over. But I feel when we were writing it, it was probably a bit more than that, like, ‘We’re here whether you like it or not.’ And it’s such a nice little sassy number just to finish off on.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Parasites & Butterflies","playParams":{"id":"1780402904","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/parasites-butterflies/1780402904","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5uRq9tAqhsULMA35OL37Uk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780402904/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1118452716","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1118452716?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757061837623,"RTCI":0}}},"1801556941":{"id":"1801556941","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801556941?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tallah","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tallah/137058200","artwork":{"bgColor":"bab8bf","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0a0f","textColor2":"1f1b26","textColor3":"2f2d32","textColor4":"3e3b45","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/89/de/2d89dec6-612b-bc90-80d7-ec39f6eb3cff/5055006571318.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Death Metal/Black Metal"],"name":"Primeval: Obsession // Detachment","playParams":{"id":"1801556941","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/primeval-obsession-detachment/1801556941","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7nrRaUQM4WWS9MoZytJoZH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801556941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"137058200","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137058200?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757042082068,"RTCI":0}}},"1802736479":{"id":"1802736479","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802736479?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"CMAT","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cmat/1506697965","artwork":{"bgColor":"f5f3ed","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"37221d","textColor2":"27273f","textColor3":"5d4c47","textColor4":"504f62","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4e/66/2b/4e662be1-06af-1cae-0078-a271530691d3/199350041914.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ea3826","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000311","textColor2":"030410","textColor3":"2f0d15","textColor4":"310e14","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/28/b3/1f/28b31f89-2501-65d2-bd53-4804574443f4/0972c3a9-1734-4148-8382-00cd82286fea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"CMAT on her third album: “I had a hard time making it, but I’m so proud of it.”","standard":"Watching the pure joy of Glastonbury-goers doing the Woke Macarena to CMAT’s anthem “Take a Sexy Picture of Me” at her 2025 performance might make you think Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson is having an easy time being a pop star. But the story behind her third album, <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i>, released two months later, suggests otherwise.\n\n“I didn’t think I was going to make another record so quickly, and when all these ideas started landing, I knew I needed to do this before I could do anything else,” CMAT tells Apple Music of the follow-up to 2023’s <i>Crazymad, for Me</i>. “It was a very hard album to make for a number of reasons, and it’s a very heavy subject matter. What we were trying to pull off was so difficult that I had a really hard time making it. But that being said, I’m really proud of it,” she says.\n\nIt’s a big album. While “Take a Sexy Picture of Me” provided the perfect—and well-deserved—pop crossover, complete with viral TikTok dance, CMAT was keen to stay true to her roots and go “full country” on songs like “When a Good Man Cries.” CMAT recorded the album in New York, addressing themes of grief, loss, and “the ambition to be bigger and more important than you currently are,” both in terms of herself and her native Ireland. “In general, I have to work on things on the road when they’re in their infancy,” she says. “But place-wise, I think this album was born of grief and loss and sadness and stuff, and things being put into perspective for me in a way that they hadn’t been before. All of this suffering I endured making it, and now I’m bearing the fruits.” Read on as CMAT talks through <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i>, one track at a time.\n\n<b>“Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy”</b>\n“I definitely needed something to open up the record that wasn’t my voice. A lot of this album is criticizing Ireland, which is something I love more than anything else in the world. So, I wanted something that captured my love for it and to show people I wasn’t coming from a snotty place. One day, I randomly came across a documentary, and this scene happened. Billy Byrne is about to free a lot of pigeons, and this is a phone call that he makes from a telephone box that’s in the middle of a beach. He sums up everything that I love about Ireland: its weirdness, its beauty, and its warmth.”\n\n<b>“EURO-COUNTRY</b>\n“‘EURO-COUNTRY’ is a bit of a Frankenstein song—I wrote bits of this years ago for a completely different thing. I knew the album was going to be called <i>EURO-COUNTRY</i> and then I thought, ‘I’d love a title track for this record.’ Usually, it’s the other way around. The line ‘I feel like Kerry Katona’ came because I have a real fascination with beautiful blondes who are destroyed by the press. I’ve written about Princess Diana and Anna Nicole Smith in the past, and I think Kerry is another one of those women that was rinsed by the British press, completely fucking unfairly. I really do admire her, and I think she’s very strong.”\n\n<b>“When a Good Man Cries”</b>\n“I’m really glad the way those two songs run into each other. That’s one of the most successful bits of the album. I needed to go full country immediately, so everyone knew what the record was. This is me going in on myself because I made an ex-partner cry. He hadn’t done anything wrong. There’s this thing in third-wave feminism, which is, I feel, now outdated, where women should be like men. Making a man cry is turning a trope on its head. I repeat ‘Kyrie Eleison’ [‘Lord have mercy’] over and over again at the end, which is a reference to my favorite song of all time, ‘The Donor’ by Judee Sill, in which she’s begging God for another chance to become a good person.”\n\n<b>“The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station”</b>\n“‘The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station’ is a meditation on irrational hatred and intolerance. It’s based around me getting annoyed every time I saw a poster of Jamie Oliver because when we were on tour, we’d eat a lot of sausage rolls from his branded delis. I don’t actually have any beef with Jamie Oliver, so I’m kind of like, ‘Ciara, you need to stop being a bitch. He’s got kids.’ And then there's a stream-of-consciousness section in the bridge where I’m going through my own history to try and figure out how I became such a bitch. I think it’s good to be self-critical—I don’t think anyone should ever rest on their laurels when it comes to kindness and their capacity for it. We should all be trying way harder.”\n\n<b>“Tree Six Foive”</b>\n“This song has been around for two years, and it used to be called ‘365,’ but there’s a little artist called Charli xcx who released a song with the same name, which is enormous. So, I was like, ‘I can't call it that, so I’ll just call it what it is in my phonetic spelling.’ It’s about looking back on my history again and thinking about a time where I made the decision to try and not to be treated badly anymore. I wanted it to be a proper flashback of a song. Even though I don’t have these feelings anymore, it’s a former version of myself that’s doing bad foreshadowing. A stupid song written by a stupid person to illustrate the person that I used to be, I guess.”\n\n<b> “Take a Sexy Picture of Me”</b>\n“If I’m making an album that is so much about capitalism, the cruelty of the modern condition, and how lack of community has made everyone be an asshole, I had to do one song where I was like, ‘I have also been a victim of this.’ The thing that had been rattling around in my head the most was last year, when we were doing festivals, and there were all the comments being nasty to me over my physical appearance and my weight. I remember saying, ‘Let’s make this the most accessible-sounding, biggest, fattest pop song so that loads of people are forced to listen to the most uncomfortable lyrics I’ve ever written.’ Under no circumstances did I think it was going to go anywhere near as big as it did, with Julia Fox doing a little TikTok dance to it, but I knew it would pop off in some way.”\n\n<b>“Ready”</b>\n“A lot of people in my life really loved this song, but I didn’t know how I felt about putting it on a record because it felt too optimistic and poppy. And I still don’t really know how I feel about the song, but I really like the place that it occupies in the record. It’s about somebody who is giving up after a period of complete stagnation. I wrote it in a COVID-y time. I’m saying I’m so bored of having depression that I’m going to do something self-destructive but fun because I don’t care anymore.”\n\n<b>“Iceberg”</b>\n“This is a song about my best friend Bella. It’s funny, we’ve been best friends since we were 14, and I’m a pop star and she’s a lawyer. She’s the most studious, hardworking person in the world. When she got her job which she’d worked towards her whole entire life, I saw the pressures of this ambition and this full-time work completely beat her down for a while. And she started to go in on herself. I found it really funny that she thought that I wouldn’t know she was suffering. This is the thing in female friendships that I think is so beautiful—you cannot pull the wool over my eyes. I know who you are. There’s a joking line in the beginning of it where I’m like, ‘Where did you go, crazy girl boss?’”\n\n<b>“Coronation St.”</b>\n“I wrote bits of this when I was 23. Leaving something to sit and marinate in one form for seven years is something I like doing, so it’s like I’m in collaboration with a former version of myself. It’s about jealousy, being stagnant, and feeling like I didn’t get everything I thought I was owed by life. I wanted to capture that deadness and feeling of having nothing happening in your life and really double down with hindsight just how harrowing it was. I used to do a weird job managing and cleaning apartments in Manchester, and one of them overlooked the set of <i>Coronation Street</i>. I found it mad that it was fake buildings. I was like, ‘Wow, even Coronation Street’s not real.’”\n\n<b>“Lord, Let That Tesla Crash”</b>\n“Weirdly, this is the least profound song on the record. It’s about loss. My friend died, and I had to write the story of us in it because it was the first time I lost someone I was really close with. You make friends with people without thinking much about it, just enjoying their company. And then, when they’re gone, you realize what the point of them was. I only realized how much he meant to me when he died, and so much about his death annoyed me. I felt quite stupid being a touring musician/pop-star person because I was like, ‘What's the point in this?’ And then, I went to see the flat we both lived in together, and there was a charger and a Tesla parked outside it, and I remember being so angry about that.”\n\n<b>“Running/Planning”</b>\n“I wasn’t going to bring this song to the studio, but we made a draft of it in one night, which sounds almost exactly the same as it does now. It was so instinctive and so immediate. This is another song about ambition, drive, and the downsides of it. I was thinking about how there’s a treadmill of life that you get on when you’re in a heterosexual relationship. You date for a couple of years and then you get engaged, get married, and then you have a baby and live the rest of life. There’s a transactional element to romantic relationships that muddies something that’s otherwise quite beautiful. And also, societal pressures to conform. With conformity comes the weird prejudices against people who don’t [conform]. Carving your own path and going against it makes your life so hard.”\n\n<b> “Janis Joplining”</b>\n“‘Janis Joplining’ is a name I’ve given to being self-destructive. What’s weird is that’s not what the song’s about. I just thought it was a good line. Maybe it’s a bit salacious, but I had a crush on a guy who was married, and I realized a lot of it was born of seeing him and his wife interact with each other. Actually, what I was longing for was the community they had formed and their intimacy. It ends the record because after everything I’ve just spoken about, what I want is this egalitarian relationship and to comfortably talk intimately with everyone in the world, and if I can’t have it, then I self-destruct and go Janis Joplining. I wanted to end on a note that sounds like I think I have a solution to all the problems I’ve just spoken about for 45 minutes.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Indie

viral Toronto glam rockers embrace goth romanticism.","standard":"“Heartbreak, gold mine,” Jordan Miller sings at the start of “Touch Myself,” a paean to irrepressible desire that appears partway through The Beaches’ third full-length album. And with those three words, she provides a perfectly succinct snapshot of The Beaches’ trajectory since 2023, when the viral post-breakup anthem “Blame Brett” thrust the Toronto band into the Top 40 pop charts on both sides of the border. With <i>No Hard Feelings</i>, The Beaches continue to navigate the emotional minefield of young-adult love with their sense of humor and candor intact. \n\nBut if their early releases saw them rocking out with ’70s glam swagger, <i>No Hard Feelings</i> casts their fine-tuned pop sensibilities in an ’80s goth romanticism, with the shimmering guitars and yearning hooks of tracks like “Touch Myself” and “I Wore You Better” hitting the heretofore untapped sweet spot between Robert Smith and Taylor Swift. And where The Beaches’ breakout single was about trying to move on from a relationship, <i>No Hard Feelings</i>’ emotional centerpiece—the synthy soft-rock stunner “Lesbian of the Year”—is a bittersweet account of leaving your past behind completely, with Miller giving voice to keyboardist/guitarist Leandra Earl’s experience of coming out. \n","tagline":"New

duo on their fourth album: “We were afraid of making a dance tune.”","standard":"<i>CHOROPHOBIA</i> means fear of dancing, something that Dutch duo Weval admit to suffering from when they were younger. But it’s an anxiety that Harm Coolen and Merijn Scholte Albers conquered for the release of their fourth album, the follow-up to 2023’s <i>Remember</i>.\n\n“We said to each other, ‘Let’s make a dance record,’” Scholte Albers tells Apple Music. “Before, we’d never dared do it and always made ‘listening’ records. But we got a lot of energy from the idea and the creative process became way more fluid.”\n\nIt’s definitely a dance record, with 11 tracks that veer from “MOVEMENT,” which evokes the spirit of 3 am at a 1990 rave, to the synth-heavy hypnotizer “HEAD FIRST,” before smashing everyone’s resolve to sit down with the KILIMANJARO-featuring wig-out “OPEN UP THAT DOOR.”\n\n“We were always afraid of making a dance tune, and we wanted to see if we could change up the process,” says Coolen. “All our previous records were made with unlimited time and we loved that, but instead of looking at a track for three years, working on it almost every month to see if it gets any better, we found an urgency in our writing. For the first record [2016’s <i>Weval</i>], we only had one synthesizer and now we have so many tools and friends and vocalists to reach out to.”\n\nThe sense of urgency was, in part, brought about by Scholte Albers’ packed schedule. While making the album, he was also writing, directing, and scoring his first feature film, <i>Straf</i>, which he describes as “dark, but full-on comedy.” As if that wasn’t enough, they directed the video for “OPEN UP THAT DOOR” themselves. “I think that week was super crazy because we had to finish the record on Monday, produce the music video and shoot it on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, we played fabric in London,” says Scholte Albers.\n\nRead on and don’t be afraid to dance as Weval takes you through each track on <i>CHOROPHOBIA</i>.\n\n<b>“CHOROPHOBIA”</b>\nMerijn Scholte Albers: “I think we finished 90 percent of the record, or maybe we thought it was 100 percent finished, and I played these chords on the piano just for fun. We thought it would be nice to have an element of the fear in the record, and then Harm plugged in the mic and started singing with this crazy granulator machine, with super weird delays.”\nHarm Coolen: “We’re admitting that we’re a little bit afraid of dancing, so we wanted to lean into that fear. It was funny that multiple people noticed the sound at the end and said, ‘Did you sample “Toxic” from Britney Spears?’ Sometimes, you think nobody listens to our own little nerdy stuff, and then suddenly people notice all those little details.”\nMSA: “Let’s make it clear: We didn’t sample Britney Spears.”\n\n<b>“MOVING ON”</b>\nMSA: “This was one of the first tracks when we realized we wanted to make the more cheerful, outgoing dance stuff. We talked about the BPM being an average of 125. I played this track in the slower tempo and then we sped it up and it sounded so funky. And Harm started singing on it. It was such a fun process and I think you can hear that. There are so many elements because we were like, ‘Oh, this is also nice. This is also nice.’ We had this whole studio built, but those parts are from my phone. We put it in the analog synths and then it sounds super rich and layered. But it all started with just a phone app. That’s a nice thing with the record: it’s really cheap stuff combined with rich analog synths.”\n\n<b>“MOVEMENT”</b>\nMSA: “This track has a bassline which we took from a very old track of ours, ‘The Most,’ and then it was played live. So we pitched it and re-edited it, but then we played it in clubs with only the bassline, with the kick drum underneath and it always worked because it’s such a happy beat. I love how the drum sounds—I’m proud of the snappiness of it. Sometimes, you create a drum track and then you still have to polish it. But I also discovered that if you choose the right samples, you don’t have to mix the hell out of it.”\nHC: “Because we’d been playing it in the DJ sets, we realized we should finish it—and not in a subtle, calm way. We kept that energy. So this was a good example where the people on the dance floor told us to put it on the record.”\n\n<b>“JUST FRIENDS”</b>\nHC: “This was a funny one. I was pretty busy running the ship on the days when Merijn was shooting his movie and I’d make music in the evenings. Instead of approaching it like work, I treated it like playing a video game. I had this habit of spending evenings on the couch, starting new songs with no pressure. And I started this little idea of playing with the chords, but it was 11 pm and I wanted to go to bed. My phone wasn’t around and I almost left it, but I grabbed it and the first thing I subconsciously sing is the lyrics of this song. We used the little recordings from that iPhone and dubbed them with a proper mic. The next day, Merijn said, ‘Oh, you made something super nice.’ And I said, ‘Huh? Is that so?’”\n\n<b>“HEAD FIRST” (feat. Nsanshi)</b>\nMSA: “We had this really funny session with KILIMANJARO because he arrived at the studio and he brought his brother, Michael [the artist/producer Nsanshi]. Harm immediately gave them two mics and was blasting instrumental tracks, and they were going for it. We recorded three hours of crazy stuff and there was this small bit of a fun, shouting thing from his brother. Because we’ve never made tracks with those kind of vocals, we immediately got super energetic.” \nHC: “When Josh [KILIMANJARO] and Michael came over, it was like they were playing a sport together. Michael gave all the energy and we said, ‘Cool. Let’s take this and build something around it.’”\n\n<b>“DOPAMINE”</b>\nMSA: “This one started when I finished all the shooting days for the movie and I was exhausted, so I took some time off, but then I felt itch to go to the studio because I didn’t make music for a long time.”\nHC: “A long time—that’s a month for you. I think when Merijn started this initial idea, we did more DJ sets again and we felt that wild energy during them. But it’s such a nice form of wildness. We were reinventing what we wanted to do in our DJ sets because we tend to love super chill, mellow music. Then we had the idea of bringing more of that bold wildness into our studio process. ‘DOPAMINE’ has such a dry-sounding hook, it has a sort of comedy element to it.” \nMSA: “I saw Jamie xx playing it in a big stadium, and that’s super nice that a track like that goes to a lot of places outside of our life and DJ shows.”\n\n<b>“THIS IS…”</b>\nHC: “This is such a fun little ingredient to kick off the second round. The first time I flipped the vinyl, I didn’t know which side I chose because I didn’t look at it, but I heard the beginning of ‘CHOROPHOBIA’ and I was like, ‘Oh yes.’ This is the B-side.”\n\n<b>“BETTER”</b>\nMSA: “When we’d finished the demo for ‘BETTER,’ we thought it was a super joyful, groovy, dancey, disco-y vibe, so we said, ‘Let’s go for it.’ I always saw it as one of the tracks that really fits on this concept, without knowing that we were going to make ‘DOPAMINE,’ ‘HEAD FIRST,’ and all this other stuff.”\nHC: “This was a good example of us wanting to get out of our comfort zone and write with other people, which was exciting. I went to [singer-songwriter] Richard Orofino’s apartment in New York and we wrote for two hours straight. It’s cool to learn so much about writing with other people. Merijn and me are used to going so deep into the rabbit holes, which I love, but it was cool to be with a stranger saying, ‘Let’s try to make a song after an hour.’ Merijn took that demo to the US and remixed it into this more funky—and better—track we have now.”\n\n<b>“OPEN UP THAT DOOR” (feat. KILIMANJARO)</b>\nMSA: “This was some of the most fun we had in the studio with KILIMANJARO and it’s also inspired by DJing. I think he actually sang this hook on ‘DOPAMINE,’ but we loved it so much and we thought it was such a fun vocal to play around with that we made it into a new track. It had the gibberish kind of singing from his brother underneath the whole track, which was so groovy and fun to hear.”\nHC: “We always wanted to make a music video and with this song, KILIMANJARO’s delivery and the lyrics, we came up with the idea. What if it’s about the fact that you’re afraid of dancing? The character has an extroverted side when he’s talking and then suddenly it becomes a dance party and he has a problem. We collaborated with a friend of ours, Bear Damen, who made videos for James Blake and [Benny Sings with] Mac DeMarco. For us, it was a full-circle moment to make this little film, and it was so heavy in terms of time because Merijn still had his movie to finish, but we’re really glad we did it.”\n\n<b>“MERCATOR”</b>\nMSA: “This track is an ode to the place where we had all these house parties in Mercator Square, Amsterdam. We play it live at every show now, so that’s a sign that it works on the dance floor and we get so much back from the audience when the kick and the snare drops. It’s a bit more on the emotional side, but that’s why we started making music—when we went to clubs ourselves more than 10 years ago, we experienced the feeling of having goosebumps while dancing.”\nHC: “Mercator Square was a hub where all our friends just could ring the door and step in. We wrote a part of this record based on this picture of a friend of ours preparing for a house party. He’s DJing in a silly setup, with one hand on a bag of chips and the other on this old-school computer mouse selecting songs.”\n\n<b>“FREE”</b>\nHC: “This track also started on that couch and I wrote it with my phone. I thought the initial vocal lines sounded a bit R&B-ish, but a bit cheesy with my voice. The lyrics aren’t the most abstract, but it didn’t really work with my vocals so we asked Megan de Klerk, who’s a friend of ours, to give it a try. We had her input on the vocals as well as the lyrics and ended up with more of that ’90s feel. The reference for it was that song from <i>The Beach</i>, All Saints’ ‘Pure Shores,’ You can’t bring everybody on tour, but I’m up for getting a new spin and trying it with Megan on stage where we can. I’d 100 percent love to dive into this again.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"CHOROPHOBIA","playParams":{"id":"1811689083","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chorophobia/1811689083","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Hqy5F2Bny4NmVvc40XN69"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811689083/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"606587384","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/606587384?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757049415288,"RTCI":0}}},"1812522836":{"id":"1812522836","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812522836?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"shame","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shame/1245798125","artwork":{"bgColor":"fc9603","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"180100","textColor2":"2c0800","textColor3":"451f01","textColor4":"552501","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/fb/ed/71fbedd8-bde3-bc95-a6a9-db259e94cb99/54238.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","gradient":{"color":"0a0a0a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"3b0102","textColor3":"3d1e00","textColor4":"611f02","textGradient":["ffffff","3b0102"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fa/d2/51/fad251d7-aa37-3031-c33f-e5f2c72ccd7b/Jobd712ef54-8bce-430d-a1c1-74bde7947b33-194688192-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381424444_2202565427-Time1749761401306.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","gradient":{"color":"0a0a0a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fc7f02","textColor3":"d1c4c7","textColor4":"d66602","textGradient":["ffffff","fc7f02"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3d/89/72/3d8972b9-c6e5-d2aa-58a0-4f2e42f02777/Jobb595601b-b468-4d78-9256-cb3b4fdd03ca-194688191-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381424443_2202565428-Time1749760103634.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e5be73","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"2b1b0f","textColor2":"312818","textColor3":"503c23","textColor4":"55462a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fa/ba/90/faba90a4-3572-3be9-5a67-17ac99bc26ec/a7c8cf27-4dbf-4183-9722-9340c7398f4e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Urgency meets adventure on the rock experimentalists assured fourth album.","standard":"As one of a few shouty, abrasive, angular bands coalescing around Brixton live venue and rehearsal space The Windmill during the late 2010s, shame found themselves being ushered into a pigeonhole. Alongside the likes of Squid, black midi, and Black Country, New Road, they were heralded as the new wave of post-punk by a UK music press and A&R industry keen to have uncovered the next fertile scene. Wisely, the five-piece did their best to elude those strictures on the follow-ups to 2018 debut <i>Songs of Praise</i>. But reflecting on 2021’s <i>Drunk Tank Pink</i> and <i>Food for Worms</i> (2023), records that benefitted from ideas drawn from psych-rock, folk, jazz, and even singing lessons, shame began to wonder if some of their urgency had been thinned out. As a result, <i>Cutthroat</i> arrives with the band’s horizons still broad but their sound revitalized.\n\nThe title track, with its combustion of riffs and groove, and the agitated polemic of “Cowards Around” captures the bracing, confrontational energy of the band’s live shows. It’s an opening salvo that establishes the vim and efficiency with which they go on to try out rockabilly (“Quiet Life”), the cockeyed but melodic sound of early Pavement (“Plaster”), sing-along indie pop (“Spartak”), and a collision of Portuguese folk, disco, and New Wave (“Lampião”). Against this absorbing backdrop, singer Charlie Steen muses on just how conflicted and paradoxical the human condition is. And he does it with a little more self-assurance and a bit less vulnerability and doubt than before. “Well, you can follow your fashions/You can follow your cliques/And I feel sorry for you/For feeling sorry for me,” he declares on “Spartak.” <i>Cutthroat</i> is the sound of shame continuing to explore their sound—and arriving somewhere increasingly unique.","tagline":"New

songs that find the band—now a trio—in a state of ragged intimacy.","standard":"After the stylistic sprawl of 2022’s <i>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You</i>, Big Thief’s sixth album finds the group bringing their increasingly distinctive sound closer to the vest in a literal sense: <i>Double Infinity</i> is their first album as a proper trio, following the departure of bassist Max Oleartchik. As a result, these nine songs—woolly, warm, and with frissons of electricity coursing through their veins—capture Big Thief in a state of ragged intimacy, every melodic turn and shift in instrumentation expanding and contracting like a pair of lungs. \n\nThe rumbling drum fills and strummy framework of “Words” seemingly stretch for miles on end, while the nearly seven-minute “No Fear” carries a faint gothiness in its inky guitar lines that drip around Adrianne Lenker’s bruising vocals. More so than on any other Big Thief album to date, rock music is the name of the game here; even “Grandmother,” which features ambient legend Laraaji lending vocal incantations, bursts and blooms in a manner not unlike what was coming out of the 1970s Laurel Canyon scene.

The former BRITs Critics’ Choice winner has hit a prolific patch since becoming an independent artist, with his fourth album in five years. He’s gaining new fans on TikTok, opened for Billie Eilish (a fan of his 2024 album <i>Black Friday</i>) on tour in 2025, and delivered a self-assured tribute to Brian Wilson at Glastonbury a few weeks before this release. But dig deeper into his lyrics and there’s a mass of vulnerability, self-doubt, and sadness at the world.\n\nThe willingness to bare his soul has led to a deep connection with fans—underlined by the continuing viral success of his 2012 debut single “Another Love” and 2023’s “Black Friday”—and <i>A Wonderful Life</i> finds Odell at his most authentic, even if he still doesn’t love the mid-thirties version of himself. “I’m standing in the mirror/I want to change my skin/Wish that I was taller/Wish that I was thin,” he sings on the early Radiohead-esque “Ugly.”\n\nWritten on tour in 2024, <i>A Wonderful Life</i> is a snapshot of a hectic period in which Odell balances the messy business of life on the road with love and friendship. There’s a nod to a pre-gig burnout on “Can We Just Go Home Now,” where he’s determined to carry on despite his ills: “Call the doctor up to my hotel room/You see I’ve lost my voice, I’m in a very bad mood/Give me drugs, give me a drip, give me a 20 minute’s rest.”\n\nBut the show does go on and by the time Odell reaches the album’s closing track, the Leonard Cohen-inspired “The End of Suffering,” there’s a glimpse of light coming through the curtains. “It’s good to see the sun,” sings Odell, suggesting that life might still be a little bit wonderful after all.","tagline":"New

songwriter completes the third of his four-part recovery.","standard":"John Butler’s first attempt at making <i>PRISM</i> took place five years before it was finally finished. The process broke him to the point where he gave up. “I hit a bit of a stumbling block,” he tells Apple Music. “I couldn’t complete it, for probably more personal and spiritual reasons than ability. I had to walk away. I had to surrender.”\n\nIn the background, Butler’s personal and professional lives were going through seismic changes. His two-plus decades marriage of more than 20 years to Danielle Caruana, aka singer-songwriter Mama Kin, had hit turbulent waters. Their respective fathers passed away during COVID within 40 hours of each other. His band, the John Butler Trio, was also in a state of flux. When Butler finally stepped back from <i>PRISM</i> and took time to sit and contemplate everything that was happening around him, he started to see a way through. “I had an epiphany: four seasons as a way of building back to something,” he says. “The seasons were ‘heal yourself,’ ‘begin again,’ ‘go solo,’ ‘band.’”\n\nThe “heal yourself” component saw him fulfill a long-held ambition of making an ambient album with 2024’s <i>Running River</i>. The “begin again” season followed with a 2024 instrumental busking EP called <i>Still Searching</i>, a sequel of sorts to his first busking release, 1996’s <i>Searching for Heritage</i>. Having regained his confidence via these projects he approached the third season, “go solo,” by trying to complete <i>PRISM</i>. (The “band” season, he thinks, will see him reunite the John Butler Trio.) On his first ill-fated attempt, he was determined to do everything himself, but this time around, he enlisted the services of producer James Ireland (Pond, San Cisco) to engineer and collaborate. “He’s such a great beatmaker, and I love rhythm and beats,” says Butler. “There were already a shit ton on what I’d been doing, and he just made them better and added his own flair.”\n\nThe duo began building songs around Butler’s guitar percussion, layering beats, synths, and guitars over the top, a musical bed on which the singer could purge the devastatingly raw emotions and events of the previous few years. Here, Butler walks Apple Music through the turmoil and hope of <i>PRISM</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Going Solo”</b>\n“I remember being in an alley, crying. I was in a bit of a dark place. Things were changing. My band was changing, the players wanted to move on. My marriage had reached an expiry date, and in order to renew we had to fill out new contracts, basically, and we weren’t ready to. We didn’t know what we wanted. My dad and my father-in-law both passed away during COVID. So there was all this movement taking place. And ‘Going Solo’ was a bit like, ‘I’ve gotta step back, listen to what’s going on,’ and at the same time, throwing your hands up to the sky and saying, ‘I’m really scared.’ You’ve come to this mid-life moment where everything reevaluates. It’s like, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Going Solo’ is about that.”\n\n<b>“King of California”</b>\n“Things were looking pretty south [for] my wife and I. We went in [to marriage] with the best of intentions, but we were kids. And we’re not as perfect as we thought, and we thought we’d be so much better than our parents. But [it’s saying], ‘That aside, you’re really great, I really love you, and we’ve been on a ride, and we might have to recontract this union, but I still want to do it with you. You’re still my main queen, you’re the person I want to grow old with. But holy shit, didn’t we just have a time.’”\n\n<b>“Gets No Better” (with Dingo Spender)</b>\n“I went out bush in the Pilbara by myself and stayed under the stars for two weeks straight. It’s about being on that beautiful country and celebrating it and going, ‘I’m so happy to be right next to this fire. Not next to a phone, not next to all the bullshit that’s going on in this world, but just to sit next to the simplest element and love up that country and have that country love up you.’”\n\n<b>“So Sorry”</b>\n“I don’t think any of us go through marriage without doing something we regret. There’s also like, ‘Hey, have we forgotten who we are?’ It was written at a time where you’re like, ‘What the fuck happened? You’re an amazing woman, why can’t I see you? And I know I’m a good man. Why are we struggling? We were so boggled. We were trying so hard.’ Somewhere in amongst it you’re like, ‘I’m sorry. I love you heaps. I’m so sorry for what’s happening to us, I’m so sorry that when I say that or try to meet you there, it triggers you. And I know you’re really trying to help and I’m feeling unmet and I don’t know what’s happening.’ It was written in that desperate stage.”\n\n<b>“The Way Back”</b>\n“I was lucky to be one of the busier musicians during COVID. I was in the Blue Mountains, I was with my recording gear and just watching the world vomit on its chest. Watching the anti-vax conspiracy, BLM, post-#MeToo, Trump—it was like, ‘Fuck, this world is having a go at all the things at once.’ And I couldn’t not write about it. Then just going, ‘There’s something really kind of beautiful about COVID. Everybody’s shoulders dropped for a second.’ It felt like, ‘Oh God, that was crazy—can we stop this?’ And this sense of ‘How do we get back to something that is pre-fake news? I want to go back, but not back to the patriarchal, colonial, systemic racism world. But where the fuck are we?’”\n\n<b>“Doing Just Fine”</b>\n“It was right in the middle of COVID. I got asked to be on the Vax the Nation website and sign my thing to that, and I didn’t. Not because I was against vaccinations, I just didn’t want to tell people what to put in their body. I was vaccinated. The haters online were just cranking up. All of a sudden it was like I’m working for the government, and they’re all like, ‘You’re on that website!’ ‘Look on the website, I’m not on it!’ Never talk to a troll. So there was a sense of ‘Are you with us or against us?’ To me it was like, ‘I’m going to get vaccinated, you do what you do, but don’t ask me to fucking fly your flag or get on your side. I’m not taking a side. Your sides are both fucked.’”\n\n<b>“Hand in Mine”</b>\n“It made sense in the stark reality of all the things I was coming to terms with. Amongst all that fray and confusion, can somebody just hold my hand? Don’t give me any answers. You won’t be able to answer it for me, ’cause no one can answer this. Amongst this little storm, just hold my hand.”\n\n<b>“Trippin on You”</b>\n“There’s a certain time in a marriage, usually a few years after the kids are born, where all of a sudden, you look at each other one day and you’re like, ‘Why don’t I know you?’ Or, I have all these memories of you, they’re like stories I’ve put on top of you. The classic ones are, why didn’t he realize that dinner needed to be made? Why didn’t he realize the clothes needed to be washed? He’s not looking, he’s not dependable. I’ve learned to be dependable and think about those things, but [I’m] still being seen that way. We keep old memories, we don’t refresh the new memories. And that’s tripping on somebody. You have to go, ‘Hey, we’ve been running from old programs on each other that are obsolete. We’d better do a refresh of where we’re at because we’re tripping.’”\n\n<b>“Outta My Head”</b>\n“Some philosopher once said, ‘Man’s greatest threat is not ecological destruction, it’s not political decay, it’s not economic collapse, it’s global insanity.’ We’ll actually lose our minds. That’s going to be the biggest challenge now.”\n\n<b>“Let Yourself Go”</b>\n“Traversing the conflicted paradox which is my relationship with my father. Loving him so much and learning so much from him, and also being on the receiving end of a lot of trauma and violence over the years. It’s tragically sublime taking care of someone during their death. At the same time, dealing with the aftermath of all this stuff that’s left behind.”\n\n<b>“Leave the Rest to Earth”</b>\n“James Ireland’s father passed just after we finished that song. Dan’s father had passed, my father had passed. Dealing with that profound thing—oh, people just go. When you lose someone close, you’re pretty existential about what this is all about, and I could be gone tomorrow and what am I doing today? You get pretty deer-in-the-headlights. It’s just kind of dealing with all that. Just really settling in, almost in a stoic way, to I shall die one day.”\n\n<b>“Wings to Fly”</b>\n“I did that song a lot playing solo around the world—it’s on the [John Butler Trio’s 2023] <i>Live in Paris</i> album—but it never made it to [a studio] album. And I really thought it deserved to. I was like, ‘I wonder if I could write a song about climate change without saying climate change. How can I write about this without sounding cringey? How do I cover all its complexities and duality and hypocrisy?’ And this came out. It’s a real sign of our times, where we’re at now, and it’s my job to document what’s going on in me, but also what’s going on in the world. It felt like a song for now.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter","Folk-Rock"],"name":"PRISM","playParams":{"id":"1815393815","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/prism/1815393815","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7hs6LrNQDVwx1e0pwamcIZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815393815/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"481119179","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/481119179?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757035393451,"RTCI":0}}},"1816027264":{"id":"1816027264","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816027264?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"David Byrne","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/david-byrne/47192943","artwork":{"bgColor":"d8b37e","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"0d0c09","textColor2":"312254","textColor3":"352d21","textColor4":"533f5c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9a/5b/61/9a5b6137-db99-8501-4f54-ad7524a88454/191401217873.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"061409","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"fdf736","textColor2":"fff353","textColor3":"ccca2d","textColor4":"cdc644","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0f/4a/0a/0f4a0af0-0209-ad6a-7f07-79d7b91e8331/Jobca3e2eb0-b252-4dcd-a59f-7fee882c97c5-194496216-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381032210_2198694571-Time1749564019692.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"400b07","gradient":{"color":"400b07","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fcec2e","textColor3":"d0c552","textColor4":"cfbf27","textGradient":["ffffff","fcec2e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2e/b3/ef/2eb3ef7d-01da-194a-11b0-508cba0077a0/Job5eafda2c-e602-4417-a222-a7e37df1d703-194567981-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381179632_2200162356-Time1749650233666.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4f0e26","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e1aebd","textColor2":"ccab9f","textColor3":"c48e9f","textColor4":"b38b87","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/25/bd/e5/25bde514-3750-640d-73e5-d24258669e0e/20479ced-6fd0-4472-a21b-715b5109ccf7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Naked, life-affirming joy from a creative polymath and American treasure.","standard":"David Byrne’s last album, 2018’s <i>American Utopia</i>, wasn’t merely an album: It was a sprawling multimedia work that encompassed music, a stage show, and a film that captured the magic of its performance. In fact, it was so sprawling that its chronology even includes a lengthy period of dormancy, between opening on Broadway at the end of 2019 and restarting in 2021 after COVID restrictions were eased. “During the pandemic, of course, I wanted to write new songs, but I felt like what was happening was bigger than anything I could write about,” Byrne tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of that unexpected gap. “And I didn’t quite know how to address it.”\n\nWhile the songs that make up his eighth album under his given name, <i>Who Is the Sky?</i>, recorded with the musically elastic Ghost Train Orchestra, aren’t directly a product of that time, there are threads and themes that trace back to it. “I realized that some of these new songs are coming out of that,” he adds. The most obvious is probably the ode to his living quarters “My Apartment Is My Friend,” where Byrne ruminates on how intimate that physical space has become. \"So forgive me if I hesitate, if a tear comes now and then,” he sings. “You stood by me when darkness fell/My apartment is my friend.”\n\nByrne has always had a gift for making the specific, and even the fantastical, seem universal. “Moisturizing Thing” plays like a Hollywood sci-fi, starring Byrne himself, in which he tries an anti-aging skin treatment only to turn into a toddler, forcing him to see the world through another’s eyes. He’s constantly asking more of himself in these songs: He questions a smiling religious teacher who’s gorging himself on hors d’oeuvres (“I Met the Buddha at a Downtown Party”); he ponders the place he’s been put in history (“The Avant Garde”); he wonders how his wife just understands things so naturally (“She Explains Things to Me”); he sees life in cycles of happiness and pain, searching and resolution (“Everybody Laughs”). And he does it all with the playfulness, grace, and naked, life-affirming joy of a musical elder statesman who has never lost his curious, creative spark.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Who Is The Sky?","playParams":{"id":"1816027264","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-is-the-sky/1816027264","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5xDqZQlSx2gRrAyAgHQ8AB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816027264/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"47192943","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/47192943?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757061782470,"RTCI":0}}},"1816045714":{"id":"1816045714","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816045714?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hexrot","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hexrot/1666004140","artwork":{"bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"deda71","textColor2":"bfcc7d","textColor3":"b2af5b","textColor4":"9aa465","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/88/8a/4a888a22-1aa8-c896-414d-695004a3a9fa/612789665709.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Formless Ruin of Oblivion","playParams":{"id":"1816045714","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/formless-ruin-of-oblivion/1816045714","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6DrLIqp6nLktzNAeMZmanD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816045714/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666004140","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666004140?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1756405318800,"RTCI":0}}},"1816985643":{"id":"1816985643","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816985643?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Glenn Hughes","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/glenn-hughes/932047","artwork":{"bgColor":"081511","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d5d4d2","textColor2":"bfc6cb","textColor3":"acaeac","textColor4":"9aa3a6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/0c/8a/710c8a4b-1bd7-c65c-7931-d97417e27dd7/199350770845.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"cbbaab","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1e1310","textColor2":"33211b","textColor3":"41342f","textColor4":"514038","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/3a/05/8a3a05e1-2c51-2faa-91da-1ce0af6f0b1f/977b3866-781b-4c30-b664-51a3a3c207e1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"name":"Chosen","playParams":{"id":"1816985643","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chosen/1816985643","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Yupd5WiayJOgjYNfN5HZC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816985643/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"932047","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/932047?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757046093068,"RTCI":0}}},"1818148533":{"id":"1818148533","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818148533?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jord","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jord/1441043590","artwork":{"bgColor":"11110f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cdb1b0","textColor2":"d1a197","textColor3":"a89190","textColor4":"ab847b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8e/ae/02/8eae02eb-2782-e89b-13f6-6063526ab724/8715392254741.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Emellan Träden","playParams":{"id":"1818148533","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/emellan-tr%C3%A4den/1818148533","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2VSIqhK48xB0qFIMlUF8yq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818148533/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1441043590","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1441043590?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757046603551,"RTCI":0}}},"1818559851":{"id":"1818559851","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818559851?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kingdom of Giants","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kingdom-of-giants/416846306","artwork":{"bgColor":"0e0d15","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"bac1df","textColor2":"aeb2ce","textColor3":"979db7","textColor4":"8e91a9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0b/fc/d6/0bfcd6a9-d84f-a6f6-bf97-ed4f398e2712/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Burning Chrome -

The country sensation’s debut album, 2024’s <i>Cold Beer & Country Music</i>, earned Top an ever-growing legion of fans, who love the Washington-born singer-songwriter’s traditionally informed, ’90s-tinged sound and his undeniable chops as a singer and player. On this sophomore outing, Top loosens up his approach, dipping into the sunny sounds of Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney while celebrating living the life he’d dreamed of as an aspiring singer-songwriter. “With this record, it’s like I’ve lived a little more, and so I have a little more to say,” Top tells Apple Music. “There’s just a little more depth to it, I think. It goes a couple layers deeper than the first record, which I love and I’m very proud of it. But I think there’s more meat on the bone with <i>Ain’t In It for My Health</i>.”\n\nLead single “Good Times & Tan Lines” splits the difference between Buffett’s beachiness and Alan Jackson’s no-frills twang, with blessedly traditional production from Top’s longtime collaborator Carson Chamberlain that puts fiddle and steel front and center. Other highlights include the tequila-soaked heartbreaker “Flip--Flop,” which shows off Top’s playful sense of humor, and closing track “Honky Tonk Till It Hurts,” a love letter to country music with shades of ZZ Top (no relation). Below, Top shares insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Between the Ditches”</b>\n“My parents have been very supportive, but definitely aren’t shy about telling me I’m being an idiot if I’m being an idiot. So, there’s that. I’m close with all my siblings, and very thankful to have good relationships with all of my family. Then I’ve got some good old friends that knew me before, who haven’t changed their attitude toward me because of any sort of success and whatnot.”\n\n<b>“Flip--Flop”</b>\n“With anything that’s kind of like a goofy song, it is a fine line where it starts to get way off into cornball/cheese world. So [I like] having a song that actually says a little something still but can have that humor. I’m very sarcastic, try to be funny, cutting up, joking all the time.”\n\n<b>“South of Sanity”</b>\n“I played a couple shows with Red Clay Strays. We’d already done our show and they were going on after us, and I was supposed to go up and do a song with them. I got a call with some bad news and I was sitting over on the side of the stage or standing in the wings, one song left, and then I was going out, and I’m trying not to bawl my eyes out. Then it’s like, ‘Put your phone back in your pocket, take a drag on a cigarette, and let’s go sing.’ Where it started, I had a marriage that didn’t work out. When I first moved here I was married, and yeah, I messed that up. So that’s part of that song too.”\n\n<b>“Lovin’ the Wrong Things”</b>\n“When you’re dreaming about [making] it, you’re just thinking about the bright lights and the thousands of people that are out there. And that’s such a small fraction of the actual work. Your schedule can get out of hand, you can get run into the ground and worn out and then start looking for a way to cope with it, I guess. A lot of times there’s a lot of options that aren’t necessarily terribly healthy. Free drinks all night up on the stage until you realize it don’t help you sing and play. I think that’s a perfect representation of, I assume, what I feel like a lot of young artists do. They catch a little success, then all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Holy cow, we’re lit. There’s no rules.

disco-tinged pop that oozes self-deprecating charisma.","standard":"Sabrina Carpenter spent the decade after her debut single, 2014’s “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying,” patiently finding her voice. Her persistence finally paid off in 2024, when the absurdly catchy singles “Espresso” and “Please, Please, Please” launched the former child star into a whole new realm of pop stardom. Her sixth album, August 2024’s <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>, reintroduced the pint-sized singer as a sharp-witted diva with a honeyed voice and a fondness for campy innuendo—and earned Carpenter her first two Grammys (Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Solo Performance).\n\nJust over a year after <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>’s release, the biggest breakout pop star of 2024 fires off its follow-up, <i>Man’s Best Friend</i>, which carries on her streak of concise 12-track records that draw from her love of ’70s disco and ooze snarky, self-deprecating charisma. “Oh, boy,” Carpenter chuckles to begin lead single “Manchild,” which taps the usual co-writers (Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen) for a country-tinged ode to the incompetent, unavailable men she can’t seem to shake. \n\nRomantic disappointment prevails, though the 26-year-old maintains her sense of humor as she wishes an ex a lifetime of celibacy on “Never Getting Laid” and drunk-dials old flames on the twangy “Go Go Juice.” Steeped in the nostalgic sounds of her heroes (Dolly Parton, the Carpenters, ABBA, the Bee Gees), Carpenter’s lyrics approach the drudgery of modern dating with a wink and a well-timed dirty joke. “I promise none of this is a metaphor,” she sings on the New Jack Swing-inspired “House Tour,” then she carries on: “I just want you to come inside.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Man’s Best

there’s a deeper purpose to dance music, it’s escapism,” says the DJ.","standard":"“I think the difference between a ‘producer album’ and a ‘singer-songwriter album’ in the traditional artist sense is that you’re really trying to bring people into a feeling,” SG Lewis tells Apple Music. On his rapturous third studio album, the DJ/producer invites the audience to share in an emotion he has been experiencing for as long as he has been listening to and making music—albeit one he only recently learned there was a word for, after spending a summer immersed in the history of Ibiza. “In a lot of the music I make, I like to make references to different time periods or different eras of music, and I was kind of like, ‘What is the reason that I feel drawn to these different eras that I wasn’t a part of?’ It’s not nostalgia, because I wasn’t alive for it,” he says. “Is there a term for feeling nostalgia for something you haven’t experienced?”\n\nThe term Lewis was searching for would became the title of the record: <i>Anemoia</i>. Building on the idea of Ibiza as “a partying promised land, where all the shame and all the shackles of society didn’t exist,” he rendered the concept as a dream-within-a-dream-like reimagining of nightlife on the island during the ’90s. “I was pairing these nostalgic sounds that are very familiar to people, and are classic in a sense, with songwriters and voices and stories that are modern—but then also trying to find a through line in the production that tied those things together into what I interpreted as the sound of anemoia,” he says.\n\n<i>Anemoia</i> may keep a longing eye on the past, but the idealized fantasies conjured by tracks like the wistfully haunting “Feelings Gone” or bubbling rave anthem “Devotion” capture just as much of the current cultural moment—something Lewis was conscious of preserving as the record began to take shape. “If there’s any kind of deeper purpose to dance music, to me, it’s escapism,” he says. “Retrospectively, I want this album to create the feeling of anemoia for people who perhaps weren’t around or weren’t old enough to experience clubbing now, and the sound of the album and things I’m drawing on are all very escapist because there’s a lot of reasons to feel scared and worried about the future. I’m trying to create a sonic world people can escape into, or soundtrack their escapism and deliver them from whatever hardship they’re facing. That’s the mission.” Read on to find out more as he takes us through <i>Anemoia</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Memory”</b>\n“I knew that the word ‘anemoia’ is not a familiar word. I didn’t know what it meant before I Googled it, and also that no one knows how to pronounce it. So I wanted to build a track that was like a sonic introduction to the world in which the album was going to inhabit, but then also be able to put on some audio that would introduce people to the concept of anemoia because it was not self-explanatory. The whole purpose of ‘Memory’ is just to introduce people to the feeling of the album—the euphoria, and this kind of bittersweetness, the chords, the sound—and also the literal concept.”\n\n<b>“Feelings Gone” (with London Grammar)</b>\n“For years I had this instrumental that I’d started in LA with my friend, J Moon. It was something that I was playing in DJ sets, and it had this feeling which was like bittersweet, but also the build of it and the drums having a slightly Balearic feeling to them. It was the first thing I made that I was like, ‘Oh, this is like the sound of the album…’ But the only voice I could hear on it in my head was Hannah’s [Hannah Reid of London Grammar]. There’s a depth to her voice and her songwriting that adds such emotional weight. Sometimes, dance music, especially pop dance music, can feel disposable but I just felt that Hannah and the band would really create a track that had depth. Rather than referencing what was happening in ’90s Ibiza, ‘Feelings Gone’ is my projection. If I was looking at those photos, what’s playing in my head?”\n\n<b>“Sugar” (with Shygirl)</b>\n“Shygirl and I started this song on the same day that we started ‘mr useless,’ which was a song that we did for her project [2024’s <i>Club Shy</i> EP]. So we had this other demo and I got Shygirl down and we finished off the song structure and stuff, and then TEED [Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs] added the synth line. We really wanted ‘Sugar’ to feel like one of those 2000s Hedkandi, ’90s trance, super-pop dance records where they’re just like an overflow of serotonin and joy—for every decision to be very bright and very pop.”\n\n<b>“Transition” (with RAHH)</b>\n“The summer that ended up making this album exist, I spent a lot of time in Ibiza and I played Pacha I lot. It’s the oldest club on the island, it has so much history. There’s a sound of Pacha and it’s this 2000s, super-compressed drums, funky basslines, French Touch—I wanted to create a song that is a nod to that. I’d heard RAHH on a couple of records so we got together, and she’s an incredible songwriter. She is able to deliver these vocals that have the power and soul of a classic house vocal, but it’s not delivered in a way that feels like pastiche. A lot of the album leans more into that kind of bittersweetness. I love that feeling, but when I sat back and listened to everything, I wanted a record that did the opposite. ‘Transition’ is a call to arms, the kind of dance record that I play out at peak times.”\n\n<b>“Devotion” (with Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs)</b>\n“TEED is one of my best friends in the world, but he still remains a musical hero of mine. He is someone I get a lot of help and advice from, so it only felt right to have him collaborate on the album. This was an instrumental we started together. We tried a bunch of different ideas and vocals, and eventually, I was like, ‘Why don’t you just sing on it?’ It’s very euphoric in a classic ’90s piano house way. When I think of acid house and the UK rave movement scene, I think about those ’90s rave piano tracks. It doesn’t matter where you are or how long you’ve been playing, when you reach that piano breakdown, the sound of those beats coming in provides such a moment of lights-on euphoria.”\n\n<b>“Past Life”</b>\n“This is really a breather in what is otherwise a very dance-oriented album. In any album or extended format like this, I do think that a change in tempo is a relief. So I wrote this hook that induced a sort of dreamlike state. The whole thing is supposed to be from the perspective of someone dreaming about another time in the past and what that might’ve been like. Just creating a moment of reflection and a sonic change from the pace and euphoria of the rest of the album.”\n\n<b>“Back of My Mind”</b>\n“I use my vocal in a way that is a lot more direct and front-on than I have done in the past—there’s less reverb, less effects—and I think that there’s a story and a deep emotion to it. All my favorite club music has that element. Whether it’s Robyn, ‘Dancing on My Own’ or Kings of Tomorrow, ‘Finally,’ those songs are designed for the club and an environment that’s very hedonistic and kind of momentary, but they have a depth and a story, and I think that gives them the longevity and the purpose. The initial idea was less dance-y—it came from listening to Radiohead, the verse was very meandering, kind of like Thom Yorke, trying to be cool—and it was like the euphoria got added and it got beefed up. Now that I’m playing it live, I can see people connecting to the lyrics. I hadn’t heard that phrase used in a dance record but it’s a very universal feeling.”\n\n<b>“Another Place” (with Frances)</b>\n“Frances is a long-term collaborator of mine, we went to university together. She’s primarily a songwriter now, and we did some great songs for this record, but she’s so musically gifted and has the most incredible vocal so I asked her if she would feature on this. I really wanted to create the end-of-night, 4 am, sort of slight comedown, emotional breakbeat song. The ‘Think’ break [the much-sampled drum break topped with ‘Woo! Yeah!’ from Lyn Collins’ ‘Think (About It)’] is sampled in this. I wanted to trigger that feeling of anemoia for people who aren’t tuned in to the names of different breaks where they’re like, ‘Where do I know this from?’ and because it’s such an iconic break and so synonymous with rave and dance music, the ‘Think’ break does that for a lot of people. I think that’s a fun emotion to play with.”\n\n<b>“Fallen Apart”</b>\n“I wrote the original six years ago, very quickly, after someone that I worked with really hurt my feelings. It was like a note that I’d written down, just like, ‘I’m not going to forget that’ and it sat on my hard drive for ages but there was never really a home for it. I played it to TEED, and we spent a day working on it, beefing it up and turning it into what it became. It’s funny because it sounds like a romantic breakup song, and I think, eventually, I changed some of the lyrics to allow it to resonate in that way, but it really came from a platonic falling out.”\n\n<b>“Baby Blue” (with Oliver Sim)</b>\n“I met Oliver in LA when I was working on this record and we did two sessions—one for my album, one for his. We didn’t come away with songs we wanted to put out, but we immediately got on well. I had this instrumental I’d worked on with my friend Karma Kid, and we just spent a day trying to make these end-of-night, disco-edit kind of instrumentals. I found this sample, Wess Machine, ‘Hard Luck’ and the intro just had this two-bar loop. I resampled it and added elements to it, made it work in a modern club setting. I sent it to Oliver, and he was out but said, ‘Give me five minutes…’ Five minutes later, he sends a voice note and he’d written the hook. He was like, ‘I just went in the toilet and wrote this.’ I was gobsmacked. So then he came down to my garden and we recorded it. Wrote a little verse and it was done. His voice is so warm and rich and beautiful. He’s a very special human being.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"name":"Anemoia","playParams":{"id":"1820217693","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anemoia/1820217693","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3kse3e9XxmIedJb9bfjErH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820217693/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"966324292","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/966324292?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757079108747,"RTCI":0}}},"1821237733":{"id":"1821237733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821237733?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joni Mitchell","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joni-mitchell/203373","artwork":{"bgColor":"1b1720","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"e99894","textColor2":"d99988","textColor3":"c07e7d","textColor4":"b37f73","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/ee/08/cbee08cf-589f-e13e-68e1-3c6cc5a3554d/603497811090.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A massive self-portrait of Mitchell’s most fluid, exploratory side.","standard":"Joni Mitchell fell in love with jazz as a teenager—in particular, the sound of Miles Davis’ trumpet. “Miles Davis taught me how to sing,” she said onstage in 1974. “Pure straight tones holding straight lines. The feeling when you sing and you open up your heart.” As much as we call her a folk singer (her acoustic guitar, her historical context), her music always felt more like jazz whether it sounded like it or not: the subtlety, the complexity, the privileging of personal freedom over the unity of (and accessibility to) the crowd. You could sing Neil Young at a protest or a campfire; Joni Mitchell, not so much.\n\n<i>Joni’s Jazz</i>, which starts with 1971’s “Blue” and goes on to present a non-chronological edit of album, live, and demo tracks going all the way up to “Summertime” from the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, is both a celebration of her music and an argument of sorts about it—namely that the “jazz” that drove the narrative around definitive but divisive albums like 1975’s <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> and 1979’s <i>Mingus</i> was actually a central part of her sound for most of her career and a driver of her creative legacy. (Of <i>Hissing</i>, she once joked that she “cut the jazzers some slack…and that was the kiss of death.”)\n\nThe irony of this progressive, often wild music is that it came out of a rejection of what at the time was considered cool. “I couldn’t get anybody to explain how this got to be hip,” she once said of her frustrations with the recording process in the late ’60s. “It wasn’t as good as the sound that went before.” Basic stuff, she meant—how drums sounded, the way a bass player arranged their part around her vocal melodies. “They would get exasperated, like I was ignorant,” she said. “Until one guy said, ‘Joni, you’re gonna have to play with jazz musicians.’” There’s an idea. \n","tagline":"New Anthology"},"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"name":"Joni's Jazz","playParams":{"id":"1821237733","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":61,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jonis-jazz/1821237733","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6lhaz5gTp1D1WQieSYmJqH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821237733/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"203373","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/203373?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757082639290,"RTCI":0}}},"1821352877":{"id":"1821352877","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821352877?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cut Copy","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cut-copy/7432761","artwork":{"bgColor":"e4e1da","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"101010","textColor2":"27351f","textColor3":"3a3938","textColor4":"4d5744","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c5/b1/7c/c5b17c9d-d7f6-cc68-a036-86b979832422/199350686856.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e3e2df","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"201e1c","textColor2":"313234","textColor3":"474543","textColor4":"545556","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e6/49/fc/e649fc08-0b2a-25a9-81a0-61cec1848958/a25052e6-5cce-4eca-beb8-1ff3560921f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Emotional and musical layers enrich this tender synth-pop.","standard":"Five years after 2020’s <i>Freeze, Melt</i>, Cut Copy has only grown more nuanced and self-reflective, with soft-sung leader Dan Whitford leaning into confiding closeness across <i>Moments</i>. That suits the Melbourne band’s warm, tender synth-pop, which can still flash back to their more extroverted past with selectively clubby touches. American singer Kate Bollinger lends dreamy guest vocals amid some weepy steel guitar on “Belong to You,” a track that balances melancholy and motion in a way that feels distinctive to Cut Copy. The like-minded “Still See Love” explores the stark duality between its peppy verse and pensive chorus, while “When This Is Over” taps a poignant choir of children and “Gravity” morphs its way through a slippery, suite-like structure. Yet, even when a song starts off mellow, the band often introduces some engaging new facet near the end, from the vocodered mantra closing the slow-burn title track to the burbling layers coming to a head during the final minute of “More Alive.” This album may be fairly low-key, but Cut Copy still knows how to hypnotize with sneaky hooks and quiet sincerity.","tagline":"New

Flip’s third album takes a neon-soaked trip back to the ’80s.","standard":"While writing the songs for their ’80s-indebted third album, G Flip (aka Melbourne-born artist Georgia Flipo) created a character to describe the essence of what they were striving for. “I would continuously say, ‘This song’s almost there, it just needs a little more Butch Springsteen in it,’” they tell Apple Music. “And it was my version of Bruce Springsteen—my lesbian queerness merged with a Bruce Springsteen delivery. It ended up being how I would describe what the record sounds like.”\n\n<i>Dream Ride</i> was born out of a fascination with the ’80s output of artists such as Springsteen, Madonna, Prince, Guns N’ Roses, and Whitney Houston, with G Flip reveling in the musicality, instrumentation (they bought a keytar and learned to play saxophone), and drum sounds of the era. “I wanted to build a world,” they explain. “I wanted to think about if I was in the ’80s what would I look like? What would I drive? Where would I go? Where would I work? So it was all a bit of this fantasy dream of me in the ’80s. And throughout every song I’d mention a lot of references to cars. I like how that filtered into the writing, ’cause it meant that I got to drive this really sick, 1970s hot pink Barracuda around in the music videos.”\n\nThough there is an element of fantasy and storytelling to songs like “Disco Cowgirl,” the album also draws on very real themes of loss (“In Another Life”) and the queer experience (“Bed on Fire”), set to a soundtrack of high-powered anthems (“I Don’t Wanna Regret”), dramatic power ballads (“Baby, I’m a Winner”), and skewed synth-pop (“Exactly What I Like”). Here, G Flip takes Apple Music back to the ’80s and through each track on <i>Dream Ride</i>.\n\n<b>“Disco Cowgirl”</b>\n“It felt like the perfect introduction to this new, ’80s-esque world. This song has got that fun drama of ‘Will I ever see my disco cowgirl again? Is she going to ride off into the sunset without me?’ This also shaped the color of the record. The song to me is that hot pink, neon, driving-through-Hollywood kind of vibe. I was making the record and driving between the studio and where I live [in LA], so there were a lot of late-night, 2 am drives. But this always felt like, ‘Let’s open the record with it.’ You hear the car pulling up right at the start, so the dream ride begins.”\n\n<b>“I Don’t Wanna Regret”</b>\n“This song is Butch Springsteen to a tee. Sometimes, I forget during a show, or just in my life, to take a moment to say, ‘Hey, G, you’ve done a lot of cool shit and you should be proud of yourself.’ And I wanted a song that everyone in the crowd could also feel like, ‘Hey, I need to celebrate as well—I bought that car and I got that job and I got the girl I was in love with.’ I wanted to shout out every single person in the room, and you can hear it lyrically from the get-go. I’m trying to include everyone to have this celebration moment during the show.”\n\n<b>“In Another Life”</b>\n“It’s the most deep and emotional song on the record. I really wanted a song about loss, but that has this edge of hopefulness that we’ll be together in another life, and I’ll be there with open arms and I’ll see you then. I didn’t want to make this emotional in a way that doesn’t have hope.”\n\n<b>“Bed on Fire”</b>\n“When I first slept with a woman it was such a bookmark in my life. There was this euphoria and this power like, ‘This is who I am and I’m going to shout it from the rooftops.’ There was also a little bit of anger [that] I’ve had to suppress so much of my life because I was taught it was wrong, or I’ll go to Hell, and so there was a bit of fire to it.”\n\n<b>“Cut His Dick Off”</b>\n“It’s so cruise-y and it’s such a vibe-y song and it doesn’t give off any aggression like the title does. I’ve grown up with friends who are dating someone who fucking sucks. And he’s bad. I find, with me and my mates, that if we’re talking about a friend we’re like, ‘I swear to God, if he ever does that to her again, I will cut his dick off.’ And it’s just this relatable saying that you say off the cuff, but I wanted to put it in a song and make it a title.”\n\n<b>“Baby, I’m a Winner”</b>\n“When we were making the record I was listening to a lot of hair-metal bands, but their ballads. It was such an era of these absolute rock-star-dressed men but they’re screaming in a slower tempo with a piano, and they’re doing these guitar solos that are long, and I thought it was so cool. I really wanted to make a record like that. It’s about fighting in a relationship. Baby, I’m a winner but I’ll lose to you. I’ll let you take this one. We don’t need to argue anymore. You win this fight.”\n\n<b>“Big Ol’ Hammer”</b>\n“This is the queerest song I’ve ever written. When we’d get tired or wouldn’t be having the best of ideas, we’d write a silly song. And me and [songwriter] Jesse Thomas were dancing around the lounge room and singing, ‘You make me feel like a man, goddamn, woo!’ And we were having fun and not thinking too much. But then we realized we couldn’t get it out of our heads. And when you’re writing three to four songs a day, if you can remember a song three weeks later, it made me be like, ‘Maybe there’s something in this song.’”\n\n<b>“Exactly What I Like”</b>\n“Definitely a Devo vibe. At the time, I was listening to a lot of Prince, and he would go into falsetto and do a lot of rhythmic stuff. I never do that, but I was a few drinks deep and thought it was funny, so I started going [sings the verse]. We were all like, ‘This is so fun.’ Instead of crash cymbals we used samples of fireworks going off; we got little dogs going ‘woof’ in the song. It’s a little batshit crazy. It’s just about, baby girl, that’s exactly what I like. You’re trying all this stuff and you don’t think I like it but it’s exactly what I like. It’s this cheeky, fun, playful, sexy song.”\n\n<b>“Lush”</b>\n“This is a very intimate, sexy, candlelight, bedroom kind of song. I was very inspired by Mk.gee and Dijon, who are not ’80s artists, but if you listen to Mk.gee’s records, he uses a lot of textures and guitar tones that are quite ’80s-inspired. This is the slow sex jam of the album.”\n\n<b>“Let’s Take This Show on the Road”</b>\n“I was trying to get a song that could be a wedding song on the record. We wanted warm, cruise-y, falling in love; timeless love. This song also reminds me of my parents. They’ve separated but they’ve fallen in love with new people and are growing old together. It feels like a song like you’ll grow old and be in love and you’ll find your person. It felt like the perfect way to end the record. You can hear at the end of the song the car drives away. And you’ve just finished the dream ride.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Dream Ride","playParams":{"id":"1821731879","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dream-ride/1821731879","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0jLgfhtSr2LTdQFWfi4VB0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821731879/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1101039433","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1101039433?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757078970378,"RTCI":0}}},"1822268984":{"id":"1822268984","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822268984?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Astronomical Telegram","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/astronomical-telegram/531476660","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f2e8cd","textColor2":"bfc5ac","textColor3":"c4bba6","textColor4":"9a9f8c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/23/b4/1e/23b41ee8-8a3f-8103-0d26-a5c97fdf479f/8718723292474.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"name":"Boyaca - EP","playParams":{"id":"1822268984","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/boyaca-ep/1822268984"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822268984/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"531476660","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/531476660?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757043094368,"RTCI":0}}},"1822526657":{"id":"1822526657","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822526657?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ten56.","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ten56/1556817098","artwork":{"bgColor":"acb3ac","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1d0000","textColor2":"2a0000","textColor3":"392322","textColor4":"442422","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/09/3c/8a/093c8aaf-5537-845d-35ca-79d94942734a/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"IO","playParams":{"id":"1822526657","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/io/1822526657","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2RJttoIphditrfgq3FEq3j"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822526657/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1556817098","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1556817098?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757052581798,"RTCI":0}}},"1823142720":{"id":"1823142720","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823142720?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Rob Thomas","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rob-thomas/217178","artwork":{"bgColor":"eae5d1","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"080809","textColor2":"0f0e0f","textColor3":"363431","textColor4":"3b3936","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f2/d1/dc/f2d1dc29-7191-cd72-67a9-747de19643d3/25UMGIM88771.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"33322f","gradient":{"color":"33322f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"140e0d","textColor3":"393835","textColor4":"3e3834","textGradient":["ffffff","140e0d"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/62/12/c8/6212c80e-c9d7-e9c1-8b4a-f4886364c470/Job5be7fcf4-3fe9-4fa3-ac1a-60106328bf5a-195901285-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_383733224_2226106339-Time1750994187398.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"33322f","gradient":{"color":"33322f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2f1c17","textColor3":"3b3733","textColor4":"54443c","textGradient":["ffffff","2f1c17"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e4/0e/f1/e40ef189-1b39-91d9-80be-1181badd55ea/Job7413f32e-6fe0-4043-8dfe-92600b3f0dc3-195901286-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_383733225_2226106340-Time1750995237326.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"e7e3d1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"121112","textColor2":"2a2524","textColor3":"3d3b38","textColor4":"504b46","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1f/a9/75/1fa97585-26ee-deb3-d303-bd656ba35423/86f77856-b39c-457f-9ec0-ecc12afc7207.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Matchbox Twenty leader yearns for the chaos of youth.","standard":"On Rob Thomas’ sixth solo album, <i>All Night Days</i>, the Matchbox Twenty bandleader yearns for the chaos of youth. The title puts the singer in that hazy early-morning light, in that half-sleep state after an all-nighter, before the body can figure out what time it is and why it’s been awake for so long. On the title track, Thomas cooks up a hard-charging drum groove and atmospheric synths that give way to a chugging guitar melody and pedal steel accents. He wishes to be wild for just one more minute, to approach life with the unabashed joyfulness of his youth. He admits it might be the booze speaking, but honesty always flows easier with inebriation. “Picture Perfect” is a throwback cut, featuring drum sounds from ’80s synth-pop records and glimmering synths. Here, old memories are like “sad, sad songs.” Thomas asks to be taken back to a time he can hold on to, to a world in which the highs of freedom are tangible—not merely memories he’s left singing about.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"All Night

album five, Dev Hynes sublimely examines the concept of home.","standard":"In the seven years since Dev Hynes last released an album as Blood Orange, the English musician wasn’t exactly twiddling his thumbs. After 2018’s searching <i>Negro Swan</i>, the scene veteran released a mixtape (<i>Angel’s Pulse</i>) and an EP (<i>Four Songs</i>), composed soundtracks for film and TV, and hopped on records with Lorde, Turnstile, and Vampire Weekend. All the while, he contemplated the future of Blood Orange. “I’m always making music,” Hynes tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. But before he could release it, he had to answer his own questions: “Why should it exist? What’s the point?” Then Hynes’ mother died in 2023, and the direction for the fifth Blood Orange album, <i>Essex Honey</i>, became clear. \n\nSet in the county outside London that Hynes once called home, it’s a sublime examination of what “home” even means, refracted in the prism of his elegant hybrid of hazy pop, feather-light funk, and ghosts of post-punk and New Wave. Echoes of distant music memories forge pathways into the past: “Regressing back to times you know/Playing songs you forgot you owned/Change a memory, make it 4/3,” Hynes sings on “Westerberg,” its title a nod to The Replacements’ lead singer and its hook a play on the band’s 1987 track “Alex Chilton.”\n\nMore Easter eggs are buried in the bass grooves, sax solos, distorted guitars, and orchestral swoons—a Durutti Column sample on “The Field,” an Elliott Smith interpolation sung by Lorde on “Mind Loaded,” a line about writer’s block delivered by Zadie Smith on “Vivid Light.” The prevailing mood is liminal, surrendered between past and present, though in Hynes’ hands, purgatory sounds heavenly.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"Essex Honey","playParams":{"id":"1825903903","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/essex-honey/1825903903","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5RUma3H9uzDLXxwT7JzTel"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825903903/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"440698865","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/440698865?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757061868295,"RTCI":0}}},"1827531567":{"id":"1827531567","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827531567?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"John Tejada","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/john-tejada/2893125","artwork":{"bgColor":"b4bec9","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0a0b","textColor2":"0b0d0d","textColor3":"2c2e31","textColor4":"2d3033","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5d/6f/6c/5d6f6cc1-cd18-bb4f-2ec9-ae5bd94a3896/199502089443_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"name":"The Watchline","playParams":{"id":"1827531567","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-watchline/1827531567","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6lmX7FyCs97gC6InJTWvyC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827531567/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2893125","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2893125?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757045887995,"RTCI":0}}},"1827988130":{"id":"1827988130","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827988130?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Josh Baldwin","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/josh-baldwin/276932668","artwork":{"bgColor":"384144","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f0eae3","textColor2":"d1cdcb","textColor3":"cbc8c3","textColor4":"b2b1b0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/92/42/24/92422497-dcf3-5693-5b47-b06da2293d31/791126529710_FGMFINALCOVERv.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"name":"Full Grown Man, Vol. I - EP","playParams":{"id":"1827988130","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/full-grown-man-vol-i-ep/1827988130"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827988130/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"276932668","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/276932668?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757045349678,"RTCI":0}}},"1828103000":{"id":"1828103000","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828103000?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mau y Ricky","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mau-y-ricky/1096068683","artwork":{"bgColor":"3e3e3c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f49fb7","textColor2":"f797b3","textColor3":"d08c9f","textColor4":"d2859b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/f3/54/05f354df-eb64-aa56-8154-633ee2c37736/198830944547.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"69a8a7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1f0c08","textColor2":"1a110e","textColor3":"2e2b28","textColor4":"29302d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a7/87/ac/a787ac7b-eff2-2667-2adf-870b043e21e5/dd2e099f-550c-45d7-9ac5-1743efe795f1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Venezuelan duo unlocks new global pop chambers.","standard":"Ever since their 2017 single “Mi Mala” hit, the Venezuelan duo Mau y Ricky have remained righteously entertaining artists in Latin pop.

Embedded in the exponentially expanding global footprint for pop music, <i>LA LLAVE</i> unlocks even more sonic chambers for the pair.\n\nUnlike the prior album, this one more eagerly reaches for features from some similarly skillful guests in order to reach its goals. From the tropical reveries of “samaná” with Danny Ocean and Yorghaki to the swirling throwback thrills of “noche de luna” with their countrymen in LAGOS, they build beauteous musical worlds populated by eminently relatable sentiments and vocal harmonies.

Debuting in 2015 out of the idol survival show <i>Sixteeen</i>, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu are popular worldwide for their bright discography, catchy choreo, and prolific output. <i>ENEMY</i>, their second full-length album release of 2025, is specifically targeted at Japan, where Korean idol music is a part of the mainstream pop scene and TWICE is incredibly popular. (Three of the group’s members, Momo, Sana, and Mina, are from Japan.) \n\n<i>ENEMY</i> is TWICE’s sixth full-length Japanese album, following 2018’s <i>BDZ</i>, 2019’s <i>&TWICE</i>, 2021’s <i>Perfect World</i>, 2022’s <i>Celebrate</i>, and 2024’s <i>DIVE</i>. The album’s rock-infused title track stretches the boundaries of TWICE’s self-described “color pop” sound while still fitting seamlessly into the group’s tradition of self-empowerment songs. “Even a flower cannot bloom without swaying,” members Dahyun and Chaeyoung rap in Japanese on the second verse of the pop-rock song about persisting through hardship. \n\nThough <i>ENEMY</i> flirts with other sounds across its nine tracks—like cheerful summer bop (“Up to you”), laidback electropop (“FINE”), meandering jazz-pop (“Love is more”), and sweet acoustic ballad (“Glow”)—it returns to J-rock for album-ender “Like 1,” a sentimental song composed by Taku and Toru, members of the veteran Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK. The track’s lyrics were written by TWICE leader Jihyo, leaving listeners on a poignant, ambiguous note: “Know there will come a time/For a bittersweet salute (I wanna)/Stay in this moment now/But we don’t get to choose.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["J-Pop","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"ENEMY","playParams":{"id":"1828648304","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-26","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/enemy/1828648304","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/18v5nf750qcff18B0a6WmG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828648304/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1203816887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1203816887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757051170373,"RTCI":0}}},"1829047011":{"id":"1829047011","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829047011?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tiwa Savage","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tiwa-savage/324225716","artwork":{"bgColor":"dddbde","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"2b0804","textColor2":"370f0d","textColor3":"4e3230","textColor4":"583836","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b8/23/c3/b823c387-a459-4a6a-6b57-c4c9fad86e04/199316078022_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e0e0e0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"161515","textColor2":"262424","textColor3":"3e3e3e","textColor4":"4b4a49","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4c/20/77/4c207705-7097-9762-8d6d-aca284f5d455/847a02ce-f304-4a95-918f-274ec90ed2e7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Meet the real Tiwa Savage: “This is the most vulnerable I’ve been on a record.”","standard":"As the title of Tiwa Savage’s <i>This One Is Personal</i> suggests, the Queen of Afrobeats is in rare form across her fourth studio album. “It’s the most vulnerable I’ve ever been on a record,” Savage tells Apple Music. “Every single record resonates with an experience I’ve gone through. It took two years for me to do this record.”\n\nThough she recorded the project in various locations around the world, she limited features to just Skepta, taves, and James Fauntleroy, opting instead to give herself the space to reflect on love, heartbreak, and faith as she’s experienced it. “It was a very dark time for me, and it was very therapeutic too,” she says. Below, Savage explains just how <i>This One Is Personal</i>, taking us through the album track by track.\n\n<b>“I’m Done”</b>\n“This is one of those piano-led records, where it’s just piano and vocals. It was very important for me to open the project with this, just to set the tone and almost to get it out of the way. It was hard for me to record this, too, because every single line was personal. But ‘I’m Done’ is a ballad. It’s emotional.”\n\n<b>“Angel Dust”</b>\n“This song is about a toxic relationship. Angel dust is a drug, so in this song I’m talking about a relationship where I know I’m kind of addicted to the relationship, but it’s not necessarily good for me.”\n\n<b>“You4Me”</b>\n“This is probably one of the lighter records on the album. I love the sample of the Tamia record, ‘So Into You.’ It’s one of my favorite R&B records of all time. I wanted to lean into this genre a lot more; it was very important for me to do a sample because I love records that are sampled well. ‘You4Me’ is a great summer record, a girl fantasizing about a guy that she has feelings for.”\n\n<b>“On the Low”</b>\n“‘On the Low’ is about something that I’ve experienced where you are seeing someone, but you guys are keeping it on the low, for whatever reason—maybe two celebrities or two people that shouldn’t be together, but they found themselves together; being in a relationship that we kind of want to keep on the low, but I don’t know if I really want to, but I know that that’s the best thing. And I was happy to get Skepta on the record. I think this is the first time we’ve heard him rap in a more romantic way.”\n\n<b>“Holding It Down”</b>\n“‘Holding It Down’ is an experience or relationship, I would say, where you guys are together, but you don’t want to give yourself titles of boyfriend or girlfriend or couple—you are in a situationship. [This is] me saying that I’m not doing this for entertainment. I’m holding this down because there’s a lot of sexual chemistry between us.”\n\n<b>“10%”</b>\n“This was a real-life experience. I was in the studio recording and I got a call from someone that I was with at the time. He was like, ‘Yo, pull up, come through.’ And I literally stopped my session. I was feeling like a bad girl at that time—every girl has that person that can bring out that wild side of them—and I was basically just driving to this guy’s house and my phone was on 10%. I was just praying that my phone doesn’t die before I get there because I’ll have to call him when I’m downstairs. I didn’t have a charger or nothing in the car. So yeah, ‘10%’ is a fun, sexy record.”\n\n<b>“Twisted”</b>\n“One of the last songs I recorded on the project. My heartbreak from the first record, ‘I’m Done,’ was so bad, it left me in such a bad state that the next person I got with, my heart was hardened. I found myself even being toxic and being the same person that broke my heart to this [new] person. And this poor guy was accepting of everything, and I was just like, ‘Yo, this is twisted.’ But it was kind of like, ‘OK, I’ve been treated so bad and I’m just out here just being the toxic person.’”\n\n<b>“Scared of Love”</b>\n“It’s self-explanatory. I’m scared of love now. I feel like it’s just hard for me to give that part of me like I did before, because I got burnt. So, ‘Scared of Love’ is like, ‘Should I really be scared? But then when I’m with you, I’m not scared. When I’m with you, I feel like I can conquer the world—but then I’m also scared of that because of the power that we have together.’”\n\n<b>“Pray No More”</b>\n“The title kind of makes you think I’m saying ‘pray no more,’ which is contradictory to what the song is about. I’m a very spiritual person. I love God. I have fear of God, of Jesus Christ. I think it’s very important to always pray. But in the song, what I’m saying to the guy is, ‘You don’t have to pray for me anymore, you already have me. So you can pray to God for money or work or career, but when it comes to my heart and my loyalty and just me being there for you, me being your ride-or-die, you got me.’”\n\n<b>“Addicted”</b>\n“This song gives that ’80s vibe, the drums. It’s such a cool midtempo record. Again, it’s talking about being addicted to a love, being addicted to something that is not necessarily cool for you. It’s a follow-up for ‘On the Low.’ Being so addicted to something that you’re just like, ‘How long can I keep this a secret?’ Because eventually people are going to find out.”\n\n<b>“This One Is Personal (Interlude)”</b>\n“You know when you’re in love and it doesn’t work out, and then you go through that disbelief phase and you’re just like, ‘What? How can you do this to me? I’m that bitch. I’m that girl. You’re nothing without me.’ And your friends are also echoing like, ‘Yeah, girl, you don’t need him.’ This was my moment of trying to encourage myself and pick myself back up again.”\n\n<b>“Will I Run Again?”</b>\n“The song is basically like, ‘When will I learn my lesson? And how will I learn my lesson if I keep repeating the same [mistake]? And will I run again? Will I be able to fly again? Will I be able to get through this?’”\n\n<b>“For One Night”</b>\n“This song is talking about a situation where you found yourself having a one-night stand, but you don’t want it to be a one-night stand. You’re like, ‘Can we pretend this isn’t just for one night?’ But it is for one night. But in that moment, you’re telling yourself, ‘Can we just pretend like there’s nobody else in the world? Let’s just pretend like this isn’t just going to go away. This isn’t just for one night.’”\n\n<b>“You’re Not the First (You’re Just the Worst)”</b>\n“‘You’re not my first, you’re just the worst…’ Again, talking about the relationship, saying, ‘You’re not the first person to break my heart, you’re just the worst one and you’ve just done it in the worst way.’”\n\n<b>“Change”</b>\n“This is such a special record to me because I’m saying, ‘I want to change for you. Whatever is going to make you love me, I want to [do that].’ But people might think that I’m talking about a guy, but ultimately, I’m talking about God. Because after all was said and done, the only person I could run to was God. And I was just like, ‘Listen, God, I’m here now. I’m in this hole, I’m in this dark space.

The six-track mini album represented a long-awaited reunion for members SHOWNU, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, JOOHONEY, and I.M, following a multi-year hiatus due to mandatory military service. Because of this, <i>THE X</i> isn’t just an album—it’s a musical bridge between MONSTA X’s boundary-breaking past and their future. \n\n“Time has passed, and it’s already been over a decade,” <i>maknae</i> I.M raps, in an interplay of Korean and English, on the Brazilian funk club banger “Do What I Want.” “We never slack off, the six of us together are never afraid.” Rapper JOOHONEY led composition for the forward-looking album opener, which acts as a reintroduction to MONSTA X’s focused, devil-may-care persona. \n\nThe third-generation idol group has taken an active part in writing their own music since their 2015 debut out of the survival show <i>No.Mercy</i>. Other “self-produced” tracks on <i>THE X</i> include the I.M-led “Savior,” a sexy pop earworm about an obsessive love, and the Hyungwon-led “Fire & Ice,” an R&B-tinged pop track about two opposites coming together. \n\nLead single “N the Front” has prolific American producer Dem Jointz behind the scenes. The track blends swaggering, rap-driven zigs with rock-fueled vocal zags. While it’s the only track without a MONSTA X member on the writing team, it’s a song that simultaneously evokes the group’s hip-hip idol origins and the eclectic musical maturity they’ve developed in a decade of performance.\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"THE X - EP","playParams":{"id":"1831445714","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-01","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-x-ep/1831445714"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831445714/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"992315362","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/992315362?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757061728870,"RTCI":0}}},"1831558610":{"id":"1831558610","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831558610?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Susumu Yokota","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/susumu-yokota/42151157","artwork":{"bgColor":"131412","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f2cfb2","textColor2":"f4c8a3","textColor3":"c5a992","textColor4":"c7a486","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/51/0a/52/510a5215-c95f-d189-3d29-5ea8038534a9/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Image (1983-1998) [2025 Remastered]","playParams":{"id":"1831558610","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/image-1983-1998-2025-remastered/1831558610","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1GyaHuFdy826K4bhtJgIua"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831558610/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"42151157","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/42151157?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757043056051,"RTCI":0}}},"1831623489":{"id":"1831623489","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831623489?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"FOLA","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fola/1571944412","artwork":{"bgColor":"390b02","hasP3":false,"height":1800,"textColor1":"f57844","textColor2":"f4652c","textColor3":"cf6337","textColor4":"cf5324","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/59/b8/63/59b86391-e066-1f75-3302-b8b568667bd7/199316218947_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1800},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"811c00","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f7884f","textColor2":"f76f34","textColor3":"df723f","textColor4":"e05e29","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/74/b0/41/74b041b3-cf05-eeb4-9691-3372db0d9500/Jobd56cd53c-3de4-4902-a55a-5aa84525cec8-201812550-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_394865764_2319035113-Time1756760882927.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1d1411","gradient":{"color":"1d1411","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f77f44","textColor3":"dbbfb7","textColor4":"df6b36","textGradient":["ffffff","f77f44"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3b/9e/8f/3b9e8f61-a6f7-df8e-9c38-5c8334eea45e/Jobf2dc5897-5517-4041-939e-2484e250284f-201812549-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_394865765_2319035112-Time1756759325956.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e9ad3b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000001","textColor2":"1e1106","textColor3":"2e220d","textColor4":"473011","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a0/66/c6/a066c6a3-723c-1ed9-d85e-ad262a71ac89/49d577df-eb4c-41da-a5d1-3d3debdc6efe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“I want people to listen to these songs and let go of their worries,” FOLA says.","standard":"FOLA says that when he started to put together the songs that would form the backbone of <i>catharsis</i> a little over a year before its release he wasn’t necessarily en route to making any kind of career-defining statement. “To be frank, nothing was going on in my life at that time,” he tells Apple Music. “Being the kind of person that I am, I just always like to record, even if I am going to put them out or not, even if I have a rollout plan or not. I just love to always have stuff down. I always like to work, so when the time comes to make everything work, it will all be in place.” \n\nThat ability to let the vibes guide him gifted FOLA a suite of songs that blur the line between utopian romance and lovelorn anguish, while also nodding towards the kind of dedication he sees as imperative to overcoming life’s challenges. He’s paying homage to the legendary hustle and bustle of Lagos on “eko,” unpacking feeling untethered in the context of a relationship on Kizz Daniel collab, “lost,” and then laying out the effects of a former partner’s absence in his life in “caricature.”\n\nFor all the unbridled emotion he delivers on <i>catharsis</i>, FOLA was sure to build bridges toward relief and resolution where he could. It’s something he hopes others will find in the music as well. “This album is like building a soul hospital, looking for something to cleanse and repair your soul,” he says. “I want people to listen to these songs and let go of their worries. I want people to do more after listening to these songs.” Below, FOLA talks us through the key tracks from <i>catharsis</i>. \n\n<b>“gokada”</b>\n“‘gokada’ is talking about delivery. It’s talking about how I always come through like a [Nigerian delivery service] Gokada worker. On this song, I’m talking about my music, talking about the way I put it together, and speaking about work ethic. I’m talking about the hard work I put into my craft. So, it’s just a play on the Gokada line that’s quite popular.”\n\n<b>“eko”</b>\n“‘eko’ is coming from a place of struggle because I had to move to Lagos, and that’s what inspired the song. It’s about having to leave home to feed home. I’m talking about going home or going harder. Another thing I touched on is having to wear fake clothes and stuff at the beginning because I was poor. There are a lot of things that people don’t know about, the trials of trying to make it in life. It’s just a song to fuel your hustle and inspire you to work more. ‘eko’ was produced by LOL.” \n\n<b>“golibe” (feat. Victony)</b>\n“This is a beautiful song. It’s just a song about true love, and Victony really went hard on that song; people are going to love it. It was a mind-blowing session. Victony is such a great guy. I learned a lot from working with him that night. We also have more records on the way.”\n\n<b>“you”</b>\n“I’m going to tell you for a fact that ‘you’ wasn’t inspired by my experience, ‘you’ was inspired by my manager, MelvinTheWave. I wasn’t in love when I wrote ‘you,’ but my manager was in love, so I was watching his lifestyle, and I wrote the song off that.”\n\n<b>“lost” (feat. Kizz Daniel)</b>\n“A girl was giving me tough times when I wrote ‘lost.’ She wasn’t straightforward with her answers, so I was just lost. It’s a love song with a twist. People talk about the sweet things you get from love when you fall in love, but nobody talks about the ups and downs, the back and forth. So, that’s what ‘lost’ is about. Kizz Daniel’s verse is mind-blowing; he brought some speciality as he has been in the game for a while. I think he knew what the song needed.”\n\n<b>“healer”</b>\n“I arranged the song in a way where it feels like you’re just talking to your girl. There’s a lot that comes with being lost. I think after all of that, telling your girl to be your healer is something we’ve all experienced. Like she’s the only clinic that can heal your soul, despite any issues between you, she’s the only answer to the problem. That’s why I named the song ‘healer.’”\n\n<b>“cruise control”</b>\n“The way I made ‘cruise control’ was weird because it was not a song I planned on making. I came up with it on my phone. I saw that I wrote ‘cruise control’ somewhere on my phone’s notepad while I was in the studio. I didn’t write anything after that, and it was just cruise control. When I heard the beat in the studio, I just started singing, and that was how it came about. I was just in the studio, saw the word and caught the vibe. It was produced by LOL. I work with him a lot; he produced about three tracks on the album.”\n\n<b>“robbery” (feat. Gabzy)</b>\n“Similar to ‘lost,’ I won’t call it a heartbreak song, but it’s about a girl who is cheating you emotionally. That’s what the song is all about.”\n\n<b>“caricature”</b>\n“‘caricature’ means getting a representation of something. It’s a song about true love. It’s just like when you’re missing your girl, and you are like, ‘OK, yeah, you’re not here, but I’m going to get a caricature of you, I’m going to get a representation of you.’ It’s actually the first song I wrote on that project. I wrote it in March 2024.”\n\n<b>“it’s going”</b>\n“‘it’s going’ was made from a place of hustle. It’s talking about how I wasn’t ready for this game. I didn’t see all of these things coming. It’s just a song that keeps you going. It’s something you need to listen to.”","tagline":"New Album and

Nashville singer-songwriter adds six new tracks to his 2024 album.","standard":"Riley Green’s third album opens with some sage advice. On “That’s a Mistake,” a warm and tender track with ’90s Tim McGraw vibes, Green runs through a laundry list of minor miscalculations—forgetting to get an oil change, perpetually running late—before revealing the kind of misstep that leaves a lasting impression: a romantic one. It’s an understated opening to Green’s boldest release yet, one that finds the Alabama-born star pushing himself as both a songwriter and a vocalist. Standout tracks on the record, which follows 2023’s <i>Ain’t My Last Rodeo</i>, include “Turnin’ Dirt,” a laidback ode to blue-collar life, and “Don’t Mind If I Do,” an emotional duet with country singer-songwriter Ella Langley. The record wraps with the hit song “Worst Way,” a soulful solo write that shows off Green’s sultry side.\n\nGreen wrote four of the album’s 18 tracks by himself, telling Apple Music that he’s unlocked a new level of artistry since reframing his approach to his songwriting process. “When I was a kid, I always thought [writing a song] was a lucky thing,” Green says. “You had those one-hit wonders, and to write a hit song seemed like, ‘Well, sometimes you just get lucky, or you get in the right room, or have the right idea.’ And when I started thinking about songwriting as something that you could get better at, like a skill, it really changed my whole mindset on it. It just motivated me to write better songs and write songs that people connect with.” Below, Green shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“That’s a Mistake”</b>\n“I grew up listening to a CD from front to back. I don't know that everybody does that anymore, but it's certainly a way I like to do it. And I always try to schedule my songs on my album for that reason. But it's just such an easy listen. I can remember when the song—it sounds like it ends. I didn't want it to end, and then it keeps going. And the whole time I was just into it. And it's tough, with a song that's kind of down or midtempo like that, to keep somebody's ear that whole time. But I just love that song and the vibe of it. And I thought that was a cool way to start the record off, and then, we bring it back down at the end.”\n\n<b>“Turnin’ Dirt”</b>\n“It's a strange thing when you cut outside songs, for me, because I haven't really done that a lot. I write so much of my own music. But I cut songs that sound like something I would write, that I just didn't write. ‘Turnin’ Dirt’ is one of those. It sounded like I wrote that song. People would argue with you that I wrote it, probably.”\n\n<b>“Chip Off the Ol’ Block”</b>\n“I love writing songs that are common sayings, especially Southern country sayings. So ‘Chip Off the Ol' Block’ is writing a song about my dad and the ways that we're similar, writing in a fun, lighthearted way. But I wanted to do it like The Band, Levon Helm, something kind of swampy. There's a song Lynyrd Skynyrd had called ‘Made in the Shade,’ and it is that kind of thing. So, I'm glad it came out that way and it's got a different feel than a lot of stuff I have, too.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Mind If I Do” (feat. Ella Langley)</b>\n“All the duets that I really loved growing up, you always wondered, ‘Is there something going on?’ or whatever. And I think, as a fan, you like for stuff to be true. When you hear a song, it's a love song, and that's what made George [Jones] and Tammy [Wynette] so big, I think, is that all their songs were about what was really going on. And then, when they split, George is still writing these lovesick heartbreak songs. So for me and Ella to have two songs we do that are doing that much, I'm sure there's a lot of rumors and speculation, but it's cool, man.

Paramore star takes full advantage of her newfound independence.","standard":"As the frontwoman for pop-punk heroes Paramore, Hayley Williams has spent her entire professional life in the major-label system, having first signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 when she was just 15. But following the worldwide arena tour for Paramore’s 2023 album, <i>This Is Why</i>, the contract expired, and she returned to her concurrent solo career as a fully independent artist for the first time, completely unburdened by the weight of commercial expectations—and from any conventional notions of what even constitutes a proper album. In August 2025, she dropped a whopping 17 new tracks online at random, inviting fans to create their own playlist permutations. “I really did want to shirk the responsibility,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe at the time. “I was kind of interested in other people’s perspective, also, because there’s just a point where you’re in the eye of that storm, you’re making things, you’re going through shit, and you can’t possibly have perspective.”\n\nHowever, four weeks after that initial data dump, Williams finalized her own version of the tracklist and officially corralled those songs under the title of <i>Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</i>. You can understand why sequencing these tracks was such a daunting task: <i>Ego Death</i> feels a lot like listening to five-disc CD changer stocked with ’90s faves on shuffle mode, bounding between fuzzy Breeders-styled odes to anti-depressants (“Mirtazapine”), No Doubt-like tropical-pop mash notes (“Love Me Different”), and pure Alanis-worthy catharsis (“Hard”); she even works the chorus of Bloodhang Gang’s “The Bad Touch” into the grungy folk dirge “Discovery Channel,” transforming the original’s horndog hook into a raw expression of animalistic lust. \n\nBut while <i>Ego Death</i> draws from a kaleidoscopic pop palette, Williams’ punk-rock heart beats loudly throughout, as she takes side-eyed shots at the Nashville establishment on the deceptively breezy title track, while using the gothic trip-hop backdrop and deadpan Lana-esque vocal of “True Believer” to paint a damning portrait of so-called Christians who “pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all the children.” As a parting gift, Williams appends <i>Ego Death</i>’s original 17 loosies with the previously unreleased “Parachute,” which seamlessly folds Williams’ punk past and alt-pop present into a triumphant closer that sounds like Chappell Roan working up the nerve to stage-dive into the pit at Riot Fest.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Ego Death At A

Music. “We make music that’s true to who we are, from the sound to the visuals. And as Africans, we’re in the best position to tell those stories our way.” For his Africa Now mix, Ayra Starr’s Bronx-born official DJ spotlights the storytellers and artists who continue to redefine the sound of the continent—including Starr, Wizkid, Rema, Lojay, and Odeal.\n\n“I chose a list of vibrant new music with fresh sounds that just feel good, the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance without thinking,” he says. “[It’s] warm, comforting, and free. It feels like home. I really believe in this new generation. We’re young, unapologetic, and not afraid to push the boundaries. I think African music is on the verge of a major shift, and this next wave of artists is ready to change the game and reshape how the world hears and sees the continent.”","tagline":"New DJ Mix"},"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African","Amapiano"],"name":"Africa Now: September 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1833568864","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":54,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/africa-now-september-2025-dj-mix/1833568864"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833568864/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1237403678","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1237403678?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757071905160,"RTCI":0}}},"1833953319":{"id":"1833953319","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833953319?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"D Smoke","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/d-smoke/440946372","artwork":{"bgColor":"ac3a15","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f7e3e6","textColor2":"ecd5d5","textColor3":"e8c1bc","textColor4":"dfb6af","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/24/ef/77/24ef774d-c8ed-e2b4-abaa-95820a36c087/764656489120_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The LA rapper contemplates grief and the strength of community bonds.","standard":"As an integral part of Southern California’s bountiful, diverse rap scene, D Smoke knows how important community is. These tight relationships inform his 2025 LP, <i>Wake Up Supa</i>, which reflects the strength of his neighborly bonds within the context of grief and trauma; the project is also a journal of the Inglewood spitter coming to terms with the death of his mother. On the opening title track, Smoke observes how tragedy can take “the wind out the whole city.”\n\nThe line may be about a number of significant deaths that have occurred in the city, or it might simply be about the collective grief from his friends and family after he lost his mom. Regardless, there’s a comfort in this openness. Even during his lowest moments, D Smoke finds support in the strength of his bonds. Take the triumphant, uplifting “Chin Up,” which finds the rapper imploring anyone going through it to keep pushing. It’s advice for anyone struggling, but also for himself: “And even if you get knocked down right when you get up, better keep your chin up.”","tagline":"New

But in the wake of the Paper Route Empire mogul’s death in 2021, Glizzock carved a lane for himself that would have had Dolph smiling big enough to show off the whole of his signature blue-diamond grill. To be specific, Key Glock is having his way across the 18 tracks of <i>Glockaveli</i>, never losing sight of the ultimate mission: “I’ma go and get that money, like Dolph told me to,” he raps on “Hallelujah.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Glockaveli: All Eyez On Key","playParams":{"id":"1834886306","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":31,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/glockaveli-all-eyez-on-key/1834886306","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1xilmbBVUsZj9oXCLHS81F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834886306/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1199258326","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1199258326?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757082508994,"RTCI":0}}},"1834985908":{"id":"1834985908","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834985908?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jabari","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jabari/1719245219","artwork":{"bgColor":"2b6787","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dce7fb","textColor2":"d2e4f1","textColor3":"b8cde4","textColor4":"b1cbdb","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d7/f5/75/d7f575ef-932e-72c0-cdbd-97c55a6c9212/196873548494.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ccc5d6","textColor2":"92abd6","textColor3":"a7a1ae","textColor4":"788caf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ea/93/62/ea936238-2c63-88ac-8234-9aca44635df8/43e8a235-682f-4a43-89f5-a7f4a9288287.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Bel-Air star debuts with a silky rap-and-R&B combo.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"ULTRA","playParams":{"id":"1834985908","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ultra/1834985908","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5RVCEBzJf14dJzY8Avz8yk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834985908/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1719245219","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1719245219?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757047324551,"RTCI":0}}},"1835129525":{"id":"1835129525","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835129525?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kent Boca","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kent-boca/1835129526","artwork":{"bgColor":"4a3c11","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f5d3ab","textColor2":"fb5822","textColor3":"d3b58c","textColor4":"d7521f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/15/c2/bb/15c2bbaa-40da-14f4-1a42-ea8804f70689/8718723297042.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"name":"Rubber Legs -

So it couldn’t have come as much of a surprise that someone like Joey Bada$$ would eventually step up to address the current iteration of this tiresome talking point. After all, the Pro Era figure made his name by both reveling in and refurbishing the hometown sounds of the golden age, building with his crew while seeing his own star rise. \n\n“This thing is a competitive art form,” he tells Apple Music. “For people who’s really passionate about this and passionate about moving that pen, we understand that.” His 2025 opening move “The Ruler’s Back” and its subsequent rap ripostes “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Pardon Me” made his position known and, on some level, put him at perceived odds with certain Los Angeles denizens. “I believe I’m at my best when I’m feeling the heat of another pen,” he says, explaining how the perceived rivalry fueled his craft.\n\nBut regardless of any animosity or gossip generated amid that back-and-forth, it all led to the release of <i>Lonely at the Top</i>, a mixtape that fully transitions the <i>1999</i> rapper into his present era. The Chuck Strangers-produced opener “DARK AURA” provides a proper reintroduction, leading swiftly into the confident alliance of Joey with Westside Gunn on the ornate “SWANK WHITE.” In line with the flexibility of the project’s format, the beats sometimes surprise, as with the R&B groover “3 FEET AWAY” and the Neptunes-esque throwback “SUPAFLEE.” Yet even when he’s in more familiar musical territory on “HIGHROLLER” or the Statik Selektah-helmed “BK’S FINEST,” he never sounds stale. \n\nNYC pride pervades the project, occasionally amplified by locally sourced guests like A$AP Ferg, Rome Streetz, and Pro Era pal CJ Fly. Given Joey’s lyrical swipes at the West Coast that led to this moment, the presence of TDE mainstay Ab-Soul on “STILL” seems less like a conciliatory olive branch than a slightly subversive act of artistic solidarity, one made even more meaningful by Rapsody’s concurrent feature. “I mean, I’ll say we was trolling, but we had to show people that you can do this,” he says. “And it could be love afterwards—and during, even.” \n","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Lonely At The Top","playParams":{"id":"1835726721","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-29","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonely-at-the-top/1835726721","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5iFqSKGaLAcDXtgfhLu26i"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835726721/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"577261450","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/577261450?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757078958172,"RTCI":0}}},"1836057808":{"id":"1836057808","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836057808?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Farruko & Louis BPM","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=364377482-1679681205","artwork":{"bgColor":"9da9b3","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"08090a","textColor2":"2f2204","textColor3":"25292c","textColor4":"453d27","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/81/00/3e8100d9-c2ae-5044-da03-ad3babe2da89/5021732968647.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"5795df","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0d0d0d","textColor2":"171009","textColor3":"1b2837","textColor4":"242a34","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/74/42/e5/7442e5a3-3913-920f-e03c-461254c04803/97f8f032-282a-4c20-a48c-c719b5d0e795.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Two generations of traperos explore global pop together.","standard":"Among Farruko’s many career high points, his song “Krippy Kush” stands out for being one of the first Latin trap singles to chart in the US.

On their joint project <i>167BPM</i>, the bespoke duo outright refuse to limit themselves to any one style, instead exploring a variety of sounds that speak to the contemporary global Latin movement’s genre fluidity. Having previously seized attention with their “Tranquilo” remix, which also featured J Balvin, Kris R., and iZaak, they kick off this concise collaboration in trap mode with the instantly gratifying “PANCC.” From there, they offer locally inspired fusions galore, from the dance-floor tribalism of “OE OE” to the roots-infused “REGGAEGUAIRA” and the lushly polyrhythmic “CANAIMA.” On “ASÍ CRECÍ,” both artists examine their respective pasts and upbringings with critical eyes, giving the streets something fresh to ponder.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Urbano

Versed in pop, indie, and hip-hop, Frank has an expansive take on what makes worship music, and lyrically leans into more positive, uplifting messaging instead of fire and brimstone. <i>CHILD OF GOD II</i> opens with “ENCORE,” a gauzy overture with a snippet of Frank speaking to his grandfather about his rise to fame, a move that sets up the personal nature of the rest of the project. \n\n“YOUR WAY’S BETTER” pairs a bubblegum beat with a sunny lyric, recalling Chance the Rapper’s pre-fame work with Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment. Other highlights are “NO L’s,” an edgier number that could sneak onto pop radio, and “LIVE YOUR LIFE,” a laidback track that splits the difference between Jack Johnson and Still Woozy. Guests on <i>CHILD OF GOD II</i> include actor and musician Nathan Davis Jr. on the slinky, trap-inspired “WOKE UP THIS MORNING” and Nigerian singer-rapper Limoblaze on the loose and groovy “LIKE WATER.” Country star Thomas Rhett joins Frank on “NOTHING ELSE,” a short but potent celebration of what makes life sweet.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Christian Pop","Music","Christian"],"name":"CHILD OF GOD II (BACK TO BACK)","playParams":{"id":"1837276835","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","trackCount":26,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/child-of-god-ii-back-to-back/1837276835","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/49wdSgGW3XbsRnl8x9VCLI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837276835/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436657314","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436657314?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757080408191,"RTCI":0}}},"1837511095":{"id":"1837511095","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837511095?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lizzo","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lizzo/472949623","artwork":{"bgColor":"a5a5a5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0d0d0d","textColor2":"1a110e","textColor3":"2b2b2b","textColor4":"362f2c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e0/26/a2/e026a28e-424f-6692-d683-6ebbbea4d14e/075679601315.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Nothing beats a Lizzo mixtape, now expanded with 10 new tracks.","standard":"The singing, rapping, flute-playing polymath spent the three years since 2022’s <i>Special</i> courting unexpected controversy and flirting in social media posts with quitting music entirely. After mostly laying low throughout the turbulence, Lizzo emerged in February 2025 with a rock-inspired new single and an announcement of her fifth album, both titled <i>Love in Real Life</i>. But first, a bit of raucous, freewheeling fun: With three days’ notice in late June, she revealed a surprise 13-track mixtape whose artwork shows the singer grinning from ear to ear and flipping the double bird. The project came together just as spontaneously. “I did this shit in three motherfucking days, bitch!” she crows on “DITTO,” before adding: “You’re welcome!”\n\nFrom the jump, <i>MY FACE HURTS FROM SMILING</i> stands in stark contrast to the posi-vibes-only pop-rap that skyrocketed the 37-year-old singer into the mainstream circa 2019. “Bitch, I’m mad! Bitch, I’m pissed off!” she bellows on intro “CRASHOUT” before letting loose a 35-minute barrage of blistering, boisterous trap music. But her formidable Southern rap skills come as no surprise to those who heard her unofficial TikTok remix of PLUTO and YKNIECE’s 2025 viral hit “WHIM WHAMIEE,” which appears here as the rowdy “YITTY ON YO TITTYS (FREESTYLE).”\n\nOver grimy, bouncy beats from the likes of Zaytoven and Tay Keith, Lizzo sounds like she’s having more fun than she’s had in years: firing shots at the haters, turning up with her girls, and interpolating trap throwbacks. (“NEW MISTAKES” is likely the only song of 2025 to interpolate both Boosie Badazz and “Für Elise.”) She’s joined by Doja Cat on “STILL CAN’T FUH” and SZA on “IRL” for a pair of bratty bad-bitch symposiums. “I can’t let no comment section ever fuck with my vibe,” she spits on the latter duet. It’s a lesson to take heed of for 2025: Why be mad when you can throw ass and touch grass instead?","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"MY FACE STILL HURTS FROM SMILING","playParams":{"id":"1837511095","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-face-still-hurts-from-smiling/1837511095","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2YoR3iqOT0HH62KRJN39w2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837511095/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"472949623","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/472949623?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757079307954,"RTCI":0}}},"1837867200":{"id":"1837867200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837867200?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Justin Bieber","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/justin-bieber/320569549","artwork":{"bgColor":"f8b6c3","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0a0a","textColor2":"0e0b0c","textColor3":"3b2c2f","textColor4":"3c2d30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e0/cb/3e/e0cb3e1c-0dde-156d-d500-7943bc4ddebd/25UM1IM36272.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"eeb8c4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b0909","textColor2":"171213","textColor3":"392c2f","textColor4":"423336","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b4/15/2c/b4152c34-6a81-ce17-6521-ea95b93e1dd1/93303ccf-9be4-4f3b-b110-3dbc3f177f73.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"030202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d9af8b","textColor2":"cca58d","textColor3":"ae8c70","textColor4":"a48571","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a1/a1/94/a1a194ff-f49d-5f71-2d48-903f56c212d4/4dde8042-e875-47af-a3c9-d2450de3f625.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The surprise sequel to SWAG is here.
