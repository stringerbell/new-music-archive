You’ve likely heard “Weak in Your Light” from 2023’s <i>Strange Disciple</i> if you’ve turned on a single TV show in the last few years, and their fourth album <i>Dance Called Memory</i> continues their hot streak of broadly appealing and emotionally resonant songcraft. \n\nWith frequent collaborator and LCD Soundsystem live member Nick Millhiser behind the boards, these 10 songs sparkle and bounce with every rhythmic twist, as lead singer Ian Richard Devaney’s angelic vocals hover above the proceedings. And lest you think they’re becoming easy to pin down, <i>Dance Called Memory</i> has a few tricks up its sleeve: Witness the brittle backbeats that make up the framework of “In Another Life” or the glistening shoegaze textures that course through “Now That You’re Gone.” It’s these subtle tweaks to their sound that prove that, even as they grow in popularity, Nation of Language continues to evolve in new and surprising ways.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"name":"Dance Called Memory","playParams":{"id":"1802059612","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dance-called-memory/1802059612","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2fNPTFiU2sCY9m6tv3Ucqa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802059612/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1160352768","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1160352768?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758237606454,"RTCI":0}}},"1809241664":{"id":"1809241664","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809241664?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"King Princess","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/king-princess/1349968534","artwork":{"bgColor":"d19970","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"0c0705","textColor2":"17110d","textColor3":"33241b","textColor4":"3c2c21","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c2/79/92/c2799269-0bc5-1df0-a772-56842ba73851/0720841362005_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"d6a68f","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0c0a06","textColor2":"3f2017","textColor3":"342922","textColor4":"5d3b2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bf/ce/65/bfce6565-a002-6888-719a-6f40cce90237/Job3164d48e-9d55-4238-a6b1-1ea3f8017b24-193613823-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379280230_2182973663-Time1748506257126.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"4e181a","gradient":{"color":"4e181a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"281612","textColor3":"2f2620","textColor4":"49322a","textGradient":["ffffff","281612"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/44/ae/28/44ae2825-8484-eb98-a385-ff14e868e686/Job9826211c-cce4-4415-a7f9-84a9fec88970-193613822-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379280231_2182973662-Time1748505326769.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"933c1c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fafefe","textColor2":"efbdb4","textColor3":"e5d7d0","textColor4":"dca396","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/8f/09/a1/8f09a1da-fac7-6b9f-8e4f-96cc64e38e30/4d28b2bf-4cba-44ef-b2b4-e9c7d9065ae3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"963723","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fafaf6","textColor2":"f3e3d2","textColor3":"e6d3cc","textColor4":"e1c1af","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f4/9a/bb/f49abbff-83d2-8932-4bab-5a4b626a1b3a/749833a1-d044-4151-a984-1f8d3134ba09.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A swaggering, sexy dive into the havoc women wreak upon each other’s lives.","standard":"The third album from the Brooklyn-born pop provocateur took shape during a period of upheaval: In one turbulent summer, the artist born Mikaela Straus left her longtime label, her Los Angeles apartment, and her four-year relationship. Instead of fighting the chaos, the musician embraced it, resulting in what could ostensibly be called a breakup album. But on <i>Girl Violence</i>, King Princess swaggers rather than sulks, streamlining her formerly eclectic sound for a slinky, sexy deep dive into the havoc women wreak upon each other’s lives. “Why does nobody mention that girls can be violent?” she growls on the title track, concluding: “I hate it, but I kinda like it.”\n\nAfter moving back to NYC in 2023, Straus began working with a pair of Brooklyn-based producers: Jacob Portrait of the psych-rock band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Joe Pincus, who’d made beats for SZA and Doechii. Together, the trio crafted a sound steeped in late-’90s electronica and reverb-heavy rock, using heartbreak as a springboard for questions about human nature. Doo-wop meets dream pop on “Girls,” a slow-burner for the down-bad on which Straus yowls in her smokiest rasp: “To let you back in/That would be violence/That would be chaos/I wanna try it.” Luckily, all that drama builds character. On “Origin,” a sultry downtempo number, she begins to get her groove back: “I’ve had to face fire, fight fear/And spend a lot of time in the mirror/And I’m cool, I’m weirder/I’m hot, I’m deeper/I’m starting to feel myself again.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Girl Violence","playParams":{"id":"1809241664","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/girl-violence/1809241664","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4aAqSQJ69OruOHDlQ9B5ki"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809241664/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1349968534","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1349968534?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758079463569,"RTCI":0}}},"1809986177":{"id":"1809986177","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809986177?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lorna Shore","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lorna-shore/385220213","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f4dac9","textColor2":"b6d0d4","textColor3":"c9b5a7","textColor4":"98adb0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/22/4a/e5/224ae512-a396-42bc-f075-925b7c834074/196872991611.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"45423c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dddad2","textColor2":"d0ccc1","textColor3":"bebcb4","textColor4":"b4b0a6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/02/a1/56/02a15655-999d-9e9a-7fdc-52d13213a2a1/c5acb580-493d-41b5-8258-6be9a88ab221.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The New Jersey deathcore crew talk through their crushing fifth album.","standard":"After the rousing success of 2022’s <i>Pain Remains</i>, New Jersey deathcore crew Lorna Shore returns with their fifth album. Vocalist Will Ramos made his full-length debut with the band on <i>Pain Remains</i>, and felt the pressure to deliver again on <i>I Feel the Everblack Festering Within Me</i>. “I definitely approached this one with 1,000 percent more anxiety, if you can imagine,” he tells Apple Music. “Everyone’s like, ‘What’s the next Lorna Shore album going to be like? It’s got to be the most incredible thing ever.’ That stuff is always in the back of your mind when you’re writing stuff.”\n\nThe title <i>I Feel the Everblack Festering Within Me</i> is taken from a line in the album’s opening track, “Prison of Flesh.” “It’s about my family’s history of dementia,” Ramos says, which creates “a fear inside, like you’re running from something. That line is one of my favorites from the song, but honestly, we were just trying to come up with a sick-ass name.”\n\nMusically speaking, Ramos and his bandmates—guitarist Adam De Micco, drummer Austin Archey, bassist Michael Yager, and guitarist Andrew O’Connor—expand Lorna Shore’s crushing sonic palette while stripping back some of their renowned technicality in favor of monster grooves on tracks like “Unbreakable,” “In Darkness,” and the Lamb of God-inspired “War Machine.” “We weren’t too strict on keeping it 100 percent deathcore or 100 percent death metal or whatever other people expect Lorna Shore to put out,” Ramos says. “At the end of the day, we just want to put out good music.” Below, he comments on each song.\n\n<b>“Prison of Flesh”</b>\n“My grandma, I don’t know where she is in her head at this point. My aunt is slowly forgetting things. Throughout the song, I personify these demons that are coming to get you, but the demons are the void that’s slowly filling you up. The song ends in this big climax like you’ve just been eaten by whatever this void is, until you don’t even know who you are or who the people around you are. It’s my ode to people with dementia and the families who have to deal with that.”\n\n<b>“Oblivion”</b>\n“I think <i>Interstellar</i> is the best movie ever. There’s a scene where the astronauts go to a water planet that looks beautiful but is actually hell. They realize that they made the worst decision they could have made, and by doing that they screwed themselves. I thought it was a perfect example of the things that we’re doing to ourselves and to our own planet. We’re going to look back and be like, ‘What the hell did we do?’ The song sounds surreal and angelic but also kind of desolated. And that’s exactly how we felt when we watched <i>Interstellar</i>.”\n\n<b>“In Darkness”</b>\n“This is one of the band’s favorites because it just sounds freaking huge. It’s basically a song that goes out to all of the outcasts. I think all of us that are metalheads know the feeling. Now it’s cool, but back in the day people were probably looking at you weird because you’re a little bit different than what everybody else wants. So it’s like we were raised in a valley of darkness—that’s the metaphor I think of—but in that darkness we became exactly who we are, and that’s awesome.” \n\n<b>“Unbreakable”</b>\n“This is completely out there for Lorna Shore. I wanted a song that people would react to like Queen back in the day, when they played ‘We Will Rock You’ and people are clapping their hands, stomping their feet, and they’re part of the show. I wanted that unity in a room full of people that is so powerful that you have this moment when you feel like you’re on top of the world. So this is supposed to be that unifying type of song. It's talking about how we’re almost like diamonds: The pressure of everything has squeezed us together and we became this beautiful thing that is perfect and imperfect at the same time, but unbreakable.”\n\n<b>“Glenwood”</b>\n“To me, this is the most important song on the album. It’s about when I fixed my ties with my father. My dad and I had a very strange relationship when I was growing up. We had a lot of moments when we did not talk, and the last time was for a lot of years. I don’t think it was out of any kind of animosity. I think we were just so similar and so incredibly stubborn that we fought a lot about dumb stuff. He had to work a lot, which meant he wasn’t home, and I never really saw him. He was working so we could live in a nice area, but as a kid you don’t really see that. You just think he should be home more. But I’m an adult now, and I get it. I wanted to capture that feeling.” \n\n<b>“Lionheart”</b>\n“This song is supposed to feel like you’re going into battle. You don’t know what the world is going to throw at you, but you’re going to face it. It’s supposed to be a super-empowering song, like you’re on a horse galloping into this hellfire, but whatever the trials are that you’re about to face, you’re down to do it. We’ve got ‘Unbreakable’ to bring everyone together, and now we’re gonna go fight some shit. Let’s fucking go.” \n\n<b>“Death Can Take Me”</b>\n“It’s a song about being in a position of power. As time goes on, you feel like you have to hide how you are, and in a way, it feels incredibly numbing. I think I'm trying to describe the way that Lorna Shore was when we finally got big, we finally freaking made it, and it just felt like everything that we did, we were walking on eggshells. And you know there’s people who are knocking on your door, just waiting to pull the rug out from under you and take whatever you have. I think you can only be in that position for so long until you’re like, ‘I don’t want this anymore.’ So the song ends with this person jumping off of a tower and basically just being like, ‘I’m going to splat on the ground, and the whole world can watch this happen and know that it was because of everybody that got me to this point.’” \n\n<b>“War Machine”</b>\n“We wanted to write a song that was an ode to all the older bands that we listened to growing up, like Lamb of God. But it took a long time to figure out how to write this one. Like on ‘Unbreakable,’ we wanted to pull back a little bit on vocals and rather than shredding the fretboard into oblivion, we wanted to write something that was groovy, heavy, and angry. So we made it sound like you’re in the fucking trenches, the world has been taking from you, you’re pissed, and now it’s time for you to take back from the world.” \n\n<b>“A Nameless Hymn”</b>\n“This is basically our anti-religion song. All of us in Lorna Shore were raised Christian but as we got older, we started to stray from our beliefs. We started to realize there’s so much hypocrisy and cruelty involved, and nobody does anything about it. If you’re into metal, there’s probably a good chance that you gave up on the Christian world, and there’s nothing wrong with that. So I wrote this from the perspective of a pious Christian who’s dying. He’s sacrificed so much for something that never came through for him. In his last moments, he looks for redemption but never gets it. He’s angry and resentful and he ends up unseen, unheard.” \n\n<b>“Forevermore”</b>\n“When we were writing this, we were describing it as a Viking shooting a flaming arrow at a wooden ship floating off into the sunset. Me and Adam had two big losses in our immediate families, and for me it was my first loss of somebody that was very close to me. It got me all fucked up and it was hard for me grieve because when it happened, I went on tour the next day. This was a young dude who passed away, and it was very unexpected. So I wanted to write a song that was an ode to him. One of my favorite lines in the song is, ‘This isn't goodbye, we'll meet again on the other side.’ It’s about finally having acceptance of that loss. I’m sad he died, but I’m also happy that I got to live at the same time as him, in some of the same moments with him.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"I Feel The Everblack Festering Within Me","playParams":{"id":"1809986177","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-feel-the-everblack-festering-within-me/1809986177","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/07y8y3CSFTq48HwejrTdGw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809986177/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"385220213","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/385220213?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758211990098,"RTCI":0}}},"1810246456":{"id":"1810246456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810246456?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dance Gavin Dance","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dance-gavin-dance/204782507","artwork":{"bgColor":"020307","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"bdc69f","textColor2":"c6b693","textColor3":"979f81","textColor4":"9f9277","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/85/14/0d851436-8ffe-d569-bd78-ff92529d244a/4099964161434.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ccccc5","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0c0d0f","textColor2":"352c21","textColor3":"323333","textColor4":"534c42","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d7/f1/74/d7f174ef-c53b-9d2c-2f54-ed7a4ed77b85/8697d47f-588c-4048-8e2e-8ca94e2d787b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"After an upheaval, the post-hardcore band returns with a blistering 11th LP.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Pantheon","playParams":{"id":"1810246456","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pantheon/1810246456","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4pOEtwmUG4PBP47SbdGzC5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810246456/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"204782507","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/204782507?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758047098836,"RTCI":0}}},"1810267152":{"id":"1810267152","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810267152?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Parcels","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/parcels/1148094312","artwork":{"bgColor":"3a472d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f4f4a2","textColor2":"f4dcc4","textColor3":"ced18b","textColor4":"cfbea6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/17/dc/43/17dc433f-27cb-3cd7-1469-2184ae99b7b2/5056556160120_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b7b19f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1d1510","textColor2":"31231c","textColor3":"3c342d","textColor4":"4c4036","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0c/37/5e/0c375e74-6874-78de-1bc3-a4985e717058/7732cbb3-6e96-4fc2-87b8-06a295fc69c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Byron Bay act’s third album: “This one feels a lot more pure and direct.”","standard":"The members of Parcels had barely graduated high school when they left Byron Bay, Australia for Berlin in 2014, five friends sharing a dream and a cramped one-bedroom apartment. Within a year, they had released their debut EP and signed a label deal; by 2017, they were collaborating with Daft Punk on the band’s single “Overnight,” a track that would become the dance icons’ final production. \n\nAfter two albums—2018’s self-titled debut and 2021’s double LP <i>Day/Night</i>—and nearly a decade in motion, Parcels finally took a break in 2023. For six months, they lived their ordinary lives while working on songs individually before reconvening to finish them together. Whereas <i>Day/Night</i> was recorded in a single studio and meticulously planned out, their third album <i>LOVED</i> was made more loosely, with sessions in Berlin, Byron Bay, Sydney, and Mexico City, and a go-with-the-flow approach that let the album emerge on its own. “It's kind of like Parcels back to our most authentic self, in a way,” bassist Noah Hill told Apple Music’s Travis Mills in April 2025. “This one feels a lot more pure and direct, and more to what we naturally have inside of us.”\n\nFrom opener “Tobeloved,” <i>LOVED</i> is dotted with moments of laughter and colorful ad-libs that drop listeners right in the booth with them. That joy permeates the production, a vintage blend of peppy keys, hand-claps, chest-swelling crescendos, and funky guitar riffs that beg for a little shimmy. They also bring tenderness: “Ifyoucall” offers unconditional love with the warmth of a long hug, and “Leaveyourlove” is a starry-eyed declaration of devotion. The latter, written in Mexico while watching the sun set over the ocean, became the album’s anchor point. “We were all writing our own individual verses about our own love stories at the time, and wanting to lean into that directness and not being afraid to talk about love so directly,” said Hill. “This track just clicked with all of us instantly.”\n\nBut <i>LOVED</i> also refers to the emotion in the past tense. The disco fizz of “Yougotmefeeling” sugarcoats the realization that a relationship is past saving, and the more delicate “Summerinlove” aches with post-breakup yearning.

Nashville singer-songwriter gets metaphysical on his fourth album.","standard":"Ruston Kelly has never shied from the spiritual in his music, but this fourth album finds the Nashville-based singer-songwriter in an especially metaphysical mindset. Following his 2023 album <i>The Weakness</i>, <i>Pale, Through the Window</i> comes after a pivotal time for Kelly, who chronicles a period of reflection, healing, and blossoming love in these 13 new tracks. Kelly recorded the album live in Nashville alongside his touring band and longtime collaborator/producer Jarrad K (Morgan Wade, Tommy Prine), and there’s a subtle looseness in the music that comes from this intimate setup. \n\nThe opening title track is built atop reverbed vocal harmonies, stacked for a gently mesmerizing effect that mimics being in the same room as Kelly and his crew. Lyrically, that song finds Kelly yearning hopelessly for a lost love, finding only himself instead. “Wayside” laments society “shouting from their phone” and highlights Kelly’s prowess as a melody writer, with a driving, sticky verse hook that breaks open at the chorus, while on “Waiting to Love You” he dips back into the rootsy pop rock of earlier fan favorites like “Mockingbird.” Kelly closes the LP with “All In,” a deeply confessional love song about fully committing oneself to another person, no matter how scary the prospect.","tagline":"New

Little Mix star takes the highs with the lows on her flamboyant solo debut.","standard":"When JADE made her bombastic solo debut with “Angel of My Dreams” in July 2024, her yet to be named album had already been completed. The song, a Mike Sabath production that splices power-ballad theatrics, stomping electro basslines, and sugary, sardonic melodies into a Frankenstein’s monster of a tune, was hailed by fans and critics alike for its bold experimentalism, setting up sky-high expectations for the Little Mix star’s future output. As JADE told Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd, shortly after its release: “There’s a lot of songs on the record that have that same experimental vibe. I have a few of the more straight-down-the-line, poppy songs on there, but peppered in with the chaos that is my brain.”\n\nThe statement holds water now <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> has landed. Front-loaded with singles, which see JADE navigate shimmering disco sensuality (“Fantasy”), ballroom club (RAYE co-write “Midnight Cowboy”), and no-punches-pulled electropop (“FUFN (Fuck You for Now)”) with consummate ease, the back half of the record pulls her broad spectrum of influence together cohesively without sacrificing any of the originality or left-field choices that have come to shape her sonic identity. “I think [the reaction to ‘Angel of My Dreams’] has given me reassurance that I can really be myself,” JADE said. “I can take these risks. I can do something a bit braver…”\n\nThat confidence extends to the album’s lyrical themes, which examine JADE’s complex feelings about life in the spotlight, love and its maddening effects—see the delightfully unhinged romance of “Plastic Box”—and the relatable feeling of being at war with your own mind, from all angles. She shoulders her own blame for throwing up emotional walls on “Self Saboteur” only to pull back the curtain with skittish midtempo “Glitch,” revealing the distorted inner voice “telling me lies, telling me how it is” and “hijacking all my decisions.” “Unconditional” makes floaty, ethereal promises of love without reservations to someone struggling to love themselves over a chugging, synth-pop beat, while “Natural at Disaster” takes the concept of a torch song and interprets it literally, putting a vocally dramatic match to the gentle, piano-backed memory of a toxic dynamic. “If there are any darker topics that are personal to me that I write about, then I always give it a bit of a humor to it,” JADE said, speaking to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in the week of release. “It’s been fun as a songwriter being able to finally write more personal concepts and explore that and show people exactly who I am.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, given JADE’s widespread songwriting contributions during the decade she spent as a member of one of the UK’s most successful girl groups, <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> shares some of its DNA (and its producers, including Sabath, MNEK, and Lostboy) with the sounds of late-career Little Mix. While it’s common for band members striking out on their own for the first time to reinvent themselves entirely—a kickback against the artistic compromise that collective creativity demands—JADE boldly bucks the trend, converging her own unique impetus with echoes of the familiar. <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> feels more grounded in authenticity as a result, allowing her to take ownership of her past as she builds for the future.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY!","playParams":{"id":"1813142774","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thats-showbiz-baby/1813142774","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Q1Rf1xZ5OiQcCFnSAHdeE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813142774/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1753030541","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1753030541?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758233184969,"RTCI":0}}},"1814467357":{"id":"1814467357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814467357?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Aly & AJ","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aly-aj/33989931","artwork":{"bgColor":"5e5c60","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6f6f7","textColor2":"eeeeef","textColor3":"d8d7d9","textColor4":"d1d1d2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/01/50/ae01506b-ce3e-3d1d-89c9-e98142d3eadc/199350556302.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"More Silver - EP","playParams":{"id":"1814467357","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/more-silver-ep/1814467357"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814467357/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"33989931","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/33989931?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267193403,"RTCI":0}}},"1814923974":{"id":"1814923974","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814923974?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Frost Children","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/frost-children/1505504789","artwork":{"bgColor":"7a4d51","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f2faf8","textColor2":"fadfe3","textColor3":"dad8d7","textColor4":"e0c2c6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ef/14/8f/ef148f63-6d89-7703-30a8-239e480e1411/198704498367_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"a2a69f","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"1d090b","textColor2":"280a0f","textColor3":"372828","textColor4":"40292c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ee/9d/4d/ee9d4d2a-ed9d-f09b-1b4d-1036419f62d2/Job27f93654-b544-40ef-90f2-63b6496aad6f-196835503-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385440303_2241387809-Time1751947365284.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2e231f","gradient":{"color":"2e231f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"110607","textColor3":"241a17","textColor4":"2d1e1c","textGradient":["ffffff","110607"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f0/68/ee/f068ee1f-052c-3f65-1055-b4384ad5e483/Job0c4c8b23-de5f-49d5-aeeb-35c55b49ee7d-196835502-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385440304_2241387808-Time1751946362867.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Angel and Lulu Prost hone their chaotic maximalism.","standard":"Since their first project as Frost Children (2020’s <i>Aviation Creates Adventurous Beginnings</i>), the duo of Angel and Lulu Prost have honed their chaotic maximalism while helping to define what exactly the “indie sleaze revival” means—is the trend a sound or a feeling? If the free-wheeling, red-blooded party-rock anthems of the St. Louis-raised, New York-based duo are any indication, it’s the latter—drawing from hyperpop, indie rock, electroclash, and meme mischief, Frost Children’s music is hard to pin down, but easy to dance to. \n\nOn <i>SISTER</i>, the duo wrings every last drop of pathos from a serotonin-heavy blend of scuzzy bloghouse, mid-aughts dance-punk, and festival-core EDM. The spirit of indie sleaze is alive on “ELECTRIC,” with its buzzsaw synths and Rapture-esque vocals, while Kim Petras collab “RADIO” channels sleazy late-2000s electropop. Setting aside their previous work’s occasional tongue-in-cheek humor, the prevailing mood is earnest: On the title track, stripped-down ’90s rock shimmers with a hyperpop sheen as the siblings recall the dandelions and hand-me-downs of their Midwestern upbringing: “The two of us, driving down a roundabout life again/It’s the two of us/Sister.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"SISTER","playParams":{"id":"1814923974","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sister/1814923974","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0IojfyxFQMggZW9aNCeaV7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814923974/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1505504789","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1505504789?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267018068,"RTCI":0}}},"1815306100":{"id":"1815306100","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815306100?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joy Crookes","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joy-crookes/1079218175","artwork":{"bgColor":"36110a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dbbf9d","textColor2":"eb9069","textColor3":"ba9c80","textColor4":"c67756","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7e/bc/da/7ebcda0c-1764-9208-13c5-9d9e8231b8b9/196873029115.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"1b0b09","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e1e3e3","textColor2":"dcc8c6","textColor3":"bab7b7","textColor4":"b5a2a0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e5/52/ee/e552eea5-3a87-4521-8972-a962f91bc183/42d7184d-84ce-4924-ae6b-8f31c294740e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e3b6a4","textColor2":"ce9b84","textColor3":"b59183","textColor4":"a57c6a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b4/d8/3a/b4d83af0-5ade-df3e-cc94-3f8d07a6091c/932ba1b2-53d2-43cf-ba0c-98aabf1ac0e4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The soulful talent severs ties and sheds skin on this bold artistic rebirth.","standard":"Joy Crookes emerges from a long period of personal tumult that followed the release of her acclaimed debut album <i>Skin</i> (2021) with a different outlook on life and a striking record, <i>Juniper</i>, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the South London-born singer-songwriter. “I know we’ve got problems/That’s just family/And God knows what we carry from our history,” she sings on “Mother,” bold, punctuating percussion building up and breaking into twinkling piano riffs as she draws connecting lines through the generations. Relationships and their rippling effects are central to <i>Juniper</i>: “House with a Pool” narrates an abusive scenario in soulful, melancholic tones; “Paris” explores how bittersweet memories have altered her perception of the city of love; and sensual, slow-burn “Carmen” holds up a mirror to Crookes’ relationship with herself. \n\nStar turns come from Vince Staples, who contributes a poetic eight-bar evaluation of jealous rivals to “Pass the Salt,” and Kano, offering the other side of the equation to Crookes’ raw calculation of heartbreak on “Mathematics.” (Listeners may also recognize the resonant backing vocals on warm, retro groove “Somebody to You” as belonging to alt-rock singer-songwriter Sam Fender.) But, of course, it is Crookes herself that shines the brightest, cutting straight to the heart of her expressions and observations with scathing acerbity and exercising the versatility of her distinctive, malleable voice to evocative effect.","tagline":"New

adult-alternative icon jumps back into the fire.","standard":"Sarah McLachlan’s first album of originals in 11 years fortuitously arrives in the same month as the premiere of <i>Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery</i>, a documentary that celebrates the trailblazing legacy of her all-women festival. And in many respects, <i>Better Broken</i> serves the same function in 2025 as Lilith Fair did in the ’90s, by providing a safe space for fans to gather and wallow in all the feels. With boygenius producer Tony Berg behind the boards, <i>Better Broken</i> sees McLachlan effortlessly integrate herself into a contemporary singer-songwriter landscape she helped create, with the title track reintroducing us to the folk-schooled storytelling, trip-hoppy textures, and hair-raising vocal turns that made her an adult-alternative icon. \n\nAs ever, McLachlan masterfully distills relationships to the most intimate details (“I want to feel the shiver/Your fingers writing poetry on my skin,” she sings on the dustbowl devotional “Long Road Home”), while delving into their messy aftermaths with unflinching resolve: The post-breakup piano ballad “Wilderness” just might be the most elegant “fuck you” to an ex ever written. \n\nBut while its songs take the form of deeply personal heart-to-heart conversations, <i>Better Broken</i> is very much tuned into the socio-political tumult weighing on all our lives—the tender piano serenade “Only Human” is the musical equivalent of a shoulder to cry on, with McLachlan offering words of encouragement to beaten-down souls like the world’s most sympathetic life coach. And if McLachlan is several decades removed from her Lilith Fair mobilization efforts, uplifting self-empowerment anthems like “One in a Long Line” and “Rise” show the festival’s feminist fuse still burns brightly inside her.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"Better Broken","playParams":{"id":"1817066446","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/better-broken/1817066446","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1M6hqzklMlxYCA3nyS43KI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817066446/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"111192","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/111192?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758255337546,"RTCI":0}}},"1817272996":{"id":"1817272996","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817272996?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mimi Webb","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mimi-webb/1294518981","artwork":{"bgColor":"bdc0c0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0b0b","textColor2":"161a18","textColor3":"2e2f2f","textColor4":"373b39","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/15/7d/c6/157dc68f-ab70-cb56-54ea-696ac905fb26/196873182421.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"605851","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f9edeb","textColor2":"fbdbd6","textColor3":"dacfcc","textColor4":"dcc0bb","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c8/05/47/c8054734-4db4-8299-3b72-56a6e3b5e4f6/b47bb4bf-5d1d-463f-bd37-bb71c1268e16.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“It’s about unexpected turns”: the viral phenom goes deep on her second LP.","standard":"Mimi Webb’s <i>Confessions</i> is packed with self-assured pop goodness, but the singer-songwriter had so many doubts about it she abandoned her initial ideas. “The first version of the album was completely scrapped,” Webb tells Apple Music Radio. “I wrote it about a year and a half ago and I just freaked out and felt so uninspired. I was like, ‘I can’t sing these bloody songs for the next two years on tour. There’s just no way.’ Even though I had so much love for them, it wasn’t touching the surface for me, it wasn’t deep enough for what I was going through in my day-to-day life.”\n\nWebb admits starting again on the follow-up to 2023’s <i>Amelia</i> was a challenge, but it’s one that left her “very happy.” And putting in that extra shift paid off, with 12 songs that show the emotional range of mid-twenties life. Webb shot to fame in the early 2020s with the Charli D’Amelio-endorsed “Before I Go,” and <i>Confessions</i> finds her diving deeper. Beneath the glossy Y2K R&B of “Kiss My Neck” lies hidden heartbreak, and she offers a tender acceptance of her parents’ split after 30 years of marriage on “You Don’t Look at Me the Same.”\n\nOne of Webb’s favorite tracks on the album is “Mind Reader,” with Meghan Trainor. “We went to her house and we were vibing the whole time writing that one,” she says. There’s also the standout “Love Language,” a tight three minutes of sophisticated pop that sees Webb examining what she wants from a partner. “It changes a lot with age,” she says. “When I was 21, it was gift giving and then as I got older, it’s all acts of service for me, just being a few steps ahead and helping me. If I’m rushing home from work, I’d love a bit of dinner on the table.”\n\nThere was just one more element of uncertainty once <i>Confessions</i> was finished: the title. “I had no idea what I was going to call this album and I was back and forth,” she says. “There’s a lot of positive and a lot of negative in it, and I think that is the story of life. For me, it was about being able to break the fourth wall on this album and dive a lot deeper than the surface levels. It’s about the whole experience of unexpected turns—you never really know what’s around the corner.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Confessions","playParams":{"id":"1817272996","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/confessions/1817272996","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5y1oiAL4x6fLWbnk34J4nw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817272996/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1294518981","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1294518981?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758047184156,"RTCI":0}}},"1817744638":{"id":"1817744638","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817744638?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Favors, FINNEAS & Ashe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1817748454-1138790033-1234718215","artwork":{"bgColor":"ad9c8a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0b0b","textColor2":"131111","textColor3":"2c2824","textColor4":"322d29","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/59/71/32597154-2d4d-158e-fe5b-64ac24de72de/25UMGIM73476.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"565465","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f6f0d6","textColor2":"f6dcbc","textColor3":"d6d1bf","textColor4":"d6c1ab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b9/53/7b/b9537b4f-888c-bc02-6bde-d31231dbb0f5/2dc78b96-e910-493e-8c4b-6dc7009f9a86.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"819194","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"080605","textColor2":"090704","textColor3":"202222","textColor4":"212221","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b0/26/44/b026441d-76d1-56e7-e0f1-bee2a0b42768/4632d5b9-f30c-42ba-88d8-5d15d76f0612.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"FINNEAS and Ashe mine their chemistry to expand on their signature styles.","standard":"On <i>The Dream</i>, FINNEAS and Ashe’s first album together as The Favors, the duo tries their hand at one of the most difficult formats to replicate: the male-female power duo. Think Sonny & Cher, Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra, Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks. The album, which was produced by FINNEAS, features the duo harmonizing over lush orchestral pop and folk arrangements, infusing their signature styles with disco, slow-burning balladry, and country music. Though the collection marks their first time working together on an entire album, they collaborated on Ashe’s 2021 track “Till Forever Falls Apart.” Their relationship dates back even further. In an interview with Zane Lowe, the duo revealed that they met about nine years ago and quickly struck up a friendship. \n\nThat chemistry works its way through the entire album, from the ELO-inspired electropop of the title track to the lounge jazz of “Ordinary People,” which calls to mind another all-time male-female duo: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga. The exciting restlessness of the album’s genre explorations comes from the way their relationship began to build. “I think that our friendship really has a lot to do with a kind of mutual curiosity,” FINNEAS says. “I think that, over the years, I’ve looked at why I feel super affectionately towards somebody. And obviously, people’s talent or energy is important, but I think people’s curiosity is this big, underrepresented societal thing.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Dream","playParams":{"id":"1817744638","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dream/1817744638","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48M39K7MWoYxykqTE2brIi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817744638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1817748454","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1817748454?l=en-US"},{"id":"1138790033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1138790033?l=en-US"},{"id":"1234718215","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1234718215?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758241689417,"RTCI":0}}},"1818104765":{"id":"1818104765","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818104765?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Kanneh-Masons","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-kanneh-masons/1436699481","artwork":{"bgColor":"e94a5f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"030202","textColor2":"030202","textColor3":"311115","textColor4":"311115","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cd/7b/b1/cd7bb1a0-353a-3189-ccbd-7c00bce6e47a/25UMGIM39982.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"acbad0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"120c0a","textColor2":"191311","textColor3":"312e32","textColor4":"363437","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e5/5b/eb/e55beb3c-e822-6289-4cc7-652366ee231a/b4fecc75-b4d6-4f50-ae6d-056aa2bf7b04.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Read our exclusive album commentary by the Kanneh-Mason family.","standard":"The Kanneh-Mason family is a musical phenomenon. Each of its seven siblings—Isata, Braimah, Sheku, Konya, Jeneba, Aminata, and Mariatu—is a world-class musician in their own right. But together they form something incredibly powerful and unique: a supergroup bound together by musical brilliance, childhood memories—and love. \n\n<i>River of Music</i> is their second album together, and is a potent expression of that love, as different combinations of Kanneh-Masons perform together in solo and ensemble music that spans almost four centuries. \n\nRead on, as each work is introduced by family members for this exclusive track-by-track for Apple Music Classical.\n\n<b>Deep River</b>\nSheku: “This is a transcription, originally for piano, of an African-American spiritual by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Coleridge-Taylor was a British composer, whose father was from Sierra Leone. Our mother Kadie was born in Sierra Leone to a Sierra Leonean father and Welsh mother, so this piece feels very personal. \n\n“Isata has previously recorded the original version for piano and Isata, and Braimah and I have also recorded a piano trio version. This is a new arrangement written by us, and it features all seven of us performing.” \n\n<b>Ar Lan y Môr</b>\nAminata: “<i>Ar Lan y Môr</i>—Welsh for ‘On the seashore’—is a traditional Welsh folk love song. We chose this song for the album because, growing up, our grandmother often played the Cerys Matthews album <i>Tir</i> (<i>Land</i>). This song is one of my favorites from that album, so we decided to arrange it for all seven of us. Performing it takes me back to memories from childhood spent in our grandmother’s house in Wales. The piece starts and ends softly with just strings, which creates a calming, peaceful atmosphere.”\n\n<b>Hiraeth</b>\nIsata: “<i>Hiraeth</i> was written by me—its title is the untranslatable Welsh word for longing, love, and connection with one’s homeland. It was chosen for this album because of our own connection with Wales, and the fact that we spent most of our childhood holidays in the mountains there or at our maternal grandmother’s house in Caldicot, South Wales.\n\n“The opening seventh chord represents the feeling of longing, and the sweeping arpeggios in the piano left hand, along with the tremolos and moving semiquavers [sixteenth notes] in the strings, represent the wildness of the Welsh landscape. The way the harmony moves, bar by bar and in parallel chords, represents the way the colors of the landscape appear during a long walk.”\n\n<b>Calon Lân</b> \nAminata: “Welsh for ‘A Pure Heart,’ <i>Calon Lân</i> is a Welsh hymn from the 1890s. I grew up listening to it, and love its beautiful lyrics. We chose to have it as a duet for two violins (me and my brother Braimah) as it feels like two voices singing the hymn together. We really enjoyed building each verse and chorus so that the hymn grows and expands to a soaring climax.”\n\n<b>Trio Sonata in G Minor—Largo</b>\nMariatu: “The third movement of Handel’s Trio Sonata is an intense conversation between the instruments. I chose this piece for the album because Sheku used to play cello duets with me when I was first learning the instrument. Listen out for the sonorous voices of the instruments when they’re playing together, accompanied by our sister Isata on the piano.”\n\n<b>Sospiri</b> \nBraimah: “<i>Sospiri</i> (Italian for ‘Sighs’) is a short, sorrowful piece written by Edward Elgar in 1914 in the shadow of World War I. The spread piano chords, large intervals, and syncopations over the downbeats all create this feeling. The piece is intimate yet expansive, hopeful yet tragic, and is one of my favorite examples of Elgar’s ability to express opposing emotions at the same time. It was a special experience for me to record this in Abbey Road with [record producer] Jonathan Allen.”\n\n<b>Fantaisie-Impromptu</b>\nJeneba: “Chopin’s <i>Fantaisie-Impromptu</i> is a piece that has punctuated nearly every stage of my piano development. It was one of my first introductions to Chopin’s music, and I was instantly drawn to the turbulent passagework and passionate melodies of the first section, and the intimacy and longing of the middle section. The piece was one of my paternal grandad’s favorite pieces, and he would always come in and listen to me practice it.”\n\n\n<b>Consolation No. 3 in D-Flat Major</b>\nIsata: “Liszt’s ‘Consolation No. 3’ (composed between 1849 and 1850) unfolds with extraordinary emotional depth, sustaining a feeling of tenderness and sadness within the promise of consolation. Its fluid phrases create a strong sense of narrative and song. The piece was chosen for the album as it was one of the pieces we would hear our dad perform around the house when we were children. \n\n“It’s an especially interesting piece because Liszt creates an illusion of growing through a single note on the piano (which is, in reality, impossible) through his use of harmonic rhythm and texture. Listen to the way the tune comes back differently every time. Recording this piece was a focused and intimate experience for me.”\n\n<b>Song to the Moon</b>\nSheku: “In ‘Song to the Moon,’ arranged here for cello and piano, Dvořák introduces the theme of singing and love. The music comes from his opera, <i>Rusalka</i>, based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale. Confined to the water, the sprite Rusalka has no way of telling the prince of her love for him, so confesses to the moon instead, in the hope that her feelings will be communicated. Both my parents love opera, and this is one of their favorite arias.”\n\n<b>Piano Quintet in A Major, “Trout Quintet”</b>\nSheku: “The ‘Trout Quintet’ is so nicknamed because the fourth movement features a theme and variations based on Schubert’s song ‘Die Forelle’ (‘The Trout’). We always listened to this piece as children in our parent’s car on long and short journeys, and it is definitely one of our favorites. We wanted to play it when we were young children, but no one played the double bass—Jeneba wanted to learn the instrument, but it was deemed too big to fit in a family car! And so to record this piece was, and will always be, a special moment.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Chamber Music"],"name":"River of Music","playParams":{"id":"1818104765","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/river-of-music/1818104765","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5rvGYRbXGRZcWz7NlW66y2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818104765/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436699481","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436699481?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758263076327,"RTCI":0}}},"1818531286":{"id":"1818531286","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818531286?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Briscoe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/briscoe/1460309805","artwork":{"bgColor":"c4ced7","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"1b1e0d","textColor2":"232112","textColor3":"3d4135","textColor4":"43443a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/49/3e/d8/493ed866-601c-39ad-9015-f0f491e5d3b5/00880882672355_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"3c3e29","gradient":{"color":"3c3e29","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"262718","textColor3":"323535","textColor4":"454840","textGradient":["ffffff","262718"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c6/46/d8/c646d8c9-7be9-bb07-d891-4776d4286dde/Job41830b41-d3f1-4034-b10f-895d9e11ac20-198272253-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388113662_2263768023-Time1753304400215.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"3c3e29","gradient":{"color":"3c3e29","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2c2b19","textColor3":"383c3a","textColor4":"4d4e42","textGradient":["ffffff","2c2b19"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f6/c9/5d/f6c95d23-c013-570e-8db1-52ffde64491c/Job5c3de4ea-4e9e-4e35-90e2-bfeae4555f2d-198272252-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388113661_2263768022-Time1753302833174.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"bed4d3","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0f2826","textColor2":"1c3634","textColor3":"324a49","textColor4":"3c5554","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0f/cc/a8/0fcca8cf-1aab-2e98-fc00-aa14bc81a173/ac8c50c1-b9e8-43cd-a620-8adff045ee4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Austin, Texas, duo explores an eclectic take on country.","standard":"Texas country music is not a monolith, something the quickly rising Austin-based duo Briscoe proves quickly on this full-length collection. Exploring the gentler side of the Lone Star State sound, Briscoe crafts melody-forward, intricately plotted roots music, with principals Philip Lupton and Truett Heintzelman focusing especially on highlighting the complex interplay between their two voices. The duo tapped producer Brad Cook (Waxahatchee, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats) to helm the record and enlisted the talents of Andrew Marlin (acclaimed roots act Watchhouse, formerly known as Mandolin Orange) and multi-hyphenate instrumentalist Phil Cook to join the studio band.\n\nThe resulting sound is fresh and eclectic, blending folk, pop-rock, and just enough twang to keep things country. The title track, with its imagistic lyrics and lush production, would sound at home on a Josh Ritter record, while “Escudilla” uses a breezy-sounding arrangement to tell a story about environmental destruction. Another highlight on <i>Heat of July</i> is “Flashlights in the Canyon,” a compassionate account of the perilous journey often faced by immigrants coming into Texas.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"name":"Heat of July","playParams":{"id":"1818531286","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heat-of-july/1818531286","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0CEGk4q0Vx33fmT0rZUulK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818531286/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1460309805","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1460309805?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758247868711,"RTCI":0}}},"1818782483":{"id":"1818782483","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818782483?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kojey Radical","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kojey-radical/992166757","artwork":{"bgColor":"151616","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f59966","textColor2":"afa5f3","textColor3":"c87e56","textColor4":"9088c7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/36/96/e2/3696e295-dcef-c44e-0dee-55cfad6437cd/5021732803085.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"020304","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e39977","textColor2":"e69950","textColor3":"b67b60","textColor4":"b87b41","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/64/53/95/645395b8-22d6-5b83-1aca-c63f28a3a2b6/Jobdee74e37-655d-4633-a42e-0a07bb4a0254-196967544-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385700758_2243463676-Time1752071414958.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"091b1b","gradient":{"color":"091b1b","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e68d4f","textColor3":"958fac","textColor4":"b87342","textGradient":["ffffff","e68d4f"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4c/1b/4e/4c1b4ea7-2cf1-e126-ba12-84f22e1ed865/Job50ede640-4dc3-45ce-ab9a-5b5abe0d49fb-196967545-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385700759_2243463675-Time1752073159933.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"212c39","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f3e3dd","textColor2":"ece2f1","textColor3":"c9bebc","textColor4":"c3becc","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9f/23/ea/9f23ea04-fa7c-0f05-ed95-f056079cd26d/ba048531-e671-436f-aa6f-78ea842359f0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“There’s still a lot of my life that I’m figuring out,” the UK rap star says.","standard":"“My first project dropped when I was 21 and I was fresh out of uni. Half the things I know now, I didn’t know then,” Kojey Radical tells Apple Music. The multidimensional artist—poet/rapper/musician—has done a lot of growing since emerging in 2014, not least in the three years between the 2022 release of his debut album <i>Reason to Smile</i> and this tightly plotted follow-up. Having ascended to new heights of success (BRIT, Ivor Novello, and Mercury Prize nominations), this record finds Radical caught in the liminal space between two worlds and struggling to feel at home in either one. Inspired by a star-studded, imposter-syndrome-inducing Fashion Week afterparty and a birthday celebration for a close childhood friend that highlighted a rift in their relationship he had been too busy to even notice, <i>Don’t Look Down</i> is Radical’s attempt to reconcile the disconnect.\n\n“I think it’s documenting a time in my life that I would call a transition into real adulthood,” he says. “There’s still a lot of my life that I’m figuring out, and maybe because of the way we’ve all been conditioned to think, there was a guilt in the fact that I hadn’t.” Over the course of the album’s runtime, he dives deep into the core conflicts plaguing his spirit: the artifice of fame; pleasure-seeking and its pitfalls; the pressure to uphold his responsibilities as a friend, a father, a voice for his community. The narrative places him in yet another party environment, occurring in a loop that closes out with Radical locked in a bathroom listening to a voice note from his son in the final seconds of reverential tearjerker “Baby Boy,” forming a seamless connection to opening track “Knock Knock,” where he is summoned back to the festivities and the cycle begins anew. “The bottom half of the album is kind of addressing all these personal relationships that were established in the first half, but seeing the reality of how some of them turn out,” says Radical. “It’s like the duality of some things you can fix, some things you can’t fix, but I guess the most eternal bond is the one between me and my son. [This album] is me writing to him, but also writing to myself and wanting to leave a reminder of what this all was, and why, and that it was all for him.” Read on, as Radical takes us through <i>Don’t Look Down</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Knock Knock”</b>\n“[The other voice on this track] is my boy, Kwoli Black. He’s a UK rapper and one of my more recent best friends. It’s very hard to make close friendships in adulthood, but we’ve managed to build quite a tight brotherly bond. I wanted to include his voice, because that would’ve been him at the door. The poem itself is kind of the prelude to the album. Life was starting to feel like this party had been thrown for me and I didn’t know. I was like, ‘Why is everyone trying to celebrate me? Why do I deserve this?’ And then, ‘What does it mean when people <i>haven’t</i> turned up to celebrate me? Why am I watching those people and not thanking the people that are here? Why don’t I feel at home anywhere?’ It’s asking these questions so we can answer them throughout the album.”\n\n<b>“Rotation”</b>\n“This is me stepping out into the party, but then using it as a way of narrating the times that we’re in now. ‘Did the most for minimum wages/Took a little debt for syllabus pages.’ It’s like we go from this institution to that institution and everything’s in a circle. Even me—this internal dialogue of ‘I want to vibes too. I want to shoobs it up, I want to smoke it up, I want to drink it up,’ but at the same time, I’ve got something to say…and not being sure if people even want to hear me say that. It’s like being conscious almost becomes this prison when actually we’re all conscious of what we’re doing and when we’re doing it. But I think some people are given the gift of being able to articulate it and it’s like, ‘Do I use that or do I not?’ I like to juxtapose moments of confusion or angst with music that we can dance to and celebrate to, so the message is hidden in the funk drums and this innate groove that makes you want to move immediately.”\n\n<b>“Rule One” (feat. Bawo)</b>\n“The concept for the song actually came from this show that I did many, many moons ago. It was an Afro-punk show. They had the rules for the party by the side of the stage and it was like, ‘No homophobia, no racism, no this, no that.’ As an image, it always stuck with me. Even in this gathering of rejoicing and celebrating, there are still rules of engagement. There are still ways that we have to handle ourselves. There’s a lot of responsibility you feel music-wise to drive that, but also again, make music that people can just vibe to and feel themselves to and feel empowered to. So I think ‘Rule One’ is just me setting the precedent for dos and don’ts.”\n\n<b>“Drinking My Water” (feat. MNEK)</b>\n“At any kind of big function, unless I’m ready for the dance floor, I like being out of the way. I like observing and seeing what’s going on. Especially when you can’t bring your people. You have to make acquaintances with people like, ‘OK, we’ll ride out these next three hours together, because we don’t know no one else here.’ That’s this song for me. And life is different for me now. I feel alien to the people around me. If I jump on a call with my bredrins and everyone’s chit-chatting about a normal life, how am I supposed to say, ‘Oh, I just did this campaign, met that person, got paid this much, went to sleep…’? It’s a reminder that I’m quiet, but I’m not sad. I’m fine. I call it an introvert anthem.”\n\n<b>“Long Day” (feat. Dende)</b>\n“I was indulging in the fruits that came with the labor, and some fruit is great for you and some fruit isn’t. I was spending a lot of time eating fruit that should have been forbidden. The indulgence is pleasure and a lot of the time, we’re just pleasure-seeking. It becomes a crutch, or the answer to a long day, and you realize that your whole energy towards it is toxic [too]. The interlude at the end where I’m talking to Kwoli mimics conversations we’ve had in real life where I’ll be in that long-day state of mind. It leads into ‘On Call’ which is the story of me trying to understand if I like love or if I love love.”\n\n<b>“On Call” (feat. James Vickery)</b>\n“I wanted to a play on ‘Ms. Fat Booty’ by Mos Def [the artist now known as Yasiin Bey]. I’m doing a lot of ‘Ms. Fat Booty’ references where I’m having a conversation with a woman called Love, who’s the embodiment of love throughout the album. As I meet her, she’s very quick to be like, ‘I see through you,’ and the idea of her seeing through me almost becomes the challenge. She’s got to be on call, because she’s someone I can feel vulnerable in front of. I’ve always wanted to do a storyteller-style song like that, because I grew up on so much hip-hop that really took me on a journey. James Vickery slid on that hook and everything about it is just reminiscent of something I hold dear to me, in terms of hip-hop.”\n\n<b>“Expensive” (feat. Planet Giza)</b>\n“The Pocket Queen is an amazing drummer from America. She works with Swindle and she had given us these drum grooves. ‘Expensive’ was one and ‘Conversations’ was another. As soon as we heard it, it was like, ‘There’s something about this that’s immediate and sexy,’ and everything started to build itself. It’s going to sound crazy, but I wanted to give women the chance to feel like Alesha Dixon in the N.E.R.D ‘She Wants to Move’ video. That was my whole goal with this record. How do I give the listener that feeling of: the show is stopped, the lights are on, shock out, no one cares, do what you’re doing?”\n\n<b>“Problems” (feat. Cristale)</b>\n“Now we’re at the midpoint of the album, where we’ve looked at how the change of lifestyle leads you to overindulge in things that aren’t really tangible. They’re just fleeting moments that make you feel all the endorphins of moving in the right direction, but nothing’s figured out. How do you even explain to somebody what your problems are when you’re in this middle point of success? In the grand scheme of things, my wants and needs are very simple, but to get there is a very complicated process. Yes, I’m happy and I’m working and I’m successful, but I feel like I should be saying more, doing more, I shouldn’t be around certain people, I need to lock in, I need to cut people off. It’s creating a party out of this angst and taking it to church a little bit.”\n\n<b>“Conversation”</b>\n“We’re into the angsty part of the album. The rat race of life. Trying to understand the transition between your twenties and your thirties and put what that feels like into audio format. Having to be a provider, an understander, and an activist all in one day, because the powers that be aren’t doing what they need to be doing for us. Everything’s more visual, we can see it. One story is somebody getting glammed up to go out, the next one is children being lost in wars. We’re so desensitized to it. The speed makes you feel like you’re tapping away at that speed. Next thing, next thing, next thing, next thing. When are we going to stop to talk about it? When do we have this conversation?”\n\n<b>“Communication” (feat. Benjamin AD)</b>\n“Ben’s interlude is like stepping outside the party for a second. The wind hits you and it’s like, ‘Rah. Life does go on.’ There’s so many things I’ve missed out on. People still hold space, but they don’t see the grind I’ve been on. You don’t realize how long you’ve been inside until you step outside. And sometimes you’re afraid to see that the party continues even after you leave.”\n\n<b>“Life of the Party”</b>\n“The second verse was written about a trip that I took to Sydney. The promoter asked me to do a paid walk-through at this club. It’s just gyal everywhere. I know they don’t know whose section they’re in, so I’m just walking around, normal, ‘Hi everyone, how are you doing, my name’s Kojey,’ but I’ve not said it’s my section. Then they bring over this Patron and it’s got my name in sparklers. So now all these gyal clock this is my section and everyone’s energy changes. And I can’t blame them, because they’re looking for their opportunity to even have a taste of whatever lifestyle they think this is. And none of it’s real. I’m sat here surrounded by what is unequivocally fake love, thinking back to everything I know from back home. I’m from an estate in Hackney—I want to be around my people. But no one’s here. It’s just me. It’s that feeling of being the center of attention, but also feeling isolated by that attention. And not being able to talk about how that makes you feel is even more isolating.”\n\n<b>“Breathe” (feat. Col3trane)</b>\n“That’s the crash out. And when I crash out it’s like bravado because the ego takes over. None of you could tell me nothing. So it’s that crescendo of ego and isolation. You can hear the children’s choir out there and the voices from everywhere almost feel like they’re taunting you. And even though I’ve got this moment to breathe, there’s still one person I want to talk to. As much as I’ve got all this stuff around me, I’m still looking for Love. I met her before. I ain’t even acknowledged her since I met her. But guess who I’m going to call when I’m all drunk and dizzy or whatever? And it happens at the end of the song. I want to talk to this person that has very clearly seen through me and seen through all of this, but since I met her—and it was done this way on purpose—we ain’t heard from her. Until it feels like everything’s on top of me.”\n\n<b>“Curtains” (feat. SOLOMON)</b>\n“It starts like, ‘I really do love this person. I love you…(bitch). Like, damn, why you make me feel these feelings! Ugh!’ But then I’m sat there and I’m trying to ask myself, ‘What did I do to show this person that I felt that way?’ And I’m running out of answers every next line. Even down to moments when I could have said it and I didn’t say it. This is openly as raw as I can sing what was happening with that, and how left it went because of me. This might be the only opportunity that I get to say it that way, because I know even the person in question doesn’t want to hear it. The song ends like, ‘If you ever hear this, just call me, because I would rather say this to you than say it on a song. But as long as I’ve said it, it’s been said.’ A lot of the time, these are things that are reminders to me to be like, ‘All right, your mistakes have allowed you to make a beautiful song out of it, but repeating these mistakes makes this who you are.’ Anyway, she’s heard the song. She hated it.”\n\n<b>“Comfortable” (feat. Jaz Karis)</b>\n“I was trying to write this as the welcome-back-to-the-streets accountability anthem, where I’ve had this conversation with Love and realized I didn’t do enough to show Love that she was loved, and now I’ve lost Love. Sometimes people hear that song and think I’m saying that she’d done something wrong and I got too comfortable. No. I did something wrong by getting too comfortable. I cared just enough to feel let down by the fact that we can’t work this out. And it’s like, ‘Well, I tried and trying wasn’t enough and that’s OK, I’ll just have to go back to the old me.’ That’s always our first reaction: I’ll give up, I’ll just go back to it then. That’s getting too comfortable in leaning into your flaws and not acknowledging that you need to do something about it.”\n\n<b>“Everyday”</b>\n“Another super vulnerable one. We’re talking about, in the midst of loss, you fall back on your vices. A lot of my vices were there to help me deal with my own personal insecurities, so you have these verses where I’m kind of self-examining and breaking myself down. And a lot of people thought I was still talking about Love when they first heard this song. Nope. That chorus is about my dealer. Love doesn’t always have to be a person. Sometimes love can be a vice. Creating these songs that everybody can sing together is how I escaped from the loneliness of all these feelings. ‘Everyday’ never takes me more than 10 seconds to teach a crowd, and by the time the chorus comes around everyone can sing it with me.”\n\n<b>“Baby Boy” (feat. Ghetts, Chrissi)</b>\n“I was sat with [producer] Owen Cutts and we were talking for two hours about the reality of entering a co-parent situation and the effects that has on you, trying to choose your own happiness, so you can still be the best parent you can be, as opposed to being that reflection of parents that we saw that stayed unhappy and took that out on their children in weird ways. Being able to get the perspective from an older father, Ghetts, for me is like…it’s him talking to his son, but also, everything that I wish my dad would have pulled up and said to me. And Owen did the big one on that. He made sure everybody that worked on the record were dads themselves. From instrumentation to lyrics it’s written with the intention of being a real, genuine checkpoint for fatherhood. I wanted it to be this moment that feels like a resolve on a lot of the topics that were brought up the album. And the answer to what my idea of home is: my son’s voice. That always snaps it back into the reality of all this make-believe. This is your real life. Come back here.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Don't Look Down","playParams":{"id":"1818782483","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-look-down/1818782483","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1RAGs6JnmurAIytKWIbAxX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818782483/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"992166757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/992166757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758226729110,"RTCI":0}}},"1819085978":{"id":"1819085978","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819085978?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lola Young","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lola-young/452271760","artwork":{"bgColor":"e3e3e3","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1e1613","textColor2":"3a2f24","textColor3":"453f3c","textColor4":"5c534a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ba/49/f2/ba49f247-d1b3-518f-0eee-22c6bbf63c0e/25UMGIM74990.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"241a15","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"504744","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/00/28/c5/0028c5e7-4b79-6ab2-dc8c-145c649724ba/Job50691ddc-ec22-40a8-baf3-50d48421a0c5-195208680-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382507270_2212812767-Time1750335308458.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"26191b","gradient":{"color":"26191b","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"332821","textColor3":"3f3a3a","textColor4":"5c534e","textGradient":["ffffff","332821"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9f/35/30/9f3530b4-2f6e-fb20-37c6-834227f59152/Jobfafaee19-9c87-4a7a-ae7d-8879230b114e-195208679-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382507421_2212812421-Time1750334420267.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"cc9389","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"090807","textColor2":"1d1512","textColor3":"302421","textColor4":"402e2a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/b5/ee/efb5ee50-07d4-3827-c81d-868598a1638b/c7d208ed-5828-4144-9d8e-8c3cd85fa46e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f1eef1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"080806","textColor2":"2e2c29","textColor3":"373635","textColor4":"555351","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d2/0a/dc/d20adcf2-faae-f796-7807-eccef0071c2f/de6d25e4-b4a4-4dbd-9844-386b29970c07.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“It’s a bit of a curveball”: Lola Young serves self-love, sass, and survival.","standard":"Following up a global hit like “Messy” is an intimidating job. But Lola Young was never in any doubt about her next move. The South London singer-songwriter took the authenticity she’d shared in the anthem to being your imperfect self and doubled down on it.\n\n<i>I’m Only F**king Myself</i> finds Young teetering on the brink of superstardom, with her turbulent past still looming large in her memory. Breakups, hookups, and leaving her vices behind are all covered in a raw, straight-talking but playful style that suggests she’s learned her resilience and grit the hard way. “It digs a bit deeper for me, for sure,” Young tells Apple Music. “There are a lot of different genres and influences on there, but I would say it was a reflection of where I was at in my life. It’s very of its time as well.”\n\nThe album comes little more than a year after 2024’s <i>This Wasn’t Meant for You Anyway</i>, but Young felt a sense of urgency. “I was in a weird place mentally, but felt confident, so I needed to get something out,” she says. “It’s bit of a curveball, but there are definitely some hidden gems in there. And there are some songs that people will love if they love ‘Messy.’”\n\nYoung worked with her long-term collaborators Manuka (Conor Dickinson and Will Brown), who co-wrote “Messy,” and Grammy-winning producer Solomonophonic (SZA, Doja Cat), so there was already a level of trust there. “I’ve been working with them since the very beginning of my career, so I can pass ideas off of them, going back and forth,” she says. “They’re incredible collaborators and people to be around, so they help with energy as well. I get so comfortable, I don’t need to say what I’m feeling.”\n\n<i>I’m Only F**king Myself</i> comes with a manifesto that’s as bold and complex as Young herself. “I hope it makes people feel less alone. I hope it makes people feel empowered and free,” she says. “Find a piece of themselves that they can cherish. Love themselves or hate themselves, whatever they want to feel while they’re listening to it. And have a good cry at certain points too.” Read on as Young takes you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“F**K EVERYONE”</b>\n“This captures a moment. I wanted to embody something confident, fun, and free for the first track. My producer Jared [Solomon, aka Solomonophonic] was playing the chords, which are kind of punky, early-2000s, but heavily alternative with distorted, crunchy guitars. Then he made a sample out of his voice and started going around with that grating sound that happens throughout the song. Jared is very much a sound person, and he’s incredible at making those little ear-candy moments in a song.”\n\n<b>“One Thing”</b>\n“‘One Thing’ is a liberating song about how women shouldn’t feel constricted by social or societal norms around how they should be having sex. It’s about wanting one thing from somebody and not being concerned about what they want, or how you should feel towards a one-night stand or someone in a relationship. When you don’t want to take it further and you don’t want to fall in love. I’m not an activist, but I’m aware that by showing my body and being confident in the way I look and the way I naturally am, I can hopefully bring out a lot of confidence in people.”\n\n<b>“d£aler”</b>\n“I do love ‘d£aler.’ I think it’s a hopeful song. A lot of the chords are very uplifting and so is the sentiment, even though there’s a sad undertone. That’s what makes ‘d£aler’ special. It’s not my favorite track on the album at the moment, but that can change day by day and I still love performing it. I love that it’s an uplifting song, but it’s got a sad message. It’s definitely one that goes a bit deeper for me.”\n\n<b>“SPIDERS”</b>\n“‘SPIDERS’ is one of my favorite tracks at the moment. I love everything about it. It’s very big and ‘feeling’ and it’s got that kind of ’90s indie influence. I love the line, ‘I’m not a woman if I don’t have you,’ which is about unity and co-existing. Making the video was a really nice experience, actually. I had to hold a tarantula, so I overcame a lot of my fears, which I guess is what this song’s about. It wasn’t easy, but that’s the whole point of it.”\n\n<b>“Penny Out of Nothing”</b>\n“I think ‘Penny…’ might surprise people. It’s a different vibe for me, for sure. The chords are kind of bossa nova, but a bit psychedelic. This track was recorded in Rue Boyer, a studio in Paris, but we moved around a bit for the rest of the album. Some of it was recorded in New York and some of it was on my own. The lyrics on this are freestyle, off the top of my head, saying how I felt. I usually work quite freely with that. Sometimes, if I’m writing on my own, it’s a different experience and I write almost subconsciously—getting the first thing that comes to mind down, and then I flesh it out or edit it.”\n\n<b>“Walk All Over You”</b>\n“After hearing ‘Penny…’ and going into that darkness, I wanted to bring it back into the light. When I’m writing the sadder songs, I’m often not thinking about an experience, but the feeling in general and how that can manifest itself in different ways in the music. This one’s more uplifting—I wrote it on my own in my bedroom, and I really like that idea of putting shoes on and then walking all over someone. It’s got character and it’s sassy.”\n\n<b>“Post Sex Clarity”</b>\n“This one is about a brief relationship I had with someone. It’s about that situation when you really felt you were interested and beyond in them, and you feel accepted, wanted, seen, and understood by them. Again, it’s one of my favorites. That line, ‘I still love you and I don’t know why,’ sums up that feeling. Obviously, on the flip of the word, it’s like having that intimate moment with someone and realizing that you still feel really amazingly about them, but you’re not together.”\n\n<b>“SAD SOB STORY! :)”</b>\n“The vocal on this is quite theatrical, which I love. It’s a storytelling song about a relationship that I had for a long time—and coming out of it and not wanting to hear that bullshit, not wanting to hear them trying to crawl back to you. As I get further away from these experiences, they do still hit me, but they also feel a bit distant because obviously I’m traveling so much. There’s that physical distance, and I’m looking at it from the situation I’m in now. The lyric ‘Life’s about learning’ is how sometimes it can show you things the hard way or in a really beautiful way. I’m definitely showcasing a different side of my experiences on this record.”\n\n<b>“CAN WE IGNORE IT? :(”</b>\n“This just flowed out. It’s about wanting to ignore my feelings and needing other people to do the same—and letting go and wanting to escape. I wanted it to feel very dark and raw, but also energetic and high-tempo. Usually, the first thing that comes out when I’m writing sticks, and the lyrics always flow out of me.”\n\n<b>“why do i feel better when i hurt you?”</b>\n“It’s a really soulful and powerful song about a toxic relationship and it’s one of my favorite vocals I’ve done. I wanted a sad, ballad moment on the album as a bit of variation. Putting the tracks in order came quite naturally. I did move them around and try different things, but this is the way that stuck and moved me the most.”\n\n<b>“Not Like That Anymore”</b>\n“This track is about me pulling myself out of a really self-destructive time. It’s hopeful because it’s about looking past that and finding new ways to feel happy. For me, that’s spending time with friends, music <i>always</i>, poetry, being present, and having small moments with people that I love. Instead of going to substances or something else that’s a quick dopamine release, it’s worth finding subtle moments. Of course, it becomes harder sometimes, but you can find a way of making it feel a little easier. It’s still a process and an ongoing journey for me.”\n\n<b>“who f**king cares?”</b>\n“This vocal started out as a voice memo on my phone and the way it was recorded is the way I released it. I didn’t want to change anything about it, so it went straight onto the album. It’s a very sad song, and I wrote it very quickly about where I was in my life and what I was feeling at that moment. There’s a glimmer of hope in there as well, which is a theme running throughout the album.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"I’m Only F**king Myself","playParams":{"id":"1819085978","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/im-only-f-king-myself/1819085978","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5jUCvcrzCNng7N3iNVY4ts"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819085978/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"452271760","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/452271760?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758273420938,"RTCI":0}}},"1819975338":{"id":"1819975338","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819975338?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"John Prine","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/john-prine/157060","artwork":{"bgColor":"ae8a6d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070504","textColor2":"070504","textColor3":"281f19","textColor4":"281f19","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1a/0c/1e/1a0c1e11-4b23-d470-dfe3-d176d7d59cfa/55403.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Prine’s 1995 rootsy classic, enriched with alternate versions and demos.","standard":"Produced by Howie Epstein, <i>Lost Dogs + Mixed Blessings</i> was a new approach for John Prine. The band features master players from the L.A. studio scene, including guitarist Waddy Wachtel, multi-instrumentalist John Jorgenson, keyboardist Benmont Tench, and bassist Bob Glaub. Unsurprisingly, the result sounds more than a little like ’90s-era Tom Petty; that’s not a bad thing, especially on “Lake Marie,” “Same Thing Happened to Me,\" and “New Train.” The nondescript production of “We Are the Lonely” disguises what are easily some of Prine’s most hilariously self-deprecating lyrics: “White divorced swinging male/Seeks company to no avail/Worthless ruthless toothless man/Wants wealthy woman with a plan.” As much as fans and producers might want to try out new styles on Prine, there’s no denying the effect of “Day Is Done,” “This Love Is Real,\" and “He Forgot That It Was Sunday,” which essentially feature his voice and an acoustic guitar. Such songs provide a pleasure equal to watching fresh bread rise in a clay oven. But the real jewel is the closer, “I Love You So Much It Hurts,” a sweetly askew piano ballad worthy of Nilsson or Newman.","tagline":"New Deluxe

rock trio emerges from doubt emboldened, inventive, and united.","standard":"After the lockdown-encouraged bout of productivity that spawned two albums in 14 months—2020’s <i>A Celebration of Endings</i> and <i>The Myth of the Happily Ever After</i> (2021)—Biffy Clyro slipped into a period of inactivity and uncertainty. Wearied by the joyless experiences of COVID, the trio ended their 2022 tour with the decision to take some time out to rest and reflect on what should be next for Biffy—if anything. Singer/guitarist Simon Neil indulged in some creative throat-clearing, hawking up the abrasive, pummeling metal of 2023’s <i>Rivers of Heresy</i>, the debut album by his rock supergroup Empire State Bastard. As much as he enjoyed making and touring that record though, he found himself missing melody and the consuming hooks that had elevated the Kilmarnock trio—completed by brothers Ben (drums) and James Johnston (bass)—into one of Britain’s biggest rock bands across their nine albums.\n\nNeil began to write new Biffy songs at the piano, the first full one to emerge being the tender “Goodbye,” which sits at the midpoint of this album. A song about needing to distance yourself from loved ones to remind yourself why you love them, it reveals how the three of them were able to escape their own individual doubts about the band to make one of their strongest records to date. Neil has pitched the album as one that contemplates relationships and thoughts that endure through our lives, and allusions to the brotherhood of Biffy regularly emerge. If the title of “Woe Is Me, Wow Is You” speaks to that rare kind of band who have managed to ascend to rock stardom without ever taking themselves too seriously, then its content is all about the trio’s teak-tough bond. It was written by Neil as an account of their time together, and the vulnerability of the verses evaporates as the chorus erupts with “We believe in the concept/We defy the impossible…This ship is built to last.”\n\nBiffy aren’t just doing this for their love of each other though. They’ve often interrogated the purpose of an album before making one—lest they ever start churning out records just because that’s what they’re <i>supposed</i> to do. So while they prove characteristically adept at transitioning from fierce riffs and jittery time signatures to choruses that sound like sun blistering through rain clouds (“A Little Love,” “Two People in Love”), they continue to test the boundaries of festival-headlining rock. “It’s Chemical!” is what happens when Biffy bend big beat, baggy, and Britpop to their will and “Dearest Amygdala” nods so strongly to glossy ’80s pop, it demands to be played on a keytar with your suit sleeves rolled up.","tagline":"New

JUNO Award-winning 2024 EP <i>Complicated</i> and arriving six years after the release of his first single, 2019’s “If You Were a Song.” Accordingly, the Matt Geroux-produced album sounds confident and sturdy, with the kind of radio-friendly country that first found Ross fans in and outside of his native Ontario and would later earn him honors like back-to-back Canadian Country Music Association Award Entertainer of the Year wins. \n\nThe album opens with its title track, a sweet and poppy breakup song with the gritty soul of Kip Moore and the R&B influence of Sam Hunt. “Hate How You Look” is arena-ready with its prominent kick drum and soaring chorus, and features the kind of sticky melody that characterizes much of Ross’ music. Other highlights include closing track “Scared of Getting Sober,” a vulnerable song about navigating heartbreak, and “Single Again,” which earned Ross his first No. 1 country song in the United States. <i>Later Tonight</i> also features fan favorite “Drunk Right Now (Na Na Na),” a collaboration with Akon that plays off the pop star/rapper’s 2008 hit single “Right Now (Na Na Na).” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Later Tonight","playParams":{"id":"1825871410","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/later-tonight/1825871410","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7hAMjXvMKlllp6f3WZatdD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825871410/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1476860883","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1476860883?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758254831297,"RTCI":0}}},"1825872508":{"id":"1825872508","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825872508?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Astonvilla","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/astonvilla/15077695","artwork":{"bgColor":"4a433c","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f7efe8","textColor2":"ecddd3","textColor3":"d5cdc5","textColor4":"cbbeb5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/13/92/b0/1392b0ae-39fb-32af-b20a-3341e43ff9eb/4099964180459.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Aston Villa (Édition 30ème anniversaire)","playParams":{"id":"1825872508","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"1996","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aston-villa-%C3%A9dition-30%C3%A8me-anniversaire/1825872508"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825872508/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15077695","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15077695?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267185018,"RTCI":0}}},"1826198222":{"id":"1826198222","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826198222?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Nine Inch Nails","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nine-inch-nails/107917","artwork":{"bgColor":"020000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e5e5e5","textColor2":"f80001","textColor3":"b8b7b7","textColor4":"c70001","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/76/79/21/767921a2-c9d0-9618-32a3-ebe8fcb9c723/25UMGIM93266.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f90101","textColor2":"f70101","textColor3":"c70101","textColor4":"c50101","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bd/ab/87/bdab878b-3ab1-b29c-ef5e-0835c3d68a46/Job59541608-f518-499d-ad37-bf5e7b9f0946-203220807-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397369446_2340031755-Time1757965615669.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f80101","textColor3":"b7b7b7","textColor4":"c70101","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/13/24/32/1324323b-be03-92fd-cf1d-1b6043dff114/Jobef400e08-c772-4f32-9385-bd97ea345a18-203220806-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397369447_2340031756-Time1757963799975.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1dfd2","textColor2":"c8c2bd","textColor3":"c4b6ab","textColor4":"a39e9b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/15/d7/04/15d70449-9c6a-c419-9b99-b7fc1eb0e577/cfd9ca74-96ec-4d5e-bcdc-a20c64f02980.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Reznor ’n’ Ross mix moody instrumentals with futurist bangers.","standard":"Since the early 2010s, Trent Reznor has been leading a double life: As he continued to lead industrial-rock agitators Nine Inch Nails through arenas around the world, he also reinvented himself as the award-winning soundtrack composer (alongside longtime collaborator Atticus Ross) for prestige big-screen fare like <i>The Social Network</i> and <i>Challengers</i>. But <i>TRON: Ares</i>—the long-awaited third entry in Disney’s future-shocked franchise—is the first Reznor ’n’ Ross score to be released under the NIN name. And really, the brand synergy is perfect: As an entity that’s always thrived on the violent tension between man and machine, Nine Inch Nails is an ideal avatar for TRON’s blinding-lights vision of AI run amok. \n\nHowever, when heard outside its cinematic context, <i>TRON: Ares</i> feels like it could be another entry in NIN’s experimental album series <i>Ghosts</i>, presenting a sprawling 24-track collage of dreamy piano interstitials (“Echoes”), lo-tech techno (“This Changes Everything”), swelling ’70-sci-fi synthphonies (“100% Expendable”), dramatic, pulse-pounding set pieces (“Daemonize”), and brain-bending avant-electronic eruptions (“New Directive”). \n\nAt the same time, <i>TRON: Ares</i> is greatly distinguished from the duo’s previous film collaborations by the inclusion of some Reznor-led strobe-lit ragers (”As Alive as You Need Me to Be,” “Shadow Over Me”) that would be right at home in NIN’s classic ’90s canon.

and Stevie’s historic 1973 debut finally gets its own moment in the sun.","standard":"“We’re old enough now that we’ve laid down our weapons,” Stevie Nicks told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2012. She was talking not only about potential songs for a new Fleetwood Mac album, but also her fabled, contentious, and musically revelatory relationship with Lindsey Buckingham. The 40th anniversary of their debut together, 1973’s <i>Buckingham Nicks</i>, was quickly nearing, so she was hoping for a deluxe box set and a grand tour where they reunited their old band to play that album end-to-end. Trouble was, though, that Buckingham wasn’t entirely on board, telling <i>Rolling Stone</i> a week later that her plan would be “economically suicidal.” Some dynamics are hard to change, and <i>Buckingham Nicks</i>—one of the most famous footnotes in rock ’n’ roll history—remained out of print beyond even its 50th anniversary. At last, it is back.\n\nThe early incarnation of Fleetwood Mac was stumbling out of the smoky ’60s haze when producer Keith Olsen played Mick Fleetwood a track from a debut he’d just produced by a handsome duo called Buckingham Nicks. Their record barely sold or generated much interest at all, but Fleetwood was so struck by what he heard that he wanted the guitarist in his own band. Buckingham, however, insisted that his girlfriend and harmony partner come along for what turned into one of music’s most infamous rides—a nonpareil hit factory fueled by breakup, blow, and betrayal. \n\nYou can hear the sparks that led to Fleetwood Mac’s subsequent masterpieces so clearly in these 10 tracks. Nicks’ nasal command cuts perfectly against Buckingham’s chiming guitar during “Long Distance Winner,” creating an irresistible frisson, while the pair’s all-uppers energy during “Don’t Let Me Down Again” predicts the excitement they’d soon put on the radio. Buckingham plays so beautifully during the brief instrumental “Stephanie,” while Nicks manages to be both mellow and menacing during “Races Are Run,” finding the steely willpower that would soon make her a permanent star. It is easy to hear these songs half a century later and wonder how these two didn’t make it as a duo. Turns out, they first had to change the way we heard rock songs with a band before we could truly appreciate how charmed this set, at last faithfully restored, actually was and is.","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Pop"],"name":"Buckingham Nicks","playParams":{"id":"1827113805","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"1973-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/buckingham-nicks/1827113805"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827113805/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1205332165","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1205332165?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758251235388,"RTCI":0}}},"1827507396":{"id":"1827507396","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827507396?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"twenty one pilots","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twenty-one-pilots/349736311","artwork":{"bgColor":"311a18","hasP3":false,"height":1425,"textColor1":"f69584","textColor2":"fc5243","textColor3":"ce7c6e","textColor4":"d3473b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1a/13/dc/1a13dc15-b07d-c302-4f04-080b67591628/075679609908.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1425},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"150908","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f69384","textColor2":"fb4b3c","textColor3":"c9786b","textColor4":"cd3e31","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/cd/76/ce/cd76cedb-ea3e-5026-27c8-546869a93ef1/Jobed891538-ae3c-4a96-a507-f464fd1fd657-202489090-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396101106_2329270948-Time1757359693571.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"110706","gradient":{"color":"110706","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fc4d3e","textColor3":"d16558","textColor4":"d24135","textGradient":["ffffff","fc4d3e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/74/32/58/7432589c-da09-62f1-296b-aa1d5f0f7b34/Job8f9ffd28-fe18-4023-ad42-dce41d6519dc-202489091-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396101105_2329270947-Time1757361075182.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"200c08","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f54f40","textColor2":"ea5041","textColor3":"ca4234","textColor4":"c24236","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/81/f3/eb/81f3ebad-cdda-141a-930f-d0f12d663aa3/499c9f5f-f4d5-4635-abe2-04ccd7c821ba.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"bbb9b5","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b0b0d","textColor2":"181819","textColor3":"2e2e2e","textColor4":"393838","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cb/c7/84/cbc7849a-3a0b-a7f0-ec5f-a7ec3c0c62b2/dcb8d530-9517-4735-a2ee-d7d2f013670c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A dense rap-rock dystopia populated by robots and necromancers.","standard":"Since blowing up in 2015 with their fourth album, <i>Blurryface</i>, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have parlayed their high-concept rap-rock-pop hybrid into massive mainstream success.

Through a dense rap-rock dystopia populated by robots and necromancers, the duo fight through bouts of insecurity (“Garbage”) and paranoia (“The Contract,” which recruits YUNGBLUD to continue where last year’s “Paladin Strait” left off). “Did you learn a thing?” Joseph sings on the haunting closing track, looking back on the decade-long journey and concluding: “Intentions will set you free.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Breach","playParams":{"id":"1827507396","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/breach/1827507396","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1El3k8dU3sKyoGUeuyrolH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827507396/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"349736311","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/349736311?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758266495214,"RTCI":0}}},"1828766093":{"id":"1828766093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828766093?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Toro y Moi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/toro-y-moi/312848073","artwork":{"bgColor":"784b2c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fab67f","textColor2":"f8a767","textColor3":"e0a06f","textColor4":"de945b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/72/6d/61/726d61b0-8500-83dc-7f2d-7030da6bf17b/57541.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chaz Bear strips back 2024’s Hole Erth to its warm essence.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Unerthed: Hole Erth Unplugged","playParams":{"id":"1828766093","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/unerthed-hole-erth-unplugged/1828766093","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZjpUdKgDpQxvIBq3bINsx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828766093/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"312848073","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/312848073?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758234879424,"RTCI":0}}},"1828913217":{"id":"1828913217","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828913217?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chase Rice","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chase-rice/412047193","artwork":{"bgColor":"644d28","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dff0e3","textColor2":"dde7d2","textColor3":"c6cfbe","textColor4":"c5c8b0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2f/88/5b/2f885bf3-707a-e6f2-55e1-069b1ca90567/8721215831495.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"eaeaea","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"121111","textColor2":"1f1c1c","textColor3":"3d3c3d","textColor4":"474545","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ac/2f/c5/ac2fc590-24da-b078-3e58-7f27354a13ca/3562a12a-34a5-4602-8617-99a11a098bb5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An ambitious statement that continues a new chapter.","standard":"With 2024’s <i>Go Down Singin’</i>, country star Chase Rice kicked off a new chapter in his career. The “Eyes on You” hitmaker had parted ways with the major-label system and wanted to reintroduce himself—something he continues on this ambitious and unexpected full-length collection. Written over the course of a few days after Rice performed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, <i>ELDORA</i> was a team effort, with Foy Vance, Wyatt McCubbin, and producer Oscar Charles serving as co-writers across the album’s dozen tracks. \n\nOpener “Cowboy Goodbye” is a spare ballad that almost sounds like a demo, capturing the intimacy at the heart of the album’s creation. The title track is similarly unadorned, as Rice sings mournfully of hitting the road from Tennessee to the titular Colorado town. “Tall Grass” features contributions from Alabama-born up-and-comer Kashus Culpepper and “My Boy” singer-songwriter Elvie Shane, with the trio turning in a soulful account of wishing for a better world for future generations. Rice teams up with traditionalist McCubbin on “Two Tone Trippin’,” an old-school barnburner with electric guitar by Music Row mainstay Charlie Worsham. And Madeline Edwards joins Rice on “Country & Western,” a brooding ballad with sultry vocals and a mysterious vibe.","tagline":"New

Endeared to ’90s-meets-2000s R&B aesthetics yet skillfully refurbished with modern Southern hip-hop appeal, 2024’s <i>u made me a st4r</i> provided a more complete picture of the type of artist he aimed to be. “I just was dealing with a lot of pressure going in my last project,” he tells Apple Music. “I had to settle down and remind myself that I could still do this.”\n\nFor his follow-up <i>Still Shinin</i>, sporting solid features from Texas rappers Maxo Kream and Zillionaire Doe, his endeavors to self-define and self-assess continue to progress in his favor. “We from Texas, so it hit different,” he says. “We showing y’all the culture right now, man.”\n\nWith Swishahouse co-founder and Chopstars DJ OG Ron C frequently popping in as a mixtape-styled host, the project furthers 4batz’s episodic escapades via the grindset romantics of “act x: n da mornin” and the lusty versatility of “act xiii: my lil shootah.” Production-wise, a woozy gloss coats just about every track, applying an ethereal, otherworldly quality to “act xiv: twerksongggg” and the knowing throwback “act xii: big on u.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Still Shinin","playParams":{"id":"1834409258","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-shinin/1834409258","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5NUNaj9pyIjcNd5e9ObgzE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834409258/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1694556206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1694556206?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267816851,"RTCI":0}}},"1834785393":{"id":"1834785393","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834785393?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lola Kirke","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lola-kirke/1160910059","artwork":{"bgColor":"71b3cd","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"150b05","textColor2":"370808","textColor3":"272d2d","textColor4":"432a30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/95/07/e1950787-8b73-3f20-122a-9cfc3f184fb2/198704680922_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"name":"Trailblazer (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1834785393","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trailblazer-deluxe/1834785393","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2zy7Q5dInDxRP8ff8yltB1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834785393/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1160910059","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1160910059?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267221802,"RTCI":0}}},"1834789764":{"id":"1834789764","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834789764?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"B.G.","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/b-g/3200518","artwork":{"bgColor":"8e9292","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0f0f10","textColor2":"201a17","textColor3":"28292a","textColor4":"36322f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/15/43/6e/15436e32-7e53-5b5a-6b21-a96b12c46980/56811.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The New Orleans legend urges young rappers to learn from his mistakes.","standard":"As a condition of the New Orleans rap legend’s supervised release from prison in 2023, a federal judge in Louisiana ruled that the artist born Christopher Dorsey would have to allow the government to approve his lyrics going forward. (He’d served 11 years of a 14-year sentence, having pled guilty in 2011 to two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.) It wasn’t the first time a rapper’s lyrics were used against him in the courtroom (see the State of Georgia v. YSL Records trial of 2023-2024), a seeming infringement upon First Amendment rights which the former Hot Boy doesn’t shy away from emphasizing on his first solo album since 2009. “I want to tell them stories, but I ain’t ’bout to risk it,” B.G. rasps in his familiar drawl on the fiery title track, on which he shouts out Young Thug, urges young rappers to learn from his mistakes, and stoically

prolific K-pop group’s swaggering, sentimental second Japanese album.","standard":"On ATEEZ’s <i>Ashes to Light</i>, evolution is earned, but sometimes still fought against. The nine-track effort represents the second full-length Japanese album released by the K-pop octet since their 2018 debut under KQ Entertainment, and it’s an expansion of the group’s music further past swashbuckling swagger to sentimental sensuality. It brings together four previously released J-pop tracks (“NOT OKAY,” “Days,” “Birthday,” and “Forevermore”) and five new ones (“Ash,” “12 Midnight,” “Tippy Toes,” “FACE,” and “Crescendo”), giving the album a temporal scope broader than the group’s prolific output might suggest is possible. \n\nThe album brings in more of ATEEZ’s signature rap in “12 Midnight,” a song about fighting through anxieties in the middle of the night. “Tippy Toes” keeps things low-key before ATEEZ erupts into the J-rock-fueled frenzy of “FACE” and the unbridled sentiment of “Crescendo,” the latter asking fans (known as ATINY) to stay “together, forever” with the group. “Let's hide away, like the setting sun/So that we won't be found in this ever-changing world,” members Seonghwa, Hongjoong, Yunho, Yeosang, San, Mingi, Wooyoung, and Jongho suggest on the album-ending ballad “Forevermore.” The song is an emotional tribute to a time that must pass—though not just yet.\n","tagline":"New

high-energy, tempo-shifting mix from the LA basshound.","standard":"LA producer NGHTMRE (aka Tyler Marenyi) is a wizard when it comes to dynamics. His 2025 album <i>MINDFULL</i> not only shifts gears in speed and intensity—it also intersperses trap and bass bangers (featuring the likes of A$AP Ferg and Flowdan) with tunes that more closely resemble singer-songwriter ballads. He takes a similarly varied approach to his Apple Music Fitness mix: “My goal was to change the tempo of the mix every 10 to 15 minutes or so,” he tells Apple Music. “A BPM change always helps jump-start my energy when working out and keeps things moving.”\n\nAlongside caffeinated classics like Europe’s “The Final Countdown” and Zombie Nation’s “Kernkraft 400,” and a few of his own recent tracks, Marenyi strategically places a number of songs for maximum impact. Kanine’s remix of Sub Focus’ “On and On” lands in the middle of the mix “and comes at the perfect time to get your second wind,” he says. “I always find myself losing energy after 20 to 25 minutes, so the tempo increase helps me push through.” LYNY’s “Section” closes things out: “The elements of the song are minimal, but the bass is strong. I always get so hyped when I hear this record. I figured it would be great to include as the final song to push through the end of the workout.”\n","tagline":"New Fitness Mix"},"genreNames":["Bass","Music","Electronic","Dance"],"name":"Fitness:

Eight months before the release of his 2025 album <i>For Her 2</i>, he dropped <i>For Us</i>, a celebration of the women in his life and the many milestones they celebrated. It was originally seen as a spiritual sequel of sorts to his 2023 album <i>For Her</i>, but that story is being continued in an official capacity with <i>For Her 2</i>. On the album, the lovestruck North Carolina rapper sings of the strongest relationships in his life. “If Only,” which features 21 Savage, finds Hunxho employing his signature thick Auto-Tune and singing about the chances he no longer has to show his love how much he loves her. “Intimate Relationships” finds him rummaging through the aftermath of a betrayal. Things are less regretful on the raunchy “#1 Girl,” which finds the rapper promising his partner that no matter what he does, she still has his heart.","tagline":"New

eighth LP is a full-on pop revival: “One of the last I’ll get away with.”","standard":"Ed Sheeran used his last two albums as a bit of a genre cleanse. Now he’s ready for a full pop revival on his eighth full-length. “I think <i>-</i> [<i>Subtract</i>] and <i>Autumn Variations</i> were a really good circuit breaker for me to just be like, ‘I’m a singer-songwriter, I’m going to make singer-songwriter albums and I am going to dip in and out of things when I feel like it,’” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And I think that <i>Play</i> will be one of the last pop hurrahs that I’ll get away with.”\n\n<i>Play</i> inhabits a familiar but expanding sonic space in Sheeran’s oeuvre. For several songs, he relies heavily on diverse Eastern musical styles like the Bollywood-tinged “Sapphire,” the Persian-influenced “Azizam,” and the Punjabi-inspired “Symmetry.” “I’m just exploring completely new different world and cultures, and there are superstars in the same country with different languages, and that’s super exciting as well,” he says. On tracks like “Old Phone” (a remembrance of lost friends that recalls the storytelling of “Castle on the Hill”) and “The Vow” (which harkens to “Perfect” and “Thinking Out Loud”), he throws back to the traditional Sheeran sound of old. \n\nBoth deeply personal and <i>mostly</i> relatable, many cuts belie his devotion to his family and wife. Two sweetly romantic odes, “In Other Words” and “For Always,” also describe universal emotions. “They’re very human things that you go through with your partner or your kids,” he says. “There’s stuff that I can relate to with my friends going through the same things. I’m very vastly different in other areas of my life and things that I do, but I think when you are a partner and a father and a friend, you share many, many, many experiences.” \n\nBut it’s the album’s first song “Opening” that may be more specific to Sheeran’s particular circumstances, taking a critical eye to his own international fame. “Not the pop star they say they prefer/Kept quiet but I came to be heard/Been a long time up top, but I ain’t complacent/If I look down, I can see replacements.” He’s not worried, though, about those deemed “the next Ed Sheeran”: “I just take them on tour.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"name":"Play (Extended Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1837753866","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/play-extended-edition/1837753866","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64QhljQEwTfoEt9z6jsyxl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837753866/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"183313439","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/183313439?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758162354768,"RTCI":0}}},"1837759114":{"id":"1837759114","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837759114?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Etana","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/etana/203182162","artwork":{"bgColor":"ff1717","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"130101","textColor2":"2c0404","textColor3":"420606","textColor4":"560707","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/eb/ea/a5/ebeaa50d-4b13-a00a-362b-827900f03c89/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Reggae","Music","Dub"],"name":"Dubclaat","playParams":{"id":"1837759114","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dubclaat/1837759114","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3uxBH7ZsKhP8Wevk2K6FhY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837759114/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"203182162","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/203182162?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758267182782,"RTCI":0}}},"1837988502":{"id":"1837988502","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837988502?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Luke Bryan","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luke-bryan/20131064","artwork":{"bgColor":"687b80","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"010202","textColor2":"030202","textColor3":"161a1b","textColor4":"171b1b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e2/7b/a5/e27ba5c3-6195-c39c-17c9-f99f6df143ae/25UM1IM27250.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d2d6cf","textColor2":"c2ccbf","textColor3":"abaea9","textColor4":"9ea69c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/86/55/d2/8655d244-7fa0-4b15-c24b-53454aa5d2d1/fda6ff4b-0c0a-4750-8b98-95bed5d2fea1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Welcome To Farm Tour -

This exclusion doesn’t necessarily speak to the quality of such tracks, rather than their lack of suitability for a particular project. As a corrective, the Latin trap superstar presents a selection of such previously concealed works via <i>Archivos Eladio Vol. 3</i>, a project not unlike Nas’ <i>The Lost Tapes</i>. That 2002 compilation of choice rarities was received nearly as well as some of the Queensbridge icon’s proper full-lengths, and this 2025 offering from the <i>DON KBRN</i> artist stands to do something similar with his own massive fanbase. Beginning with a sixth installment of his celebrated “Sauce Boy” freestyles, the half-hour-long effort showcases his high-level rapping both solo (“Luego,” “Me Siento Kbrn”) and alongside respected, rising Spanish-language spitters. When those latter guests, like Danny Towers, Midnvght, and YOVNGCHIMI, come through, they serve to bolster his already formidable microphone prowess.","tagline":"New

with two new tracks featuring some special guests.","standard":"When Miley Cyrus won her first Grammys in 2024 (Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers” from 2023’s <i>Endless Summer Vacation</i>), something shifted. “I think somewhere inside of me, I needed to hold a trophy and just feel for a moment that I have something that I can hold in my hands that feels like a true achievement,” the 32-year-old child star turned pop icon tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “After every album, I’ve been able to say, ‘Well, I made the album I set out to make, and that’s enough.’ Somewhere, I was avoiding the fact that it did matter to me.”\n\nHaving finally achieved the validation she’d been longing to feel since childhood, Cyrus says she “felt free to make the album that I’ve really been craving my whole adult career to create.” The name of the resulting album, her ninth, emerged out of the ether while riffing in the studio with producer Max Taylor-Sheppard and Cyrus’ boyfriend/collaborator, Liily drummer Maxx Morando. “As soon as [Taylor-Sheppard] played the first chord, I just said, ‘Tell me something beautiful tonight.’ It was so easy, but I have no idea where it came from. The chord he played was so beautiful that what needed to be said had to be beautiful.”\n\nIn the title track, a Sunday morning soul jam erupts with a “flash, bang, spark” into post-apocalyptic prog-rock distortion. That clash of sensuality and chaos extends through <i>Something Beautiful</i>, whose ’80s-inspired melodrama swings for the fences in sound and theme. The deceptively sparkly-sounding “End of the World” celebrates one last blowout bash before the sky falls. “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form,” Cyrus says. “Pop gets given a bad name by manufactured label creations, and that’s just not what it is.” She’s thinking of legendary pop innovators who evolved with the times: David Bowie, Madonna, Elton John.\n\nThe ultra-funky “Easy Lover” was intended for another such icon: Cyrus originally wrote it circa 2020’s <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, then refurbished it for placement on Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. When Bey went with “II MOST WANTED” instead, Cyrus kept the slinky number for herself, recruiting Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard to play electric guitar—though the “Tell ’em, B!” ad-lib stays.\n\nCyrus’ inimitable voice has never sounded more soulful, though that has not come without a price. She tells Apple Music she has Reinke’s edema, a rare condition which causes fluid to build up in the outer layer of the vocal folds—hence her trademark rasp. “So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am,” she says. “But it’s extremely difficult to perform with, because it’s like running a marathon with ankle weights on.” It could be removed surgically, but for Cyrus, the benefit isn’t worth the risk, “because the chance of waking up from surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability.”\n\nThroughout a career that’s spanned two-thirds of her life, Cyrus has felt lost in the static. “White noise is essentially everything happening all at the same time, and I feel like that was what the last 20 years of my career felt like,” she says. But while recording <i>Something Beautiful</i>, she found herself coming to terms with everything that’s come before. Over the heavy disco groove of “Reborn,” she delivers a mission statement: “If heaven exists/I’ve been there before/Kill my ego/Let’s be reborn.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe

Scarcely three months after dropping the subsequent <i>Sins Aloud</i>, the prolific Georgia native returns with the like-minded <i>GANGWAY</i>. His signature style—a fidelity-fractured mélange of intense sub-bass frequencies, hypnotic synth sequences, and free-associative bars—persists across a baker’s dozen new tracks. \n\nOn cuts like “Pro Mag” and “Fart 808,” his approach remains as radical as when he initially emerged—rapid-fire lines delivered with a casual drawl. His connection to Atlanta’s historic trap past is anything but vestigial on “MIDDLE OF CAR,” “Protect da brand,” and “Shoutout dat boy,” each track begging for a classic mixtape DJ drop. Indeed, once listeners get past the extremity of the noisy instrumentals, his links to 2010s hip-hop steadily reveal themselves like little mysteries, with echoes of Harlem’s A$AP and Southside Chicago drillers creeping through “Pints” and “OXY.”","tagline":"New
