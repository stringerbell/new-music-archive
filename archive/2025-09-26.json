You’ve likely heard “Weak in Your Light” from 2023’s <i>Strange Disciple</i> if you’ve turned on a single TV show in the last few years, and their fourth album <i>Dance Called Memory</i> continues their hot streak of broadly appealing and emotionally resonant songcraft. \n\nWith frequent collaborator and LCD Soundsystem live member Nick Millhiser behind the boards, these 10 songs sparkle and bounce with every rhythmic twist, as lead singer Ian Richard Devaney’s angelic vocals hover above the proceedings. And lest you think they’re becoming easy to pin down, <i>Dance Called Memory</i> has a few tricks up its sleeve: Witness the brittle backbeats that make up the framework of “In Another Life” or the glistening shoegaze textures that course through “Now That You’re Gone.” It’s these subtle tweaks to their sound that prove that, even as they grow in popularity, Nation of Language continues to evolve in new and surprising ways.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"name":"Dance Called Memory","playParams":{"id":"1802059612","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dance-called-memory/1802059612","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2fNPTFiU2sCY9m6tv3Ucqa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802059612/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1160352768","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1160352768?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758860575121,"RTCI":0}}},"1811655305":{"id":"1811655305","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811655305?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Henret","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/henret/1489180593","artwork":{"bgColor":"25100f","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f67554","textColor2":"f67554","textColor3":"cc6146","textColor4":"cc6146","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2f/6e/6c/2f6e6ce3-4814-4d6c-9a2a-e76c19e19d33/198704490606_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Depths Below - EP","playParams":{"id":"1811655305","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/depths-below-ep/1811655305"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811655305/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1489180593","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1489180593?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758860220723,"RTCI":0}}},"1814869228":{"id":"1814869228","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814869228?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Purity Ring","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/purity-ring/461030854","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dbbeb2","textColor2":"b3a6d0","textColor3":"af988f","textColor4":"8f85a6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fe/07/a1/fe07a102-b03c-8332-5ae5-5187abba1eb3/54467.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"baaec9","textColor2":"daa09b","textColor3":"948ba0","textColor4":"ae807c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bb/e5/06/bbe50627-ecca-2126-9d6a-24aaffef8aad/Job6522f735-35c9-4a0b-b304-d444439e95f7-203782332-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398433812_2348719087-Time1758551358705.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"a778e0","textColor3":"a19174","textColor4":"8560b3","textGradient":["ffffff","a778e0"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/28/4c/1d/284c1dba-7a31-5cb7-a855-6eceb41b2114/Jobc62bed70-491e-49bc-b34f-1eb18eb344c9-203930552-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398678059_2350708253-Time1758650711949.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111131","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"bfc5c4","textColor2":"88a9d8","textColor3":"9ca1a6","textColor4":"708bb7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7a/22/71/7a227107-42d9-e818-e735-95183f7a8735/8241cb6e-0409-4ef3-998c-9c6f7ce55ddc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The duo’s imaginary video game soundtrack delivers real digi-pop thrills.","standard":"Listening to Purity Ring’s panoramic synth-pop has always felt a bit like stepping into a futuristic fantasyland, so it makes perfect sense that Megan James and Corin Roddick would envision their self-titled fourth album as the soundtrack to a <i>Final Fantasy</i>-style RPG that exists only in their own minds. But while <i>purity ring</i> comes loaded with fleet-footed, breakbeat-driven bops (“many lives,” “between you and shadows”) ideal for whipping through levels at warp speed and slaying enemies with militaristic precision, the album’s more manic tracks flow naturally into meditative soundscapes (“part ii,” “mistral”) that reflect the more exploratory aspects of gaming, where you’re content to just wander through and marvel at the digital vistas around you. And even if you’re not a headset-sporting joystick jockey, there’s no resisting the emotional undertow of “imanocean,” where James turns off the pitch-shifting vocal filters and Roddick eases off the electro-freakery to deliver an acoustic-driven, heart-pumping indie-pop anthem.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"name":"purity ring","playParams":{"id":"1814869228","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/purity-ring/1814869228","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3n0N3fSeIXDhMWSFtN2rX9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814869228/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"461030854","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/461030854?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758861904272,"RTCI":0}}},"1816801411":{"id":"1816801411","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816801411?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Headstones","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/headstones/1224908681","artwork":{"bgColor":"101334","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e48036","textColor2":"fa0106","textColor3":"b96a36","textColor4":"cb040f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ad/c8/59/adc859ab-3623-7175-ddf8-e10ad73b321e/821826039094.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Canadian rockers’ urgency remains intact on their 11th album.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"BURN ALL THE SHIPS","playParams":{"id":"1816801411","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/burn-all-the-ships/1816801411","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0fOKfwP09wOgJ0Sv4Q0ybz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816801411/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1224908681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1224908681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758860066476,"RTCI":0}}},"1817066446":{"id":"1817066446","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817066446?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sarah McLachlan","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sarah-mclachlan/111192","artwork":{"bgColor":"0b1011","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"b4ccd3","textColor2":"9bc1cc","textColor3":"92a6ac","textColor4":"7e9da7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/47/16/f4/4716f49b-2e98-a721-9b84-9a8e97c92f3d/25CRGIM49464.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"06010b","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"b8cdd2","textColor2":"a8c7d2","textColor3":"94a4aa","textColor4":"879faa","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/11/80/6b/11806bad-6e44-505e-15af-46cd5dfe9680/Jobfdd36ea6-944c-4993-844b-7006140bb50a-196979258-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385738774_2243687709-Time1752083237901.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"0a090a","gradient":{"color":"0a090a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"8bc4cd","textColor3":"95abad","textColor4":"709da6","textGradient":["ffffff","8bc4cd"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/25/e1/fd/25e1fd36-d55a-93be-4d12-867ba49dac2e/Jobda802abb-8810-4ecc-b21c-f4534be7f424-197437598-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386575998_2250821746-Time1752513114625.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"0f1921","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"adc1cf","textColor2":"d6ac85","textColor3":"8da0ac","textColor4":"ae8e71","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/77/54/cb/7754cb01-9eaa-9f85-e48b-3968fb81d083/61a4dca7-a2b4-465a-8eae-862ce527f6fd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dcb5a4","textColor2":"d3a38c","textColor3":"b39487","textColor4":"ac8573","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/01/e1/a9/01e1a9b0-abc0-e03c-4dae-f4bfac2bd90d/bf3fce9a-d536-41c1-9c80-38012b858ccb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The adult-alternative icon jumps back into the fire.","standard":"Sarah McLachlan’s first album of originals in 11 years fortuitously arrives in the same month as the premiere of <i>Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery</i>, a documentary that celebrates the trailblazing legacy of her all-women festival. And in many respects, <i>Better Broken</i> serves the same function in 2025 as Lilith Fair did in the ’90s, by providing a safe space for fans to gather and wallow in all the feels. With boygenius producer Tony Berg behind the boards, <i>Better Broken</i> sees McLachlan effortlessly integrate herself into a contemporary singer-songwriter landscape she helped create, with the title track reintroducing us to the folk-schooled storytelling, trip-hoppy textures, and hair-raising vocal turns that made her an adult-alternative icon. \n\nAs ever, McLachlan masterfully distills relationships to the most intimate details (“I want to feel the shiver/Your fingers writing poetry on my skin,” she sings on the dustbowl devotional “Long Road Home”), while delving into their messy aftermaths with unflinching resolve: The post-breakup piano ballad “Wilderness” just might be the most elegant “fuck you” to an ex ever written. \n\nBut while its songs take the form of deeply personal heart-to-heart conversations, <i>Better Broken</i> is very much tuned into the socio-political tumult weighing on all our lives—the tender piano serenade “Only Human” is the musical equivalent of a shoulder to cry on, with McLachlan offering words of encouragement to beaten-down souls like the world’s most sympathetic life coach.

From the radio-friendly uplifter “Nice to Each Other” to the sweeping, late ’60s Dionne Warwick-esque soul of “So Easy (To Fall in Love),” <i>The Art of Loving</i> finds Dean self-assured as she slinks freely through R&B and pop. “You can make whatever you want, there’s no rules and that’s such a freeing feeling,” she tells Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd.\n\nDean describes her songwriting on <i>The Art of Loving</i> as “real, fresh, and honest” and she makes it sound so easy. It’s no surprise that the overarching theme—love in its different forms—came naturally. “I had the title quite quickly,” she says. “I’ve also been fascinated by love. It’s the one thing that everybody is looking for in their life in some capacity, whether it be friendship, family, romantic, but it’s something that we’re not taught. There’s not a love module in school. It’s this magic thing we’re supposed to know how to do. So I wanted to take a closer look at it and what it means to me and the art of it, the craft of loving someone properly.”\n\nThe album opens with the instant hit “Nice to Each Other,” the obvious choice for Dean. “As soon as I wrote it, I knew it was going to be the first song. It’s got a Fleetwood Mac guitary feel and it’s cheeky, it’s flirty,” she says. There might be heartbreaks and wistful moments along the way, but Dean leaves listeners in no doubt she’s in a happy place. “How could I not be?” she says. “I’ve been thinking a lot about touring and what I want to sing live and I want it to be joyful. So I’ve been moving towards joy.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"The Art of Loving","playParams":{"id":"1817609404","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-art-of-loving/1817609404","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0l8zYqoUeBYg47Gmevq9HZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817609404/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1487253329","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1487253329?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758895740688,"RTCI":0}}},"1817616700":{"id":"1817616700","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817616700?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"crushed","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/crushed/1650154551","artwork":{"bgColor":"809fa4","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"000103","textColor2":"101114","textColor3":"1a2023","textColor4":"262e31","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/77/ad/01/77ad01f7-f600-0d01-bdff-45a9251791c1/54980.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"101010","gradient":{"color":"101010","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"181b1f","textColor3":"192022","textColor4":"2c3438","textGradient":["ffffff","181b1f"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0e/49/af/0e49af17-11f5-fd5b-f705-eedd9517256c/Joba4aceedd-e8c1-4fe5-bd4c-74921da71807-196376476-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384593522_2234478668-Time1751468138912.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"101010","gradient":{"color":"101010","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"9fcad0","textColor3":"91b0b5","textColor4":"80a3a8","textGradient":["ffffff","9fcad0"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a0/e5/46/a0e5467f-1462-f056-84bd-066395abeb79/Jobf271ddf2-9c10-4444-8542-4d8f8881ee66-196376475-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384593523_2234478667-Time1751467218679.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"no scope","playParams":{"id":"1817616700","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-scope/1817616700","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1MoHchytw6sq4hhC28JZ7x"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817616700/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1650154551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1650154551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758862141388,"RTCI":0}}},"1817744638":{"id":"1817744638","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817744638?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Favors, FINNEAS & Ashe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1817748454-1138790033-1234718215","artwork":{"bgColor":"ad9c8a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0b0b","textColor2":"131111","textColor3":"2c2824","textColor4":"322d29","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/59/71/32597154-2d4d-158e-fe5b-64ac24de72de/25UMGIM73476.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"565465","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f6f0d6","textColor2":"f6dcbc","textColor3":"d6d1bf","textColor4":"d6c1ab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b9/53/7b/b9537b4f-888c-bc02-6bde-d31231dbb0f5/2dc78b96-e910-493e-8c4b-6dc7009f9a86.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"819194","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"080605","textColor2":"090704","textColor3":"202222","textColor4":"212221","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b0/26/44/b026441d-76d1-56e7-e0f1-bee2a0b42768/4632d5b9-f30c-42ba-88d8-5d15d76f0612.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"FINNEAS and Ashe mine their chemistry to expand on their signature styles.","standard":"On <i>The Dream</i>, FINNEAS and Ashe’s first album together as The Favors, the duo tries their hand at one of the most difficult formats to replicate: the male-female power duo. Think Sonny & Cher, Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra, Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks. The album, which was produced by FINNEAS, features the duo harmonizing over lush orchestral pop and folk arrangements, infusing their signature styles with disco, slow-burning balladry, and country music. Though the collection marks their first time working together on an entire album, they collaborated on Ashe’s 2021 track “Till Forever Falls Apart.” Their relationship dates back even further. In an interview with Zane Lowe, the duo revealed that they met about nine years ago and quickly struck up a friendship. \n\nThat chemistry works its way through the entire album, from the ELO-inspired electropop of the title track to the lounge jazz of “Ordinary People,” which calls to mind another all-time male-female duo: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga. The exciting restlessness of the album’s genre explorations comes from the way their relationship began to build. “I think that our friendship really has a lot to do with a kind of mutual curiosity,” FINNEAS says. “I think that, over the years, I’ve looked at why I feel super affectionately towards somebody. And obviously, people’s talent or energy is important, but I think people’s curiosity is this big, underrepresented societal thing.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Dream","playParams":{"id":"1817744638","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dream/1817744638","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48M39K7MWoYxykqTE2brIi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817744638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1817748454","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1817748454?l=en-US"},{"id":"1138790033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1138790033?l=en-US"},{"id":"1234718215","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1234718215?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758876387581,"RTCI":0}}},"1818531286":{"id":"1818531286","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818531286?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Briscoe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/briscoe/1460309805","artwork":{"bgColor":"c4ced7","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"1b1e0d","textColor2":"232112","textColor3":"3d4135","textColor4":"43443a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/49/3e/d8/493ed866-601c-39ad-9015-f0f491e5d3b5/00880882672355_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"3c3e29","gradient":{"color":"3c3e29","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"262718","textColor3":"323535","textColor4":"454840","textGradient":["ffffff","262718"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c6/46/d8/c646d8c9-7be9-bb07-d891-4776d4286dde/Job41830b41-d3f1-4034-b10f-895d9e11ac20-198272253-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388113662_2263768023-Time1753304400215.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"3c3e29","gradient":{"color":"3c3e29","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2c2b19","textColor3":"383c3a","textColor4":"4d4e42","textGradient":["ffffff","2c2b19"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f6/c9/5d/f6c95d23-c013-570e-8db1-52ffde64491c/Job5c3de4ea-4e9e-4e35-90e2-bfeae4555f2d-198272252-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_388113661_2263768022-Time1753302833174.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"bed4d3","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0f2826","textColor2":"1c3634","textColor3":"324a49","textColor4":"3c5554","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0f/cc/a8/0fcca8cf-1aab-2e98-fc00-aa14bc81a173/ac8c50c1-b9e8-43cd-a620-8adff045ee4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Austin, Texas, duo explores an eclectic take on country.","standard":"Texas country music is not a monolith, something the quickly rising Austin-based duo Briscoe proves quickly on this full-length collection. Exploring the gentler side of the Lone Star State sound, Briscoe crafts melody-forward, intricately plotted roots music, with principals Philip Lupton and Truett Heintzelman focusing especially on highlighting the complex interplay between their two voices. The duo tapped producer Brad Cook (Waxahatchee, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats) to helm the record and enlisted the talents of Andrew Marlin (acclaimed roots act Watchhouse, formerly known as Mandolin Orange) and multi-hyphenate instrumentalist Phil Cook to join the studio band.\n\nThe resulting sound is fresh and eclectic, blending folk, pop-rock, and just enough twang to keep things country. The title track, with its imagistic lyrics and lush production, would sound at home on a Josh Ritter record, while “Escudilla” uses a breezy-sounding arrangement to tell a story about environmental destruction. Another highlight on <i>Heat of July</i> is “Flashlights in the Canyon,” a compassionate account of the perilous journey often faced by immigrants coming into Texas.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"name":"Heat of July","playParams":{"id":"1818531286","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heat-of-july/1818531286","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0CEGk4q0Vx33fmT0rZUulK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818531286/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1460309805","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1460309805?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758863352672,"RTCI":0}}},"1818548779":{"id":"1818548779","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818548779?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Geese","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/geese/1378038472","artwork":{"bgColor":"b9d0e9","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"050b10","textColor2":"0a0b0d","textColor3":"29323c","textColor4":"2d3239","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0b/b8/f1/0bb8f1d7-1df0-20c0-9539-51d08058eeb1/5400863191436_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"4587c0","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"151516","textColor2":"151516","textColor3":"1e2c38","textColor4":"1e2c38","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f8/73/ad/f873ad8b-9a36-fdde-3b8a-8035cd022e75/Job457f7f9f-9851-4406-81ce-22f5bf89ad3b-196302026-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384433873_2233279501-Time1751400985266.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"e5edf5","gradient":{"color":"e5edf5","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"040b10","textColor3":"31353a","textColor4":"2e363d","textGradient":["000000","040b10"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/43/de/a9/43dea9bb-b5f6-d9dc-a01c-1399c454c13a/Job60cf01c9-f820-4996-8eae-43af97b1a19a-196302025-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384433874_2233279500-Time1751399515140.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"eedfdb","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"201911","textColor2":"2f2826","textColor3":"49403a","textColor4":"554d4a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/58/f5/e8/58f5e84d-a508-d0e0-fd78-040f2a17ea80/de6508b9-bd46-41a2-ae66-4da47f736b15.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"One of rock’s most electrifying new crews and gripping new voices.","standard":"Geese—a band of four 23-year-old longtime pals from Brooklyn and Manhattan—represent such an exciting jolt of rock ’n’ roll possibility that they successfully convinced marquee producer Kenny Beats to change his name in order to work with them. When the members of Geese were still in elementary school, Beats was showing up on increasingly big hip-hop records by Smoke DZA, ScHoolboy Q, Freddie Gibbs, and Vince Staples. But as he doggedly pursued Geese through 2024 and convinced them to give his new Los Angeles digs a try, they offered a caveat: He should drop the Beats once and for all and just be Kenny Blume. The swap proved worth it. Together, Geese and Blume made one of this year’s truly great rock records, finding an often-hidden seam between old-school indie-rock idiosyncrasy and the mainstream’s explosive power. <i>Getting Killed</i> feels like a burst of new life.\n\nGeese signed a pandemic-era deal for their high-school debut, <i>Projector</i>, before raising the stakes with their indulgent, discursive, and beguiling <i>3D Country</i>. But their flock unexpectedly grew early in 2025, when <i>Heavy Metal</i>—the brilliant solo debut of singer and leader Cameron Winter, actually released late in 2024—became an unexpected and uncanny breakthrough. Fans of that album may recognize its tunefulness at the start of Geese’s “Cobra,” where lilting keyboards indeed conjure “Love Takes Miles.”\n\nAside from Winter’s singular voice and barbarically blunt lyrics, though, the similarities stop there: <i>Getting Killed</i>is a savage and beautiful thing, anchored by the athletic rhythm section of bassist Dom DiGesu and drummer Max Bassin and given a serrated edge by guitarist Emily Green. Where “Islands of Men” moves from a warped Rolling Stones strut into art-rock transcendence, “Bow Down” is nervous and mean start to finish, Winter howling about lost love over an instrumental that feels like heart palpitations. Hinging around howled lines about bombs in cars, opener “Trinidad” indeed lands like a piece of twisted scrap metal. Geese, though, can be tender and exquisite. “Half Real” is an anthem for holding love close as the world tries to chip away at it, while the climactic soul stunner “Au Pays du Cocaine” is a let’s-stay-together update for our era of shared discontent. \n\nGeese have recently flamed the eternal embers of rock-savior dialogues, their imaginative but relentless approach suggesting for many talk about the next Strokes or Radiohead. And, sure, that might happen. But more importantly, Geese have simply done what so many great rock bands in the past have done—they’ve learned the lessons of their forebears, ripped them apart, and reordered them in a way that sounds as thrilling to them as to us. “I’m getting killed by a pretty good life,” Winter warbles on the title track, echoing Neil Young a half-century on. Whether you’re in heaven or hell, it’s hard not to nod at least a little bit of assent to one of rock’s most electrifying new crews and gripping new voices.","tagline":"New

a bit of a curveball”: Lola Young serves self-love, sass, and survival.","standard":"Following up a global hit like “Messy” is an intimidating job. But Lola Young was never in any doubt about her next move. The South London singer-songwriter took the authenticity she’d shared in the anthem to being your imperfect self and doubled down on it.\n\n<i>I’m Only F**king Myself</i> finds Young teetering on the brink of superstardom, with her turbulent past still looming large in her memory. Breakups, hookups, and leaving her vices behind are all covered in a raw, straight-talking but playful style that suggests she’s learned her resilience and grit the hard way. “It digs a bit deeper for me, for sure,” Young tells Apple Music. “There are a lot of different genres and influences on there, but I would say it was a reflection of where I was at in my life. It’s very of its time as well.”\n\nThe album comes little more than a year after 2024’s <i>This Wasn’t Meant for You Anyway</i>, but Young felt a sense of urgency. “I was in a weird place mentally, but felt confident, so I needed to get something out,” she says. “It’s bit of a curveball, but there are definitely some hidden gems in there. And there are some songs that people will love if they love ‘Messy.’”\n\nYoung worked with her long-term collaborators Manuka (Conor Dickinson and Will Brown), who co-wrote “Messy,” and Grammy-winning producer Solomonophonic (SZA, Doja Cat), so there was already a level of trust there. “I’ve been working with them since the very beginning of my career, so I can pass ideas off of them, going back and forth,” she says. “They’re incredible collaborators and people to be around, so they help with energy as well. I get so comfortable, I don’t need to say what I’m feeling.”\n\n<i>I’m Only F**king Myself</i> comes with a manifesto that’s as bold and complex as Young herself. “I hope it makes people feel less alone. I hope it makes people feel empowered and free,” she says. “Find a piece of themselves that they can cherish. Love themselves or hate themselves, whatever they want to feel while they’re listening to it. And have a good cry at certain points too.” Read on as Young takes you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“F**K EVERYONE”</b>\n“This captures a moment. I wanted to embody something confident, fun, and free for the first track. My producer Jared [Solomon, aka Solomonophonic] was playing the chords, which are kind of punky, early-2000s, but heavily alternative with distorted, crunchy guitars. Then he made a sample out of his voice and started going around with that grating sound that happens throughout the song. Jared is very much a sound person, and he’s incredible at making those little ear-candy moments in a song.”\n\n<b>“One Thing”</b>\n“‘One Thing’ is a liberating song about how women shouldn’t feel constricted by social or societal norms around how they should be having sex. It’s about wanting one thing from somebody and not being concerned about what they want, or how you should feel towards a one-night stand or someone in a relationship. When you don’t want to take it further and you don’t want to fall in love. I’m not an activist, but I’m aware that by showing my body and being confident in the way I look and the way I naturally am, I can hopefully bring out a lot of confidence in people.”\n\n<b>“d£aler”</b>\n“I do love ‘d£aler.’ I think it’s a hopeful song. A lot of the chords are very uplifting and so is the sentiment, even though there’s a sad undertone. That’s what makes ‘d£aler’ special. It’s not my favorite track on the album at the moment, but that can change day by day and I still love performing it. I love that it’s an uplifting song, but it’s got a sad message. It’s definitely one that goes a bit deeper for me.”\n\n<b>“SPIDERS”</b>\n“‘SPIDERS’ is one of my favorite tracks at the moment. I love everything about it. It’s very big and ‘feeling’ and it’s got that kind of ’90s indie influence. I love the line, ‘I’m not a woman if I don’t have you,’ which is about unity and co-existing. Making the video was a really nice experience, actually. I had to hold a tarantula, so I overcame a lot of my fears, which I guess is what this song’s about. It wasn’t easy, but that’s the whole point of it.”\n\n<b>“Penny Out of Nothing”</b>\n“I think ‘Penny…’ might surprise people. It’s a different vibe for me, for sure. The chords are kind of bossa nova, but a bit psychedelic. This track was recorded in Rue Boyer, a studio in Paris, but we moved around a bit for the rest of the album. Some of it was recorded in New York and some of it was on my own. The lyrics on this are freestyle, off the top of my head, saying how I felt. I usually work quite freely with that. Sometimes, if I’m writing on my own, it’s a different experience and I write almost subconsciously—getting the first thing that comes to mind down, and then I flesh it out or edit it.”\n\n<b>“Walk All Over You”</b>\n“After hearing ‘Penny…’ and going into that darkness, I wanted to bring it back into the light. When I’m writing the sadder songs, I’m often not thinking about an experience, but the feeling in general and how that can manifest itself in different ways in the music. This one’s more uplifting—I wrote it on my own in my bedroom, and I really like that idea of putting shoes on and then walking all over someone. It’s got character and it’s sassy.”\n\n<b>“Post Sex Clarity”</b>\n“This one is about a brief relationship I had with someone. It’s about that situation when you really felt you were interested and beyond in them, and you feel accepted, wanted, seen, and understood by them. Again, it’s one of my favorites. That line, ‘I still love you and I don’t know why,’ sums up that feeling. Obviously, on the flip of the word, it’s like having that intimate moment with someone and realizing that you still feel really amazingly about them, but you’re not together.”\n\n<b>“SAD SOB STORY! :)”</b>\n“The vocal on this is quite theatrical, which I love. It’s a storytelling song about a relationship that I had for a long time—and coming out of it and not wanting to hear that bullshit, not wanting to hear them trying to crawl back to you. As I get further away from these experiences, they do still hit me, but they also feel a bit distant because obviously I’m traveling so much. There’s that physical distance, and I’m looking at it from the situation I’m in now. The lyric ‘Life’s about learning’ is how sometimes it can show you things the hard way or in a really beautiful way. I’m definitely showcasing a different side of my experiences on this record.”\n\n<b>“CAN WE IGNORE IT? :(”</b>\n“This just flowed out. It’s about wanting to ignore my feelings and needing other people to do the same—and letting go and wanting to escape. I wanted it to feel very dark and raw, but also energetic and high-tempo. Usually, the first thing that comes out when I’m writing sticks, and the lyrics always flow out of me.”\n\n<b>“why do i feel better when i hurt you?”</b>\n“It’s a really soulful and powerful song about a toxic relationship and it’s one of my favorite vocals I’ve done. I wanted a sad, ballad moment on the album as a bit of variation. Putting the tracks in order came quite naturally. I did move them around and try different things, but this is the way that stuck and moved me the most.”\n\n<b>“Not Like That Anymore”</b>\n“This track is about me pulling myself out of a really self-destructive time. It’s hopeful because it’s about looking past that and finding new ways to feel happy. For me, that’s spending time with friends, music <i>always</i>, poetry, being present, and having small moments with people that I love. Instead of going to substances or something else that’s a quick dopamine release, it’s worth finding subtle moments. Of course, it becomes harder sometimes, but you can find a way of making it feel a little easier.

futuristic fusion of ’90s R&B, pop, hip-hop, soul, and electronic music.","standard":"“If you understood who I was back then, then you’d understand there was already no box for me,” Rochelle Jordan says of her musical journey in a behind-the-scenes mini-documentary for her album <i>Through the Wall</i>. Since her 2011 debut, the Los Angeles-based British Canadian artist has been carving out her own lane, a vintage yet futuristic fusion of ’90s R&B and pop, hip-hop, soul, and electronic music. Jordan’s fascination with the latter stems back to her childhood, when her older brother blasted jungle, drum ’n’ bass, UK garage, house—all shades of dance—in his bedroom, the rhythms seeping through her walls. \n\nThe album’s title nods to those formative experiences, but it also carries spiritual meaning. Among the obstacles Jordan faced in her career, one of the most challenging was internal: impostor syndrome. As she learned to dismantle those mental barriers and step fully into her power, <i>Through the Wall</i> found its roots. Produced mainly by longtime collaborator KLSH (and additionally Byron the Aquarius, Terry Hunter, and DāM FunK), <i>Through the Wall</i> bumps like a night in the club, with luxe house grooves that could take dance floors from midnight to sunrise. \n\nThat sparkling feeling of freedom lives in songs like “Sweet Sensation” and “Close 2 Me,” which radiate the exuberance of living in the moment, whether out with friends or wrapped up with a lover. Slipping into a sing-rap flow, Jordan makes room to flex on “Ladida” and “Around,” her earned braggadocio strutting like it’s dripped head-to-toe in the Versace she name-drops. Even after breakups (“Sum,” “Get It Off”), she’s still thriving, looking fly, and living in her exes’ heads rent-free. \n\n<i>Through the Wall</i> also pauses to reflect. On “Eyes Shut,” Jordan observes the struggles of those around her, questioning connection in a digital world and seeking purpose. “Got dopamine and can’t feel my soul/I just feel like there’s something more,” she muses. But the title track (“TTW”) asserts her resilience: “When you really wanna push through, okay/Let them say what they want to/Bussin’ through the wall.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Through The Wall","playParams":{"id":"1824330589","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/through-the-wall/1824330589","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1vTquD47VNHtfuc5tVLI98"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824330589/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"537708607","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/537708607?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758890887375,"RTCI":0}}},"1825640456":{"id":"1825640456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825640456?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Robert Plant","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/robert-plant/288062","artwork":{"bgColor":"e2c6c5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1a0503","textColor2":"3a2e31","textColor3":"422b29","textColor4":"5b4c4e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/03/48/cc/0348cc21-27f7-c7b5-5a75-597f9d741673/075597894462.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The rock icon connects the dots between blues, folk, and indie faves.","standard":"It’s hard to think of another artist from the ’70s classic-rock era who’s aged more gracefully than Robert Plant. Rather than trying of relive past glories, the former Led Zeppelin shrieker has spent much of the 21st century recontextualizing his formative influences—American blues, English folk, early rock ’n’ roll, Middle Eastern classical—into more earthy and ethereal realms. He carries himself less as a rock star than as a student, seeking out players and inspiration from niche scenes—be it bluegrass or indie rock—to bring his roots-music reinventions to life. \n\n<i>Saving Grace</i> is named for the group of players who’ve supported Plant since 2019, but like his previous crews Band of Joy and The Sensational Shape Shifters, they’re no mere backing band but fully integrated collaborators, with singer Suzi Dian playing his spirited vocal foil. Together, they roam through a collection of covers that effectively serves as a road map to Plant’s lifelong musical journey, connecting the dots between early Zep influence Memphis Minnie (a rollicking “Chevrolet”), his perennial San Fran psych favorites Moby Grape (a delightfully dreamy “It’s a Beautiful Day Today”), and his more recent obsession with Minnesota slocore legends Low (an urgent, Eastern-inflected interpretation of <i>The Great Destroyer</i> fuzz bomb “Everybody’s Song”). \n\nBut even if Plant is now far removed from the proto-metal bombast of Led Zeppelin, <i>Saving Grace</i>’s simmering renditions of traditional tunes like “As I Roved Out” and “Gospel Plough” show that he still abides by his former band’s formative philosophy, by reinvigorating age-old musical texts for the modern age.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Country","Americana"],"name":"Saving Grace","playParams":{"id":"1825640456","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/saving-grace/1825640456","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3E3qeXLdDtaX16OV4kbNoF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825640456/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"288062","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/288062?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758876021190,"RTCI":0}}},"1826051409":{"id":"1826051409","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826051409?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tentendo","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tentendo/1252060952","artwork":{"bgColor":"1d1b1c","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"ffa140","textColor2":"ff878a","textColor3":"d18638","textColor4":"d17173","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/78/9e/9e/789e9e40-6f71-3779-b4eb-e97b8bbfe175/198704608032_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"name":"(CPU) - EP","playParams":{"id":"1826051409","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cpu-ep/1826051409"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826051409/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1252060952","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1252060952?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758860878428,"RTCI":0}}},"1826198222":{"id":"1826198222","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826198222?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Nine Inch Nails","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nine-inch-nails/107917","artwork":{"bgColor":"020000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e5e5e5","textColor2":"f80001","textColor3":"b8b7b7","textColor4":"c70001","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/76/79/21/767921a2-c9d0-9618-32a3-ebe8fcb9c723/25UMGIM93266.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f90101","textColor2":"f70101","textColor3":"c70101","textColor4":"c50101","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bd/ab/87/bdab878b-3ab1-b29c-ef5e-0835c3d68a46/Job59541608-f518-499d-ad37-bf5e7b9f0946-203220807-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397369446_2340031755-Time1757965615669.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f80101","textColor3":"b7b7b7","textColor4":"c70101","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/13/24/32/1324323b-be03-92fd-cf1d-1b6043dff114/Jobef400e08-c772-4f32-9385-bd97ea345a18-203220806-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397369447_2340031756-Time1757963799975.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f12e25","textColor2":"f4281d","textColor3":"c42821","textColor4":"c7231b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d7/10/8a/d7108a69-1c92-db34-7318-d08fbbd99f6e/76924ad0-805a-4b8d-8408-340c5fb4a264.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1dfd2","textColor2":"c8c2bd","textColor3":"c4b6ab","textColor4":"a39e9b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/15/d7/04/15d70449-9c6a-c419-9b99-b7fc1eb0e577/cfd9ca74-96ec-4d5e-bcdc-a20c64f02980.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Reznor ’n’ Ross mix moody instrumentals with futurist bangers.","standard":"Since the early 2010s, Trent Reznor has been leading a double life: As he continued to lead industrial-rock agitators Nine Inch Nails through arenas around the world, he also reinvented himself as the award-winning soundtrack composer (alongside longtime collaborator Atticus Ross) for prestige big-screen fare like <i>The Social Network</i> and <i>Challengers</i>. But <i>TRON: Ares</i>—the long-awaited third entry in Disney’s future-shocked franchise—is the first Reznor ’n’ Ross score to be released under the NIN name. And really, the brand synergy is perfect: As an entity that’s always thrived on the violent tension between man and machine, Nine Inch Nails is an ideal avatar for TRON’s blinding-lights vision of AI run amok. \n\nHowever, when heard outside its cinematic context, <i>TRON: Ares</i> feels like it could be another entry in NIN’s experimental album series <i>Ghosts</i>, presenting a sprawling 24-track collage of dreamy piano interstitials (“Echoes”), lo-tech techno (“This Changes Everything”), swelling ’70-sci-fi synthphonies (“100% Expendable”), dramatic, pulse-pounding set pieces (“Daemonize”), and brain-bending avant-electronic eruptions (“New Directive”). \n\nAt the same time, <i>TRON: Ares</i> is greatly distinguished from the duo’s previous film collaborations by the inclusion of some Reznor-led strobe-lit ragers (”As Alive as You Need Me to Be,” “Shadow Over Me”) that would be right at home in NIN’s classic ’90s canon.

and Stevie’s historic 1973 debut finally gets its own moment in the sun.","standard":"“We’re old enough now that we’ve laid down our weapons,” Stevie Nicks told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2012. She was talking not only about potential songs for a new Fleetwood Mac album, but also her fabled, contentious, and musically revelatory relationship with Lindsey Buckingham. The 40th anniversary of their debut together, 1973’s <i>Buckingham Nicks</i>, was quickly nearing, so she was hoping for a deluxe box set and a grand tour where they reunited their old band to play that album end-to-end. Trouble was, though, that Buckingham wasn’t entirely on board, telling <i>Rolling Stone</i> a week later that her plan would be “economically suicidal.” Some dynamics are hard to change, and <i>Buckingham Nicks</i>—one of the most famous footnotes in rock ’n’ roll history—remained out of print beyond even its 50th anniversary. At last, it is back.\n\nThe early incarnation of Fleetwood Mac was stumbling out of the smoky ’60s haze when producer Keith Olsen played Mick Fleetwood a track from a debut he’d just produced by a handsome duo called Buckingham Nicks. Their record barely sold or generated much interest at all, but Fleetwood was so struck by what he heard that he wanted the guitarist in his own band. Buckingham, however, insisted that his girlfriend and harmony partner come along for what turned into one of music’s most infamous rides—a nonpareil hit factory fueled by breakup, blow, and betrayal. \n\nYou can hear the sparks that led to Fleetwood Mac’s subsequent masterpieces so clearly in these 10 tracks. Nicks’ nasal command cuts perfectly against Buckingham’s chiming guitar during “Long Distance Winner,” creating an irresistible frisson, while the pair’s all-uppers energy during “Don’t Let Me Down Again” predicts the excitement they’d soon put on the radio. Buckingham plays so beautifully during the brief instrumental “Stephanie,” while Nicks manages to be both mellow and menacing during “Races Are Run,” finding the steely willpower that would soon make her a permanent star. It is easy to hear these songs half a century later and wonder how these two didn’t make it as a duo. Turns out, they first had to change the way we heard rock songs with a band before we could truly appreciate how charmed this set, at last faithfully restored, actually was and is.","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Pop"],"name":"Buckingham Nicks","playParams":{"id":"1827113805","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"1973-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/buckingham-nicks/1827113805"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827113805/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1205332165","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1205332165?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758331663135,"RTCI":0}}},"1827315213":{"id":"1827315213","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827315213?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mariah Carey","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mariah-carey/91853","artwork":{"bgColor":"e9e9e9","hasP3":false,"height":3200,"textColor1":"171717","textColor2":"2a2a2a","textColor3":"414141","textColor4":"505050","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/00/53/54/00535476-ca81-846b-cf51-f1d98d5f28a2/764656422486_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3200},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"e6e6e6","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0a0a0a","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor3":"363636","textColor4":"464646","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cc/b7/4b/ccb74bfd-30e3-b2b7-6b18-c5c36b0bd09f/Job5ea20e02-5bb9-4d16-bc76-67911e73f468-203566114-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398046652_2345524619-Time1758305721103.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"faf8f8","gradient":{"color":"faf8f8","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"262626","textColor3":"393939","textColor4":"515151","textGradient":["000000","262626"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/13/7f/0f/137f0fcf-8256-f860-b576-f07122cfa842/Job96912374-1351-4826-a978-78ca2c3a9ddb-203566113-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398046653_2345524620-Time1758303988401.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"030303","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor3":"be9b7b","textColor4":"b38f6c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/00/20/a4/0020a441-59e5-deed-20f9-dfb61d898f98/97a79a7a-6da6-4c02-80b9-a604f919d5e2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"0f0316","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e2975d","textColor2":"d59879","textColor3":"b8794f","textColor4":"ad7a65","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/52/f0/2352f071-5643-bcdf-0cb7-2150820da25d/5430c146-9a2c-48b5-a734-162ca6a2f408.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Mariah Carey is “a little bit more vulnerable” on her 16th studio album.","standard":"In 2020, Mariah Carey gave her all to one of the most vulnerable works of her career—but for the first time, it wasn’t an album. Her memoir <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> laid bare her feelings about her complicated family life, the myriad successes of her record-breaking career, the joys of motherhood, and more. Though Carey’s an award-winning songwriter and has been known for her prowess with the pen since her 1990 debut, she tells Apple Music that the process of writing <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> unlocked something new for her when it came to plumbing particularly difficult emotional depths for her lyrics. “It definitely did something to me where I was just a little bit more vulnerable, a little bit more exposed, a little bit more able to be myself, regardless,” she says. \n\n<i>Here For It All</i>, her 16th studio album, is her first project to fully capitalize on this soul-searching, and look no further than the ballads for proof. “Nothing Is Impossible” is an ode to her own resilience (“I dream a greater dream/I fight a greater fight/I overcome it all”), and the grand and sentimental title track is the sort of unabashedly romantic that hits the ear like a love note read aloud (“When you leave/You take a little bit of every fiber that’s embedded in me”). These showstoppers are classically Carey, but so is the album’s robust mix of R&B, hip-hop, disco, gospel, and pop. “I was a little bit worried in the beginning that there were too many different types of records,” she says. “And I was just like, ‘I don’t care.’” \n\nWhether she’s vaulting her whistle tones to the heavens (alongside gospel legends The Clark Sisters on “Jesus I Do”), invoking ’90s street swagger with “Type Dangerous” (which samples Eric B. & Rakim’s “Eric B. Is President”), time-traveling with ’70s slow jams (courtesy of the Anderson .Paak collaboration “Play This Song”), or covering a childhood favorite (her take on Paul McCartney’s Wings classic “My Love”), Carey is unapologetically herself and relishing in every note. Read on for her thoughts on each track of <i>Here For It All</i>.\n\n<b>“Mi”</b>\n“It’s an ode to self-love and self-care. It was just one of those things where it’s tongue-in-cheek, but it’s still one of those ones that a lot of people were like, ‘Oh, I love this.’ I just visualize me in a hot tub every time.”\n\n<b>“Play This Song” (feat. Anderson .Paak)</b>\n“I definitely wanted to work with Anderson because he’s so brilliant and amazing at what he does, which is just being a kick-ass musician. But when we got into the studio, we decided we wanted to do something that was kind of ’70s, and we did give you that kind of vibe. So we started working on ‘Play This Song,’ and it was just one of those ones that I really loved. Working with him in the studio, he’s a great companion in terms of making music.”\n\n<b>“Type Dangerous”</b>\n“I was in a restaurant in Aspen, and I was with Andy [Anderson .Paak] and a couple of friends. All of a sudden they started playing music and playing different songs. Suddenly ‘Eric B. Is President’ comes on, and I was like, ‘What? I love this song. I haven’t heard this song in forever.’ We went to the studio the next day and started playing around with sampling it, and it’s just on and on from there... I made them play it over and over.”\n\n<b>“Sugar Sweet” (feat. Shenseea and Kehlani)</b>\n“I just think [Shenseea and Kehlani]’s freedom really shows, and they’re just present; they’re who they are. This makes the record so much younger and more fun, and I just thought it was everything. I’ve never had a trio before with three strong women, and having the ability to do this now, it’s amazing. I love what it speaks on. I love what it speaks to.”\n\n<b>“In Your Feelings”</b>\n“It’s one of those ones where you tell a story about something you’ve been through and put it together and you release it. And that’s what we did. People really like the ‘I think you might be getting a little bit too...’—that part. I like it a lot. I wasn’t really trying to say anything. I was just feeling the moment. I didn’t even appreciate it much until we did it and I lived with it for a while.”\n\n<b>“Nothing Is Impossible”</b>\n“I was just writing a couple of things, playing around with little ideas and working with my very close friend and musical director Daniel Moore. He was playing on the piano. I was singing along. We were following each other in terms of melody, and then I just took it home and wrote the lyrics. I think it’s one of those ones where I had to be by myself and really just off in my own world writing about these sort of feelings. I think it’s something, if anything, it would help somebody get through something.”\n\n<b>“Confetti & Champagne”</b>\n“I guess it’s about somebody that you’re not with anymore, but you’re speaking to them, and that’s it. You don’t really care. That’s the basic ‘Clink, clink, clink, pow/Look at me now.’ That’s basically it.”\n\n<b>“I Won’t Allow It”</b>\n“We took a long time writing it—not a long time with the actual words or the music, but it was just over time we produced more and did more. It’s another one with [.Paak], and he’s just so great at that type of vibe. There are some kiss-off moments in that. ‘I won’t entertain all your narcissistic ways’ is one of my favorite moments. ‘Should have been more proactive’—these parts just make me laugh.”\n\n<b>“My Love”</b>\n“It’s more an homage to my childhood, because I remember being a little girl and riding on the back of a motorcycle with my mother’s friend’s daughter and her boyfriend. This was their song, and they were in love. I’m still hoping that Paul McCartney might play something on it, which would be amazing. He is one of the greatest of all time, ever, and I just asked before I recorded the song, would he mind if I recorded it? I had a conversation with him, and he was like, ‘No, give it a shot, send it to me.’ And I’m like, ‘How do I do this? Because I really want him to be on this song doing background vocals, something.’ I don’t think that’s where he’s at right now, but he might lay something for the deluxe version. I would be thrilled out of my mind. But yeah, if you talk about the emotion when I’m singing it, it’s definitely about finding someone that you really revere and care for.”\n\n<b>“Jesus I Do” (feat. The Clark Sisters)</b>\n“I am a humongous Clark Sisters fan. I love their work. Karen Clark’s solo album is just scrumptious and unparalleled. I really was like, ‘I can’t believe I’m in here doing this.’ We wrote it together and sang it together. All the backgrounds that we did, I mean, I’m so inspired by their background vocals that when I get to mix that with mine, it’s something to be healed.”\n\n<b>“Here For It All”</b>\n“It’s just special to me; that’s why I put it at the end and named the album after it, because it’s personal to me. It’s not even something I want to even go into every beat of. I love the way it ends and then it doesn’t end. I thought this was going to be my gospel song on this album, because that’s the vibe it’s giving, but we have ‘Jesus I Do,’ so it’s different. I just feel like this is such a ‘Mariah Carey record’ in a way that other songs I’ve done however long ago weren’t, because it’s got a soulfulness to it, just the way that it’s arranged. I just feel like it’s something very personal, but also very like it’s giving this to other people that need to hear something like that.”\n","tagline":"New Album and

Nashville hitmaker makes his genre preference clear: “This is what it is.”","standard":"The Mississippi-born singer-songwriter dabbled in the sounds of heavy Southern rock on previous records like 2023’s <i>the mockingbird & THE CROW</i> and 2024’s <i>Quit!!</i>. But if you couldn’t tell from the title (or the fact that the word “country” appears seven times on the tracklist), the fourth album from HARDY is a country record—and don’t you forget it. As the hitmaker explained to Apple Music’s Ty Bentli, the title stems from comments he received over the years for his genre-bucking blend of country and rock. “In case you didn’t know what this is, this is what it is,” he says. “There’s a little bit of smartass in that, but it’s just part of who I am.”\n\nHARDY embraces his redneck roots on songs like “Bottomland,” an ode to his family’s deep history as outdoorsmen, and “Buck on the Wall,” inspired by a visit to his grandfather’s hunting cabin. (The latter first appeared on his May 2025 EP, titled—you guessed it—<i>COUNTRY!</i>.) On ERNEST duet “Bro Country,” the duo shrewdly comments on the genre’s evolution since HARDY cut his teeth in Nashville in the early 2010s. And on the title track, he rejects urban sprawl in favor of small-town simplicity: “If it was up to me, I’d make the whole damn country country.”\n\nJust past the exhortation of good old country livin’, a heavier theme lingers in the margins. “I know that if anybody listens to [the album] top-down, they’re going to think, ‘God, there’s a lot of songs about death,’” HARDY says. The fixation on mortality makes sense: While writing the album, he not only celebrated the birth of his first child but also lost his grandfather. Still, HARDY uses the potentially grim preoccupation as inspiration to live life to the fullest: “Let’s go to Paris, drink a beer on the roof/Hook up on some Ferris wheel and get matchin’ tattoos,” he sings on “Goodbye.” “It’s never a bad thing to remember that when you’re with the people that you love, one day you won’t be,” he explains. “You can channel that into a morbid thought, or you can channel that into a very positive mindset.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"COUNTRY!

The “Eyes on You” hitmaker had parted ways with the major-label system and wanted to reintroduce himself—something he continues on this ambitious and unexpected full-length collection. Written over the course of a few days after Rice performed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, <i>ELDORA</i> was a team effort, with Foy Vance, Wyatt McCubbin, and producer Oscar Charles serving as co-writers across the album’s dozen tracks. \n\nOpener “Cowboy Goodbye” is a spare ballad that almost sounds like a demo, capturing the intimacy at the heart of the album’s creation. The title track is similarly unadorned, as Rice sings mournfully of hitting the road from Tennessee to the titular Colorado town. “Tall Grass” features contributions from Alabama-born up-and-comer Kashus Culpepper and “My Boy” singer-songwriter Elvie Shane, with the trio turning in a soulful account of wishing for a better world for future generations. Rice teams up with traditionalist McCubbin on “Two Tone Trippin’,” an old-school barnburner with electric guitar by Music Row mainstay Charlie Worsham. And Madeline Edwards joins Rice on “Country & Western,” a brooding ballad with sultry vocals and a mysterious vibe.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"name":"ELDORA","playParams":{"id":"1828913217","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eldora/1828913217","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/01Yys35yorCs199XVnBOH7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828913217/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"412047193","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412047193?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758876283585,"RTCI":0}}},"1829591942":{"id":"1829591942","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829591942?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cameron Whitcomb","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cameron-whitcomb/1542957700","artwork":{"bgColor":"94854a","hasP3":false,"height":1425,"textColor1":"040302","textColor2":"070302","textColor3":"211d10","textColor4":"231d10","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b3/b7/a1/b3b7a1d8-e176-d938-2497-2df488d53575/075679604057.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1425},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"110303","gradient":{"color":"110303","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fd1100","textColor3":"cebda4","textColor4":"cd0e00","textGradient":["ffffff","fd1100"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ed/fb/13/edfb1346-25fe-5d0f-e05f-0fc4c4c8df9f/Job08da3f87-5c95-4c05-a3ea-414d50903b88-199230346-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390039627_2279093244-Time1754331683094.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"110303","gradient":{"color":"110303","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fc270e","textColor3":"b4bd88","textColor4":"cf1f0b","textGradient":["ffffff","fc270e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/94/f1/e8/94f1e83f-e8da-667c-67b2-a00dc6f644ed/Job575030e9-9122-4f55-830c-29ca910eea86-199230347-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390039778_2279093245-Time1754333897218.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c9b977","textColor2":"c7b75f","textColor3":"a29560","textColor4":"a0934d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7c/7e/72/7c7e72c4-f70c-e872-6c74-1f99ff62d2b3/c7eac96a-689f-4001-a201-b590983a6b8b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"a09c9a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0f0f0e","textColor2":"1b1916","textColor3":"2c2b2a","textColor4":"353331","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/34/a6/f1/34a6f16a-8e71-4eb6-17d2-c974bd69b06e/d91f0b3b-32c0-4dc2-acb0-ad5d1aad33d3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An intimate, wrenching debut that chronicles the journey out of addiction.","standard":"Cameron Whitcomb took a roundabout path to country music. The 22-year-old rising star left home at the age of 17 to work on the Trans Mountain pipeline, a job he pursued until the songs he began posting online found an audience and landed him on Season 20 of <i>American Idol</i>. An addict since adolescence, Whitcomb also found sobriety during this period, and these formative experiences serve as a thematic foundation for the 15 tracks on his full-length debut. Produced by Jack Riley, <i>The Hard Way</i> is rootsy country music in the vein of Zach Bryan or Sam Barber, though Whitcomb’s own sound expands to include shades of melodic pop, alt-rock, and even a touch of punk. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a wrenching account of facing and overcoming the demons that accompany addiction and depression. That tune also takes sonic cues from the stomp-clap folk of the 2010s, an influence also heard on tracks like “Options” and “Hundred Mile High.” Other highlights include “Quitter,” a clear-eyed chronicle of chasing sobriety that acknowledges the interpersonal challenges of addiction, and “As I Stand Before the Coffin,” on which Whitcomb grapples with loss and grief with compassion and self-awareness. Whitcomb ups the personal ante of this collection with periodic spoken interludes, lending the album a lived-in intimacy that underscores its immense vulnerability.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"name":"The Hard Way","playParams":{"id":"1829591942","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hard-way/1829591942","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/01rtI8jY5h2ZdPHMXnWJtb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829591942/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1542957700","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1542957700?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758876056999,"RTCI":0}}},"1829673291":{"id":"1829673291","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829673291?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lucas Peire & Frank Montasell","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1029406047-1076888461","artwork":{"bgColor":"f78a05","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"010506","textColor2":"070503","textColor3":"322006","textColor4":"371f03","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7e/83/ac/7e83ace6-f2eb-d0d8-fb8e-eedefee09264/810123166855.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"name":"Billionaires' Bunker (Soundtrack from the Netflix Series)","playParams":{"id":"1829673291","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":21,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/billionaires-bunker-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-series/1829673291","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0D5wrIW8ayDyxyM4YeWlqQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829673291/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1029406047","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1029406047?l=en-US"},{"id":"1076888461","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1076888461?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758331831781,"RTCI":0}}},"1830276102":{"id":"1830276102","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830276102?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bright Eyes","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bright-eyes/6547614","artwork":{"bgColor":"8db8c2","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"34110e","textColor2":"3c221c","textColor3":"453232","textColor4":"4c403d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6b/40/2f/6b402feb-28cc-9d25-1566-3435d850fc05/57677.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ae1006","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"d0f3f9","textColor2":"fccf9a","textColor3":"c9c6c9","textColor4":"eca97c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/47/3c/a1/473ca145-f9cd-0bf9-06f1-a44e3c5008a5/Job33d48c30-638e-4cb5-9c95-f4f05243b4ee-201238071-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393792221_2309731691-Time1756229853007.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"6b0f0f","gradient":{"color":"6b0f0f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"0d1111","textColor3":"370906","textColor4":"391513","textGradient":["ffffff","0d1111"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a0/73/70/a0737059-3cf2-4b77-305b-b493097e7f2c/Job36389a9a-2786-4553-8803-dc745d667cae-201238070-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393792220_2309731692-Time1756227920774.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"212418","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"a4c49c","textColor2":"dcafa3","textColor3":"89a481","textColor4":"b69387","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1b/b5/17/1bb5178b-6ce3-7b54-0460-0843cbb51f21/0a09aa4d-16a5-4c9e-8ec0-d94d6511d13f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Conor Oberst indulges angry invectives, grandiose pop...and first-wave ska.","standard":"In 2024, Bright Eyes’ inimitable figurehead Conor Oberst lent his distinctively black-and-blue vocals to “The World is Dangerous,” a dusky and ruminative tune from Alynda Segarra’s eighth album as Hurray for the Riff Raff, <i>The Past is Still Alive</i>. Clearly, the collab rubbed off on Oberst, whose EP <i>Kids Table</i>—a follow-up to 2024’s Bright Eyes album <i>Five Dice, All Threes</i>—finds him creatively melding with Segarra directly (the languid, slide guitar-laden, and exquisitely Bright Eyes-y “Dyslexic Palindrome”) while taking a seeming inspiration from their own folk-rock travelogues.\n\nWith lyrical invectives against hipsters, Ronald Reagan, and various clothing retailers, “1st World Blues” has a first-wave ska feel that makes you think, if only for a second, that Oberst has busted out a porkpie hat and two-tone suit in the studio.

Little Mix star packs her solo debut with big hooks and heartfelt emotions.","standard":"Propulsive rhythms, cheerful guitar riffs, belting vocals—the recipe for cooking up a self-titled debut solo album from Little Mix alum Perrie Edwards makes use of all these ingredients. With Edwards working alongside a healthy helping of cream from the hit songwriter crop—Maegan Cottone (Little Mix, Kylie Minogue), Plested (Lewis Capaldi, Jonas Brothers), and Ed Drewett (One Direction) are among the names credited—<i>Perrie</i> plays out like a master class in folk-influenced pop.\n\nOpening with the one-two punch of sentimental Ed Sheeran co-write “Forget About Us” and the wry, he’s-just-not-that-into-you wisdom of “If He Wanted to He Would,” Edwards strikes a plain-talking, open-hearted chord that resonates throughout the entire album. “Rocket Scientist” builds up a scene of romantic disconnection into a charged anthemic chorus; “Punchline” soundtracks a sardonic look on the bright side of life’s trials and tribulations with polished funk production; the midtempo “Absofuckinglutely” narrates a marriage proposal that receives an unambiguously emphatic response. The album’s most intriguing moments however, veer away from stomp-clap optimism and waggish lyrics to maximize Edwards’ undeniable vocal talents. While the light and breezy cuts on <i>Perrie</i> go down easy, the standouts are “Goodbye My Friend” and “Miss You”—a sensational R&B ballad penned with Tre Jean-Marie and MNEK—both of which call to mind early-career Mariah Carey.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Perrie","playParams":{"id":"1833885341","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/perrie/1833885341","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/40D8mOfQknlA99Q7QpLJEC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833885341/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1729865272","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1729865272?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758890517496,"RTCI":0}}},"1834026089":{"id":"1834026089","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834026089?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Peezy","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/peezy/1433819455","artwork":{"bgColor":"18250c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f0f5ea","textColor2":"c9b594","textColor3":"c5cbbe","textColor4":"a59879","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/33/d1/21/33d1214b-1d40-d99b-4f00-21630d36749d/199316236552_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Detroit rap maestro commands an elite guest list.","standard":"Regarding the annals of Detroit rap, Peezy has already ensured his name will go down in regional history.

With her world-conquering third album, 2021’s <i>Planet Her</i>, Doja Cat completed her evolution from viral internet oddball to full-on pop-rap star. Well, sorta: Ever the contrarian, the musician born Amala Dlamini announced in early 2023 that she was leaving pop music behind; months later, her fourth album, <i>Scarlet</i>, showcased her formidable rap skills with flinty songs that rejected the terms of her mainstream success. But when she began to conceptualize her fifth album last year, the pendulum swung the other way. “I think I love talking about love,” Doja tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And I also think music is just such a door for expressing love in its different forms.”\n\nOn <i>Vie</i> (the French word for life, or the phonetic interpretation of the Roman numeral five), Doja pulls up via DeLorean with a whole new sound and style. Artfully grounded in the decadence of the ’80s, she spiffs up songs about love-bombing and limerence with skittering drum machines, punchy basslines, and the occasional sax solo. She channels Queen on “AAAHH MEN!,” an ode to the maddening, demoralizing, irresistible pleasures of men, and brings new jack swing into the 2020s on lead single “Jealous Type.” Naturally, what she called “that ’80s tacky romance sort of spin” demanded Doja’s first meet-up with pop’s premiere nostalgist, Jack Antonoff. “And so it’s the grappling with talking about something personal and creating something fresh, and then getting to know someone new,” she tells Lowe of their collaboration. “All of these things fell together really naturally.”\n\nMore playful than its predecessor, <i>Vie</i> relishes in its campy mood board and dishy subject matter: On “Silly! Fun!,” a punch-drunk R&B throwback about romantic delusion, the honeymoon’s over nearly as soon as it starts (“I know it could be a blast to just pop out a baby/We’re so very silly, getting married in Vegas”). But just because it’s flamboyant doesn’t mean it can’t be deep. “This album really grew from my sessions in therapy, and being so gung-ho on being there twice a week,” she says. “And learning about the human experience and how our brains function subconsciously and consciously.” Meanwhile, she mastered her singing skills—note the chops towards the end of “Jealous Type.” “I feel like I can do a lot more things that I could never do,” she says. “It’s just a more evolved, more mature version of whatever I’ve been doing since the beginning.”\n\nHigh-gloss romance aside, love manifests in other ways. “I think that creativity is love,” Doja tells Lowe. “You risk a lot for love. And so when a musician loves what they do, sometimes that entails things that are kind of uncomfortable and scary. But it doesn’t matter, because you love that thing so much.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Vie","playParams":{"id":"1834042903","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vie/1834042903","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1cqqIH16XzBnDchrXJ9Enf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834042903/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"830588310","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/830588310?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758899125750,"RTCI":0}}},"1834550403":{"id":"1834550403","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834550403?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cardo Got Wings","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cardo-got-wings/1452652457","artwork":{"bgColor":"c7c6c7","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"212225","textColor2":"4b2328","textColor3":"424345","textColor4":"634447","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4b/0d/b7/4b0db78e-d31a-00da-57b8-48f66db6b3a5/199316241679_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"f0e9e8","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"302d2e","textColor2":"2e2e31","textColor3":"565353","textColor4":"555455","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/03/f0/50/03f0502c-450b-d604-80ad-279b2551558f/Jobd5dd8384-12de-421f-aa8b-cbc9211463b9-203403110-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397728323_2342929730-Time1758153193692.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2b2c4e","textColor3":"4f4d4f","textColor4":"52526d","textGradient":["ffffff","2b2c4e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2a/f1/0f/2af10f73-0886-5508-a3fa-0bcde47b9a31/Jobc419af3a-ab1d-4755-9f5e-8fe11b2d35a3-203403109-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397728322_2342929729-Time1758151341711.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A versatile MC and producer elevates a crop of promising young voices.","standard":"For over 15 years, Cardo Got Wings has been quietly building an infallible production résumé in hip-hop, establishing himself as a go-to collaborator for superstars and underground MCs alike.

The nine-track effort represents the second full-length Japanese album released by the K-pop octet since their 2018 debut under KQ Entertainment, and it’s an expansion of the group’s music further past swashbuckling swagger to sentimental sensuality. It brings together four previously released J-pop tracks (“NOT OKAY,” “Days,” “Birthday,” and “Forevermore”) and five new ones (“Ash,” “12 Midnight,” “Tippy Toes,” “FACE,” and “Crescendo”), giving the album a temporal scope broader than the group’s prolific output might suggest is possible. \n\nThe album brings in more of ATEEZ’s signature rap in “12 Midnight,” a song about fighting through anxieties in the middle of the night. “Tippy Toes” keeps things low-key before ATEEZ erupts into the J-rock-fueled frenzy of “FACE” and the unbridled sentiment of “Crescendo,” the latter asking fans (known as ATINY) to stay “together, forever” with the group. “Let's hide away, like the setting sun/So that we won't be found in this ever-changing world,” members Seonghwa, Hongjoong, Yunho, Yeosang, San, Mingi, Wooyoung, and Jongho suggest on the album-ending ballad “Forevermore.” The song is an emotional tribute to a time that must pass—though not just yet.\n","tagline":"New

Often the artists helming Apple Music’s exclusive Early Hours DJ mix series cater to both frames of mind. “This mix can be enjoyed at the start of the day, poolside on a sunny afternoon, or as the sun is rising after a big night,” KILIMANJARO tells Apple Music. “The beauty is in the fluidity. I try to approach chill-out sets with a fresh vision every time, but there are classics that always seem to stake their claim.” \n\nThe London-based multihyphenate sets the tone with Samm’s chilled beauty “Body Language,” before bringing out a selection that’s like a big hug, perfect for winding down or easing yourself into the day. “My aim was to create that feeling of warmth and hope. The mix of vocals, instrumentation, and percussion is intended to create a space for peace and optimism,” he says. “And if not, it’s just a blend of great records that make you feel good! I was really excited to put this set together, as due to the energetic nature of my shows, it’s a style that I rarely get to play out.” Listen and read on as KILIMANJARO highlights a new of his favorite tracks to spin in the early hours.\n\n<b>&ME, Black Coffee, “The Rapture Pt. III”</b>\n“A record that I’ve loved from the moment I heard it. Part three of the ‘Rapture’ trilogy, the track takes you on an emotional rollercoaster every time. I think the record coming from two heroes of mine, Black Coffee and &ME, makes it even more magical.”\n\n<b>Francis Mercier, Von Boch, “Found Love”</b>\n“Such a heartwarming record. Its iconic vocal married with this Afro-house foundation makes for an ideal chill set track. Also being produced by two friends of mine, Francis Mercier and Von Boch, makes it that extra bit special.”\n\n<b>Jazzy, KILIMANJARO, “No Bad Vibes (Adriatique & Samm Remix)”</b>\n“This remix of ‘No Bad Vibes’ is my personal favorite. Having been a massive fan of both Adriatique and Samm for a minute, it was a privilege to have them put this track together, and I’ve been slamming it out at every opportunity since we got it back.”","tagline":"New DJ Mix"},"genreNames":["Afro House","Music","African","Dance","House"],"name":"Early Hours (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1838037421","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/early-hours-dj-mix/1838037421"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838037421/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1633454189","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1633454189?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758842416091,"RTCI":0}}},"1838368858":{"id":"1838368858","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838368858?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"BROWN EYED SOUL","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brown-eyed-soul/148045514","artwork":{"bgColor":"bcb6b3","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0e0c","textColor2":"312821","textColor3":"2d302d","textColor4":"4c443e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0f/10/d1/0f10d179-369d-0874-5904-ad9c4ecec4fe/191953471730.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"83775b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"020103","textColor2":"040301","textColor3":"1c1914","textColor4":"1d1a13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/51/82/ca/5182ca24-2a33-e936-8d73-b5b3f63150c4/3417fef0-e43b-4802-a7ba-f4edf0700361.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"Soul Tricycle","playParams":{"id":"1838368858","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-23","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/soul-tricycle/1838368858","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2gynWgXZ5cqwvL0S0J4naU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838368858/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"148045514","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/148045514?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758845642812,"RTCI":0}}},"1838378210":{"id":"1838378210","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838378210?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sasi The Don & Jerusha","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=467044833-1439140264","artwork":{"bgColor":"3d0404","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f48f2a","textColor2":"e96262","textColor3":"cf7322","textColor4":"c64f4f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cc/48/46/cc4846b5-5d10-cf6b-aef9-6ba04336f170/196873586465.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Reggae","Music"],"name":"FYRE -

Warm saxophones reminiscent of sophisti-pop legends The Blue Nile surprisingly pop up on “Bluebirds,” while Gutierrez heads deep into straight-up trance territory with the ascendant, glorious fromage of “We Don’t Leave the House.” There are moments of striking tenderness on <i>Y’all</i>—witness the tangled guitar balladry of “i love you and it sounds stupid”—but cuts like the lurching “Modafinil” and the micro-IDM of “Vendi Vidi Vici” drive home Gutierrez’s impressive skill of melding pop smarts with intricately eggheaded electronic baubles.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Electronic","Electronica"],"name":"Y’all","playParams":{"id":"1838587274","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-25","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yall/1838587274","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3QliGTfl4dbkKLI17VkbVl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838587274/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1465672438","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1465672438?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758863630661,"RTCI":0}}},"1838735761":{"id":"1838735761","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838735761?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"TYGAPAW","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tygapaw/1306182435","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"392110","textColor2":"382515","textColor3":"614d40","textColor4":"5f5143","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/40/25/62/402562a5-7dff-f54d-854b-897c8b18b3ca/4070209002415_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"IMMIGRANT - Single","playParams":{"id":"1838735761","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-23","trackCount":2,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/immigrant-single/1838735761"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838735761/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1306182435","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1306182435?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758859569670,"RTCI":0}}},"1838752033":{"id":"1838752033","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838752033?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Fuerza Regida","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fuerza-regida/1275690475","artwork":{"bgColor":"390515","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f59f70","textColor2":"fc5344","textColor3":"cf805e","textColor4":"d5443b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/62/80/21/62802108-29c3-c28c-c219-4fb41bbb4ca3/196873592183.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"360414","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e8a684","textColor2":"f59f70","textColor3":"c4866e","textColor4":"ce805e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d1/71/50/d17150d5-4263-50c1-d4e6-04522e6fa493/1c347bde-21d8-4498-9bbc-5cc047208443.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"06001b","hasP3":true,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor3":"b27f67","textColor4":"a36f56","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/09/66/3d/09663dbf-a26f-fe02-3b2a-dcbf2a75aeba/647abe23-35ca-44fd-a9e2-1bfea609484c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"160910","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d7a79a","textColor2":"97aed5","textColor3":"b1877e","textColor4":"7d8dad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/5b/44/d05b44e5-15e6-5df0-545a-362de72bed29/f70f1540-e137-45a8-b2f1-ec1449819162.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"380f21","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e4c5bb","textColor2":"cea8a8","textColor3":"c1a19c","textColor4":"b0898d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b5/91/9b/b5919bcf-055a-ef45-0800-c25a1139ffbc/3a6168d2-6f5e-4f64-98cf-43ea491fab3a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"ccbec9","textColor2":"e9604a","textColor3":"a398a1","textColor4":"bb4d3b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/18/05/8d/18058d2d-03e8-8989-3ef7-4558fd07c221/b0b8d4ae-8136-4c35-b1e2-796cbf212310.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Hear songs in Spatial Audio from Fuerza Regida’s Mexico City performance.","standard":"Música mexicana stars Fuerza Regida only played a handful of live shows to celebrate the release of their <i>111XPANTIA</i> album, noting explicitly, “Esto No Es Un Tour.” What’s fortunate for fans who couldn’t make it to any of the shows is that Apple Music Live was there to chronicle the Mexico City stop, where they performed tracks from the album, along with the wealth of hits that got them there, presented for you here after having been mixed and mastered in Spatial Audio.

with two new tracks featuring some special guests.","standard":"When Miley Cyrus won her first Grammys in 2024 (Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers” from 2023’s <i>Endless Summer Vacation</i>), something shifted. “I think somewhere inside of me, I needed to hold a trophy and just feel for a moment that I have something that I can hold in my hands that feels like a true achievement,” the 32-year-old child star turned pop icon tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “After every album, I’ve been able to say, ‘Well, I made the album I set out to make, and that’s enough.’ Somewhere, I was avoiding the fact that it did matter to me.”\n\nHaving finally achieved the validation she’d been longing to feel since childhood, Cyrus says she “felt free to make the album that I’ve really been craving my whole adult career to create.” The name of the resulting album, her ninth, emerged out of the ether while riffing in the studio with producer Max Taylor-Sheppard and Cyrus’ boyfriend/collaborator, Liily drummer Maxx Morando. “As soon as [Taylor-Sheppard] played the first chord, I just said, ‘Tell me something beautiful tonight.’ It was so easy, but I have no idea where it came from. The chord he played was so beautiful that what needed to be said had to be beautiful.”\n\nIn the title track, a Sunday morning soul jam erupts with a “flash, bang, spark” into post-apocalyptic prog-rock distortion. That clash of sensuality and chaos extends through <i>Something Beautiful</i>, whose ’80s-inspired melodrama swings for the fences in sound and theme. The deceptively sparkly-sounding “End of the World” celebrates one last blowout bash before the sky falls. “This, to me, is pop music in its fullest form,” Cyrus says. “Pop gets given a bad name by manufactured label creations, and that’s just not what it is.” She’s thinking of legendary pop innovators who evolved with the times: David Bowie, Madonna, Elton John.\n\nThe ultra-funky “Easy Lover” was intended for another such icon: Cyrus originally wrote it circa 2020’s <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, then refurbished it for placement on Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. When Bey went with “II MOST WANTED” instead, Cyrus kept the slinky number for herself, recruiting Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard to play electric guitar—though the “Tell ’em, B!” ad-lib stays.\n\nCyrus’ inimitable voice has never sounded more soulful, though that has not come without a price. She tells Apple Music she has Reinke’s edema, a rare condition which causes fluid to build up in the outer layer of the vocal folds—hence her trademark rasp. “So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am,” she says. “But it’s extremely difficult to perform with, because it’s like running a marathon with ankle weights on.” It could be removed surgically, but for Cyrus, the benefit isn’t worth the risk, “because the chance of waking up from surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability.”\n\nThroughout a career that’s spanned two-thirds of her life, Cyrus has felt lost in the static. “White noise is essentially everything happening all at the same time, and I feel like that was what the last 20 years of my career felt like,” she says. But while recording <i>Something Beautiful</i>, she found herself coming to terms with everything that’s come before. Over the heavy disco groove of “Reborn,” she delivers a mission statement: “If heaven exists/I’ve been there before/Kill my ego/Let’s be reborn.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe

2024 album gets a prequel: “I went deep in my story as a Puerto Rican.”","standard":"“I wanted to start putting hints to people through this classic era, the salsa sounds, the Puerto Rican immigration,” Rauw Alejandro tells Apple Music about returning to the world of his inventive and mature 2024 album <i>Cosa Nuestra</i>. “And through that journey, I found so many things, and so many sounds, that it was impossible to put it in just one project.” Framed as more of a prequel than a sequel, <i>Cosa Nuestra: Capítulo 0</i> moves even further away from the groundbreaking futurism of the preceding <i>SATURNO</i> era of his career. “I just went deep in my story as a Puerto Rican,” he says.\n\nIn doing so, the Latin superstar’s style shifts closer to the very Caribbean essence from which he first emerged, a deliberate choice that provides the album with a profoundly unique sound with robust cultural roots. The forms presented here exist both within and beyond genre, with immersive songs like “Caribeño” and “NÁUFRAGOS” rendering well-worn terminology like “fusion” rather useless. \n\n“I always study everything before I’m going to jump into it, any type of sound or music,” Alejandro says. “I like to learn a little bit [of] the history.” Whether swinging to salsa on “FALSEDAD” or basking in bachata on “SILENCIO,” he seems consistently at home, sonically and otherwise. The spiritual and the secular become one on his sublimely tropical “GuabanSexxx,” while polyrhythmic percussion elevates the intricate love song “Carita Linda.”\n\nFrom pop-savvy Puerto Rican singer De La Rose to Dominican rap shapeshifter Jey One, the guests who occasionally enter Alejandro’s <i>Cosa Nuestra: Capítulo 0</i> zone contribute in ways simultaneously familiar and fresh. For instance, Wisin and Ñengo Flow naturally bring perreo power to “CONTRABANDO,” yet the underlying groove goes beyond the standard reggaetón mode. Even when he reaches beyond the Caribbean, as with Nigerian singer Ayra Starr on the Afrobeats-inflected “Santa” or Chilean alt-pop act Mon Laferte on “Callejón de los Secretos,” it all fits within the space he’s so carefully constructed. “I didn’t know where this journey was going to take me,” he says. “You keep growing as an artist, as a person.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"name":"Cosa Nuestra: Capítulo 0","playParams":{"id":"1839980812","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cosa-nuestra-cap%C3%ADtulo-0/1839980812","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/752aUI4EPYOGrNuo74pmCR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839980812/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1107186883","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1107186883?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758893980963,"RTCI":0}}},"1840168390":{"id":"1840168390","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840168390?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Andreas K.

For anybody wondering what she’s been up to in the meantime, allow her to set the record straight: When she wasn’t flexing at Fashion Week, she was mostly holed up in the studio, battling a mean case of writer’s block. “I really went through a crash where nothing was pleasing me—nothing,” the artist born Belcalis Almánzar tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Despite spending more time in the studio than at home, Cardi describes recording song after song that just didn’t feel right while fans clamored for <i>Invasion of Privacy</i>’s hotly anticipated follow-up.\n\nRather than brush off the funk, Cardi harnessed the full force of its power on <i>AM I THE DRAMA?</i>, her long-awaited sophomore album, named for a revelation after a vain attempt to stay out of the headlines. “For some reason, I’m getting tried even when I’m not saying nothing,” she says. “And it’s like, damn—do drama chase me, or am I just the drama?” Here, the unapologetic MC channels her pent-up aggression into belligerent trap bangers that remind you who’s the “first rap bitch on the cover of <i>Vogue</i>.” “I tried to come in peace/They tore me into pieces/Now I gotta RIP it,” she snarls on “Dead,” which opens with a report of a recent crime spree targeting “bloggers, journalists, and, most chillingly, several female rappers” before Summer Walker sings about pulling off her enemies’ lacefronts.\n\n“I’m a very colorful person,” Cardi tells Lowe. “But this past year, I feel like something kind of was dying inside of me. My humbleness, me trying so much to be unproblematic, me trying to avoid drama, avoid the disses, avoid the bitches—that’s dying out in me. Because I’m really about to show you, bitch, that you are not fucking with me. The cockiness is being born again.” The attitude comes through on “Imaginary Playerz,” Cardi’s riff on the 1997 JAY-Z classic, which was born on a bad day in the studio during the summer of 2024. “I was really caught in a funk,” she explains. “It was the third, fourth day that I’m sleeping on the couch in the studio. I’m exhausted. I’m pregnant as fuck. And I was just going through some drama in my life, and I just was so tired, so over it.” Trying to lighten the mood, her engineer blasted the JAY-Z original, and a light bulb went off. “I’m like, ‘Yo, imagine if I flip this, but my way,’” she thought, suddenly remembering that she had an awful lot to brag about.\n\nAmidst all the <i>DRAMA</i>, there are moments of levity—she recruits Selena Gomez, Tyla, and Lourdiz for a trio of sultry R&B bops, flips a Janet Jackson classic for the buoyant “Principal,” and reps her roots on “Bodega Baddie,” a high-octane norteño banger. But first, there are shots to be fired—whether at her so-called peers or at the low-down, dirty dogs she disses over the Triggerman sample on “Outside.” And on “Man of Your Word,” she opens up about the demise of her marriage over mournful steel drums. Between the flexing and the reflecting, <i>DRAMA</i> feels like catharsis—and that’s before it ends on 2020’s record-shattering, zeitgeist-capturing “WAP.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"AM I THE DRAMA?
