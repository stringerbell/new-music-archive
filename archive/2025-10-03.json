Since breaking through in 2014 with the bubbling house banger “It’s Just (House of Dupree),” the British producer has continually played with sound and identity. His 2018 full-length debut, <i>Nothing Is Still</i>, traced his grandparents’ emigration to America through neo-classical textures, and 2021’s <i>Rare, Forever</i>, a collection of free-form electronics, was born from what he called “battling his own ego,” a flex-filled attempt to define himself and his place in the world. On <i>In Daytona Yellow</i>, Vynehall lets go entirely. By ditching his ego and leaning into discomfort, he becomes his most vulnerable. \n\nFor the first time, Vynehall places his own voice and lyrics at the center. Even when sharing space with collaborators Jeshi, TYSON, Beau Nox, POiSON ANNA, and Chartreuse, the perspective remains his. Sonically, he’s as agile as ever, weaving live instrumentation and string arrangements into his shapeshifting palette. Atop the dark club beat of “Mirror’s Edge,” an uneasy bilingual dialogue blurs the line between self-loathing and self-love. That duality resurfaces on “Whip,” atmospheric hip-hop exposing the gap between outward appearance and inner turmoil, while the wistful “A Jagged Promise” lingers in spiritual stasis. Elsewhere, love becomes a challenge (“Romantica”) and a mirror to the self (“You Strange Precious Thing”).\n\nDuring the writing process, Vynehall found his North Star in the lyrics of Leonard Cohen’s 1992 song “Anthem”: “Forget your perfect offering/There is a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in.” These words thread the record but resonate most strongly on the tranquil closer “New Skin / Old Body,” which welcomes risk and sees flaws not as mistakes, but as conduits for transformation. “What you do may bear no fruit/But don't see an idle pursuit,” he adds. “Without a vision, absolute/Then you are just a strange loop.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"In Daytona Yellow","playParams":{"id":"1791149925","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-daytona-yellow/1791149925","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0uxwDrSCeLR4coJ1xT9F0U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791149925/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"523134625","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/523134625?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759443300298,"RTCI":0}}},"1796021246":{"id":"1796021246","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796021246?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"aldn","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aldn/1524910972","artwork":{"bgColor":"090b0a","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"dc868a","textColor2":"fd3c3d","textColor3":"b26e70","textColor4":"cc3233","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/59/38/c1/5938c1a7-804a-6102-11fb-5401c6474c0a/663918088418.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Dance","House"],"name":"Strung Out Symphony","playParams":{"id":"1796021246","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/strung-out-symphony/1796021246","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4vkZh7v970FaGHlF16IDeW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796021246/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1524910972","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1524910972?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759491313230,"RTCI":0}}},"1804980126":{"id":"1804980126","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804980126?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Beauty School","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/beauty-school/1449064123","artwork":{"bgColor":"dcd5cf","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0605","textColor2":"0c0808","textColor3":"362f2e","textColor4":"363130","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7f/32/8b/7f328ba1-2ec5-8fea-31e6-68a40bd9c56a/199066906743.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"From Now On","playParams":{"id":"1804980126","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-now-on/1804980126","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7zY1huGqZnrJbE4kKSTMNk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804980126/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1449064123","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1449064123?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759399717897,"RTCI":0}}},"1808945914":{"id":"1808945914","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808945914?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Whiskey Myers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/whiskey-myers/282264074","artwork":{"bgColor":"d4dad2","hasP3":false,"height":4500,"textColor1":"181111","textColor2":"261d15","textColor3":"3d3a38","textColor4":"48423b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ae/ed/e3/aeede39a-1518-c45e-aaa9-48c727655d88/8721215057963.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4500},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The country-rock band’s Texas roots are laid bare on their seventh album.","standard":"Whiskey Myers pride themselves on making genre-blurring music, so the title of this seventh album from the Texas outfit feels especially fitting, offering an onomatopoeic preview of the 11 tracks to come. Produced by Nashville juggernaut Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Lainey Wilson), <i>Whomp Whack Thunder</i> is more rock album than country, though the sextet’s Texas roots can’t help but shine through. The record opens with “Time Bomb,” a grungy, crunchy rocker that lets lead vocalist Cody Cannon—who can wail with the best of them—really let loose from the get-go. “Tailspin” is similarly rowdy, with sludgy guitar and a swaggering beat that, together, scream Southern rock. “Born to Do” gives the band a chance to show off its softer side, with vocals from Cannon that recall the early work of Black Crowes lead singer Chris Robinson. Closing track “Monsters” is introspective and encouraging, ending the record with the refrain “So dry your eyes and don’t be afraid.”","tagline":"New

it makes perfect sense that Megan James and Corin Roddick would envision their self-titled fourth album as the soundtrack to a <i>Final Fantasy</i>-style RPG that exists only in their own minds. But while <i>purity ring</i> comes loaded with fleet-footed, breakbeat-driven bops (“many lives,” “between you and shadows”) ideal for whipping through levels at warp speed and slaying enemies with militaristic precision, the album’s more manic tracks flow naturally into meditative soundscapes (“part ii,” “mistral”) that reflect the more exploratory aspects of gaming, where you’re content to just wander through and marvel at the digital vistas around you. And even if you’re not a headset-sporting joystick jockey, there’s no resisting the emotional undertow of “imanocean,” where James turns off the pitch-shifting vocal filters and Roddick eases off the electro-freakery to deliver an acoustic-driven, heart-pumping indie-pop anthem.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"name":"purity

Even though they weren’t around to witness the glory days of alt-rock, they spent the first years of their career touring with the luminaries that inspired them to start a band in the first place: The Smashing Pumpkins, Ride, Silversun Pickups, and Sunny Day Real Estate. It was those formative touring experiences that helped shape their debut LP, <i>R is for Rocket</i>, which marks a significant sharpening of their sound from their first EP, 2023’s <i>Versions of You</i>. Produced by the band’s guitarist Desi Scaglione, <i>R is for Rocket</i> is crisp and precise, anthemic, punchy guitar rock bolstered by the electrifying vocals of Alithea Tuttle. There’s the propulsive odd-meter rhythm of opener “The Choice,” the Nirvana-esque drum fills and crunching guitars of “Crossing Fingers,” and the Radiohead-inspired balladry of “Number One Fan.” Whoever proclaimed that rock is dead clearly forgot to alert Rocket.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"R is for Rocket","playParams":{"id":"1817135193","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/r-is-for-rocket/1817135193","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/71B3Y4OdzrQNt6acfdKsIG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817135193/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1645124479","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1645124479?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759454633436,"RTCI":0}}},"1817499239":{"id":"1817499239","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817499239?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Zara Larsson","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zara-larsson/570372593","artwork":{"bgColor":"161c2a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d5e4ee","textColor2":"e8aa7a","textColor3":"aebcc7","textColor4":"be8e6a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fb/1d/2d/fb1d2d1c-0f79-53ad-ab9b-ac20918b5856/196873177199.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"030901","gradient":{"color":"030901","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"039bdf","textColor3":"be8f6b","textColor4":"0782bb","textGradient":["ffffff","039bdf"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/22/71/99/2271996d-36a4-36ec-6ab8-2e5ff355faa9/Job5ec79a95-c09e-46ec-957d-9fa1cb81fbe5-202034654-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395282632_2322458160-Time1756933409992.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"030901","gradient":{"color":"030901","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e8aa77","textColor3":"afa590","textColor4":"bf8f67","textGradient":["ffffff","e8aa77"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f2/7e/e6/f27ee653-0751-3701-4b02-27f70c7a41ab/Job8847041b-1122-4274-aec6-35f9f1efb4b4-202034653-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395282633_2322458159-Time1756931881970.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"133d7b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"acdaf1","textColor2":"8ec0e7","textColor3":"8dbbd9","textColor4":"75a6d1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7b/b1/aa/7bb1aa37-25f9-f589-e0b2-8c8ee25d5db6/e3d9af16-3e9a-43f7-bb4b-5f01331dab5d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"041448","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e8a8aa","textColor2":"e88396","textColor3":"bb8a97","textColor4":"ba6d86","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/87/62/0a/87620a99-698f-1944-49c8-b7efff838f3a/d5366926-24d0-49a8-a5b9-cb251414e845.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Swedish dance-pop star finds a new level of audacity and ecstasy.","standard":"Swedish pop phenom Zara Larsson has spent her career steadily building towards a point of pure dance-floor ecstasy, and her fifth album <i>Midnight Sun</i> represents the point where she’s seemingly finally reached the summit.

From the radio-friendly uplifter “Nice to Each Other” to the sweeping, late ’60s Dionne Warwick-esque soul of “So Easy (To Fall in Love),” <i>The Art of Loving</i> finds Dean self-assured as she slinks freely through R&B and pop. “You can make whatever you want, there’s no rules and that’s such a freeing feeling,” she tells Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd.\n\nDean describes her songwriting on <i>The Art of Loving</i> as “real, fresh, and honest” and she makes it sound so easy. It’s no surprise that the overarching theme—love in its different forms—came naturally. “I had the title quite quickly,” she says. “I’ve also been fascinated by love. It’s the one thing that everybody is looking for in their life in some capacity, whether it be friendship, family, romantic, but it’s something that we’re not taught. There’s not a love module in school. It’s this magic thing we’re supposed to know how to do. So I wanted to take a closer look at it and what it means to me and the art of it, the craft of loving someone properly.”\n\nThe album opens with the instant hit “Nice to Each Other,” the obvious choice for Dean. “As soon as I wrote it, I knew it was going to be the first song. It’s got a Fleetwood Mac guitary feel and it’s cheeky, it’s flirty,” she says. There might be heartbreaks and wistful moments along the way, but Dean leaves listeners in no doubt she’s in a happy place. “How could I not be?” she says. “I’ve been thinking a lot about touring and what I want to sing live and I want it to be joyful.

The quickly rising country star tells Apple Music that she first came across the would-be title of her full-length debut album while driving through Tennessee, spotting the name “Cherry Valley” on a road sign and soon adopting the name for her own fantastical dreamland. It only made sense to choose <i>Cherry Valley</i> to title her debut outing, a delightful and often surprising collection from a young artist with a truly kaleidoscopic vision.\n\n“I write a lot of different styles of songs,” Faith says. “I have a lot of different music that I like to listen to, so I guess a lot of different influences, too, but I really could not just go down one narrow lane for the album in my brain, at least. And so I was like, ‘Well, I guess I’m the through line. My story is the through line.’”\n\n<i>Cherry Valley</i> opens with its cinematic title track, which isn’t so much a literal origin story as it is a spiritual one, with Faith imagining a “crystal sunrise on the lake” as strings swell behind her. “Sex, Drugs, & Country Music” ups the twang with traditional production including pedal steel and Western guitar, and vocals from Faith that recall Lee Ann Womack and Patsy Cline. Other highlights are the winking two-stepper “Bar Star” (the music video for that one stars none other than Billy Bob Thornton) and “Betty,” a clever, wordplay-heavy barn burner about a femme fatale, à la “Jolene.”\n\nBelow, Faith shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Cherry Valley”</b>\n“Cherry Valley is a place I drove through in Tennessee and it was sticky in my brain. I wrote the name down, and I always, when they say, ‘Go to your happy place,’ I kept picturing this place that I was making up in my brain and I just called it ‘Cherry Valley.’ So that’s what it is to me. It’s just like a dreamland.”\n\n<b>“Sex, Drugs, & Country Music”</b>\n“‘Sex, Drugs, & Country Music,’ we took 30 minutes to write. Because it was just like, ‘I should just put it out there, for better or for worse.’ I tell my dad that song’s a metaphor for sure, but it’s very true.”\n\n<b>“Bar Star”</b>\n“We shot [the music video] at Magnolia’s Motor Lounge in Texas, which is a little bar that I love and that [Billy Bob Thornton] loves. We have a mutual friend who plays music there… Somehow we both had the same day open. I brought my whole team down. My mom came—she wanted to meet him—and he brought all the <i>Landman</i> people. It was just fun. We just had a good time. And it was cool seeing him in action, too.”\n\n<b>“Betty”</b>\n“I had that idea, but I thought it might’ve been dumb. So I was like, ‘Honestly, I met a chihuahua at a truck stop named Betty, and she had her nails painted.’ I was like, ‘If that dog was a woman, she would steal my man for sure.’ I was writing little poems about it. I just couldn’t stop thinking about this damn chihuahua. And I went out to California with Tofer [Brown] and we were going to write with Shane [McAnally], and I was like, ‘Is this idea dumb, Tofer? Tell me. Betty, bet he. Is that too songwriter-y?’ And he was like, ‘No. Shane, of all people, will crush that.’ And I brought the idea, and then Shane wrote the song, basically.”\n\n<b>“Six String”</b>\n“We wrote that song and the lyrics were inspired by The Beatles, but the sonics were definitely inspired by ’50s country. I love the drama.”\n\n<b>“Burn My Memory”</b>\n“I changed a lot of the words so that the person knew it was about them. There were different little things in it that were still very specific, but more like in the room that sounded good. And then as I was doing the vocals for it, I was pissed off, and I was like, I’m changing this. He’s going to know it’s about him.”\n\n<b>“Sails”</b>\n“Lauren Hungate brought that idea in, because she had just had a little baby boy, and she said she was watching him sleep when that idea came.

In the moment, I’m always thinking of my feelings and myself.

When the members of Geese were still in elementary school, Beats was showing up on increasingly big hip-hop records by Smoke DZA, ScHoolboy Q, Freddie Gibbs, and Vince Staples. But as he doggedly pursued Geese through 2024 and convinced them to give his new Los Angeles digs a try, they offered a caveat: He should drop the Beats once and for all and just be Kenny Blume. The swap proved worth it. Together, Geese and Blume made one of this year’s truly great rock records, finding an often-hidden seam between old-school indie-rock idiosyncrasy and the mainstream’s explosive power. <i>Getting Killed</i> feels like a burst of new life.\n\nGeese signed a pandemic-era deal for their high-school debut, <i>Projector</i>, before raising the stakes with their indulgent, discursive, and beguiling <i>3D Country</i>. But their flock unexpectedly grew early in 2025, when <i>Heavy Metal</i>—the brilliant solo debut of singer and leader Cameron Winter, actually released late in 2024—became an unexpected and uncanny breakthrough. Fans of that album may recognize its tunefulness at the start of Geese’s “Cobra,” where lilting keyboards indeed conjure “Love Takes Miles.”\n\nAside from Winter’s singular voice and barbarically blunt lyrics, though, the similarities stop there: <i>Getting Killed</i>is a savage and beautiful thing, anchored by the athletic rhythm section of bassist Dom DiGesu and drummer Max Bassin and given a serrated edge by guitarist Emily Green. Where “Islands of Men” moves from a warped Rolling Stones strut into art-rock transcendence, “Bow Down” is nervous and mean start to finish, Winter howling about lost love over an instrumental that feels like heart palpitations. Hinging around howled lines about bombs in cars, opener “Trinidad” indeed lands like a piece of twisted scrap metal. Geese, though, can be tender and exquisite. “Half Real” is an anthem for holding love close as the world tries to chip away at it, while the climactic soul stunner “Au Pays du Cocaine” is a let’s-stay-together update for our era of shared discontent. \n\nGeese have recently flamed the eternal embers of rock-savior dialogues, their imaginative but relentless approach suggesting for many talk about the next Strokes or Radiohead. And, sure, that might happen. But more importantly, Geese have simply done what so many great rock bands in the past have done—they’ve learned the lessons of their forebears, ripped them apart, and reordered them in a way that sounds as thrilling to them as to us. “I’m getting killed by a pretty good life,” Winter warbles on the title track, echoing Neil Young a half-century on. Whether you’re in heaven or hell, it’s hard not to nod at least a little bit of assent to one of rock’s most electrifying new crews and gripping new voices.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Getting Killed","playParams":{"id":"1818548779","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/getting-killed/1818548779","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0eeXb23yMW6EaIgm63xxPC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818548779/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1378038472","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1378038472?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759439586910,"RTCI":0}}},"1818897477":{"id":"1818897477","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818897477?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Katie Spencer","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/katie-spencer/411143627","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a0a12","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f72b32","textColor2":"f4252b","textColor3":"c7242c","textColor4":"c52026","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/36/df/53/36df539d-d247-d341-250a-97353e2fc19a/8721215562566.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Folk"],"name":"What Love Is","playParams":{"id":"1818897477","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-love-is/1818897477","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4a1XHsg22bj7DwMpIfdFUv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818897477/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"411143627","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/411143627?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759453622133,"RTCI":0}}},"1820173264":{"id":"1820173264","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820173264?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mulatu Astatke","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mulatu-astatke/76533627","artwork":{"bgColor":"9b8d84","hasP3":false,"height":1440,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"111110","textColor3":"1f1c1a","textColor4":"2d2a27","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e6/22/a6/e622a6ca-37b5-79a1-a766-d26760d25ebe/4062548114744.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1440},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"020202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dfafbe","textColor2":"d496a3","textColor3":"b38c99","textColor4":"aa7883","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d5/da/1a/d5da1aa5-f1de-9e9e-afa0-32afdc80380c/1e4e09fe-e349-4b67-a284-5ece5b6dba24.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"An Ethio-jazz pioneer revisits his singular, funky, global fusion.","standard":"Mulatu Astatke’s hypnotic fusion of jazz, Latin, and traditional Ethiopian music is one of those sounds that feels both instantly comforting and terminally mysterious—spy themes for quiet bars at the edge of the world.

But on the California legends’ 12th studio album <i>Silver Bleeds the Black Sun…</i>, Davey Havok and company journey further into the shadowy sounds of 1980s rock than ever before. The anthemic “Blasphemy & Excess” is immediately reminiscent of Siouxie & The Banshees’ dark-clothing fantasias, while spring-loaded guitar lines bounce around “Ash Speck in a Green Eye” in a manner not unlike Joy Division’s singular sonic miserabilia. Splashy drums abound courtesy of longtime sticksman Adam Carson, whose machine-gun rhythms have mutated into pounding heartbeats—but the biggest change apparent is Havok’s voice, which has taken on a distinctly dramatic timbre after decades of howling into the void. AFI is still reinventing itself more than 30 years in, and longtime fans of this group would never expect anything less.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Silver Bleeds the Black Sun...","playParams":{"id":"1824013544","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/silver-bleeds-the-black-sun/1824013544","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5mkdGum4SA8FWcwNMlttf5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824013544/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3447440","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3447440?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759443660403,"RTCI":0}}},"1824673647":{"id":"1824673647","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824673647?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Steve ‘n’ Seagulls","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/steve-n-seagulls/981357713","artwork":{"bgColor":"c7d0d2","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1f1d1a","textColor2":"37302d","textColor3":"40403f","textColor4":"54504e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f1/96/ea/f196ea42-3b2f-3854-6143-3afe9c6aa456/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Bluegrass","Music","Country"],"name":"The Dark Side of the Moo","playParams":{"id":"1824673647","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dark-side-of-the-moo/1824673647","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1CeUyJWXUzz35qH8oImiyv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824673647/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"981357713","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/981357713?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759434745511,"RTCI":0}}},"1825447346":{"id":"1825447346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825447346?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Good Neighbours","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/good-neighbours/1726004707","artwork":{"bgColor":"db9589","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"090400","textColor2":"2c1d12","textColor3":"33211b","textColor4":"4f352a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/89/66/03/896603bc-2d76-ef10-7ba5-5a068ca8a5bb/25UMGIM90714.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1c2025","gradient":{"color":"1c2025","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2f2217","textColor3":"372720","textColor4":"523a2f","textGradient":["ffffff","2f2217"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/48/d9/38/48d93836-7fe1-852b-4b56-e36c687ee510/Joba8273fff-779e-4809-baed-eaa43806b4d3-203527283-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397972150_2344932227-Time1758274020308.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1c2025","gradient":{"color":"1c2025","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"7eb2d2","textColor3":"6fafcb","textColor4":"6692ac","textGradient":["ffffff","7eb2d2"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0c/a9/c5/0ca9c529-35d8-5568-988c-4f29dbf8d2e6/Job52e9b524-4200-482d-abfe-9eaa2563e8aa-203527282-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397972149_2344932226-Time1758273115583.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d8c9b7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1a1914","textColor2":"3f2d15","textColor3":"403c34","textColor4":"5d4c35","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e4/06/af/e406af27-4062-55bf-26cf-25743b2affbc/901b35c5-f043-4c94-a5f7-90f2e643b0d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The duo on their uplifting album: “It became positive and exciting.”","standard":"Soaring, feel-great songs are Good Neighbours’ calling card and their live gigs are full of community and camaraderie. They’d been a duo for less than a year when “Home” went viral on TikTok in early 2024, but Oli Fox and Scott Verrill kept up the momentum and set to work making their debut album, <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>. \n\n“In a perfect world, there would’ve been more time, because we’ve only really a band for about two years now,” Fox tells Apple Music. “It felt like the least we could do for all the new people that have started to follow us, in terms of putting all the songs in one lovely body of work and get it out there. We’re going to just crack on into album two now.”\n\nThe duo, who met when they were working in East London studios next door to each other, make the process sound as relaxing as their songs. “We tried to book a few days out and write stuff and that didn’t really work for us, so I think we did it in a scrappy way,” says Verrill. “A couple of hours here, a couple of hours there, sending voice notes. That worked for us instead of being locked away, trying to force something out.”\n\nBeneath the easygoing exterior that’s reflected in their bouncy sound lie some tough-to-tackle themes. “Ripple” sees them reaching out to a friend sinking into grief, and the uplifting anthem “Keep It Up” was written on a particularly bad day for Fox. “It’s making life’s grittier problems seem a little more manageable and a bit more accessible to talk about,” he says.\n\nRead on as Good Neighbours take you through <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Keep It Up”</b>\nOli Fox: “Scott was in the studio and I came in to moan about being fired from my fourth part-time job in a coffee shop. I was honestly useless—I couldn’t make a coffee to save my life, and I didn’t know anything about beans. I really wanted to do music, but couldn’t find any way to make it financially viable. Scott had those piano chords running that you hear in the beginning of the track, so I took them into the studio and started wailing down the mic. Immediately, it created this vibe where me and Scott were like, ‘Actually, this feels like something special.’ It was uplifting, but you knew there was a grit and a grain of truth in the lyric as well.”\n\n<b>“Skipping Stones”</b>\nScott Verrill: “We started this one together. It was a chance for us to lean into production, get a little more electronic and have some fun on the music side.”\nOF: “We grew up loving Passion Pit and MGMT, and the more you dig into those people, you realize they’re baring all with their lyrics as well. I guess that’s something you don’t really pick up on when you’re younger.”\nSV: “When we were making the project, we weren’t down, but we were a bit fed up and struggling to make ends meet, and then this became exciting and positive and a chance to make something that uplifted us a bit.”\n\n<b>“Ripple”</b>\nOF: “We started this before we knew that Good Neighbours was going to be a band. My friend had been really struggling to talk about his dad—who was like my second dad—passing. He was like, ‘I feel like every time I bring that up, it’s like I drag you down with me.’ For me, it was quite the opposite. I remember saying to him, ‘Oh well, whenever you come up for air, come and have a chat.’ That phrase started this image in my head of how grief can feel like you’re being submerged, and no one else can understand you because they’re all on the surface. I sent Scott the demo, and he flipped it on its head and, in true Good Neighbours fashion, made it into this optimistic-feeling track. I really love the juxtaposition of what the production does and what the message says.”\n\n<b>“found u/me”</b>\nSV: “Listening back to the album a few times, it felt like it was such high-energy and very indie and splashy, so we thought we’d try something that was a bit more heartfelt and organic. It was the last song we wrote for the album, and it popped out really quickly. We’re quite comfortable with a love song if it feels right, and this did.”\nOF: “Yeah, we’re quite shameless. It’s OK to be in love, guys.”\n\n<b>“Walk Walk Walk”</b>\nOF: “We were lucky enough to work with Justin Tranter, who’s written some ridiculously good songs [for Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Bieber]. Everything from the 2010s onwards. As songwriters growing up, it’s a dream to go and work with someone like that. Justin was awesome, and we wanted to create that college party sound of the noughties, where we’ve watched videos of Yeasayer, MGMT, and The Go! Team. Having a proper soaring synth melody has always been something we’ve aspired to do, but we needed to caveat that with a pretty solid pop song on the top. Justin brought those words out of us. It was like going back to school, working with someone like that, but we learned so much in one day. That song just goes off live.”\n\n<b>“Kids Can’t Sleep”</b>\nSV: “We wrote this in LA. It was a weird time, because we arrived on the day of the fires [in early 2025] and everything kicking off, so we flew into the chaos. It was born out of hiding away from the fires and feeling a bit weird about everything going on.”\nOF: “I’d been seeing loads online of people trying to come forward to talk about their mental health and older people were like, ‘Oh, this snowflake generation.’ I was filled with rage at that time, and then we arrived in LA and literally the world was on fire, so that’s what we’re talking about in the chorus. It’s a cry for a bit of normality again.”\n\n<b>“Home”</b>\nOF: “‘Home’ was written around the time of losing my mate’s dad. I went back to London a day early, and I saw my girlfriend at the time and hugged her outside the station, and my whole body relaxed for the first time in three days. I was like, ‘Oh, maybe home can also be within your mate or your best friend.’ That was an epiphany for me. The next day, me and Scott happened to be in the studio and it completely fell out word for word, so there was obviously something that needed to be said.”\nSV: “We never imagined one of our songs would go viral, so it caught us off guard. It was wild—the only reason we stuck it up online is because one of our friends persuaded us to use TikTok. So there was no big plan, it was an accident.”\n\n<b>“Small Town”</b>\nSV: “This is more of a scenic one for us, painting a picture instead of a specific story. I think it feels like the opening scene of a coming-of-age movie.”\nOF: “There was one person I never got over, and it was quite a young breakup when I first moved to London. It was about knowing that you were maybe the problem in the relationship, but realizing it four years too late. I think when you go through your first proper heartbreak, London suddenly becomes the tiniest village ever and everyone knows about it. So it was all about drawing a parallel between the small town that I’m actually from and how London can shrink when something goes awry.”\n\n<b>“Starry Eyed”</b>\nOF: “We wrote this on tour with Foster the People when we were 70 percent into finishing our album and we felt like we had a lot of bangers and high-octane songs. Then we were working with Joe Janiak [writer and producer for Lewis Capaldi, Ellie Goulding, and Sigrid], who’s more of a friend than a collaborator. I’d hung out with him before in LA, and he had this weird banjo that had been restrung with nylon strings, and it’s the instrument that plays throughout the track. Scott played the first three chords and we wrote the whole melody. I was like, ‘Actually, for once, rather than just layering it up, let’s keep this as stripped as we can and just tell a fun love story.’ People have really resonated with ‘Starry Eyed’ because it’s so different to the rest of our stuff.”\n\n<b>“People Need People”</b>\nOF: “‘People Need People’ has always gone down quite well live, so it felt right for the album. It sets up <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>. We had the demo and we didn’t do anything with it, but when we decided we were going to make an album we revisited it.”\nSV: “I remember when we did the chorus, we were like, ‘Oh, this feels like a <i>FIFA</i> [the video game series] song.’ And then we found out the other day it was on <i>FIFA</i> [<i>FC26</i>] and we were like, ‘Great!’ It’s the second track we’ve had on there [after ‘Daisies’] and they asked us back, which we’ve been told is a rare thing.”\n\n<b>“Left Hand Man”</b>\nSV: “We started this on a writing trip in Cornwall. It was a noodle that turned into this fun song, and for us it’s almost an interlude. It’s a chance to breathe on the album, rather than have a load of loud noises being shoved in your face.”\nOF: “Obviously, making a big song is the funnest thing to do, but when you put them all on an album together you’re like, ‘Oh no, this is quite sensory overload for people.’ So it was fun to write some smaller moments to bring the listener back down to earth.”\n\n<b>“Suburbs”</b>\nSV: “We’re both from the suburbs [Fox is from Essex and Verrill just outside Croydon, South London], and I think it’s a weird feeling, being on the outskirts, with all these music and art scenes in London that you’re not really a part of. You grow up just wanting to be a part of it, and even now we’re in the circles, it makes you more grateful for where you came from.”\nOF: “I lived in quite a rural area and it was hard growing up wanting to chase your dreams. Most people from my area have very honest jobs, so you don’t come across many people that are like, ‘I want to go sing and dance on a stage.’ It’s nice to come back and feel like I proved a younger version of myself wrong.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful Life”</b>\nOF: “We were working on this the week that ‘Home’ went viral. The whole album touches on the idea that life’s going to be a rocky ride, but boil it all down and we’re so lucky to be here. At the time, I’d seen this thing from Brian Cox [the physicist] talking about how we’re on a planet, and we’re all technically made up of stardust. He was like, ‘That in itself is so ridiculous. What more could you possibly want?’ So on the days where you miss your bus or get fired from your job, it’s crap in the moment, but when you zoom out, it means absolutely nothing in terms of how lucky you are to just be here in the first place. That was a cry to myself, and also to all of our friends that were going through the mill at the time, because they’re awesome people.”\n\n<b>“The Buzz”</b>\nOF: “I think we impressed ourselves making ‘The Buzz’ because we’ve only ever made really big shiny things and that one felt like, ‘Oh, we are actually half-decent songwriters that can just write good songs.’ So it was nice to not shower something in production.”\nSV: “When it came to the last track on the album, it was between ‘found u/me’ and ‘The Buzz.’ On our favorite bands’ albums there’s always been the ballad, and we felt like we’d not nailed that before, so we wanted to tackle it. We both have a soft spot for the song.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Blue Sky Mentality","playParams":{"id":"1825447346","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-sky-mentality/1825447346","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0FOIHe5RLulAgBq3HMV4wd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825447346/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1726004707","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1726004707?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759505357808,"RTCI":0}}},"1825829280":{"id":"1825829280","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825829280?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HNNY","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hnny/529822749","artwork":{"bgColor":"84492f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"eaf9fa","textColor2":"f9e6e4","textColor3":"d5d6d2","textColor4":"e2c7bf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/79/69/b4/7969b4a9-90ab-e904-030f-e49af2c5828b/199538199802.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c9c7bc","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0e0f","textColor2":"1f2020","textColor3":"343332","textColor4":"41413f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/da/02/e1/da02e19e-49fa-b9c1-0b9c-eff6335f696a/4c6680e6-e6d7-46c7-8478-40cbefd96e45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Close - EP","playParams":{"id":"1825829280","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-02","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/close-ep/1825829280"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825829280/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"529822749","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/529822749?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759416484665,"RTCI":0}}},"1826813744":{"id":"1826813744","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826813744?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ash","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ash/721451","artwork":{"bgColor":"14151b","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f8e6cd","textColor2":"dcdacd","textColor3":"cabca9","textColor4":"b4b2aa","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8b/e0/bb/8be0bb78-11bd-92b9-e086-b17a10be89df/199538248548.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A collection of winsome and toothy tracks from the Northern Irish rockers.","standard":"Everything Ash does is <i>big</i>: big hooks, big guitars, and choruses so huge that they’re practically their own planetary systems.

Blur guitarist Graham Coxon joins the trio for the punchy “Fun People” and the title track’s six-string theatrics, while the spacey rock of “Deadly Love” rubs elbows with a sprightly and surprising cover of the calypso standard “Jump in the Line”—the latter serving as a reminder of Ash’s try-anything-once versatility, which remains endearing as ever.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Ad Astra","playParams":{"id":"1826813744","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ad-astra/1826813744","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7hTO36Q2JbuQLjSOcXqrIL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826813744/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"721451","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/721451?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759429512739,"RTCI":0}}},"1827094834":{"id":"1827094834","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827094834?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"vegas water taxi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vegas-water-taxi/1717868617","artwork":{"bgColor":"bec9d6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0e0d0e","textColor2":"150f10","textColor3":"313336","textColor4":"373438","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/41/ee/51/41ee519e-ada7-c035-77d0-8dafe010cf69/56305.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"long time caller - EP","playParams":{"id":"1827094834","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/long-time-caller-ep/1827094834"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827094834/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1717868617","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1717868617?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759491131031,"RTCI":0}}},"1827315213":{"id":"1827315213","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827315213?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mariah Carey","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mariah-carey/91853","artwork":{"bgColor":"e9e9e9","hasP3":false,"height":3200,"textColor1":"171717","textColor2":"2a2a2a","textColor3":"414141","textColor4":"505050","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/00/53/54/00535476-ca81-846b-cf51-f1d98d5f28a2/764656422486_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3200},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"e6e6e6","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0a0a0a","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor3":"363636","textColor4":"464646","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cc/b7/4b/ccb74bfd-30e3-b2b7-6b18-c5c36b0bd09f/Job5ea20e02-5bb9-4d16-bc76-67911e73f468-203566114-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398046652_2345524619-Time1758305721103.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"faf8f8","gradient":{"color":"faf8f8","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"262626","textColor3":"393939","textColor4":"515151","textGradient":["000000","262626"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/13/7f/0f/137f0fcf-8256-f860-b576-f07122cfa842/Job96912374-1351-4826-a978-78ca2c3a9ddb-203566113-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_398046653_2345524620-Time1758303988401.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"030303","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor3":"be9b7b","textColor4":"b38f6c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/00/20/a4/0020a441-59e5-deed-20f9-dfb61d898f98/97a79a7a-6da6-4c02-80b9-a604f919d5e2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"0f0316","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e2975d","textColor2":"d59879","textColor3":"b8794f","textColor4":"ad7a65","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/52/f0/2352f071-5643-bcdf-0cb7-2150820da25d/5430c146-9a2c-48b5-a734-162ca6a2f408.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Mariah Carey is “a little bit more vulnerable” on her 16th studio album.","standard":"In 2020, Mariah Carey gave her all to one of the most vulnerable works of her career—but for the first time, it wasn’t an album. Her memoir <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> laid bare her feelings about her complicated family life, the myriad successes of her record-breaking career, the joys of motherhood, and more. Though Carey’s an award-winning songwriter and has been known for her prowess with the pen since her 1990 debut, she tells Apple Music that the process of writing <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> unlocked something new for her when it came to plumbing particularly difficult emotional depths for her lyrics. “It definitely did something to me where I was just a little bit more vulnerable, a little bit more exposed, a little bit more able to be myself, regardless,” she says. \n\n<i>Here For It All</i>, her 16th studio album, is her first project to fully capitalize on this soul-searching, and look no further than the ballads for proof. “Nothing Is Impossible” is an ode to her own resilience (“I dream a greater dream/I fight a greater fight/I overcome it all”), and the grand and sentimental title track is the sort of unabashedly romantic that hits the ear like a love note read aloud (“When you leave/You take a little bit of every fiber that’s embedded in me”). These showstoppers are classically Carey, but so is the album’s robust mix of R&B, hip-hop, disco, gospel, and pop. “I was a little bit worried in the beginning that there were too many different types of records,” she says. “And I was just like, ‘I don’t care.’” \n\nWhether she’s vaulting her whistle tones to the heavens (alongside gospel legends The Clark Sisters on “Jesus I Do”), invoking ’90s street swagger with “Type Dangerous” (which samples Eric B. & Rakim’s “Eric B. Is President”), time-traveling with ’70s slow jams (courtesy of the Anderson .Paak collaboration “Play This Song”), or covering a childhood favorite (her take on Paul McCartney’s Wings classic “My Love”), Carey is unapologetically herself and relishing in every note. Read on for her thoughts on each track of <i>Here For It All</i>.\n\n<b>“Mi”</b>\n“It’s an ode to self-love and self-care. It was just one of those things where it’s tongue-in-cheek, but it’s still one of those ones that a lot of people were like, ‘Oh, I love this.’ I just visualize me in a hot tub every time.”\n\n<b>“Play This Song” (feat. Anderson .Paak)</b>\n“I definitely wanted to work with Anderson because he’s so brilliant and amazing at what he does, which is just being a kick-ass musician. But when we got into the studio, we decided we wanted to do something that was kind of ’70s, and we did give you that kind of vibe. So we started working on ‘Play This Song,’ and it was just one of those ones that I really loved. Working with him in the studio, he’s a great companion in terms of making music.”\n\n<b>“Type Dangerous”</b>\n“I was in a restaurant in Aspen, and I was with Andy [Anderson .Paak] and a couple of friends. All of a sudden they started playing music and playing different songs. Suddenly ‘Eric B. Is President’ comes on, and I was like, ‘What? I love this song. I haven’t heard this song in forever.’ We went to the studio the next day and started playing around with sampling it, and it’s just on and on from there... I made them play it over and over.”\n\n<b>“Sugar Sweet” (feat. Shenseea and Kehlani)</b>\n“I just think [Shenseea and Kehlani]’s freedom really shows, and they’re just present; they’re who they are. This makes the record so much younger and more fun, and I just thought it was everything. I’ve never had a trio before with three strong women, and having the ability to do this now, it’s amazing. I love what it speaks on. I love what it speaks to.”\n\n<b>“In Your Feelings”</b>\n“It’s one of those ones where you tell a story about something you’ve been through and put it together and you release it. And that’s what we did. People really like the ‘I think you might be getting a little bit too...’—that part. I like it a lot. I wasn’t really trying to say anything. I was just feeling the moment. I didn’t even appreciate it much until we did it and I lived with it for a while.”\n\n<b>“Nothing Is Impossible”</b>\n“I was just writing a couple of things, playing around with little ideas and working with my very close friend and musical director Daniel Moore. He was playing on the piano. I was singing along. We were following each other in terms of melody, and then I just took it home and wrote the lyrics. I think it’s one of those ones where I had to be by myself and really just off in my own world writing about these sort of feelings. I think it’s something, if anything, it would help somebody get through something.”\n\n<b>“Confetti & Champagne”</b>\n“I guess it’s about somebody that you’re not with anymore, but you’re speaking to them, and that’s it. You don’t really care. That’s the basic ‘Clink, clink, clink, pow/Look at me now.’ That’s basically it.”\n\n<b>“I Won’t Allow It”</b>\n“We took a long time writing it—not a long time with the actual words or the music, but it was just over time we produced more and did more. It’s another one with [.Paak], and he’s just so great at that type of vibe. There are some kiss-off moments in that. ‘I won’t entertain all your narcissistic ways’ is one of my favorite moments. ‘Should have been more proactive’—these parts just make me laugh.”\n\n<b>“My Love”</b>\n“It’s more an homage to my childhood, because I remember being a little girl and riding on the back of a motorcycle with my mother’s friend’s daughter and her boyfriend. This was their song, and they were in love. I’m still hoping that Paul McCartney might play something on it, which would be amazing. He is one of the greatest of all time, ever, and I just asked before I recorded the song, would he mind if I recorded it? I had a conversation with him, and he was like, ‘No, give it a shot, send it to me.’ And I’m like, ‘How do I do this? Because I really want him to be on this song doing background vocals, something.’ I don’t think that’s where he’s at right now, but he might lay something for the deluxe version. I would be thrilled out of my mind. But yeah, if you talk about the emotion when I’m singing it, it’s definitely about finding someone that you really revere and care for.”\n\n<b>“Jesus I Do” (feat. The Clark Sisters)</b>\n“I am a humongous Clark Sisters fan. I love their work. Karen Clark’s solo album is just scrumptious and unparalleled. I really was like, ‘I can’t believe I’m in here doing this.’ We wrote it together and sang it together. All the backgrounds that we did, I mean, I’m so inspired by their background vocals that when I get to mix that with mine, it’s something to be healed.”\n\n<b>“Here For It All”</b>\n“It’s just special to me; that’s why I put it at the end and named the album after it, because it’s personal to me. It’s not even something I want to even go into every beat of. I love the way it ends and then it doesn’t end. I thought this was going to be my gospel song on this album, because that’s the vibe it’s giving, but we have ‘Jesus I Do,’ so it’s different. I just feel like this is such a ‘Mariah Carey record’ in a way that other songs I’ve done however long ago weren’t, because it’s got a soulfulness to it, just the way that it’s arranged. I just feel like it’s something very personal, but also very like it’s giving this to other people that need to hear something like that.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Here For It All","playParams":{"id":"1827315213","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/here-for-it-all/1827315213","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6MljmKZLh52AUR1v5WpWst"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827315213/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"91853","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/91853?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759441260892,"RTCI":0}}},"1827325630":{"id":"1827325630","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827325630?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-red-jumpsuit-apparatus/130037074","artwork":{"bgColor":"3d3f3f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f9f9fa","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor3":"d4d4d5","textColor4":"b2b3b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d7/34/ae/d734aed8-b59c-f28b-bac7-7e36c338a6b2/810202530300.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"X’s for Eyes","playParams":{"id":"1827325630","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/xs-for-eyes/1827325630","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2W4xgzMCme2M6yGeLFTCTi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827325630/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"130037074","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/130037074?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759454210426,"RTCI":0}}},"1828503875":{"id":"1828503875","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828503875?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HARDY","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hardy/1438874739","artwork":{"bgColor":"962b11","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f8f7e9","textColor2":"e8f6e5","textColor3":"e5cebe","textColor4":"d8cdbb","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e6/24/f0/e624f091-812b-8430-4c24-3bdb3b39cd2f/25UMGIM99507.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"662519","gradient":{"color":"662519","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e9f7e7","textColor3":"e7cdbf","textColor4":"d9d0be","textGradient":["ffffff","e9f7e7"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/df/0c/33/df0c3301-1548-ff91-84ba-038b64965e66/Job257c080b-672d-4a32-8bab-5377cb27fd0e-200101979-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391659420_2292207573-Time1755122631806.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"662519","gradient":{"color":"662519","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d8e6da","textColor3":"dacdc4","textColor4":"ccc2b4","textGradient":["ffffff","d8e6da"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a7/68/0b/a7680b62-8477-900a-49f8-39e45328f4d6/Jobbaacb75b-6b74-417f-b8f8-c9292a47fee5-200101978-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391659419_2292207572-Time1755121025063.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"89321b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e3e8e1","textColor2":"fad1c5","textColor3":"d1c4b9","textColor4":"e3b2a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bf/a5/c8/bfa5c8d3-be31-93b4-c1f8-330467bfd2e1/0a277f5e-5cb5-4f7f-a430-1cb122952995.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"151b1d","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c8f4b6","textColor2":"bbd39d","textColor3":"a4c897","textColor4":"9aae83","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e2/8d/c4/e28dc4b0-3c5b-5396-1bf2-70d11b911a55/b94ebffd-3a7b-4e75-bc85-cc4e9cb59ccd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Nashville star makes his genre preference clear: “This is what it is.”","standard":"The Mississippi-born singer-songwriter dabbled in the sounds of heavy Southern rock on previous records like 2023’s <i>the mockingbird & THE CROW</i> and 2024’s <i>Quit!!</i>. But if you couldn’t tell from the title (or the fact that the word “country” appears seven times on the tracklist), the fourth album from HARDY is a country record—and don’t you forget it. As the hitmaker explained to Apple Music’s Ty Bentli, the title stems from comments he received over the years for his genre-bucking blend of country and rock. “In case you didn’t know what this is, this is what it is,” he says. “There’s a little bit of smartass in that, but it’s just part of who I am.”\n\nHARDY embraces his redneck roots on songs like “Bottomland,” an ode to his family’s deep history as outdoorsmen, and “Buck on the Wall,” inspired by a visit to his grandfather’s hunting cabin. (The latter first appeared on his May 2025 EP, titled—you guessed it—<i>COUNTRY!</i>.) On ERNEST duet “Bro Country,” the duo shrewdly comments on the genre’s evolution since HARDY cut his teeth in Nashville in the early 2010s. And on the title track, he rejects urban sprawl in favor of small-town simplicity: “If it was up to me, I’d make the whole damn country country.”\n\nJust past the exhortation of good old country livin’, a heavier theme lingers in the margins. “I know that if anybody listens to [the album] top-down, they’re going to think, ‘God, there’s a lot of songs about death,’” HARDY says. The fixation on mortality makes sense: While writing the album, he not only celebrated the birth of his first child but also lost his grandfather. Still, HARDY uses the potentially grim preoccupation as inspiration to live life to the fullest: “Let’s go to Paris, drink a beer on the roof/Hook up on some Ferris wheel and get matchin’ tattoos,” he sings on “Goodbye.” “It’s never a bad thing to remember that when you’re with the people that you love, one day you won’t be,” he explains. “You can channel that into a morbid thought, or you can channel that into a very positive mindset.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"COUNTRY!

intimate, wrenching debut that chronicles the journey out of addiction.","standard":"Cameron Whitcomb took a roundabout path to country music. The 22-year-old rising star left home at the age of 17 to work on the Trans Mountain pipeline, a job he pursued until the songs he began posting online found an audience and landed him on Season 20 of <i>American Idol</i>. An addict since adolescence, Whitcomb also found sobriety during this period, and these formative experiences serve as a thematic foundation for the 15 tracks on his full-length debut. Produced by Jack Riley, <i>The Hard Way</i> is rootsy country music in the vein of Zach Bryan or Sam Barber, though Whitcomb’s own sound expands to include shades of melodic pop, alt-rock, and even a touch of punk. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a wrenching account of facing and overcoming the demons that accompany addiction and depression. That tune also takes sonic cues from the stomp-clap folk of the 2010s, an influence also heard on tracks like “Options” and “Hundred Mile High.” Other highlights include “Quitter,” a clear-eyed chronicle of chasing sobriety that acknowledges the interpersonal challenges of addiction, and “As I Stand Before the Coffin,” on which Whitcomb grapples with loss and grief with compassion and self-awareness. Whitcomb ups the personal ante of this collection with periodic spoken interludes, lending the album a lived-in intimacy that underscores its immense vulnerability.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"name":"The Hard Way","playParams":{"id":"1829591942","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hard-way/1829591942","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/01rtI8jY5h2ZdPHMXnWJtb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829591942/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1542957700","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1542957700?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759434548724,"RTCI":0}}},"1829932893":{"id":"1829932893","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829932893?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sparks","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sparks/218206","artwork":{"bgColor":"b4c3e5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0e0e10","textColor2":"131517","textColor3":"2f323b","textColor4":"333740","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/35/56/02/35560205-00df-c06a-d989-a752361aa603/8721215952978.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"MADDER! - EP","playParams":{"id":"1829932893","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/madder-ep/1829932893"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829932893/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"218206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/218206?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759453911856,"RTCI":0}}},"1831044542":{"id":"1831044542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831044542?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bryson Tiller","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryson-tiller/642591128","artwork":{"bgColor":"091215","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4dccc","textColor2":"c2dbdc","textColor3":"b8b4a7","textColor4":"9db2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/f3/91/32f39154-b2ea-d39b-20fc-b039eb739760/196873461342.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cad2cb","textColor2":"cca882","textColor3":"a5aba6","textColor4":"a6896c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/ac/7d/8bac7d7c-3d43-daee-fa0f-fa55b4a008b5/3a414f76-61bf-462a-83cc-40daf17d384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e8af7b","textColor2":"de9c65","textColor3":"bd8f66","textColor4":"b58054","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/dd/43/6bdd43c0-dd3b-fbbc-3800-033fe2e5b594/062eafcc-cae2-41ff-89bd-db99ecfb5192.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Louisville crooner revels in his dualities on his double-album effort.","standard":"With Bryson Tiller’s 2024 self-titled album, the Louisville crooner crafted a genre-bending departure from his comfort zone, experimenting with the soundscapes of dancehall, drill, and pop next to his signature mixture of hip-hop and R&B. Tiller fully embraced himself and where he was at within his artistry, so much so that he decided to take a hiatus from music after its release to pursue his passion for video game design. But now he’s back with <i>Solace & The Vices</i>, a double album that lets go of the pressures of the industry and starts a new chapter of his ever-evolving sound.\n\nOn the first half of <i>Solace & The Vices</i>, Tiller looks inward as he gets somberly vulnerable about his struggles with romance, handling fame, and more. On the album opener “Strife,” he croons about wanting his lover to give him another chance, while on “Workaholic,” he exposes his own shortcomings as a partner due to obsessing over his career: “I was scared of going broke in 2018/That was after all the money and the fame/Going back to how it was, the shit’ll be a shame.”\n\n“I treated <i>Solace</i> like a therapy session,” Tiller tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I really want people to listen to it that way, almost as if I’m sitting on a couch and you’re just listening to what I’m saying.” And he does just that, taking listeners on a voyage through his psyche as he pulls himself apart to reflect on the highs and lows of his relationships, whether he’s dealing with losing a lover to someone else (“Damn”), making the hard decision to end a connection (“Uncertainty”), or finding new love again (“I Need Her,” “Star Signs”).\n\nThe second half of <i>Solace & The Vices</i> finds Tiller showcasing the other side of his artistry. As he does across the majority of his discography, the singer-songwriter toes the line between singing and rapping; however, on <i>The Vices</i> he leans less into the moody trap-soul tracks that defined his career and launched him into superstardom. Instead, he dives deeper into the rap-heavy side of his musicality, delivering sharp flows and gritty, energetic bars over dynamic production from Charlie Heat, Gravez, Teddy Walton, and Hitmaka.\n\nTiller is unapologetic as he revels in his impulsive nature, waxing poetic as he brags about his lifestyle (“First Place,” “200 Bands,” “Make Life Easy”) while navigating the ups and downs of his situationships (“No Sharing,” “More Than Money,” “Last Call”), and even contemplates letting go of his player ways (“Burnout”). Tiller isn’t alone as he ventures through partying and romance. He gets some help from Bossman Dlow, Rick Ross, Plies, T-Pain, BabyDrill, Luh Tyler, and Bun B, who are along for the ride.\n\nOn the closing track “Finished,” Tiller addresses his naysayers and critics who doubt his ability to surpass his 2015 debut album <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. His resilience in the face of criticism is evident as he confidently asserts: “I’ll be done with this shit when I’m done/I ain’t lookin’ for the number one /Just money and the shit keep comin’/Kept goin’, can’t risk bein’ nothin’/Ain’t fallin’ off, bitch, you funny.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Soul","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"Solace & The

pianist pushes further into shimmering, avant-garde sound design.","standard":"The opening moments of Kelly Moran’s 2025 LP, <i>Don’t Trust Mirrors</i>, showcase something she mostly avoided on her 2024 effort, <i>Moves in the Field</i>. It’s the sound of cathartic release through synthesizers, an emotional surge that was seemingly lying in wait from the moment she decided to rediscover her affinity for techno music on Don’t Trust Mirrors. Fittingly, the sparkling track, which sounds like a night sky lit up by the surge of fireflies, is titled “Echo in the Field,” a refraction of sorts to the album it follows. That concept, too, looms large on <i>Don’t Trust Mirrors</i>, which finds Moran forging through the world with new eyes and ears, rediscovering music as she remembers it, not as something presented to her via reflection. Whereas <i>Moves in the Field</i> consisted entirely of piano-based compositions, <i>Don’t Trust Mirrors</i> is something else entirely. “Sans Sodalis” is an experiment in noise and texture, while “Chrysalis” is a thrilling study of the piano’s percussive qualities. The album concludes with the shimmering, buzzing “Cathedral,” a glowing concoction of melodies that will float along until Moran is ready to return again.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Don't Trust Mirrors","playParams":{"id":"1832992315","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-01","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-trust-mirrors/1832992315","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/28npNYRc0n2EYmv56rnzSY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832992315/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1448255815","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1448255815?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759448715262,"RTCI":0}}},"1833437635":{"id":"1833437635","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833437635?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Coheed and Cambria","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coheed-and-cambria/15031628","artwork":{"bgColor":"f98188","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"240b12","textColor2":"3a0d10","textColor3":"4e2229","textColor4":"602428","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7d/8f/2f/7d8f2f21-d14a-f911-11a4-9a88ff959db1/198704625596_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Father of Make Believe (New Entities Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1833437635","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-father-of-make-believe-new-entities-edition/1833437635","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vHWOemZcXHOgBud2vsOEc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833437635/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15031628","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15031628?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759434515540,"RTCI":0}}},"1833885341":{"id":"1833885341","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833885341?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Perrie","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/perrie/1729865272","artwork":{"bgColor":"d0a4a0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"18130d","textColor2":"211a14","textColor3":"3d302b","textColor4":"443630","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/eb/e8/9a/ebe89af7-084b-6248-3eec-4151495c3233/196873526409.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"27271e","gradient":{"color":"27271e","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"231913","textColor3":"3b302b","textColor4":"45342f","textGradient":["ffffff","231913"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/db/37/e5/db37e574-b810-3295-d00c-90c286832aee/Job28471577-b286-4fa9-abb4-eebc944d98d5-203208814-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397343556_2339834568-Time1757953423877.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"27271e","gradient":{"color":"27271e","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f2c7ae","textColor3":"cbbfb4","textColor4":"cbb0a0","textGradient":["ffffff","f2c7ae"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/8a/c7/aa/8ac7aa70-ed5c-2956-f477-179d3b057f52/Job9a5ec3bf-bbb4-4a5e-9e47-70a618e40e61-203208633-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_397343557_2339834569-Time1757951396314.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"d6b19f","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"201812","textColor2":"28211b","textColor3":"45372e","textColor4":"4a3e36","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/00/62/300062ef-9258-7df1-0224-d503d78d2c1e/402b6a92-f726-4c35-9536-d2312eb2a63b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"dfd9d9","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"312016","textColor2":"571d18","textColor3":"54453d","textColor4":"72423e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/50/9b/9b/509b9b7d-8f39-bf19-2cd1-8b985c7b0cd5/f2a8cf5e-8650-41aa-81f0-43532c5a012a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Little Mix star packs her solo debut with big hooks and heartfelt emotions.","standard":"Propulsive rhythms, cheerful guitar riffs, belting vocals—the recipe for cooking up a self-titled debut solo album from Little Mix alum Perrie Edwards makes use of all these ingredients. With Edwards working alongside a healthy helping of cream from the hit songwriter crop—Maegan Cottone (Little Mix, Kylie Minogue), Plested (Lewis Capaldi, Jonas Brothers), and Ed Drewett (One Direction) are among the names credited—<i>Perrie</i> plays out like a master class in folk-influenced pop.\n\nOpening with the one-two punch of sentimental Ed Sheeran co-write “Forget About Us” and the wry, he’s-just-not-that-into-you wisdom of “If He Wanted to He Would,” Edwards strikes a plain-talking, open-hearted chord that resonates throughout the entire album. “Rocket Scientist” builds up a scene of romantic disconnection into a charged anthemic chorus; “Punchline” soundtracks a sardonic look on the bright side of life’s trials and tribulations with polished funk production; the midtempo “Absofuckinglutely” narrates a marriage proposal that receives an unambiguously emphatic response. The album’s most intriguing moments however, veer away from stomp-clap optimism and waggish lyrics to maximize Edwards’ undeniable vocal talents. While the light and breezy cuts on <i>Perrie</i> go down easy, the standouts are “Goodbye My Friend” and “Miss You”—a sensational R&B ballad penned with Tre Jean-Marie and MNEK—both of which call to mind early-career Mariah Carey.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Perrie","playParams":{"id":"1833885341","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/perrie/1833885341","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YAqhSOtLKtiWqHEqy8iHp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833885341/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1729865272","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1729865272?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759491499073,"RTCI":0}}},"1834042903":{"id":"1834042903","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834042903?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Doja Cat","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/doja-cat/830588310","artwork":{"bgColor":"205fa9","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fbddc7","textColor2":"fddd64","textColor3":"cfc4c1","textColor4":"d1c471","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a8/c7/ea/a8c7eaf1-d92b-2ce6-74e4-1282b369cd38/196873471068.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"18364c","gradient":{"color":"18364c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fdcb3e","textColor3":"d1c471","textColor4":"d1b553","textGradient":["ffffff","fdcb3e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d6/e5/9e/d6e59eb2-faa8-befa-f3b0-e11d33b17e6e/Jobbd14d704-8480-4e42-8cee-915cd4173405-204695739-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399984904_2361991478-Time1759256018824.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"18364c","gradient":{"color":"18364c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f3c749","textColor3":"bdb2ae","textColor4":"c7ae56","textGradient":["ffffff","f3c749"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d1/fd/8a/d1fd8a83-c6c4-a694-4930-15b1dc126e4d/Job37050cb5-251b-4fea-bd9a-2b39f9dd27ab-204695738-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399984905_2361991477-Time1759254686797.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b1adb4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"160b05","textColor2":"1e140f","textColor3":"352b28","textColor4":"3b3330","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a2/8a/67/a28a6774-f49c-61e0-ac88-027065602a18/3bfbfcc9-d930-4abe-8c09-24fee02fe628.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Her fifth album revels in artful ’80s decadence: “I think creativity is love.”","standard":"“I believe the weirdest ones survive,” Doja Cat sings on “Stranger”—a line that just as easily applies to her unpredictable trajectory as it does a shimmering power ballad for misfits in love.

But when she began to conceptualize her fifth album last year, the pendulum swung the other way. “I think I love talking about love,” Doja tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And I also think music is just such a door for expressing love in its different forms.”\n\nOn <i>Vie</i> (the French word for life, or the phonetic interpretation of the Roman numeral five), Doja pulls up via DeLorean with a whole new sound and style. Artfully grounded in the decadence of the ’80s, she spiffs up songs about love-bombing and limerence with skittering drum machines, punchy basslines, and the occasional sax solo. She channels Queen on “AAAHH MEN!,” an ode to the maddening, demoralizing, irresistible pleasures of men, and brings new jack swing into the 2020s on lead single “Jealous Type.” Naturally, what she called “that ’80s tacky romance sort of spin” demanded Doja’s first meet-up with pop’s premiere nostalgist, Jack Antonoff. “And so it’s the grappling with talking about something personal and creating something fresh, and then getting to know someone new,” she tells Lowe of their collaboration. “All of these things fell together really naturally.”\n\nMore playful than its predecessor, <i>Vie</i> relishes in its campy mood board and dishy subject matter: On “Silly! Fun!,” a punch-drunk R&B throwback about romantic delusion, the honeymoon’s over nearly as soon as it starts (“I know it could be a blast to just pop out a baby/We’re so very silly, getting married in Vegas”). But just because it’s flamboyant doesn’t mean it can’t be deep. “This album really grew from my sessions in therapy, and being so gung-ho on being there twice a week,” she says. “And learning about the human experience and how our brains function subconsciously and consciously.” Meanwhile, she mastered her singing skills—note the chops towards the end of “Jealous Type.” “I feel like I can do a lot more things that I could never do,” she says. “It’s just a more evolved, more mature version of whatever I’ve been doing since the beginning.”\n\nHigh-gloss romance aside, love manifests in other ways. “I think that creativity is love,” Doja tells Lowe. “You risk a lot for love. And so when a musician loves what they do, sometimes that entails things that are kind of uncomfortable and scary. But it doesn’t matter, because you love that thing so much.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Vie","playParams":{"id":"1834042903","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vie/1834042903","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1cqqIH16XzBnDchrXJ9Enf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834042903/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"830588310","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/830588310?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759501088869,"RTCI":0}}},"1834365907":{"id":"1834365907","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834365907?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mother Tongue","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mother-tongue/912736","artwork":{"bgColor":"f3bbd6","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"0d0c0b","textColor2":"191816","textColor3":"3b2f33","textColor4":"45383c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b3/54/06/b35406db-c4ed-8067-9a3b-c2541ee5f1b8/8717306926423.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"name":"Mother Tongue (feat.

I guess I should say thank you to my auntie, for constantly playing it when I was a child. It’s at every party, every event, they play it everywhere. It’s ingrained in me.” \n\nWith just over a decade of stardom under his belt, Lagos’ Adekunle Gold has lived many lives—and written even more hits. Since breaking out in 2014 with “Sade,” Gold has proven adept at pulling distinct strands from eras past to incorporate into his interpretation of Afrobeats. Early releases like “Orente” and “My Life”—propped up by their callbacks to genres such as jùjú and highlife—established Gold as a singer with a griot’s soul and sentimentalities. He’d broaden his reach with 2020’s <i>Afro Pop, Vol. 1</i>—which includes experiments in EDM and soca—but it is <i>Fuji</i> the singer points to, as a crystallization of his practice.\n\n“My album [title] started as an acronym,” says Gold. “Finding Uncharted Journeys Inside. But I’m already making fújì sounds; Since my first album <i>Gold</i>, I have a fújì-sounding song on every album. Even if I sing R&B, I sound fújì. So I might as well show the world this sound that I grew up on.” \n\nDeftly merging tradition and heritage, <i>Fuji</i> is built around a rich percussive base as the singer works his way through apala, fújì, and tungba influences. “Big Fish” plays as an out-of-body recounting of his come-up story and “Many People” embraces success, while “My Love Is the Same” and “Believe” emphasize familial and romantic love. In each instance, we get a tip of the hat to the storytelling techniques that make up the Yoruba oral music tradition. “I love my culture, I love my traditions and heritage,” Gold says. “I will always uphold it. I feel, as Africans, we all have a duty, an obligation to show our culture. I will never stop doing that.”","tagline":"New

Born in Germany and raised in the Atlanta area, Ink has worked as a songwriter and producer for a laundry list of superstars, including Beyoncé, Latto, and Kendrick Lamar. On <i>BIG BUSKIN’</i>, Ink shows what she’s capable of as an artist, delivering a dozen tracks that blur the lines between country, pop, and R&B. “Blink of an Eye” is rootsy, gauzy pop with warm, rich vocals and complex harmonies, connecting sonically to Ink’s work on <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. The line-dance-ready “Hoedown” shows Ink’s feisty side with its heavy kick drum and flourishes of fiddle, while songs like “All I Got” and “Sweet Tea” lean into tender narratives. Ink bookends the project with a spoken “Inktro” and “Outro,” injecting more of her big, bold personality into a project with an already strong point of view.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"BIG BUSKIN’","playParams":{"id":"1837884933","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/big-buskin/1837884933","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3oe2btQxk8Ar0dcu9GHKpo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837884933/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"695840203","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/695840203?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759472708632,"RTCI":0}}},"1838055672":{"id":"1838055672","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838055672?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kyle Rodriguez","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kyle-rodriguez/1199256899","artwork":{"bgColor":"97a273","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0c06","textColor2":"1e1e1b","textColor3":"272a1c","textColor4":"36382c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/20/d8/bf/20d8bfe8-e0e5-4a40-a5a4-d2e73543e279/5059449252988.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Soundtrack"],"name":"The Secret Lives of Animals (Apple TV+ Original Series Soundtrack)","playParams":{"id":"1838055672","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":21,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-secret-lives-of-animals-apple-tv-original/1838055672","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2oKPBsAcA7gzgisYshz0sN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838055672/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1199256899","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1199256899?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758916539914,"RTCI":0}}},"1838473115":{"id":"1838473115","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838473115?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Matt Crocker","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/matt-crocker/79437778","artwork":{"bgColor":"201613","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e0cdb6","textColor2":"dbbca0","textColor3":"baa896","textColor4":"b59b84","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fb/96/09/fb96096a-81ec-ab4c-e645-33ce4243d2b7/193436441650_MCTPEPCOVER.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"name":"interlude (Live from Two Palms)","playParams":{"id":"1838473115","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/interlude-live-from-two-palms/1838473115","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0K2GBqOomjS11kdQcK2fLo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838473115/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"79437778","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/79437778?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1758915040255,"RTCI":0}}},"1838514398":{"id":"1838514398","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838514398?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Kasambwe Brothers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-kasambwe-brothers/1838514399","artwork":{"bgColor":"f0e8db","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"232a31","textColor2":"2c2f2e","textColor3":"4c5053","textColor4":"535451","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/bf/79/cabf79f6-ef67-425d-bd7e-54690cb639bc/9529.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","African"],"name":"The Kasambwe Brothers","playParams":{"id":"1838514398","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-kasambwe-brothers/1838514398","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4hsll6VLkKiAbfB6rItooi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838514398/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1838514399","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1838514399?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759491396642,"RTCI":0}}},"1838638646":{"id":"1838638646","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838638646?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Trevor Jackson","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trevor-jackson/3868593","artwork":{"bgColor":"170a04","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fff3e3","textColor2":"f8d9bb","textColor3":"d0c4b6","textColor4":"cbb097","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/08/5e/9a/085e9a4c-b77d-2c4e-eb10-471ded3947fd/ILY_COVER_2-copy-e94f02a0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A heartfelt collection of songs built around love’s highs and lows.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"I Love You -

Well, its success sparked the flame inside Taylor Swift that led to her reunion with former collaborators Max Martin and Shellback for her 12th full-length <i>The Life of a Showgirl</i>. “I’ve never been more proud of anything than I am of the Eras Tour,” Swift says. “And I just thought, ‘I want to make an album that I’m that proud of.’ And that was the catalyst for this record and calling up Max and saying, ‘Do you guys want to do this? I’ll come to you.’”\n\nIndeed, in a very showgirl manner, Swift flew back and forth to Sweden between stops on her European leg—remember, the singer-songwriter believes “jet lag is a choice”—to join Martin and Shellback, Swift’s co-writers and producers on some of the most memorable and popular hits of her career (“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “22,” “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” “Don’t Blame Me,” and “Delicate,” to name a few). The result? A confident, dazzling, at times elegant, at times cheeky, at times sensual pop explosion that examines Swift’s relationships and her fame, which is both deeply personal yet extremely relatable...mostly. (The struggles of “Elizabeth Taylor”—with its thumping rock vibes—can understandably be reserved for the uber-famous showgirls in the room.)\n\nOn the album’s first single, “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift dips back into the Shakespearean well that earned her crossover success and adoring fans. And once again, she turns the Bard’s tale into a romance rather than a tragedy. But this time, it’s more mature and fierce—as the acceptant heroine resigns herself to solitude before the hero ever comes around: “I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I/Right before you lit my sky up.”\n\nHer muses, of course, will be well-dissected. The aforementioned savior in “Ophelia” is most likely Swift’s husband-to-be, the three-time Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce. (She did, after all, announce the album on his podcast.) And he <i>probably</i> has a few more cuts dedicated to him—the most direct being the saucy, ’70s-funk-infused “Wood” and its “new heights of manhood” revelation.\n\nSurprisingly, “Actually Romantic,” with its semi-stripped-down production, deals not with a lover but with a certain hater. “You think I’m tacky, baby/Stop talking dirty to me/It sounded nasty but it feels like you’re flirting with me/I mind my business, God’s my witness that I don’t provoke it/It’s kind of making me wet,” Swift teases. And “Father Figure” pays homage to George Michael with Swift’s breathy vocals, ending with a menacing act of betrayal by a protégé: “You made a deal with this devil/Turns out my dick’s bigger/You want a fight, you found it/I got the place surrounded.”\n\nImportantly, though, remove Swift’s own potential inspirations and you get what she does best: making dizzying and vibrant songs that speak to universal emotions through her storytelling. The buoyant “Opalite” shows two people finding each other at the right time; baroque-pop “Wi$h Li$t” portrays someone who knows what her heart desires. And “Eldest Daughter,” the famous track 5—generally one of Swift’s most vulnerable on each of her albums—reveals a promise of devotion.\n\nSwift ends the record on its title track, an epic duet with Sabrina Carpenter where the women volley back and forth about a girl named Kitty, perhaps alluding to their own places in the world. “And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the bitches who wish I’d hurry up and die/But I’m immortal now, baby dolls, I couldn’t if I tried,” Swift sings proudly. In other words, as she’s proven time and time again, she’ll never go out of style.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"The Life of a Showgirl","playParams":{"id":"1838810949","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl/1838810949","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4a6NzYL1YHRUgx9e3YZI6I"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838810949/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"159260351","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/159260351?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759503702190,"RTCI":0}}},"1838990656":{"id":"1838990656","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838990656?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dennis Free","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dennis-free/1672420809","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a1007","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"eeeeee","textColor2":"f1cd85","textColor3":"c1c2c0","textColor4":"c3a76c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/99/91/79/999179e1-97dd-0021-f9d1-eaedc5899869/840200573733_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"name":"Lost Telemetry -

But if you couldn’t tell from the title (or the fact that the word “country” appears seven times on the tracklist), the fourth album from HARDY is a country record—and don’t you forget it. As the hitmaker explained to Apple Music’s Ty Bentli, the title stems from comments he received over the years for his genre-bucking blend of country and rock. “In case you didn’t know what this is, this is what it is,” he says. “There’s a little bit of smartass in that, but it’s just part of who I am.”\n\nHARDY embraces his redneck roots on songs like “Bottomland,” an ode to his family’s deep history as outdoorsmen, and “Buck on the Wall,” inspired by a visit to his grandfather’s hunting cabin. (The latter first appeared on his May 2025 EP, titled—you guessed it—<i>COUNTRY!</i>.) On ERNEST duet “Bro Country,” the duo shrewdly comments on the genre’s evolution since HARDY cut his teeth in Nashville in the early 2010s. And on the title track, he rejects urban sprawl in favor of small-town simplicity: “If it was up to me, I’d make the whole damn country country.”\n\nJust past the exhortation of good old country livin’, a heavier theme lingers in the margins. “I know that if anybody listens to [the album] top-down, they’re going to think, ‘God, there’s a lot of songs about death,’” HARDY says. The fixation on mortality makes sense: While writing the album, he not only celebrated the birth of his first child but also lost his grandfather. Still, HARDY uses the potentially grim preoccupation as inspiration to live life to the fullest: “Let’s go to Paris, drink a beer on the roof/Hook up on some Ferris wheel and get matchin’ tattoos,” he sings on “Goodbye.” “It’s never a bad thing to remember that when you’re with the people that you love, one day you won’t be,” he explains. “You can channel that into a morbid thought, or you can channel that into a very positive mindset.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"COUNTRY!

The forms presented here exist both within and beyond genre, with immersive songs like “Caribeño” and “NÁUFRAGOS” rendering well-worn terminology like “fusion” rather useless. \n\n“I always study everything before I’m going to jump into it, any type of sound or music,” Alejandro says. “I like to learn a little bit [of] the history.” Whether swinging to salsa on “FALSEDAD” or basking in bachata on “SILENCIO,” he seems consistently at home, sonically and otherwise. The spiritual and the secular become one on his sublimely tropical “GuabanSexxx,” while polyrhythmic percussion elevates the intricate love song “Carita Linda.”\n\nFrom pop-savvy Puerto Rican singer De La Rose to Dominican rap shapeshifter Jey One, the guests who occasionally enter Alejandro’s <i>Cosa Nuestra: Capítulo 0</i> zone contribute in ways simultaneously familiar and fresh. For instance, Wisin and Ñengo Flow naturally bring perreo power to “CONTRABANDO,” yet the underlying groove goes beyond the standard reggaetón mode. Even when he reaches beyond the Caribbean, as with Nigerian singer Ayra Starr on the Afrobeats-inflected “Santa” or Chilean alt-pop act Mon Laferte on “Callejón de los Secretos,” it all fits within the space he’s so carefully constructed. “I didn’t know where this journey was going to take me,” he says. “You keep growing as an artist, as a person.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"name":"Cosa Nuestra: Capítulo 0","playParams":{"id":"1839980812","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cosa-nuestra-cap%C3%ADtulo-0/1839980812","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/752aUI4EPYOGrNuo74pmCR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839980812/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1107186883","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1107186883?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759464225749,"RTCI":0}}},"1840240384":{"id":"1840240384","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840240384?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"DJ Emeezy","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-emeezy/1466681804","artwork":{"bgColor":"eabc60","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0402","textColor2":"131313","textColor3":"382915","textColor4":"3e3523","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/fa/d7/e1fad7df-b6bb-bb75-da35-ba5dff131cf3/8220a1c5-5f48-4acb-9119-900794264dd8.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"fac964","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3b321e","textColor4":"4b3921","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d2/bc/14/d2bc146e-8b35-6aba-73e8-72534b22740c/1fdc3e71-d6eb-4ff7-964d-71159c1025c7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"fe4e19","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3b160a","textColor4":"3d1b11","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/65/c8/b265c89e-e118-9499-7b9a-b6c86420060f/22435bf0-58ec-4b21-b5d1-5f8a25c7ccea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"f5c462","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"352c1a","textColor4":"463d29","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/94/05/23940539-31da-9419-551f-98515964033b/5e00696c-5cf4-4ac1-acc6-7813333b270b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"f4c060","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3f3522","textColor4":"613b20","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1d/48/e2/1d48e26f-e084-f205-16ea-724d5ba7ac1c/5bca807f-8552-40f7-9439-a9a066bc6ccb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"DJ Emeezy is tapped into “the energy of the streets and the clubs.”","standard":"The pan-Africanist ideal never died—it morphed into hybridized sonic fragments that connect Joburg to Nairobi via Lagos and Accra. One of our favorite torchbearers of the continent’s far-reaching musical ingenuity is Akwa-Ibom-born, Lagos-raised DJ Emeezy. Currently serving as tour DJ for Afrobeats superstar BNXN, Emeezy has been absorbing and also dictating the way crowds across the globe are engaging with African music. “African music keeps evolving by blending tradition with fresh global influences, and Afrobeats continues to break boundaries with sounds from the Caribbean, UK, amapiano, Afro-house, and beyond,” Emeezy says. “Being BNXN’s official DJ has given me a front-row seat to how fast Afrobeats is moving and transforming.” For his Africa Now mix, Emeezy aimed to t “bring together some of the most powerful voices and sounds in Nigeria right now,” while including selections that “reflect the energy of the streets, the clubs, and the moments that connect people everywhere.” Hear Emeezy’s vision of Africa Now and check back

and intensely personal songwriting across 11 tracks.","standard":"Like its predecessor, Morgan Wade’s fifth album is an intensely personal affair. The Virginia-born country singer-songwriter wrote all 11 tracks on <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> by herself, something she first did on 2024’s <i>Obsessed</i>, and the resulting album is a compelling listen. Produced by longtime collaborator and band member Clint Wells, <i>The Party Is Over (recovered)</i> opens with its title track, which, despite its thematic connections to newer material on the LP, Wade wrote years earlier—“recovering” it from her vault of unreleased material, as the album title suggests. That tune is sweeping and anthemic, as Wade painfully considers feelings of love that last well beyond a relationship’s expiration date. \n\n“East Coast” is similarly wrenching, though it dips into Wade’s darker side as she imagines drowning herself to get the attention of an ex-flame. It’s not all down and out, though, like on “Parking Garage” when Wade finds comfort in another broken heart, and the bright and sweet “Stay,” in which she hopes to become a better person for “the one.” Wade closes the album with the vivid and emotional ballad “Hardwood Floor,” which tells of a woman struggling to become pregnant.","tagline":"New

press play, I want them to feel like I’m taking them on a journey through the heart of R&B.” When asked to put together an exclusive mix for R&B Now, the West Philadelphia-hailing aficionado, who has spent time as official tour DJ for both Janet Jackson and Patti LaBelle, made sure to include voices like Mary J. Blige, Summer Walker, Jodeci, Chris Brown, and Mariah the Scientist: stars from multiple eras united in their ability to put feelings to melody. \n\n“I treat it like storytelling,” Aktive says. “I want every transition to feel smooth, intentional, and emotionally connected. I start by listening to what’s current—what’s moving the culture right now—but I also dig into the deeper cuts, the joints that might not be charting but still feel right.” From the alt vanguard to modern vets, straightforward to left-field, the tracks on the R&B Now DJ mix capture where R&B is now and point the way to where it’s going.

With eclectic yet consistently booming beats by the likes of Cassius Jay on “Rubber Band Man” and Hit-Boy on “Somebody,” he shares a plethora of gratifyingly true-to-form flexes. Atlanta trap pioneer Zaytoven shares a minimalist, atmospheric instrumental for “Sea World Abu Dhabi,” over which Greedo’s melodic warble floats into the ether.

The Atlanta pioneer had his momentum slowed indefinitely, however, when he was arrested as part of a massive RICO case against his record label, Young Slime Life (YSL), in 2022. Though Thugger released <i>BUSINESS IS BUSINESS (Metro’s Version)</i> after the initial arrest, <i>UY SCUTI</i>— named after the red hyper-giant star—marks the rapper’s first studio album since earning his freedom back (he remains on probation and mostly barred from his home city). \n\nThe ordeal of the past few years weighs heavily on the new album, with Thug openly reflecting on the trauma of being on trial. On “Catch Me I’m Falling,” he raps, “Broke down in a cell, I heard my brother was gon’ turn/Lawyer asked me was I next, it’ll never be my turn.” Loyalty is a key tenet that courses its way through the album. It’s a theme he reckons with on the final track, “Miss My Dogs,” a song that was seemingly recorded in the wake of a recent incident in which many of Young Thug’s jailhouse calls leaked. In those conversations, he was caught speaking poorly about some dear friends and admitted to infidelity. It’s one of the most vulnerable moments of Thug’s long career, a powerful rumination on friendship, morality, and honesty.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"UY SCUTI","playParams":{"id":"1842381836","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":21,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/uy-scuti/1842381836","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1PokOUCgfAho8snnJLTkMD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842381836/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"81886939","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/81886939?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759491552083,"RTCI":0}}},"1842409228":{"id":"1842409228","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842409228?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ABGR Lil Cory","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/abgr-lil-cory/1770774651","artwork":{"bgColor":"322b0d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"bbe3d4","textColor2":"a4cfa8","textColor3":"a0beac","textColor4":"8dae89","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/81/51/1a/81511a21-a709-cf9a-eec2-2bba32c74d9e/196873630908.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Everything Must Go","playParams":{"id":"1842409228","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-30","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything-must-go/1842409228","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1h7lHyy2qo4MHaoV9rNzTS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842409228/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1770774651","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1770774651?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759227923285,"RTCI":0}}},"1842501395":{"id":"1842501395","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842501395?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jeezy & DJ Drama","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=276972832-152535281","artwork":{"bgColor":"dbdbdb","hasP3":false,"height":2500,"textColor1":"262527","textColor2":"272829","textColor3":"4a494b","textColor4":"4b4c4c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e5/2d/97/e52d97b2-0407-9c13-e292-ccc2e5da68aa/199316290776_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2500},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Two Atlanta rap veterans reteam to switch up their style.","standard":"Back in 2022, Jeezy (formerly known as Young Jeezy) and DJ Drama teamed up for <i>SNOFALL</i>, a tape that seemed to suggest that no matter how much Atlanta’s rap scene shifted, the trap legend remained at its center. This notion was true. As the city morphed thanks to pioneering sounds from Young Thug, Future, Lil Baby, and Playboi Carti, Jeezy still held sway while doubling down on his sound. On 2025’s <i>Still Snowin’</i>, Jeezy and Drama show that just because they’re seasoned veterans doesn’t mean they can’t also switch their style up while exerting that same influence. The title track is a soulful, funk-inspired cut that features synths beamed straight in from Cali’s G-funk heyday. The beat is unlike anything Jeezy has ever rapped over before. “Snowman Party” features a slowed-down drum groove and a sultry horn melody that accents the spitter’s hypnotic chorus. “Bruce Wayne” is perhaps the closest Jeezy gets to mimicking his signature era on the project, but even it wrestles and wiggles away from a strict adherence to his trap roots.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Still Snowin'","playParams":{"id":"1842501395","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-28","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-snowin/1842501395","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3AQaGYyxlx3kHsE0thg5lV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842501395/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"276972832","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/276972832?l=en-US"},{"id":"152535281","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/152535281?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759198868251,"RTCI":0}}},"1843007317":{"id":"1843007317","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1843007317?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kali Uchis","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kali-uchis/894731301","artwork":{"bgColor":"bf896f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"090909","textColor2":"121014","textColor3":"2d231e","textColor4":"342826","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7a/a9/33/7aa93393-2189-9c11-a7a4-87d2fa487306/25UM1IM35275.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"With five new tracks—the cherry on top of her intimate fifth album.","standard":"“I’ve been realizing that I really made the album that I needed to heal myself,” Kali Uchis tells Apple Music about <i>Sincerely,</i> perhaps her most liberating work yet. The Colombian American singer-songwriter’s catalog has never felt slight or frivolous, whether in English or in Spanish. Yet this full-length follow-up to her 2024 <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i> dyad presents as something truly unique, arriving roughly a decade after her promising EP debut <i>Por Vida</i>. \n\nThe majority of the songs here began simply as voice notes, fortuitously captured in inspired moments outside of the confines or pressures of a studio setting. “Messages would just feel like they were directly coming through me, and I just had to get them out,” she says. Given such natural creative origins, it should come as little surprise that the actual process behind the album eschewed industry norms altogether, favoring home recording and unconventional settings. And despite the demonstrated level of guest vocal talent at her fingertips, she opted out of features, too. “When you’re making emotional music, you have to actually dig into difficult subjects,” she says, marking a clear distinction between this piece and its star-powered predecessor.\n\nAs a result, <i>Sincerely,</i> feels disarmingly intimate for what is ostensibly a pop album, even one from as consistently adventurous an artist as Uchis. The evocative moments of opener “Heaven Is a Home…” and closer “ILYSMIH” speak on love in grand and sweeping gestures, the passing of her mother and the birth of her son making understandably profound impacts on the work. \n\nInfluences like Cocteau Twins and Fiona Apple can be felt in all that comes between those bookends. “There’s a lot of grief, but there’s a lot of joy,” she says, describing what seeps through the veil of “Silk Lingerie,” or the vamps of “Territorial.” Excess punctuation on titles like “Lose My Cool,” and “For: You” hint at the flowing prose of her lyrics as it contributes to an even greater whole. “I think it is a celebration of life in its own way,” she says, “in the sense of finding beauty in the pain and taking the good.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe
