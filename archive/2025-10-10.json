Even though they weren’t around to witness the glory days of alt-rock, they spent the first years of their career touring with the luminaries that inspired them to start a band in the first place: The Smashing Pumpkins, Ride, Silversun Pickups, and Sunny Day Real Estate. It was those formative touring experiences that helped shape their debut LP, <i>R is for Rocket</i>, which marks a significant sharpening of their sound from their first EP, 2023’s <i>Versions of You</i>. Produced by the band’s guitarist Desi Scaglione, <i>R is for Rocket</i> is crisp and precise, anthemic, punchy guitar rock bolstered by the electrifying vocals of Alithea Tuttle. There’s the propulsive odd-meter rhythm of opener “The Choice,” the Nirvana-esque drum fills and crunching guitars of “Crossing Fingers,” and the Radiohead-inspired balladry of “Number One Fan.” Whoever proclaimed that rock is dead clearly forgot to alert Rocket.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"R is for Rocket","playParams":{"id":"1817135193","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/r-is-for-rocket/1817135193","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/71B3Y4OdzrQNt6acfdKsIG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817135193/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1645124479","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1645124479?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759650374472,"RTCI":0}}},"1817547293":{"id":"1817547293","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817547293?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jay Som","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jay-som/1079783745","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"342c26","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"5d5651","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/92/7f/8a/927f8a66-3bd6-3b74-077e-760eae563a8d/644110051790.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"460e0f","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"6b3e3f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/74/d5/e6/74d5e6f3-7d52-63b9-1888-b1ddcd41ad60/Job91d3b746-6a8e-429b-a6f4-0a4f29c1f7e8-196898244-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385561756_2242347799-Time1752004321540.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"420e0f","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"683e3f","textGradient":["ffffff","420e0f"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/26/f7/e8/26f7e888-21ae-8ade-e31a-a48156f9daea/Job7812a0e7-8379-49bf-b956-1accd3287466-196898243-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385561757_2242347798-Time1752002876106.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"After six years, Melina Duterte picks up where she left off.","standard":"In the six years since Jay Som’s critically acclaimed sophomore album <i>Anak Ko</i>, Melina Duterte has kept the kind of schedule that would strike fainter hearts with exhaustion. There’s been collaborations with Troye Sivan, beabadoobee, and Lucy Dacus; production credits across scores of indie records; a whole album with Palehørse’s El Kempner as Bachelor; and extensive touring as part of boygenius’ live band. With all this palling around, it’s not surprising that her third album as Jay Som features some high-powered collaborations: Jimmy Eat World’s Jim Adkins joins in for the surging emo-pop of “Float,” while the chugging alt-rock anthem “Past Lives” features contributions from Paramore’s Hayley Williams. \n\nBut <i>Belong</i> also finds Duterte picking up exactly where she left off with Jay Som’s recorded catalog, her trademark sense of intimacy and intricate arrangements left fully intact. From the tick-tock guitars of “Casino Stars” to the open-air wistfulness of “Appointments,” Duterte continues to develop her own brand of close-mic’d emotionalism even as her star has grown ever brighter across the 2020s.\n","tagline":"New

rising star on her debut: “I could not just go down one narrow lane.”","standard":"For Carter Faith, <i>Cherry Valley</i> is a state of mind. The quickly rising country star tells Apple Music that she first came across the would-be title of her full-length debut album while driving through Tennessee, spotting the name “Cherry Valley” on a road sign and soon adopting the name for her own fantastical dreamland. It only made sense to choose <i>Cherry Valley</i> to title her debut outing, a delightful and often surprising collection from a young artist with a truly kaleidoscopic vision.\n\n“I write a lot of different styles of songs,” Faith says. “I have a lot of different music that I like to listen to, so I guess a lot of different influences, too, but I really could not just go down one narrow lane for the album in my brain, at least. And so I was like, ‘Well, I guess I’m the through line. My story is the through line.’”\n\n<i>Cherry Valley</i> opens with its cinematic title track, which isn’t so much a literal origin story as it is a spiritual one, with Faith imagining a “crystal sunrise on the lake” as strings swell behind her. “Sex, Drugs, & Country Music” ups the twang with traditional production including pedal steel and Western guitar, and vocals from Faith that recall Lee Ann Womack and Patsy Cline. Other highlights are the winking two-stepper “Bar Star” (the music video for that one stars none other than Billy Bob Thornton) and “Betty,” a clever, wordplay-heavy barn burner about a femme fatale, à la “Jolene.”\n\nBelow, Faith shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Cherry Valley”</b>\n“Cherry Valley is a place I drove through in Tennessee and it was sticky in my brain. I wrote the name down, and I always, when they say, ‘Go to your happy place,’ I kept picturing this place that I was making up in my brain and I just called it ‘Cherry Valley.’ So that’s what it is to me. It’s just like a dreamland.”\n\n<b>“Sex, Drugs, & Country Music”</b>\n“‘Sex, Drugs, & Country Music,’ we took 30 minutes to write. Because it was just like, ‘I should just put it out there, for better or for worse.’ I tell my dad that song’s a metaphor for sure, but it’s very true.”\n\n<b>“Bar Star”</b>\n“We shot [the music video] at Magnolia’s Motor Lounge in Texas, which is a little bar that I love and that [Billy Bob Thornton] loves. We have a mutual friend who plays music there… Somehow we both had the same day open. I brought my whole team down. My mom came—she wanted to meet him—and he brought all the <i>Landman</i> people. It was just fun. We just had a good time. And it was cool seeing him in action, too.”\n\n<b>“Betty”</b>\n“I had that idea, but I thought it might’ve been dumb. So I was like, ‘Honestly, I met a chihuahua at a truck stop named Betty, and she had her nails painted.’ I was like, ‘If that dog was a woman, she would steal my man for sure.’ I was writing little poems about it. I just couldn’t stop thinking about this damn chihuahua. And I went out to California with Tofer [Brown] and we were going to write with Shane [McAnally], and I was like, ‘Is this idea dumb, Tofer? Tell me. Betty, bet he. Is that too songwriter-y?’ And he was like, ‘No. Shane, of all people, will crush that.’ And I brought the idea, and then Shane wrote the song, basically.”\n\n<b>“Six String”</b>\n“We wrote that song and the lyrics were inspired by The Beatles, but the sonics were definitely inspired by ’50s country. I love the drama.”\n\n<b>“Burn My Memory”</b>\n“I changed a lot of the words so that the person knew it was about them. There were different little things in it that were still very specific, but more like in the room that sounded good. And then as I was doing the vocals for it, I was pissed off, and I was like, I’m changing this. He’s going to know it’s about him.”\n\n<b>“Sails”</b>\n“Lauren Hungate brought that idea in, because she had just had a little baby boy, and she said she was watching him sleep when that idea came.

But the former Verve singer didn’t just turn up to peddle ’90s nostalgia. He opened his sets with “Lover,” a joyous, R&B-inspired bop that sets the uplifting, genre-bending tone for <i>Lovin’ You</i>, a collection of life-affirming anthems, unabashedly romantic serenades, and playful dance detours that showcase Britpop’s most soulful voice in all its ageless wonder. It’s the work of a rock veteran who’s got an ear tuned in to the contemporary pop conversation: “I’m a Rebel” is a slinky, French touched workout (courtesy of guest collaborator Mirwais) that sees the singer push his falsetto to ecstatic new heights, while the title track suggests his stormy solo signature “A Song for the Lovers” given a rap remix. But we also get Ashcroft in familiar <i>Urban Hymns</i> acoustic-troubadour mode on late-night reveries like “Find Another Reason” and “Live with Hope,” which aim for the symphonic splendor and gospel grandeur of classic early-’70s Stones ballads. Whether Ashcroft is playing to the club or the church, <i>Lovin’ You</i> is unified in its mission to make life feel a little less bitter and a lot more sweet.","tagline":"New

They’d been a duo for less than a year when “Home” went viral on TikTok in early 2024, but Oli Fox and Scott Verrill kept up the momentum and set to work making their debut album, <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>. \n\n“In a perfect world, there would’ve been more time, because we’ve only really a band for about two years now,” Fox tells Apple Music. “It felt like the least we could do for all the new people that have started to follow us, in terms of putting all the songs in one lovely body of work and get it out there. We’re going to just crack on into album two now.”\n\nThe duo, who met when they were working in East London studios next door to each other, make the process sound as relaxing as their songs. “We tried to book a few days out and write stuff and that didn’t really work for us, so I think we did it in a scrappy way,” says Verrill. “A couple of hours here, a couple of hours there, sending voice notes. That worked for us instead of being locked away, trying to force something out.”\n\nBeneath the easygoing exterior that’s reflected in their bouncy sound lie some tough-to-tackle themes. “Ripple” sees them reaching out to a friend sinking into grief, and the uplifting anthem “Keep It Up” was written on a particularly bad day for Fox. “It’s making life’s grittier problems seem a little more manageable and a bit more accessible to talk about,” he says.\n\nRead on as Good Neighbours take you through <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Keep It Up”</b>\nOli Fox: “Scott was in the studio and I came in to moan about being fired from my fourth part-time job in a coffee shop. I was honestly useless—I couldn’t make a coffee to save my life, and I didn’t know anything about beans. I really wanted to do music, but couldn’t find any way to make it financially viable. Scott had those piano chords running that you hear in the beginning of the track, so I took them into the studio and started wailing down the mic. Immediately, it created this vibe where me and Scott were like, ‘Actually, this feels like something special.’ It was uplifting, but you knew there was a grit and a grain of truth in the lyric as well.”\n\n<b>“Skipping Stones”</b>\nScott Verrill: “We started this one together. It was a chance for us to lean into production, get a little more electronic and have some fun on the music side.”\nOF: “We grew up loving Passion Pit and MGMT, and the more you dig into those people, you realize they’re baring all with their lyrics as well. I guess that’s something you don’t really pick up on when you’re younger.”\nSV: “When we were making the project, we weren’t down, but we were a bit fed up and struggling to make ends meet, and then this became exciting and positive and a chance to make something that uplifted us a bit.”\n\n<b>“Ripple”</b>\nOF: “We started this before we knew that Good Neighbours was going to be a band. My friend had been really struggling to talk about his dad—who was like my second dad—passing. He was like, ‘I feel like every time I bring that up, it’s like I drag you down with me.’ For me, it was quite the opposite. I remember saying to him, ‘Oh well, whenever you come up for air, come and have a chat.’ That phrase started this image in my head of how grief can feel like you’re being submerged, and no one else can understand you because they’re all on the surface. I sent Scott the demo, and he flipped it on its head and, in true Good Neighbours fashion, made it into this optimistic-feeling track. I really love the juxtaposition of what the production does and what the message says.”\n\n<b>“found u/me”</b>\nSV: “Listening back to the album a few times, it felt like it was such high-energy and very indie and splashy, so we thought we’d try something that was a bit more heartfelt and organic. It was the last song we wrote for the album, and it popped out really quickly. We’re quite comfortable with a love song if it feels right, and this did.”\nOF: “Yeah, we’re quite shameless. It’s OK to be in love, guys.”\n\n<b>“Walk Walk Walk”</b>\nOF: “We were lucky enough to work with Justin Tranter, who’s written some ridiculously good songs [for Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Bieber]. Everything from the 2010s onwards. As songwriters growing up, it’s a dream to go and work with someone like that. Justin was awesome, and we wanted to create that college party sound of the noughties, where we’ve watched videos of Yeasayer, MGMT, and The Go! Team. Having a proper soaring synth melody has always been something we’ve aspired to do, but we needed to caveat that with a pretty solid pop song on the top. Justin brought those words out of us. It was like going back to school, working with someone like that, but we learned so much in one day. That song just goes off live.”\n\n<b>“Kids Can’t Sleep”</b>\nSV: “We wrote this in LA. It was a weird time, because we arrived on the day of the fires [in early 2025] and everything kicking off, so we flew into the chaos. It was born out of hiding away from the fires and feeling a bit weird about everything going on.”\nOF: “I’d been seeing loads online of people trying to come forward to talk about their mental health and older people were like, ‘Oh, this snowflake generation.’ I was filled with rage at that time, and then we arrived in LA and literally the world was on fire, so that’s what we’re talking about in the chorus. It’s a cry for a bit of normality again.”\n\n<b>“Home”</b>\nOF: “‘Home’ was written around the time of losing my mate’s dad. I went back to London a day early, and I saw my girlfriend at the time and hugged her outside the station, and my whole body relaxed for the first time in three days. I was like, ‘Oh, maybe home can also be within your mate or your best friend.’ That was an epiphany for me. The next day, me and Scott happened to be in the studio and it completely fell out word for word, so there was obviously something that needed to be said.”\nSV: “We never imagined one of our songs would go viral, so it caught us off guard. It was wild—the only reason we stuck it up online is because one of our friends persuaded us to use TikTok. So there was no big plan, it was an accident.”\n\n<b>“Small Town”</b>\nSV: “This is more of a scenic one for us, painting a picture instead of a specific story. I think it feels like the opening scene of a coming-of-age movie.”\nOF: “There was one person I never got over, and it was quite a young breakup when I first moved to London. It was about knowing that you were maybe the problem in the relationship, but realizing it four years too late. I think when you go through your first proper heartbreak, London suddenly becomes the tiniest village ever and everyone knows about it. So it was all about drawing a parallel between the small town that I’m actually from and how London can shrink when something goes awry.”\n\n<b>“Starry Eyed”</b>\nOF: “We wrote this on tour with Foster the People when we were 70 percent into finishing our album and we felt like we had a lot of bangers and high-octane songs. Then we were working with Joe Janiak [writer and producer for Lewis Capaldi, Ellie Goulding, and Sigrid], who’s more of a friend than a collaborator. I’d hung out with him before in LA, and he had this weird banjo that had been restrung with nylon strings, and it’s the instrument that plays throughout the track. Scott played the first three chords and we wrote the whole melody. I was like, ‘Actually, for once, rather than just layering it up, let’s keep this as stripped as we can and just tell a fun love story.’ People have really resonated with ‘Starry Eyed’ because it’s so different to the rest of our stuff.”\n\n<b>“People Need People”</b>\nOF: “‘People Need People’ has always gone down quite well live, so it felt right for the album. It sets up <i>Blue Sky Mentality</i>. We had the demo and we didn’t do anything with it, but when we decided we were going to make an album we revisited it.”\nSV: “I remember when we did the chorus, we were like, ‘Oh, this feels like a <i>FIFA</i> [the video game series] song.’ And then we found out the other day it was on <i>FIFA</i> [<i>FC26</i>] and we were like, ‘Great!’ It’s the second track we’ve had on there [after ‘Daisies’] and they asked us back, which we’ve been told is a rare thing.”\n\n<b>“Left Hand Man”</b>\nSV: “We started this on a writing trip in Cornwall. It was a noodle that turned into this fun song, and for us it’s almost an interlude. It’s a chance to breathe on the album, rather than have a load of loud noises being shoved in your face.”\nOF: “Obviously, making a big song is the funnest thing to do, but when you put them all on an album together you’re like, ‘Oh no, this is quite sensory overload for people.’ So it was fun to write some smaller moments to bring the listener back down to earth.”\n\n<b>“Suburbs”</b>\nSV: “We’re both from the suburbs [Fox is from Essex and Verrill just outside Croydon, South London], and I think it’s a weird feeling, being on the outskirts, with all these music and art scenes in London that you’re not really a part of. You grow up just wanting to be a part of it, and even now we’re in the circles, it makes you more grateful for where you came from.”\nOF: “I lived in quite a rural area and it was hard growing up wanting to chase your dreams. Most people from my area have very honest jobs, so you don’t come across many people that are like, ‘I want to go sing and dance on a stage.’ It’s nice to come back and feel like I proved a younger version of myself wrong.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful Life”</b>\nOF: “We were working on this the week that ‘Home’ went viral. The whole album touches on the idea that life’s going to be a rocky ride, but boil it all down and we’re so lucky to be here. At the time, I’d seen this thing from Brian Cox [the physicist] talking about how we’re on a planet, and we’re all technically made up of stardust. He was like, ‘That in itself is so ridiculous. What more could you possibly want?’ So on the days where you miss your bus or get fired from your job, it’s crap in the moment, but when you zoom out, it means absolutely nothing in terms of how lucky you are to just be here in the first place. That was a cry to myself, and also to all of our friends that were going through the mill at the time, because they’re awesome people.”\n\n<b>“The Buzz”</b>\nOF: “I think we impressed ourselves making ‘The Buzz’ because we’ve only ever made really big shiny things and that one felt like, ‘Oh, we are actually half-decent songwriters that can just write good songs.’ So it was nice to not shower something in production.”\nSV: “When it came to the last track on the album, it was between ‘found u/me’ and ‘The Buzz.’ On our favorite bands’ albums there’s always been the ballad, and we felt like we’d not nailed that before, so we wanted to tackle it. We both have a soft spot for the song.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Blue Sky

’n’ Ross mix moody instrumentals with futurist bangers.","standard":"Since the early 2010s, Trent Reznor has been leading a double life: As he continued to lead industrial-rock agitators Nine Inch Nails through arenas around the world, he also reinvented himself as the award-winning soundtrack composer (alongside longtime collaborator Atticus Ross) for prestige big-screen fare like <i>The Social Network</i> and <i>Challengers</i>. But <i>TRON: Ares</i>—the long-awaited third entry in Disney’s future-shocked franchise—is the first Reznor ’n’ Ross score to be released under the NIN name. And really, the brand synergy is perfect: As an entity that’s always thrived on the violent tension between man and machine, Nine Inch Nails is an ideal avatar for TRON’s blinding-lights vision of AI run amok. \n\nHowever, when heard outside its cinematic context, <i>TRON: Ares</i> feels like it could be another entry in NIN’s experimental album series <i>Ghosts</i>, presenting a sprawling 24-track collage of dreamy piano interstitials (“Echoes”), lo-tech techno (“This Changes Everything”), swelling ’70-sci-fi synthphonies (“100% Expendable”), dramatic, pulse-pounding set pieces (“Daemonize”), and brain-bending avant-electronic eruptions (“New Directive”). \n\nAt the same time, <i>TRON: Ares</i> is greatly distinguished from the duo’s previous film collaborations by the inclusion of some Reznor-led strobe-lit ragers (”As Alive as You Need Me to Be,” “Shadow Over Me”) that would be right at home in NIN’s classic ’90s canon. And then there are those uncanny moments where Reznor’s frontperson and soundscaper roles blur—like “Who Wants to Live Forever?”, a disarmingly delicate duet framed by a twinkling keyboard melody that sounds like it’s wafting out of a sleeping baby’s nursery.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"TRON: Ares (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","playParams":{"id":"1826198222","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-19","trackCount":24,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tron-ares-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1826198222","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/47pjW3XDPW99NShtkeewxl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826198222/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"107917","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/107917?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1759990284859,"RTCI":0}}},"1827308975":{"id":"1827308975","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827308975?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Electric Guest","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/electric-guest/466933888","artwork":{"bgColor":"0039cc","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d1deff","textColor2":"97b4ff","textColor3":"a7bdf4","textColor4":"789cf4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/29/be/46/29be464b-abdb-57a2-2fbc-05c44ffd1b98/199538060218.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"003acc","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"dbe5ff","textColor2":"a7c0ff","textColor3":"afc2f4","textColor4":"85a5f4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/9c/e7/78/9ce77860-32b7-8220-cd08-80104843be92/Job12b90973-d701-4556-985d-3c7aa7211e81-202909169-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396870500_2335881116-Time1757673975443.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"06165e","gradient":{"color":"06165e","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"092672","textColor3":"334c8e","textColor4":"3a518e","textGradient":["ffffff","092672"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/71/5f/7e/715f7e60-d395-da70-d490-d4666fb7f497/Jobba4bdf5b-68f0-490e-bdff-c6cd8d6d168d-202909168-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396870499_2335881117-Time1757671493912.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"10K","playParams":{"id":"1827308975","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/10k/1827308975","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/212Kb9Hs920AxlxhAo7wAV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827308975/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466933888","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466933888?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760005132420,"RTCI":0}}},"1827608927":{"id":"1827608927","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827608927?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Agatha is Dead!","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/agatha-is-dead/1602271240","artwork":{"bgColor":"fbfbfb","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0a0a","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor3":"3a3a3a","textColor4":"4b4b4b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5b/23/0c/5b230cdb-b45f-a3fc-1133-820ed96ab8d0/116542.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"order -

His sound has taken multiple twists and turns since boundary-breaking singles like “Getting Me Down” and “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage,” and <i>SickElixir</i> indeed continues to push his gnarly sound into new and thrilling territory while drawing from personal loss and trauma. “I wrote this record at one of the toughest periods of my life,” Roberts tells Apple Music, explaining that he lost four friends from substance overdoses before making the decision to get sober himself. “This decade-long trip to get clean—losing friends, having family trauma and massive upheavals in my life—led me to write music like this. It was a gift to able to get my life in order.”\n\nAt first glance, this record might seem intimidating to the uninitiated, at times sounding like a washing machine crammed with dynamite. But as Roberts explains it, the intensity of <i>SickElixir</i> is meant to be inviting, as well as a reshaping of what aggression signifies in music. “One of the main things I try to put across is that aggressive music doesn’t come from an evil place,” he says. “It comes from somewhere far more deeper than that.” Indeed, amidst the harshness, <i>SickElixir</i> possesses a sneakily catchy grooviness, as bursts of high-pitched melody are emitted like steam around Roberts’ constructions. The end result is a sonic potion that just feels good going down, even as it leaves a mark.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"SickElixir","playParams":{"id":"1827977106","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sickelixir/1827977106","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/59aRCCtOb1yMhdN9TM53zR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827977106/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"367813681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/367813681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760040868920,"RTCI":0}}},"1828403729":{"id":"1828403729","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828403729?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Testament","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/testament/157139","artwork":{"bgColor":"66473b","hasP3":false,"height":1440,"textColor1":"f6c574","textColor2":"debe8d","textColor3":"d9ac68","textColor4":"c6a67d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dc/e9/4a/dce94a72-cb83-3957-0d0b-9bf2682c2fa4/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1440},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"121212","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d9d9d9","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"b1b1b1","textColor4":"a1a1a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8a/04/c9/8a04c92f-fbad-001f-f6c6-523fb91f4b9b/c49e88b9-ccf5-4706-9006-0429d6715f2f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Bay Area thrash vets draw inspiration from their legacy.","standard":"The title of Testament’s 14th studio album is a reference to the immortal Latin phrase attributed to the 4th-century Roman writer Vegetius: <i>Si vis pacem, para bellum</i> (if you want peace, prepare for war). As such, the veteran Bay Area thrashers delve into all manner of bellicose topics, from AI aggression (“Infanticide A.I.”) and invisible weapons (“Havana Syndrome”) to Wild West gunslingers (“High Noon”) and the January 6 insurrection (the title track).\n\nWith a jolt of youthful energy from new 27-year-old drummer Chris Dovas, Testament OGs Chuck Billy (vocals), Eric Peterson (guitars), Alex Skolnick (guitars), and long-serving bassist Steve Di Giorgio revisited their roots via musical references to their 1987 debut, <i>The Legacy</i>, and their first ballad (“Meant to Be”) in many years. Even the cover image, by Israeli artist Eliran Kantor, is a reference to the band’s early days as Legacy, before they changed their name to Testament. “Our very first Legacy poster had this demon guy pushing two missile launchers with a giant explosion,” Billy tells Apple Music. “We were like, ‘Let’s bring that back.’” Below, the singer comments on each track.\n\n<b>“For the Love of Pain”</b>\n“That was the last song we wrote for the record. Chris wrote some lyrics and then I put my spin on it and sent it back. Then Eric took it even further and added some black metal vocals and some more lyrics. It’s odd that it was the last one we wrote but ended up being the first one on the record, but it just comes out smashing you in the face right away, a heavy song right at the top.” \n\n<b>“Infanticide A.I.”</b>\n“AI is everywhere these days. I rode in taxis in San Francisco and Texas without drivers, which is so weird. I even went to a restaurant where there was a robot clearing the tables and taking the dishes back to the dishwasher. But I used the song as a message to beware because AI is something that just keeps collecting data. It’s going to come to a point where it’s going to have an opinion and make its own decisions. If it’s during a time of war, is it just going to start popping off nuclear warheads? Who’s stopping it? Who’s controlling it?” \n\n<b>“Shadow People”</b>\n“I saw this show on TV about people who are frozen in bed because of a nightmare, or they see dark shadows in the room and things moving in the dark, but they can’t scream or move. I looked into it more and found something where they compare it to alien abductions involving the man in the black hat, who’s a common figure in alien abduction stories. So I put both of those ideas together in this song.”\n\n<b>“Meant to Be”</b> \n“It’s been a long while since we’ve done something like this. When I first heard it, I was just stoked, because it really did take me back to ‘Return to Serenity’ or something like that. The riff and the tone and the parts that Alex and those guys came up with, it really is epic. Then I got kind of scared, because it’s like eight minutes long. That’s a lot of words, a lot of singing. But once I found my way through it, it took on a life of its own and set it up for Alex and Eric to have this really cool lead guitar journey towards the end of the song. Lyrically, people might think it’s a love song, but it’s about the planet and how mankind keeps abusing it.” \n\n<b>“High Noon”</b>\n“That was a fun one. I don’t know why, but I just had an idea in my head about a gunslinger. The pace of the song brought out this whole storyline of a duel on a dirty street and hanging out in a saloon with hookers, drinking whiskey. Eric wasn’t sure about the idea at first, but it grew on him over time. And it just makes for something differently lyrically, musically, and vocally.”\n\n<b>“Witch Hunt”</b>\n“The day Steve Souza told me he was out of Exodus, I said, ‘I’m coming over. We’re writing some songs.’ I originally wrote lyrics for ‘High Noon’ and ‘For the Love of Pain’ with Steve as well, but they didn’t work in the studio. With this song, it stuck. Eric had a working title of ‘Witch Hunt’ for this, so we combined the idea of a political witch hunt with an actual witch hunt and the burning of witches.” \n\n<b>“Nature of the Beast”</b>\n“Another oddball track here. When I first heard it, it didn’t really sound metal to me. I love Thin Lizzy, and I love the dueling guitar parts they came up with, but I didn’t feel it was right for the record. But when we started compiling all the songs for the album, we had enough death stuff and enough fast stuff. The intro on this has a Motörhead feeling, and the overall vibe is classic rock, so I kind of took that approach vocally. I pulled my voice back a bit so I’m not pushing it as much. Lyrically, it’s about going to Vegas, gambling, and putting everything on the line.” \n\n<b>“Room 117”</b>\n“I’ve been writing songs with Del James for almost 30 years now, and we co-wrote the lyrics to this one. This was another song that didn’t fit the metal mold to me, but I wasn’t going to throw it away. I had a melody, but I didn’t have any words yet. At the time, Del’s mom was in the hospital, and he was spending a lot of time there. Room 117 was her room number, and she never left that room. He lost his mom there. One day he texted me some words he wrote about that and said, ‘If you can use it, go for it. If not, I’m just sharing it with you.’ So I took some of his stuff and combined it with some of my stuff, and it fit the melody I had in my head perfectly.” \n\n<b>“Havana Syndrome”</b>\n“Since we were talking about war and weaponry on ‘Infanticide A.I.,’ another thing that came up was Havana syndrome, which is [believed to be] the result of an invisible weapon used on the US consulate, sound waves that were targeting US ambassadors and causing dizziness and headaches and balance problems—really screwing them up. I guess this is a weapon that’s also being used to defend against pirates. They hit their boats with these sound waves and the pirates get dizzy and start throwing up and then they take off.”\n\n<b>“Para Bellum”</b>\n“Me and Alex wrote this one. We knocked it out in about two hours. In the process of writing the lyrics together, I found that weird little hook of the lyric to throw off the timing of the chorus just enough to make a vocal hook without changing the riff. The song was inspired by the January 6 insurrection, which basically makes it another war song. And then of course this became the title of the album and the idea behind the cover art, with the angel with missile wings.

There’s still plenty here that will be recognizable to longtime listeners—the warm, Blue Nile-recalling saxophone line on the opening title track, the seductive and soft-lit pomp of “Know You Naked”—but with the aid of HAIM and The 1975 collaborator Tommy King on production duties, Paul Klein and Jake Goss are clearly taking pleasure in coloring outside their defined lines on <i>Soft</i>. The ascending-chord synth-pop of “Make Me Forget” is a dead ringer for CHVRCHES’ own neon dreams, while the lushness of ’90s R&B is evoked on “Good Parts” and the glistening keys on closing track “Last Forever.” “Am I too old to act my age?” Klein ruminates on the reflective “Act My Age,” but <i>Soft</i> is proof that LANY continues to mature gracefully in the pop landscape.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Soft","playParams":{"id":"1828560356","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/soft/1828560356","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2gfh9js0PqxJnWctC4au5k"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828560356/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"867853783","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/867853783?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760045768686,"RTCI":0}}},"1828924634":{"id":"1828924634","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828924634?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Utopia Strong","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-utopia-strong/1466901770","artwork":{"bgColor":"050404","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c4c7c7","textColor2":"b4beca","textColor3":"9ea0a0","textColor4":"9199a2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ba/59/b5/ba59b58d-0b57-be7b-ad66-04f481cd8456/5056688831165.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"89b5e0","textColor3":"a1a3a0","textColor4":"6e91b3","textGradient":["ffffff","89b5e0"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6c/3a/8a/6c3a8a0a-911d-94ef-4718-ad9df10e1f0f/Jobd7fc87da-8b5c-4e94-b8a4-b94f01345bfd-201218820-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393751022_2309431612-Time1756210197689.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"7eafdf","textColor3":"9da19f","textColor4":"648cb2","textGradient":["ffffff","7eafdf"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/5a/b0/01/5ab001d9-c751-9a6e-755a-77adf3cc1fe5/Jobffa1ff77-6c15-45d3-8047-e48c0efaddbe-201218819-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_393751021_2309431613-Time1756207835819.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Rock","Psychedelic"],"name":"Doperider","playParams":{"id":"1828924634","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/doperider/1828924634","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0QzqcnRs5C0CNco6XND4bw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828924634/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1466901770","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1466901770?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760059032599,"RTCI":0}}},"1831044542":{"id":"1831044542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831044542?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bryson Tiller","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryson-tiller/642591128","artwork":{"bgColor":"091215","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4dccc","textColor2":"c2dbdc","textColor3":"b8b4a7","textColor4":"9db2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/f3/91/32f39154-b2ea-d39b-20fc-b039eb739760/196873461342.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cad2cb","textColor2":"cca882","textColor3":"a5aba6","textColor4":"a6896c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/ac/7d/8bac7d7c-3d43-daee-fa0f-fa55b4a008b5/3a414f76-61bf-462a-83cc-40daf17d384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e8af7b","textColor2":"de9c65","textColor3":"bd8f66","textColor4":"b58054","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/dd/43/6bdd43c0-dd3b-fbbc-3800-033fe2e5b594/062eafcc-cae2-41ff-89bd-db99ecfb5192.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Louisville crooner revels in his dualities on his double-album effort.","standard":"With Bryson Tiller’s 2024 self-titled album, the Louisville crooner crafted a genre-bending departure from his comfort zone, experimenting with the soundscapes of dancehall, drill, and pop next to his signature mixture of hip-hop and R&B. Tiller fully embraced himself and where he was at within his artistry, so much so that he decided to take a hiatus from music after its release to pursue his passion for video game design. But now he’s back with <i>Solace & The Vices</i>, a double album that lets go of the pressures of the industry and starts a new chapter of his ever-evolving sound.\n\nOn the first half of <i>Solace & The Vices</i>, Tiller looks inward as he gets somberly vulnerable about his struggles with romance, handling fame, and more. On the album opener “Strife,” he croons about wanting his lover to give him another chance, while on “Workaholic,” he exposes his own shortcomings as a partner due to obsessing over his career: “I was scared of going broke in 2018/That was after all the money and the fame/Going back to how it was, the shit’ll be a shame.”\n\n“I treated <i>Solace</i> like a therapy session,” Tiller tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I really want people to listen to it that way, almost as if I’m sitting on a couch and you’re just listening to what I’m saying.” And he does just that, taking listeners on a voyage through his psyche as he pulls himself apart to reflect on the highs and lows of his relationships, whether he’s dealing with losing a lover to someone else (“Damn”), making the hard decision to end a connection (“Uncertainty”), or finding new love again (“I Need Her,” “Star Signs”).\n\nThe second half of <i>Solace & The Vices</i> finds Tiller showcasing the other side of his artistry. As he does across the majority of his discography, the singer-songwriter toes the line between singing and rapping; however, on <i>The Vices</i> he leans less into the moody trap-soul tracks that defined his career and launched him into superstardom. Instead, he dives deeper into the rap-heavy side of his musicality, delivering sharp flows and gritty, energetic bars over dynamic production from Charlie Heat, Gravez, Teddy Walton, and Hitmaka.\n\nTiller is unapologetic as he revels in his impulsive nature, waxing poetic as he brags about his lifestyle (“First Place,” “200 Bands,” “Make Life Easy”) while navigating the ups and downs of his situationships (“No Sharing,” “More Than Money,” “Last Call”), and even contemplates letting go of his player ways (“Burnout”). Tiller isn’t alone as he ventures through partying and romance. He gets some help from Bossman Dlow, Rick Ross, Plies, T-Pain, BabyDrill, Luh Tyler, and Bun B, who are along for the ride.\n\nOn the closing track “Finished,” Tiller addresses his naysayers and critics who doubt his ability to surpass his 2015 debut album <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. His resilience in the face of criticism is evident as he confidently asserts: “I’ll be done with this shit when I’m done/I ain’t lookin’ for the number one /Just money and the shit keep comin’/Kept goin’, can’t risk bein’ nothin’/Ain’t fallin’ off, bitch, you funny.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Soul","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"Solace & The

decade plus in the game and still “Finding Uncharted Journeys Inside.”","standard":"Adekunle Gold’s sixth album may be named after the improvisational Nigerian genre that emerged in the late 1960s, but it’s as much a reflection of Gold’s life as it is a full-throttle embrace of Yoruba oral music culture. “Fújì is just the sound of Lagos,” Gold tells Apple Music. “I grew up on fújì. I guess I should say thank you to my auntie, for constantly playing it when I was a child. It’s at every party, every event, they play it everywhere. It’s ingrained in me.” \n\nWith just over a decade of stardom under his belt, Lagos’ Adekunle Gold has lived many lives—and written even more hits. Since breaking out in 2014 with “Sade,” Gold has proven adept at pulling distinct strands from eras past to incorporate into his interpretation of Afrobeats. Early releases like “Orente” and “My Life”—propped up by their callbacks to genres such as jùjú and highlife—established Gold as a singer with a griot’s soul and sentimentalities. He’d broaden his reach with 2020’s <i>Afro Pop, Vol. 1</i>—which includes experiments in EDM and soca—but it is <i>Fuji</i> the singer points to, as a crystallization of his practice.\n\n“My album [title] started as an acronym,” says Gold. “Finding Uncharted Journeys Inside. But I’m already making fújì sounds; Since my first album <i>Gold</i>, I have a fújì-sounding song on every album. Even if I sing R&B, I sound fújì. So I might as well show the world this sound that I grew up on.” \n\nDeftly merging tradition and heritage, <i>Fuji</i> is built around a rich percussive base as the singer works his way through apala, fújì, and tungba influences. “Big Fish” plays as an out-of-body recounting of his come-up story and “Many People” embraces success, while “My Love Is the Same” and “Believe” emphasize familial and romantic love. In each instance, we get a tip of the hat to the storytelling techniques that make up the Yoruba oral music tradition. “I love my culture, I love my traditions and heritage,” Gold says. “I will always uphold it. I feel, as Africans, we all have a duty, an obligation to show our culture. I will never stop doing that.”","tagline":"New

years after Prodigy’s death, a Queensbridge rap legacy advances.","standard":"In hip-hop’s more than five-decade history, Queensbridge stands firmly as one of the genre’s foundational, load-bearing pillars. The same outer-borough NYC locale where MC Shan laid down the rap gauntlet with his seminal single “The Bridge” got reinforced further in the 1990s and 2000s by two more sons of the namesake housing development, Havoc and Prodigy. Their run as Mobb Deep hit its stride with 1995’s <i>The Infamous</i>, with the pair remaining a force to be reckoned with both lyrically and musically for another two decades. Were it not for Prodigy’s untimely and tragic passing in 2017, it stands to reason that they’d still be repping QB as a unit today, something the release of <i>Infinite</i> demonstrates. \n\nMore than a decade after their presumed swan song, the double-disc <i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i>, this posthumous collaboration not only honors the duo’s legacy but aims to advance what they cultivated as an enduring, relevant art form. With production duties divided between The Alchemist—Prodigy’s second-most-prolific co-conspirator—and Havoc himself, <i>Infinite</i> makes their case with beats and rhymes that feel downright timeless. Whether nodding to golden-age hip-hop heroics on “My Era,” cruising from the crib to the casino on “Taj Mahal,” or shrewdly menacing the opposition on “Gunfire,” their thematic bars seamlessly capture the rap veterans’ mindset. \n\nNostalgia certainly has its place here, and the appearances by Big Noyd on the grimy “The M. The O. The B. The B.” and Nas on the more celebratory “Pour the Henny” keep that classic Queensbridge presence in prominent view. Indeed, most of the features come from artists who were aligned with the Mobb in the <i>Infamous</i> days, with Wu-Tang Clan spitters Ghostface Killah and Raekwon reprising their “Right Back at You” roles on “Clear Black Nights.” Yet there’s also a genuine vibrancy here so rarely found on albums released in this particular fashion, the unmistakable interplay between the core duo enlivening moments like “Against the World” and “Score Points” and further imbued with that improbable reunion spirit via the Clipse collab “Look at Me.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Infinite","playParams":{"id":"1837337842","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/infinite/1837337842","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6vmyn1RL0oHkJhXM9hG7m3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837337842/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"77135","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/77135?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760068152551,"RTCI":0}}},"1837484943":{"id":"1837484943","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837484943?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"BIA","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bia/1112309486","artwork":{"bgColor":"c0cbd6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"170905","textColor2":"46281a","textColor3":"39302f","textColor4":"5e4940","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1c/e8/9a/1ce89ae9-1114-a144-772e-65dccb1e2f4d/196873549453.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Rap/R&B with bilingual flair defines the artist’s long-awaited debut.","standard":"As both a rapper and an R&B artist, BIA has spent more than a decade building up to the 2025 release of <i>BIANCA</i>.

Latin power-players Becky G and Young Miko amplify her bilingual might on “HARD WAY” and “BIRTHDAY BEHAVIOR,” respectively, while Southern rap stars Key Glock and Denzel Curry each match her lyrical energy on the booming pair “DADE” and “WE ON GO II,” the latter also featuring an especially animated A$AP Ferg.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"BIANCA","playParams":{"id":"1837484943","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bianca/1837484943","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7wmeALlMQDyo4HeNwf5EVV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837484943/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1112309486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1112309486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760081316489,"RTCI":0}}},"1837529320":{"id":"1837529320","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837529320?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mella","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mella/1732635704","artwork":{"bgColor":"dcd9b7","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060001","textColor2":"3a110e","textColor3":"312b25","textColor4":"5a3930","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f3/b5/90/f3b59082-a588-34cd-37a3-ccfb9793ba16/794558201131.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Or so I've been told...","playParams":{"id":"1837529320","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/or-so-ive-been-told/1837529320","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2rNHcCH7GxIzRevzrAxPAJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837529320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1732635704","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1732635704?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760070224383,"RTCI":0}}},"1837538635":{"id":"1837538635","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837538635?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dave East","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dave-east/451759978","artwork":{"bgColor":"555857","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3f6f6","textColor2":"edefee","textColor3":"d3d6d6","textColor4":"ced1cf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/62/e4/1062e404-2a39-cded-f75f-9d97569ecca1/199538693836.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d6d3d1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0d","textColor2":"151516","textColor3":"333334","textColor4":"3c3b3b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/bb/e4/42/bbe44287-230c-c925-e898-88ea9dc720a4/305ddc31-3b6c-466c-9da8-07767f8eef4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["East Coast Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Karma 4","playParams":{"id":"1837538635","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-15","trackCount":26,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/karma-4/1837538635"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837538635/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"451759978","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/451759978?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760091473039,"RTCI":0}}},"1837884933":{"id":"1837884933","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837884933?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ink","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ink/695840203","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1f28","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"efbc8d","textColor2":"ddb38e","textColor3":"c59d78","textColor4":"b7957a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c6/eb/da/c6ebda49-5516-c930-ef6f-123de286638c/25UM1IM36215.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The singer-songwriter blurs the lines between country, pop, and R&B.","standard":"Though relatively new to the scene as a solo artist, Ink has a résumé that would make even a seasoned veteran jealous.

Well, its success sparked the flame inside Taylor Swift that led to a reunion with former collaborators Max Martin and Shellback for her 12th full-length <i>The Life of a Showgirl</i>. Indeed, in a very showgirl manner, Swift flew back and forth to Sweden between stops on her European leg—remember, the singer-songwriter believes “jet lag is a choice”—to join Martin and Shellback, Swift’s co-writers and producers on some of the most memorable and popular hits of her career (“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “22,” “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” “Don’t Blame Me,” and “Delicate,” to name a few). The result? A confident, dazzling, at times elegant, at times cheeky, at times sensual pop explosion that examines Swift’s relationships and her fame, which is both deeply personal yet extremely relatable...mostly. (The struggles of “Elizabeth Taylor”—with its thumping rock vibes—can understandably be reserved for the uber-famous showgirls in the room.)\n\n“This album, by personality, was a funnier album,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “It was coming off of <i>TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</i>—the character attributes I was highlighting in that writing process were much more serious and sensitive and introspective, and oftentimes more earnest and stoic, and the characteristics of a poet. This one was like, showgirls are mischievous, fun, scandalous, sexy, fun, flirty, hilarious.” On the album’s first single “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift tests that theory by dipping back into the Shakespearean well that earned her crossover success and adoring fans, and once again, she turns the Bard’s tale into a romance rather than a tragedy. But this time, it’s more mature and fierce—as the acceptant heroine resigns herself to solitude before the hero ever comes around: “I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I/Right before you lit my sky up.”\n\nHer muses, of course, will be well-dissected. The aforementioned savior in “Ophelia” is most likely Swift’s husband-to-be, the three-time Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce. (She did, after all, announce the album on his podcast.) And he <i>probably</i> has a few more cuts dedicated to him—the most direct being the saucy, ’70s-funk-infused “Wood” and its “new heights of manhood” revelation. “When I met Travis, I started to feel a little bit like I could be like a person who could have romantic whims and have these dreams,” she says.\n\n“Actually Romantic,” with its semi-stripped-down production, deals not with a lover but with a certain hater. “You think I’m tacky, baby/Stop talking dirty to me/It sounded nasty but it feels like you’re flirting with me/I mind my business, God’s my witness that I don’t provoke it/It’s kind of making me wet,” Swift teases. And “Father Figure” pays homage to George Michael with Swift’s breathy vocals, ending with a menacing act of betrayal by a protégé: “You made a deal with this devil/Turns out my dick’s bigger/You want a fight, you found it/I got the place surrounded.”\n\nImportantly, though, remove Swift’s own personal inspirations and score-settling and you get what she does best: vibrant songs that speak to universal emotions through her storytelling. The buoyant “Opalite” shows two people finding each other at the right time; baroque-pop “Wi$h Li$t” portrays someone who knows what her heart desires. And “Eldest Daughter,” the famous track 5—generally one of Swift’s most vulnerable on each of her albums—reveals a promise of devotion.\n\nSwift ends the record on its title track, an epic duet with Sabrina Carpenter where the women volley back and forth about a girl named Kitty, perhaps alluding to their own places in the world. “And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the bitches who wish I’d hurry up and die/But I’m immortal now, baby dolls, I couldn’t if I tried,” Swift sings proudly. In other words, as she’s proven time and time again, she’ll never go out of style.\n\n“Making this was really something I’ve been wanting to do for my entire career, because I have always wanted to have fun in this type of way,” she says. “To have fun, to exhibit mischief and be flirty and fun and make jokes—that’s a huge part of my personality. Oftentimes, I get so serious, or I’m really known for a lot of my sad songs, my cathartic songs or breakup songs or whatever, because I love to write those things—but that’s not the place I’m in my life. So what I have left behind is something that really exhibits who I am in this moment.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"The Life of a

Nashville star makes his genre preference clear: “This is what it is.”","standard":"The Mississippi-born singer-songwriter dabbled in the sounds of heavy Southern rock on previous records like 2023’s <i>the mockingbird & THE CROW</i> and 2024’s <i>Quit!!</i>. But if you couldn’t tell from the title (or the fact that the word “country” appears seven times on the tracklist), the fourth album from HARDY is a country record—and don’t you forget it. As the hitmaker explained to Apple Music’s Ty Bentli, the title stems from comments he received over the years for his genre-bucking blend of country and rock. “In case you didn’t know what this is, this is what it is,” he says. “There’s a little bit of smartass in that, but it’s just part of who I am.”\n\nHARDY embraces his redneck roots on songs like “Bottomland,” an ode to his family’s deep history as outdoorsmen, and “Buck on the Wall,” inspired by a visit to his grandfather’s hunting cabin. (The latter first appeared on his May 2025 EP, titled—you guessed it—<i>COUNTRY!</i>.) On ERNEST duet “Bro Country,” the duo shrewdly comments on the genre’s evolution since HARDY cut his teeth in Nashville in the early 2010s. And on the title track, he rejects urban sprawl in favor of small-town simplicity: “If it was up to me, I’d make the whole damn country country.”\n\nJust past the exhortation of good old country livin’, a heavier theme lingers in the margins. “I know that if anybody listens to [the album] top-down, they’re going to think, ‘God, there’s a lot of songs about death,’” HARDY says. The fixation on mortality makes sense: While writing the album, he not only celebrated the birth of his first child but also lost his grandfather. Still, HARDY uses the potentially grim preoccupation as inspiration to live life to the fullest: “Let’s go to Paris, drink a beer on the roof/Hook up on some Ferris wheel and get matchin’ tattoos,” he sings on “Goodbye.” “It’s never a bad thing to remember that when you’re with the people that you love, one day you won’t be,” he explains. “You can channel that into a morbid thought, or you can channel that into a very positive mindset.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"COUNTRY!

In the wake of a major-label deal, her Grand Ole Opry debut, and her first headlining tour, the 25-year-old takes a moment on her second EP, <i>Anna</i>, to reconcile her inner child with her pop-country persona. (Anna Dasha Novotny is the singer’s full name.) Over pedal steel and fiddle on the reflective “Oh, Anna!,” she summons the nerve of her precocious younger self to deal with the pressures of her newfound fame. “Train,” a poignant acoustic ballad, depicts the slow transition from new girl in town to resident. Elsewhere are the wry, boot-stompin’ rhythms that the “California girl with a Southern heart” has become known for, like the smoky “Work on Me,” an ode to men with dirty hands and dirty minds.","tagline":"New

Aktive selects cuts we “can ride to, chill to, or get inspired by.”","standard":"“My goal is to give listeners something they can ride to, chill to, or get inspired by,” DJ Aktive says. “When people press play, I want them to feel like I’m taking them on a journey through the heart of R&B.” When asked to put together an exclusive mix for R&B Now, the West Philadelphia-hailing aficionado, who has spent time as official tour DJ for both Janet Jackson and Patti LaBelle, made sure to include voices like Mary J. Blige, Summer Walker, Jodeci, Chris Brown, and Mariah the Scientist: stars from multiple eras united in their ability to put feelings to melody. \n\n“I treat it like storytelling,” Aktive says. “I want every transition to feel smooth, intentional, and emotionally connected. I start by listening to what’s current—what’s moving the culture right now—but I also dig into the deeper cuts, the joints that might not be charting but still feel right.” From the alt vanguard to modern vets, straightforward to left-field, the tracks on the R&B Now DJ mix capture where R&B is now and point the way to where it’s going. Enjoy this set from DJ Aktive and check back for more one-of-a-kind mixes.\n","tagline":"New DJ Mix"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap","Hip-Hop"],"name":"R&B Now: Fall 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1841670935","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-02","trackCount":27,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/r-b-now-fall-2025-dj-mix/1841670935"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841670935/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"128538746","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/128538746?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760068869797,"RTCI":0}}},"1841759725":{"id":"1841759725","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841759725?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"03 Greedo","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/03-greedo/1083815092","artwork":{"bgColor":"0f0d0d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d4c4ad","textColor2":"c7baa4","textColor3":"ac9f8d","textColor4":"a29786","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bf/37/22/bf372271-9808-c10c-b6c9-6dadda424621/196873639628.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1e1e26","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"d5c2ae","textColor2":"d1a18e","textColor3":"b0a193","textColor4":"ad8779","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/78/19/89/781989dd-c2be-b9ce-ecf9-4b5af4daa7f2/Job90f86720-cd49-4af3-9c79-06b6a142f1e8-204688744-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399971945_2361891182-Time1759250529673.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"4b4031","gradient":{"color":"4b4031","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"cdc2b3","textColor3":"b1a092","textColor4":"a9a094","textGradient":["ffffff","cdc2b3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b9/d6/d5/b9d6d596-4b33-eb51-2788-7a77e30891c2/Job31793d7c-533e-4138-8a3d-5b59d489c08b-204688745-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399971946_2361891181-Time1759252478697.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Los Angeles rap phenom stays flexing after dark.","standard":"A contemporary fixture of Los Angeles hip-hop, 03 Greedo has spent the 12 months since 2024’s Detroit-infused <i>Hella Greedy</i> focused on shorter-form drops. While the idiosyncratic rap phenomenon’s triples-is-best approach on the preceding <i>Death Comes in 3’s</i> and <i>Crushing on Twin</i> provided his fans with instant gratification, the nine-track <i>Another Night Out</i> benefits from being a more substantial offering. With eclectic yet consistently booming beats by the likes of Cassius Jay on “Rubber Band Man” and Hit-Boy on “Somebody,” he shares a plethora of gratifyingly true-to-form flexes. Atlanta trap pioneer Zaytoven shares a minimalist, atmospheric instrumental for “Sea World Abu Dhabi,” over which Greedo’s melodic warble floats into the ether. Even as some of the producers here represent scenes other than his own, local guests Wallie the Sensei and WhoKid Woody help to keep this an LA affair.

Japanese-centric set that bridges the K-pop group’s past and future.","standard":"ITZY is a K-pop group that leaves no one behind. When member LIA returned from a year-long hiatus in mid-2024, the girl group rerecorded and rereleased many of the songs the other four members—YEJI, RYUJIN, Chaeryeong, and YUNA—had recorded without her for their EP <i>GOLD</i>. With 2025’s <i>Collector</i>—ITZY’s second Japanese album, following 2023’s <i>RINGO</i>—the quintet known for their performance charisma uses a similar strategy. The 10-track album includes “final versions” of “Algorhythm” and “No Biggie,” rerecorded in Japanese with Lia’s voice back in the mix. \n\n<i>Collector</i> also includes Japanese-language versions of ITZY’s Korean singles “GOLD,” “Imaginary Friend,” and “Girls Will Be Girls,” as well as five completely new tracks. The result is a Japanese-centric collection that bridges ITZY’s past and present, shortly following a JYP Entertainment contract renewal that solidified the group’s future. Lead single “ROCK & ROLL” is not really rock ’n’ roll at all; rather, the upbeat dance track uses the genre thematically to represent the subversive energy that has propelled the group to stardom. The confidence continues on the hype track “I. I. Know Me” before fading into something softer for the love song “Out of season.”\n","tagline":"New

five new tracks—the cherry on top of her intimate fifth album.","standard":"“I’ve been realizing that I really made the album that I needed to heal myself,” Kali Uchis tells Apple Music about <i>Sincerely,</i> perhaps her most liberating work yet. The Colombian American singer-songwriter’s catalog has never felt slight or frivolous, whether in English or in Spanish. Yet this full-length follow-up to her 2024 <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i> dyad presents as something truly unique, arriving roughly a decade after her promising EP debut <i>Por Vida</i>. \n\nThe majority of the songs here began simply as voice notes, fortuitously captured in inspired moments outside of the confines or pressures of a studio setting. “Messages would just feel like they were directly coming through me, and I just had to get them out,” she says. Given such natural creative origins, it should come as little surprise that the actual process behind the album eschewed industry norms altogether, favoring home recording and unconventional settings. And despite the demonstrated level of guest vocal talent at her fingertips, she opted out of features, too. “When you’re making emotional music, you have to actually dig into difficult subjects,” she says, marking a clear distinction between this piece and its star-powered predecessor.\n\nAs a result, <i>Sincerely,</i> feels disarmingly intimate for what is ostensibly a pop album, even one from as consistently adventurous an artist as Uchis. The evocative moments of opener “Heaven Is a Home…” and closer “ILYSMIH” speak on love in grand and sweeping gestures, the passing of her mother and the birth of her son making understandably profound impacts on the work. \n\nInfluences like Cocteau Twins and Fiona Apple can be felt in all that comes between those bookends. “There’s a lot of grief, but there’s a lot of joy,” she says, describing what seeps through the veil of “Silk Lingerie,” or the vamps of “Territorial.” Excess punctuation on titles like “Lose My Cool,” and “For: You” hint at the flowing prose of her lyrics as it contributes to an even greater whole. “I think it is a celebration of life in its own way,” she says, “in the sense of finding beauty in the pain and taking the good.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe

The list of names spanned genres, generations, and the globe: the Aussie pop icon Kylie Minogue, Swedish rap mystic Bladee, and K-pop supergroup SEVENTEEN were just a few. The artists were revealed as the featured guests on a sprawling, 22-track expansion of the British singer/producer’s second mixtape, <i>Fancy That</i>, which landed in May 2025 as her highest-charting album in her home country.\n\nHere, PinkPantheress adds two discs’ worth of high-end bonus versions to the original nine tracks, the first of which leans fully into cool, left-of-center pop, including a Spanish-language flip of “Illegal” from Brazilian reggaeton star Anitta and French electro-pop auteur Oklou’s dreamy reimagining of “Girl Like Me.” Disc two features remixes from a decade-spanning range of PinkPantheress’ dance-music favorites—from jungle revivalist Nia Archives to British house heroes Basement Jaxx, whose big-beat euphoria inspired several of <i>Fancy That</i>’s original

candidly with lust and loss across 16 tracks: “I wanted to be bold.”","standard":"Beginning to conceptualize his fourth album last year, Khalid thought deeply about what exactly it was that he wanted to say. But when a dramatic incident became a blessing in disguise, the 27-year-old singer-songwriter instantly knew his direction. “In the process of creating the album, I got outed and then immediately knew everything that I needed to say,” he told Hattie Collins, host of Apple Music’s Proud Radio. “It’s time to make that album for myself. It’s time to make the album that solidifies who I am—not only as an artist, but just as a person in this world.”\n\nOn the resulting record, <i>after the sun goes down</i>, the singer who’s been famous since blowing up as a teenager with his debut single, “Location,” and its follow-up, “Young Dumb & Broke,” finds himself fully in his element—passionate, unapologetic, and more confident than ever. Across 16 tracks, Khalid grapples candidly with lust and loss, yearning over hyperpop on “whenever you’re gone” and channeling Craig David on “in plain sight,” a UK garage-inspired meditation on infidelity. He’s joined by an all-star roster of collaborators, sharing writing credits with Tove Lo and Julia Michaels and recruiting legendary producer Darkchild for “out of body,” a hedonistic club jam straight out of 2001. Although the sweetest cameo comes from Khalid’s mom, who sings backup on “hurt people.”\n\nHis aim, as he tells Apple Music, is to be fearless in returning the love he’s received over the past year. “I feel like the queer community has embraced me so much, and with love unconditionally,” he says. “I have to give that back to the world, because it’s a huge part of me. It’s who I am. And I feel like I’ve played it safe so many times in my life that this time, I felt like I wanted to be bold.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"after the sun goes down","playParams":{"id":"1844394976","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/after-the-sun-goes-down/1844394976","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3e9xFKdGt0oS5O4fMubFT5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844394976/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"82842423","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/82842423?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760091760597,"RTCI":0}}},"1844469917":{"id":"1844469917","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844469917?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HoneyLuv","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/honeyluv/1564761965","artwork":{"bgColor":"daf5e4","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0e0d0e","textColor2":"262726","textColor3":"373c39","textColor4":"4a504c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dd/c1/e1/ddc1e11f-786a-761e-0e3d-ffdbe3cfa1b9/2f0eb6a3-b2c5-4220-bb60-8e40dd76f25e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"eff5f5","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"393b3b","textColor4":"323d38","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/74/df/e1/74dfe116-b237-276d-9f24-a8274b3fc2d3/39355bf8-c40b-46d8-a813-df5b967a69d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"eff5f5","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"303d37","textColor4":"323e39","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/51/06/1c/51061c32-e9a3-a554-ea30-27a1c67d3538/4ffba60a-d567-4307-97aa-4cbc764c298c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"edf4f1","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3b3d3c","textColor4":"505953","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/e2/10/0fe21083-cc06-e86b-8608-4184e28221e5/584c6ad7-7224-47ff-9d42-e4cb6c73a402.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"ebf4f0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"323433","textColor4":"545555","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/e9/d5/ebe9d537-d544-52c5-75db-89a9d339fd86/d448e12a-b270-425b-8be2-5e73bb16181f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"cad0ce","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"313332","textColor4":"494c4b","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f2/d0/50/f2d05038-9f97-e1a7-5698-15eb0ea24ffb/f858e36d-83a0-4221-8202-b7ec43ddef24.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"d5dcd9","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3e403f","textColor4":"505150","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8e/b0/2d/8eb02df2-8d04-b607-f86a-f4b6e06db7f4/88f0e1a4-00c1-4b4a-8758-9c163dacee67.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The LA DJ mixes chugging house and techno for your next run.","standard":"“Music is the heartbeat of my workout,” LA’s HoneyLuv tells Apple Music of her Fitness Mix. “The right track at the right time can either push me through when I want to quit or help me slow down and reconnect with my breath.
