On <i>And Your Song Is Like a Circle</i>, the songs sink in like a scalp massage; there’s no physical crushing here. Ballentine’s second album, though, isn’t as light as some of the instrumentals suggest: Inspired by filmmakers like David Lynch and Hayao Miyazaki, Ballentine examines the nature of the human experience—the duality of feeling infinitely alive while knowing that sensation is fleeting. The concept is also reflected in the album title and the riverlike way these songs flow into one another. “Living” features Ballentine’s voice floating disparately against layers of harmonies and abstract synths, before a simple drum groove gives the song forward direction. It eventually concludes right back where it began, though, completing the circle.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"And Your Song is Like a Circle","playParams":{"id":"1800019489","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/and-your-song-is-like-a-circle/1800019489","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/62MKnX9dinEbi3Zz9w6rx8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800019489/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1515772298","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1515772298?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760620112519,"RTCI":0}}},"1812083263":{"id":"1812083263","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812083263?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cusp","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cusp/1610154872","artwork":{"bgColor":"644e6d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f4f2f7","textColor2":"fdb4b1","textColor3":"d7d1db","textColor4":"dea0a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e6/95/ac/e695ac37-8f35-5245-203e-58aa793243d5/114561.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"What I Want Doesn't Want Me Back","playParams":{"id":"1812083263","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-i-want-doesnt-want-me-back/1812083263","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6bhygo9qIjGSsL36biMRXS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812083263/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1610154872","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1610154872?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760650061801,"RTCI":0}}},"1813492890":{"id":"1813492890","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813492890?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Barr Brothers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-barr-brothers/457103843","artwork":{"bgColor":"ede2dc","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"09080b","textColor2":"08090a","textColor3":"373435","textColor4":"363534","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bb/e4/fc/bbe4fcd9-83cc-ba36-c406-b3465141c585/908.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"181516","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e5d2c7","textColor2":"d1bbb3","textColor3":"bcaca4","textColor4":"ac9a94","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/5c/0b/305c0b0c-42d5-58e5-f533-dfe2c3e4e3d8/a8c8d558-0536-4ed2-94a0-17b06f1e4bf6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A fourth album of tender, folksy meditations from the Montreal combo.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Folk"],"name":"Let it Hiss","playParams":{"id":"1813492890","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-hiss/1813492890","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4OVKItCszlDzVX0g1hgGYQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813492890/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"457103843","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/457103843?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760715691930,"RTCI":0}}},"1815927528":{"id":"1815927528","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815927528?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Perturbator","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/perturbator/548930485","artwork":{"bgColor":"14426a","hasP3":false,"height":1440,"textColor1":"c1dbfb","textColor2":"5fa8f1","textColor3":"9fbcde","textColor4":"5094d6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/93/66/ce/9366cee6-ec09-c435-2a76-3d4474eef8a6/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1440},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"818c99","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b090a","textColor2":"1a1a1d","textColor3":"232327","textColor4":"2f3135","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d1/e6/37/d1e6376a-0653-7ab6-8d32-f19101f09ec1/af79c0b6-1347-4514-82c0-76f78d3f9af2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"James Kent’s sixth album is a dark, dancy exploration of modern society.","standard":"Gothic shades abound on Perturbator’s sixth album.

East Atlanta trap pioneer gets real about his road to redemption.","standard":"It would have been impossible to predict what would come next when Gucci Mane released his debut album <i>Trap House</i> in 2005, leading this century’s most influential hip-hop subgenre and skyrocketing the East Atlanta rapper to stardom. But since his release from prison in 2016, the trap pioneer has been transparent about the mental health struggles that informed the ups and downs of his 20-year career. Released, as per tradition, on 10/17 (which Atlanta officially declared “Gucci Mane Day” in 2023), Gucci’s 17th solo album is accompanied by his second book, <i>Episodes: The Diary of a Recovering Mad Man</i>, in which he gets real about his long road to redemption. “I done did all types of stupid shit,” he admits frankly on “Episodes Intro,” summing up his early-career legal drama in a nutshell. Much has changed for the trap icon, but some things stay the same: on “Back Cooking,” he reunites with longtime collaborator OJ da Juiceman for that vintage Guwop feeling.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Episodes","playParams":{"id":"1821113644","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":23,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/episodes/1821113644","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1ilQqLfaXbyZB7sldz26Ox"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821113644/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"62374520","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/62374520?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760717509814,"RTCI":0}}},"1821959132":{"id":"1821959132","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821959132?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Militarie Gun","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/militarie-gun/1529039426","artwork":{"bgColor":"5e5e5e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fafafa","textColor2":"f5f5f5","textColor3":"dbdbdb","textColor4":"d7d7d7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/27/1f/58/271f58a5-642d-7505-6a8c-96ce06d79d37/25CRGIM50276.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"5b585b","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"fbf8fc","textColor2":"f3eff4","textColor3":"dbd8dc","textColor4":"d4d1d5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/10/aa/c4/10aac450-165e-3f3c-3022-4c8433c2b49f/Job4911b162-206b-4c32-893c-772e03e0a251-199867368-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391227433_2288730583-Time1754934625278.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"383738","gradient":{"color":"383738","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"121212","textColor3":"1b1a1b","textColor4":"272727","textGradient":["ffffff","121212"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9e/22/f9/9e22f95a-1e72-c16e-2566-45dec5a22527/Job6ae6dbf9-90ad-444e-81ba-a2eb99edf251-199867367-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_391227434_2288730584-Time1754932783624.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"afb5c1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"090e11","textColor2":"091a38","textColor3":"2a2f35","textColor4":"2a3953","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/db/09/96/db0996e1-d150-baa6-efec-0423e0777f4e/7fe46f27-eb8d-4c67-86df-0e25699bb43d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"God Save The Gun","playParams":{"id":"1821959132","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/god-save-the-gun/1821959132","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/13YF2Z1aV8lMzx4zSw4h75"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821959132/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1529039426","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1529039426?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760670184067,"RTCI":0}}},"1822009053":{"id":"1822009053","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822009053?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chris Young","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-young/4779205","artwork":{"bgColor":"b9a383","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070400","textColor2":"221b13","textColor3":"2b231a","textColor4":"40362a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/10/61/17/10611796-84b5-e840-6b49-f0e0a078d9f2/199350844225.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"24211d","gradient":{"color":"24211d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fca543","textColor3":"ba9b69","textColor4":"ce8738","textGradient":["ffffff","fca543"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/45/69/34/456934b6-4f6b-fb63-94ea-497ba47a28ed/Jobf61a75df-e527-4712-9902-d4bf30d00f12-197499770-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386688271_2251758651-Time1752566487318.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"24211d","gradient":{"color":"24211d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f69231","textColor3":"cc9b78","textColor4":"c87829","textGradient":["ffffff","f69231"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/91/76/12/917612ab-56c5-d971-85c6-079b834bc90a/Jobf1533b2f-d848-45a0-beac-5c009e2a76b8-197499769-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386688272_2251758652-Time1752565504333.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chris Young: “I want you having a good time listening to this record.”","standard":"Ten albums into his career, Chris Young wants to make one thing clear: He isn’t going anywhere. The Middle Tennessee-born singer-songwriter says as much in the title of this collection, which marks his first release with label partner Black River Entertainment and follows 2024’s <i>Young Love & Saturday Nights</i>.\n\nYoung tells Apple Music that he wanted <i>I Didn’t Come Here to Leave</i> to be a dynamic listening experience from start to finish, which led him to assemble 14 tracks—most written himself, and some from outside collaborators—with a mix of styles, like the elastic twang of opener “Some Around Here” and the swampy Southern rock of “I Feel a Cold One Coming On.” Other highlights include two emotional tracks dedicated to Young’s parents: “Just Keep Living,” in honor of his father’s successful battle against cancer, and “Jesus, Momma, Country Radio,” which pays loving tribute to his mother and a simple country lifestyle.\n\n“Right out of the box, I want you having a good time listening to this record,” he says. “And it goes a lot of places, obviously. There’s breakup songs, there’s meaningful songs, there’s love songs, there’s all of those things in there.” Below, Young shares insight into several key tracks. \n\n<b>“I Didn’t Come Here to Leave”</b>\n“I liked the sentiment of like, ‘Hey, I’ve still got a bunch of stuff that I want to say even after this, my 10th album.’ So, I like the idea of that and also just that this is something that you’re going to crank and roll your windows down.”\n\n<b>“Good as Yours”</b>\n“When we were writing this, actually, Trannie Anderson, who’s written a bunch of stuff for Lainey Wilson and is more of a piano player than I am, had this piano lick. She had that when she came in that day, and I’m like, ‘OK, literally stop. Play it on the piano so I can memorize it because that is great and that’s exactly what we’re writing.’”\n\n<b>“I Feel a Cold One Coming On”</b>\n“That was a song that I’ve had for a while now. I actually tracked that before in the studio and then recut it with this band because the band for the entire record is the same guys all the way down. It’s been a long time since I’ve been able to do that, and a couple of guys had to sub some sessions to be there for the second time that we cut a batch of songs. But I do think that was something that was really important to me for this project.”\n\n<b>“Til the Last One Dies”</b>\n“Obviously, it’s the first single off the record, but it’s one of my favorite songs on here, and one of the few that I did not have a hand in writing—I just found this song. And I’m so lucky that I found it before anybody else because I think it is just an incredible, incredible love song. Again, I don’t want to be greedy, so, if you’re getting married this year, not even 100 percent of everyone should use this as their wedding song—just 99 percent of people.”\n\n<b>“Boots on the Ground”</b>\n“When we started writing this, I was down in Florida on a writer’s retreat with a couple of my buddies, and I was like, ‘This is either going to be a great idea or a really crappy idea, but I’m going to write the chorus as if this is a line dance.’ It’s specifically made to be that. And I did, and then we made one.”\n\n<b>“Just Keep Living”</b>\n“This is about my dad. I wrote this about my dad’s battle with cancer. And he beat it—kicked its ass, and he is still hanging. He’s had two heart attacks. This guy is just like, ‘That wall over there, I’m just going to walk through it.’ Old country guy, Dale Earnhardt mustache. I love my dad, and I actually had to call him because this was so personal. I was like, ‘Are you sure you’re OK with me putting all this out there into the world?’ And he said, ‘Yeah.’”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"I Didn't Come Here To Leave","playParams":{"id":"1822009053","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-didnt-come-here-to-leave/1822009053","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1OnI72xhWUPmOmUeh6BInY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822009053/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4779205","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4779205?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760712693616,"RTCI":0}}},"1822326118":{"id":"1822326118","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822326118?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Biohazard","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/biohazard/192082","artwork":{"bgColor":"131110","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cca547","textColor2":"df8231","textColor3":"a7873c","textColor4":"b66b2a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/35/3f/c1/353fc1bf-be70-c9cb-5c56-fd1f27d6277c/199350999581.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f3d9c3","textColor2":"f2beab","textColor3":"c6b19f","textColor4":"c59b8c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/41/14/6e/41146ebe-f6d9-f79a-6efe-a6401b19f60c/a13b590d-b121-4560-82a6-6631c215fac0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The band’s first album in 13 years reunites their classic lineup.","standard":"Biohazard’s first album in 13 years features the reunion of their classic lineup: guitarist Billy Graziadei, vocalist/bassist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Danny Schuler.

It was all coming from us, what was inspiring us and what made us excited in the studio.”\n\nAfter the huge buzz (and BRIT Awards) that followed their debut album, 2024’s <i>Prelude to Ecstasy</i>, the band found the follow-up came surprisingly easily. Combining heavy themes and postmortems on past relationships with imagery involving nature, fire, and farming implements, the five-piece still manage to make their lyrics wry and cheeky. “This Is the Killer Speaking” takes them into murder ballad territory, while “Inferno” finds them watching <i>The Real Housewives</i> as a way of dealing with their meteoric rise.\n\n“The record feels simultaneously a lot darker, more serious, and aware of the state of the world,” says Morris. “Also, I think it’s tongue-in-cheek sometimes and a bit wry, which is the way we approach the world: having that balance of absurdity and deep emotion.”\n\nIn early 2025, TLDP teamed up with Grammy-winning producer Markus Dravs. “We admired so much of his previous work,” says bassist Georgia Davies. “He’s worked with Florence, Wolf Alice, and Björk and we were like, ‘Tick, tick, tick.’ We didn’t have all the songs fully written like we did with the first album. There were seeds of ideas and skeletons of songs that we built up all together as we were going along, which was a different process. It was really fun as well.”\n\nThe last step was to name the album, which happened over dinner and sake in Japan. “Having a really evocative title like that is important,” says Morris. “I love the word ‘pyre.’ It’s so medieval. The record’s meant to be a dark <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> [Chaucer’s Middle English pilgrimage collection].” Read on as Morris and Davies take you through <i>From the Pyre</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Agnus Dei”</b>\nAbigail Morris: “I wrote this in three parts because I had a crush on someone and was imagining being with them. We actually got together, and then I wrote some of it about that, and when we broke up, I finished it. Lyrically, it’s a nice way to set up the record because a lot of the songs are discussing relationships. It’s about the nature of being a musician and having a romantic life, writing about people you date and how you mythologize the other person and make them immortal by turning them into a character in the song. Sometimes you write about someone you only met once or sometimes it’s a relationship. I think it’s just the way we communicate if you choose to date only musicians.”\n\n<b>“Count the Ways”</b>\nGeorgia Davies: “This was an old song. We were trying to work on it for the first album, so we had the genesis, but took it down a thousand different roads. All of them were dead ends. So we revived her for the second album. We were in America and listening to Arctic Monkeys, and we were like, ‘Oh, it should sound like <i>AM</i>.’ So I wrote the intro and the bass guitar line that runs throughout the song. It’s very fun to play, and I feel like people will sing along to it. Then it built up, and we added this choir outro with crazy strings.”\n\n<b>“Second Best”</b>\nAM: “This came from Emily [Roberts, guitarist] because of a relationship that she went through. That was a really interesting song lyrically because Emily started it and she wrote the choruses. Then, she took it to Lizzie [Mayland, guitarist] and Lizzie wrote the intro, and then I wrote the verses. So it was a committee song, which we’ve never done before. Emily was like, ‘This is what the song’s about. Interpret that.’ It’s about feeling inferior and betrayed and frustrated at being let down by someone you love and feeling you’re not their priority. It was a creative writing exercise.”\n\n<b>“This Is the Killer Speaking”</b>\nAM: “I was upset, confused, and angry after being ghosted for the first time, so I decided that the way to process it was to write a character song and make it funny. Originally, I wrote it just for myself as a joke. I was listening to a lot of Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Nick Cave and thinking, ‘I want to write a song like that.’ I think it was easy to make light of it instead of getting angry because, obviously, I don’t want to murder anyone.”\nGD: “This was also the song I think that helped us realize the concept of the album. It’s so character driven and we were thinking about how it sat and what connected this cowboy murder ballad to songs like ‘Agnus Dei’ and ‘Inferno.’ Using the lens of this song helped us to figure out what the whole album was about.”\n\n<b>“Rifle”</b>\nGD: “Lizzie wrote the lyrics for this one, and I think that it’s both metaphorical and quite literal because it’s talking about warmongering in general. Obviously, looking at it now, it’s quite clearly about the genocide in Palestine, but it’s also about how it would feel to know and love someone who went on to wage war and the devastation and anger that would cause to a mother. The whole song is quite angry in the choruses, but I think that clouds over this deep sadness and devastation. When the French section in the middle occurs, it feels like a parting of clouds temporarily for this personal address to one another, which is in the two-part harmony.”\n\n<b>“Woman Is a Tree”</b>\nAM: “This was another one that came from a place of wanting to do something specific with a song in the same way that ‘Killer’ was a murder ballad, but I wanted to write a folk song about womanhood, female friendships, and how men factor into your circle. I was drawn to this classic metaphor that a lot of folk stories and myths use, which is conflating women in nature. I feel like there’s such a rich well of imagery to draw on, and I wanted to write something more atmospheric. Not about one specific thing, but more of a mood of relating my perception of femininity to my perception of nature.”\n\n<b>“I Hold Your Anger”</b>\nAM: “Aurora [Nishevci, keyboards] wrote this song late in the process, and we were like, ‘That has to be on the record.’ We’re all in our mid-to-late-twenties, and this is the time when you start thinking about motherhood, family, and what you want from your life and feel intimidated and frightened. If you want children you have to decide, ‘So do I want to do an album or to have a baby?’ I can’t imagine trying to do both at the same time.”\nGD: “I think that Aurora saw her own parents make so many sacrifices for her. It’s about the expectation as well as the anxiety of ‘Am I capable of being this selfless to give my entire being to another person? What is the expectation of a mother?’”\n\n<b>“Sail Away”</b>\nAM: “I wrote this with my boyfriend at the time, maybe four years ago. We had the chorus and lyrics, and, at that time, it wasn’t about our breakup. Then, I started trying to write the verse lyrics when we were still together and nothing really was sticking. I got custody of the song, so when we broke up, I was able to write the verse. The processing of the breakup was tumultuous, so this is me trying to distill every good thing about the relationship into one song. Even if relationships end badly, it’s nice to be able to recognize the good moments. It’s the same person I wrote ‘Nothing Matters’ about, so it’s like this is the circle on the next record. We were in a car and now we’re on a boat.”\n\n<b>“The Scythe”</b>\nAM: “I wrote the chorus as part of another song when I was a teenager, and it wasn’t really about anything, because at that age I hadn’t been in a relationship. I found it a few years ago and started writing on top of it with more experience of love, then I realized that I was actually writing about grief. The nature of grief is it takes years and years to realize what’s going on and how deeply it’s affected you. My father passed away when I was 17, and now I’m 25 and still figuring out how to talk about that loss. When I was writing a song about a normal breakup, I realized that I was also writing half from the perspective of me and half from the perspective of my mother.”\nGD: “I think one of the beautiful things as a result of putting the song out is all of our comment sections on Instagram and YouTube become these places where people come to share their own stories of grief and the way that they respond to it, how it makes them feel held and comforted to hear this beautiful perspective on grief.”\n\n<b>“Inferno”</b>\nAM: “‘Inferno’ is my favorite song on the record because it’s the last one I wrote. So it feels the most up-to-date with where I am as a person. I wrote it on a break from touring in Paris—I was walking around and there was an art gallery with a crucifix hanging in the window. It looked so weird and out of place in this really brightly lit, white gallery. The song’s about being in the band and the swirling chaos of how it felt to come up over the last 18 months. There’s a reference to <i>The Real Housewives</i> because if we weren’t going out, Georgia and I would sit in our hotel room shellshocked and watch it in silence.”","tagline":"New Album and

artist’s heartfelt album bridges R&B and alt-pop with a voice to savor.","standard":"Ruel Vincent van Dijk found himself overflowing with ideas following his 2023 debut album, <i>4TH WALL</i>. In fact, the artist best known by his first name had amassed around 200 songs before embarking upon a culling process that reduced that epic slate to just 11. The remaining tracks include team-ups with some top industry names, including repeat collaborator M-Phazes and many new creative partners. Dan Wilson and Leroy Clampitt helmed and co-wrote “Wild Guess,” a snappy ode to asserting post-breakup independence. Wilson also co-penned “Destroyer,” a painfully acute account of betrayal produced by Kenny Beats. Since his first album, van Dijk has changed labels and relocated from Sydney to Los Angeles, embarking on a fresh chapter while still in his early twenties. And despite the lovelorn themes of the aforementioned songs, there’s a lot of upbeat romantic promise elsewhere. With its dreamy high notes and suave R&B turns, the opening “Only Ever” is a convincing plea for commitment. Echoing some of the same 1980s-style production, “The Suburbs” hits big pop notes on the way to fantasizing away about a shared life spent away from the hectic pace of the city. It would be easy for van Dijk’s supple, persuasive vocal delivery to steal the show here, but he backs it up with songwriting and arrangements that feel at once striking and streamlined.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Kicking My

(drummer Les Priest departed the band before the release of 2023’s <i>A Beautiful Blur</i>) while exploring new facets of their sumptuous and straightforwardly romantic sound. There’s still plenty here that will be recognizable to longtime listeners—the warm, Blue Nile-recalling saxophone line on the opening title track, the seductive and soft-lit pomp of “Know You Naked”—but with the aid of HAIM and The 1975 collaborator Tommy King on production duties, Paul Klein and Jake Goss are clearly taking pleasure in coloring outside their defined lines on <i>Soft</i>. The ascending-chord synth-pop of “Make Me Forget” is a dead ringer for CHVRCHES’ own neon dreams, while the lushness of ’90s R&B is evoked on “Good Parts” and the glistening keys on closing track “Last Forever.” “Am I too old to act my age?” Klein ruminates on the reflective “Act My Age,” but <i>Soft</i> is proof that LANY continues to mature gracefully in the pop landscape.","tagline":"New

Icelandic band seeks connection: “It’s a thing we were craving a bit.”","standard":"Six years after Of Monsters and Men’s previous full-length, the Icelandic rockers return with sprawling soundscapes and lush imagery to tackle questions about life, loneliness, longing, and belonging, their atmospheric folk-rock—at times grand, at times intimate—on full display. <i>All is Love and Pain in the Mouse Parade</i> takes its name from “Mouse Parade,” a haunting reflection of collective experience. “That song is a little bit of an odd one out,” lead singer Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir tells Apple Music. “It tells the story of these mice in a vacant house that sounds pretty fantastical.”\n\nThe album also dives poetically into the spectrum of emotions stemming from connecting with others: anxiety (“What a stunt I pulled/The thoughts, they smash against my skull,” Hilmarsdóttir sings on “The Actor”); insecurity (“Sticky from the brine/I thought I’d gone bad/You thought I was fine,” co-vocalist Ragnar Þórhallsson leads on “Tuna in a Can”); and yearning (“I wish I could run to your house/When it gets dark out,” the pair sing on “Ordinary Creature”). “The sense of community, which is kind of sprinkled all over this album,” Hilmarsdóttir says, “it’s a thing that we were really looking deeply at, and I think craving a little bit.”","tagline":"New

(See “It Girl,” a decaying folk song about rejecting the allure of external validation.) On <i>Smoochies</i>, she recruits a crack team of weirdo-pop producers (longtime collaborator Slinger, plus Elvira Anderfjärd, Luka Kloser, and Tove Burman, who wrote and produced Addison Rae’s 2025 debut) for sweet, tough, and distinctly modern love songs. “I want you in my body like microplastics,” she sings on “Microplastics,” and on “Trinket,” she collects boys like Labubus and dangles them from her purse. On “Smoochie Girl,” she wonders over glitchy sugar-rush synths: “Is this too much to keep a lock of your hair in a resin ring? Is this too much?

Mark’s second studio album, <i>Pretty Idea</i>, is just as sonically freewheeling, though the focus here is love: new love, past love, self-love. Her head’s in the clouds on sultry neo-soul numbers like “Sweet Serotonin,” which Mark debuted live in London, opening for Sabrina Carpenter in July 2025. \n\nOn “By the End of the Night,” she’s drenched in glitter for a night out with her friends, having forgotten all about a bad-news ex: “Crazy how it used to be so hard/To get over a mess like you.” (Both songs were co-produced by Julian Bunetta, who’s worked with pop It girls like Carpenter and Gracie Abrams.) Elsewhere, Mark’s tastes are as unbridled as ever, interpolating an USHER and Alicia Keys classic (“My Boo”) on “Too Much,” recruiting Anderson .Paak for the buoyant “Don’t Remind Me,” and melding alt-country with neo-soul on the wistful “Cherry Reds.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Pretty Idea","playParams":{"id":"1833155470","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pretty-idea/1833155470","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5OKVgysqIZvSUMVdEmilCu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833155470/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1099249070","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1099249070?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760629703385,"RTCI":0}}},"1833559145":{"id":"1833559145","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833559145?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"All Time Low","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/all-time-low/167375968","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"541e1a","textColor2":"621511","textColor3":"764b48","textColor4":"814340","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/81/18/f2/8118f2a8-adf5-9621-e603-3f8893d2b3ae/604675475929_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"7f9298","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0a09","textColor2":"13110e","textColor3":"222526","textColor4":"292a29","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/58/3d/7b/583d7bef-71b9-ee9f-38b7-9db9d7ef90e4/1179ed4a-a808-42af-a366-ff8501d87bf4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Two decades in, the pop-punk band still sound invigorated.","standard":"<i>Everyone’s Talking!</i> begins with a breaking of the fourth wall: “[cold open]” goes behind the scenes, with vocalist Alex Gaskarth explaining the narratives that animate an album cycle. “A few years of trauma and magic tied up with a string and a bow,” he sings. Despite this snide look at the industry at large, over 20 years into their career, All Time Low sounds as fresh and invigorated as when they broke through in the early 2000s. “SUCKERPUNCH” is a swaggering, strutting, alt-rock cut with crunching drum breaks and a surprisingly funky pre-chorus. On “Sugar,” the band teams up with singer JoJo for the most unexpectedly successful crossover collab of the year, an anthemic cut worthy of her talent for pop songwriting. Though the stories that unfold aren’t as neat as Gaskarth advertises on “[cold open],” they still go down as smoothly as ever.","tagline":"New

Lang: “These are pieces that challenge young pianists to grow.”","standard":"Whatever their creative field, any world-class artist worth their salt feels the weight of responsibility in passing knowledge and skills to the next generation. Lang Lang, arguably the most famous pianist in the world, has devoted much of his career to “paying it forward” through a variety of activities, including the Lang Lang International Music Foundation and his Piano Academy series of music tutorials. And, in 2019, Lang Lang’s <i>Piano Book</i>, an album of piano pieces, all performed by the pianist himself, designed to inspire beginners in their quest to discover exciting repertoire. <i>Piano Book 2</i> builds on its success, with pieces designed to take students to the next level. “With the first <i>Piano Book</i>, I wanted to encourage beginners and show that even the simplest pieces can have beauty,” Lang Lang tells Apple Music Classical. “This time, I wanted to take a step further with pieces that are still accessible, but that challenge young pianists to grow. It’s about the next stage of discovery, when you start to realize how much color and character you can bring out of the piano.”\n\n<i>Piano Book 2</i> features a kaleidoscopic range of repertoire. First, there are plenty of well-loved classics, ranging from Chopin, Mendelssohn, and Mozart to Satie, Rachmaninoff, and Liszt, including the latter’s <i>Consolation No. 2</i>. The <i>Consolation</i>, suggests Lang Lang, is a great example of a piece that’s both fairly accessible to many early-stage pianists, and a piece that packs huge emotional power. “On the surface, it looks simple—the notes lie quite comfortably under the hands,” he says, “but the challenge is in the sound. It’s all about voicing, about creating a singing tone, about timing the rubato so that it feels natural. Every phrase has to feel like breathing. That’s much more difficult than playing big virtuosic runs.”\n\nThat’s also true with pieces such as Satie’s <i>Gymnopédie No. 1</i>, Chopin’s Nocturne No. 2 or Debussy’s Arabesque No. 1 which should all, in Lang Lang’s view, be more widely performed by today’s concert pianists. “A piece doesn’t have to be technically difficult to be profound,” he says. He refers to the great Vladimir Horowitz who often used to play Schumann’s “Träumerei” as an encore instead of something flashy and virtuosic. “Horowitz was right—‘Träumerei’ or a simple piece by Bach can move people to tears. Sometimes, these so-called ‘easy’ works carry the deepest emotions.”\n\n<i>Piano Book 2</i>, however, is much more than a well-curated collection of classical favorites. There are also brilliant arrangements of beautiful film soundtracks, among them Ennio Morricone’s yearningly nostalgic central theme from <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>, and Yann Tiersen’s quirky “Comptine d’un autre été” from 2001’s <i>Amélie</i>. And there’s video game music, too, in the form of Yu-Peng Chen’s magical “Lover’s Oath” from <i>Genshin Impact</i> and the now much-performed “To Zanarkand” from Nobuo Uematsu’s music for the 2001 <i>Final Fantasy X</i>. \n\nYou’ll also encounter one or two popular contemporary solo works that Lang Lang’s piano pupils have recently shared with him. Joe Hisaishi’s <i>Spring</i> and Tony Ann’s <i>ICARUS</i> are two pieces that Lang Lang is keen to pass on. “The standard repertoire is beautiful, of course, but music is a living art form,” he adds. “When students play contemporary works, they realize that composers are still writing for them today. It opens their ears to new sounds, rhythms, harmonies. And it also makes the old masters feel fresher, because you hear them in contrast.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano","Solo Instrumental"],"name":"Piano Book 2","playParams":{"id":"1834399557","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":32,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/piano-book-2/1834399557","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0FOJ6DuCnJJFrchU8xT8Vx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834399557/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5519614","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5519614?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760671232861,"RTCI":0}}},"1834730090":{"id":"1834730090","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834730090?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Abadir","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/abadir/1117107986","artwork":{"bgColor":"26140e","hasP3":false,"height":4096,"textColor1":"d3c6c7","textColor2":"d2bcb1","textColor3":"b1a2a2","textColor4":"af9a90","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/94/7c/a7/947ca7df-d456-1d5b-998d-68e22b83258f/5056688851323.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4096},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Kitbashing","playParams":{"id":"1834730090","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-15","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kitbashing/1834730090","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Bu8HI3qmYH10Z80XD6k34"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834730090/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1117107986","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1117107986?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760716671553,"RTCI":0}}},"1834953646":{"id":"1834953646","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834953646?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Heavy//Hitter","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/heavy-hitter/1469761697","artwork":{"bgColor":"3c3c3c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3f3f3","textColor2":"e9e9e9","textColor3":"cecece","textColor4":"c7c7c7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d0/95/50/d0955053-5e29-6221-97f1-b31a4ef4dcd1/199538622492.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"060706","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dddace","textColor2":"c9c7bb","textColor3":"b2b0a6","textColor4":"a2a197","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/74/ef/03/74ef0351-5d43-2235-993f-6a38272a0c6f/e00abb56-0062-413a-8e98-e0fb9b2a6a20.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Coming to Terms -

Throughout his zigzagging career, Parker has played the role of headband-sporting hard rocker, cinematic psychedelic architect, indie-R&B crossover king, Diana Ross’ <i>Minions</i> soundtrack dance partner, and Dua Lipa’s go-to studio Houdini, but each pivot has only reinforced his reputation as alt-pop’s premier purveyor of hazy-headed dream-state vibes. \n\nWhile Tame Impala’s fifth album <i>Deadbeat</i> initially took shape thousands of miles away from his studio in Perth, it nonetheless represents something of a full-circle move for Parker, embracing the coastal environment, isolationist methodology, and liberating blank-slate ethos that spawned his earliest forays into recording. “The album officially started in Montecito,” explains Parker, who decamped to the Californian coast with his wife and toddlers in tow. “My thing is I get an Airbnb somewhere on the coast—I just find places literally as close to the water as you can get. Staring at the ocean for me just helps me get lost, and there’s a tranquility that comes along with it.” And from that oceanic inspiration, Parker was reminded of an essential truth: The beach is a great place to hold a rave. \n\nParker has, of course, been incorporating electronic textures into his work since 2015’s <i>Currents</i>, albeit in a manner that still adapted easily to Tame Impala’s arena-rocking live spectacle. But with <i>Deadbeat</i>, he surrenders fully to the spartan, strobe-lit allure of dance music, breaking down his traditionally maximalist approach to the most essential raw materials. The opening “My Old Ways” functions as a microcosm of Parker’s journey up to this point: Beginning with an iPhone recording that sounds like a dusty old John Lennon demo, the track hitches its core piano melody onto a hard-hitting house pulse, seamlessly bridging Parker’s classic-rock roots with his current beatmaking mindset. \n\nHe spends much of <i>Deadbeat</i> savvily toeing the line between pop economy and dance-floor abandon. The cheeky, horror-themed “Dracula” is destined to join Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” in the canon of Halloween electro-disco delights; “Piece of Heaven” gorgeously unfurls like an ’80s synth-pop spin on <i>Pet Sounds</i>; and “Afterthought”—an 11th-hour addition recorded while the album was being mastered—is an irresistible New Order-esque earworm that makes it clear why this Aussie outsider has managed to infiltrate pop’s A-list inner sanctum. \n\nBut <i>Deadbeat</i>’s most thrilling moments come on extended out-of-body experiences like “Ethereal Connection” and “End of Summer,” where Parker layers psychedelic synths over tough techno rhythms like fluorescent paint splattered on a concrete wall. And yet, even as he’s traded trippy guitar solos for blitzkrieged beats, Parker’s deeply personal songwriting has retained the wistful, self-interrogating quality that fortifies the emotional bond with his listeners. \n\n“I’ve always had a sick satisfaction from being hard on myself in my lyrics,” he says. “For me, it’s freeing to make beautiful music and then put a sticker on it that says, ‘That piece of shit!’ It flips around all those feelings that have followed me around my whole life and gives them purpose.”\n","tagline":"New Album and

years after Prodigy’s death, a Queensbridge rap legacy advances.","standard":"In hip-hop’s more than five-decade history, Queensbridge stands firmly as one of the genre’s foundational, load-bearing pillars. The same outer-borough NYC locale where MC Shan laid down the rap gauntlet with his seminal single “The Bridge” got reinforced further in the 1990s and 2000s by two more sons of the namesake housing development, Havoc and Prodigy. Their run as Mobb Deep hit its stride with 1995’s <i>The Infamous</i>, with the pair remaining a force to be reckoned with both lyrically and musically for another two decades. Were it not for Prodigy’s untimely and tragic passing in 2017, it stands to reason that they’d still be repping QB as a unit today, something the release of <i>Infinite</i> demonstrates. \n\nMore than a decade after their presumed swan song, the double-disc <i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i>, this posthumous collaboration not only honors the duo’s legacy but aims to advance what they cultivated as an enduring, relevant art form. With production duties divided between The Alchemist—Prodigy’s second-most-prolific co-conspirator—and Havoc himself, <i>Infinite</i> makes their case with beats and rhymes that feel downright timeless. Whether nodding to golden-age hip-hop heroics on “My Era,” cruising from the crib to the casino on “Taj Mahal,” or shrewdly menacing the opposition on “Gunfire,” their thematic bars seamlessly capture the rap veterans’ mindset. \n\nNostalgia certainly has its place here, and the appearances by Big Noyd on the grimy “The M. The O. The B. The B.” and Nas on the more celebratory “Pour the Henny” keep that classic Queensbridge presence in prominent view. Indeed, most of the features come from artists who were aligned with the Mobb in the <i>Infamous</i> days, with Wu-Tang Clan spitters Ghostface Killah and Raekwon reprising their “Right Back at You” roles on “Clear Black Nights.” Yet there’s also a genuine vibrancy here so rarely found on albums released in this particular fashion, the unmistakable interplay between the core duo enlivening moments like “Against the World” and “Score Points” and further imbued with that improbable reunion spirit via the Clipse collab “Look at Me.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Infinite","playParams":{"id":"1837337842","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/infinite/1837337842","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6vmyn1RL0oHkJhXM9hG7m3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837337842/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"77135","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/77135?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760581915591,"RTCI":0}}},"1837484943":{"id":"1837484943","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837484943?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"BIA","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bia/1112309486","artwork":{"bgColor":"c0cbd6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"170905","textColor2":"46281a","textColor3":"39302f","textColor4":"5e4940","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1c/e8/9a/1ce89ae9-1114-a144-772e-65dccb1e2f4d/196873549453.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Rap/R&B with bilingual flair defines the artist’s long-awaited debut.","standard":"As both a rapper and an R&B artist, BIA has spent more than a decade building up to the 2025 release of <i>BIANCA</i>.

Latin power-players Becky G and Young Miko amplify her bilingual might on “HARD WAY” and “BIRTHDAY BEHAVIOR,” respectively, while Southern rap stars Key Glock and Denzel Curry each match her lyrical energy on the booming pair “DADE” and “WE ON GO II,” the latter also featuring an especially animated A$AP Ferg.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"BIANCA","playParams":{"id":"1837484943","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bianca/1837484943","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6nKzftxVZEX4bLDGa4A16t"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837484943/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1112309486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1112309486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760556621911,"RTCI":0}}},"1837526649":{"id":"1837526649","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837526649?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dear Youth","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dear-youth/1158769970","artwork":{"bgColor":"171716","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"eeeadd","textColor2":"ded7cb","textColor3":"c3c0b5","textColor4":"b6b0a6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e8/0c/76/e80c760e-f4fa-8f55-af55-5313c228dc28/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Where You Haunt Me: Part 1 - EP","playParams":{"id":"1837526649","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/where-you-haunt-me-part-1-ep/1837526649"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837526649/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1158769970","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1158769970?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760716067757,"RTCI":0}}},"1837538635":{"id":"1837538635","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837538635?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dave East","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dave-east/451759978","artwork":{"bgColor":"555857","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3f6f6","textColor2":"edefee","textColor3":"d3d6d6","textColor4":"ced1cf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/62/e4/1062e404-2a39-cded-f75f-9d97569ecca1/199538693836.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"323232","gradient":{"color":"323232","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"050505","textColor3":"1a1a1a","textColor4":"1c1c1c","textGradient":["ffffff","050505"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/1a/9a/7b/1a9a7b93-0bd7-9dfb-a12f-09a7637b887f/Job227f6b5f-0150-40e9-8da0-c88cf1c7e1bb-205673490-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_401790254_2376884790-Time1760083742724.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"323232","gradient":{"color":"323232","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"060606","textColor3":"1a1a1a","textColor4":"1c1c1c","textGradient":["ffffff","060606"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/19/67/72/196772e7-97a7-fc0b-663b-5057d60172ed/Job01c6d83c-e50c-4a0f-9d52-102ceb4ccf80-205673489-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_401790253_2376884789-Time1760081408299.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d6d3d1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0d","textColor2":"151516","textColor3":"333334","textColor4":"3c3b3b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/bb/e4/42/bbe44287-230c-c925-e898-88ea9dc720a4/305ddc31-3b6c-466c-9da8-07767f8eef4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A New York rap vet brings his city’s mixtape energy back.","standard":"There was a time in New York hip-hop when the mixtape format effectively trumped the album. With this looser format, some of the city’s best rappers delivered their hardest, cleverest verses over quality beats—not infrequently using uncleared samples—as a means to keep the streets fed and the fans hyped. And while the definition of a given project may have lost clear meaning over the past decade, Dave East clearly holds the mixtape spirit in high regard. With producers like Nicholas Craven, Harry Fraud, and HighHonors behind the boards, this fourth installment in the <i>Karma</i> series finds the raspy native doing what he loves on his own terms.\n\nThe skits here draw inspiration from epic crime stories like <i>Goodfellas</i>, <i>Heat</i>, and <i>The Sopranos</i>, largely represented by appearances from infamous hip-hop impressionist Pain In Da Ass. But the most compelling narrative here belongs to East, fully prepared for the worst on “Ahki Store” and revealing all manner of escape routes on the impactful “Runnin’.” Few proper albums bring the lyrical heat the way he does on “Demon” or “Havana,” his pen as sharp as ever. \n\nHis choice of guests also reflects his stature in the game, pulling from a national talent pool of other seasoned stars and independent winners. He details the rough road to a luxe life with Stove God Cooks, dips into a nostalgic cloud-rap bag alongside Wiz Khalifa, and gives the R&B-meets-rap model a rugged refresher opposite Jeremih and Roc-A-Fella vet Rell. As if that weren’t enough, the posthumous Nipsey Hussle presence on “12 Months” lends even greater gravity to the whole <i>Karma 4</i> endeavor.\n","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["East Coast Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Karma 4","playParams":{"id":"1837538635","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-15","trackCount":26,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/karma-4/1837538635","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7EhhvSYad20sjiKKI5JnRQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837538635/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"451759978","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/451759978?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760638945868,"RTCI":0}}},"1837986685":{"id":"1837986685","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837986685?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"SPLIT","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/split/1779971811","artwork":{"bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d2d2d2","textColor2":"c1c1c1","textColor3":"acacac","textColor4":"9e9e9e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/48/3d/6b/483d6bae-9765-e49e-da1f-18698589a44f/3667007185986_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative","Rock"],"name":"Violence Breeds Violence","playParams":{"id":"1837986685","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/violence-breeds-violence/1837986685","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5VDstc1IDlhjo9KgXUO7qu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837986685/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1779971811","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1779971811?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760285482320,"RTCI":0}}},"1838076511":{"id":"1838076511","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838076511?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"TiaCorine","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tiacorine/1317568905","artwork":{"bgColor":"d3879d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"16080d","textColor2":"240d14","textColor3":"3c212a","textColor4":"472530","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0a/94/fe/0a94fe8f-cc82-53bc-09bb-ab6da8bd3cae/25UMGIM82216.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The NC rapper rounds out her trilogy, flexing her range and her contacts.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"CORINIAN","playParams":{"id":"1838076511","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/corinian/1838076511","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4qtAux5nQUxDiKr7YE12RW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838076511/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1317568905","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1317568905?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760601930298,"RTCI":0}}},"1838820481":{"id":"1838820481","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838820481?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"C.Y.M.","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/c-y-m/1827064454","artwork":{"bgColor":"7d4572","hasP3":false,"height":3900,"textColor1":"f8f5f7","textColor2":"edacd5","textColor3":"dfd2dd","textColor4":"d698c1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d2/29/02/d2290250-b7b6-c03e-58f6-8c39ac7fde93/5026854001272.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3900},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chris Baio and Mike Greene pack a dizzying number of ideas into 10 songs.","standard":"On their self-titled debut as C.Y.M., Vampire Weekend’s Chris Baio and Fort Romeau’s Mike Greene try to squeeze as many different ideas into a collection of 10 silky smooth pop jams as possible. Alongside guests like Day Wave, Cherry Glazerr, SOLIS4EVR, and Nana, the songwriters and co-producers find a middle ground of psych-pop, electro-funk, disco, krautrock, and pretty much every other genre under the sun. “Life of Mine,” which features Day Wave, is a shoegaze-leaning cut built around a melodic bassline and a pulsating drum line. “Catania” is built for long nights on the dance floor, with arpeggiated synths slowly building before a rock groove brings the song into the early hours. In lesser hands, this many different ideas and styles jam-packed into a tidy package would overflow in excess, but with Baio and Greene at the helm, they create something both endlessly curious and sturdy in its unique vision.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"name":"C.Y.M.","playParams":{"id":"1838820481","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/c-y-m/1838820481","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1cyr4V5UMiZ851oGMr52kY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838820481/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1827064454","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1827064454?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760717025066,"RTCI":0}}},"1839046615":{"id":"1839046615","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839046615?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Immortal Disfigurement","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/immortal-disfigurement/1618367608","artwork":{"bgColor":"2b1d1c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"b6e1f4","textColor2":"90b2d2","textColor3":"9abac9","textColor4":"7c94ad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a6/dd/13/a6dd130e-76c5-c051-c461-9a450b61f331/199538775563.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Hell Is Right In Front of Us -

In the wake of a major-label deal, her Grand Ole Opry debut, and her first headlining tour, the 25-year-old takes a moment on her second EP, <i>Anna</i>, to reconcile her inner child with her pop-country persona. (Anna Dasha Novotny is the singer’s full name.) Over pedal steel and fiddle on the reflective “Oh, Anna!,” she summons the nerve of her precocious younger self to deal with the pressures of her newfound fame. “Train,” a poignant acoustic ballad, depicts the slow transition from new girl in town to resident. Elsewhere are the wry, boot-stompin’ rhythms that the “California girl with a Southern heart” has become known for, like the smoky “Work on Me,” an ode to men with dirty hands and dirty minds.","tagline":"New

2025 album gets a sprawling, all-star 22-track expansion.","standard":"A few days before the release of <i>Fancy Some More?</i>, PinkPantheress posted a teaser video which starred her animated alter ego scribbling the names of 23 artists on a cartoon whiteboard. The list of names spanned genres, generations, and the globe: the Aussie pop icon Kylie Minogue, Swedish rap mystic Bladee, and K-pop supergroup SEVENTEEN were just a few. The artists were revealed as the featured guests on a sprawling, 22-track expansion of the British singer/producer’s second mixtape, <i>Fancy That</i>, which landed in May 2025 as her highest-charting album in her home country.\n\nHere, PinkPantheress adds two discs’ worth of high-end bonus versions to the original nine tracks, the first of which leans fully into cool, left-of-center pop, including a Spanish-language flip of “Illegal” from Brazilian reggaeton star Anitta and French electro-pop auteur Oklou’s dreamy reimagining of “Girl Like Me.” Disc two features remixes from a decade-spanning range of PinkPantheress’ dance-music favorites—from jungle revivalist Nia Archives to British house heroes Basement Jaxx, whose big-beat euphoria inspired several of <i>Fancy That</i>’s original tracks.","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Fancy Some

But when a dramatic incident became a blessing in disguise, the 27-year-old singer-songwriter instantly knew his direction. “In the process of creating the album, I got outed and then immediately knew everything that I needed to say,” he told Hattie Collins, host of Apple Music’s Proud Radio. “It’s time to make that album for myself. It’s time to make the album that solidifies who I am—not only as an artist, but just as a person in this world.”\n\nOn the resulting record, <i>after the sun goes down</i>, the singer who’s been famous since blowing up as a teenager with his debut single, “Location,” and its follow-up, “Young Dumb & Broke,” finds himself fully in his element—passionate, unapologetic, and more confident than ever. Across 16 tracks, Khalid grapples candidly with lust and loss, yearning over hyperpop on “whenever you’re gone” and channeling Craig David on “in plain sight,” a UK garage-inspired meditation on infidelity. He’s joined by an all-star roster of collaborators, sharing writing credits with Tove Lo and Julia Michaels and recruiting legendary producer Darkchild for “out of body,” a hedonistic club jam straight out of 2001. Although the sweetest cameo comes from Khalid’s mom, who sings backup on “hurt people.”\n\nHis aim, as he tells Apple Music, is to be fearless in returning the love he’s received over the past year. “I feel like the queer community has embraced me so much, and with love unconditionally,” he says. “I have to give that back to the world, because it’s a huge part of me. It’s who I am. And I feel like I’ve played it safe so many times in my life that this time, I felt like I wanted to be bold.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"after the sun goes down","playParams":{"id":"1844394976","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/after-the-sun-goes-down/1844394976","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3e9xFKdGt0oS5O4fMubFT5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844394976/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"82842423","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/82842423?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760588281953,"RTCI":0}}},"1844471188":{"id":"1844471188","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844471188?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lucy Dacus","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lucy-dacus/1060812309","artwork":{"bgColor":"604832","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f8ebee","textColor2":"e8e5f8","textColor3":"d9cac8","textColor4":"ccc5d0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/aa/49/3a/aa493a68-434b-ca4d-2088-33b604c66869/25UM1IM51836.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Demos, live cuts, and new tracks fill out a deluxe edition of Dacus’ 2025 LP.","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Forever Is A Feeling: The Archives","playParams":{"id":"1844471188","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-10","trackCount":21,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-is-a-feeling-the-archives/1844471188","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2K91mmZiTrqVmt3ZRoosk6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844471188/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1060812309","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1060812309?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760614112325,"RTCI":0}}},"1844865710":{"id":"1844865710","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844865710?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"PØGØ","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/p%C3%B8g%C3%B8/1631351996","artwork":{"bgColor":"344d7a","hasP3":false,"height":1440,"textColor1":"e2eaf3","textColor2":"a1bbe6","textColor3":"bfcbdb","textColor4":"8ca5d1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a8/f8/77/a8f877fd-9594-69f2-81c8-ea8fe6a4cfc0/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1440},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Pink Funeral","playParams":{"id":"1844865710","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pink-funeral/1844865710","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4oa8Vj7eLLiKVpjYlPOkbm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844865710/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1631351996","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1631351996?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760715887524,"RTCI":0}}},"1844932319":{"id":"1844932319","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844932319?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HAIM","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/haim/164483115","artwork":{"bgColor":"000205","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"c7ecf5","textColor2":"a3bdc7","textColor3":"9fbdc5","textColor4":"8297a0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/d4/04/5ad40480-9104-16fa-c5ed-5fd08ae20058/196873685199.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"848c92","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"020303","textColor2":"030405","textColor3":"1c1e20","textColor4":"1d1f21","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/23/af/e9/23afe94b-7581-b900-bb3c-4d29623d8099/02a04742-ff35-4a3e-8940-47188a73ef92.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The sister trio just can’t quit I quit—and add a few more tracks to their 2025 LP.","standard":"Even though HAIM named their fourth studio album—and first since 2020’s <i>Women in Music, Pt. III</i>—<i>I quit</i>, the trio of sisters aren’t quitters. “Quitting can be looked at as giving up in normal circumstances,” bassist/vocalist Este Haim tells Apple Music. “We look at it as a new beginning and betting on yourself. We quit things that don’t serve us anymore.” \n\nThe follow-up to their Grammy-nominated opus takes its name from a scene in 1996’s <i>That Thing You Do!</i> where the band’s leader announces his departure by snapping his fingers and sing-talking the words “I quit”—a move the women use regularly as an inside joke. “One day, we were checking the mic and we did it again,” Este adds. “We were like, ‘Wait, should we name our album <i>I quit</i>? Say that again.’ ‘Wait a minute. Should we?’ It took on a life of its own.”\n\nProduced by Rostam and lead vocalist/guitarist Danielle Haim, the band’s latest takes parting shots at the people in their lives who have seemingly done them wrong. (And with single artwork inspired by paparazzi pics—most famously for “Relationships,” a cheeky take on the iconic post-divorce Nicole Kidman photo—the Haims aren’t just speaking to their romantic follies but the celebrity and industry machine at large.) Appropriately, the opening track “Gone” samples the George Michael smash “Freedom! ’90,” setting the tone for the album’s message: liberation from anything and everything that may have restrained them. “I’ll do whatever I want/I’ll see who I wanna see/I’ll fuck off whenever I want/I’ll be whatever I need,” Danielle intones. \n\nTheir songs range from groovy (“Down to be wrong”) to nostalgic (“Take me back”), dreamy (“Lucky stars”), and bluesy (“Blood on the street”). “All over me” feels straight out of a ’90s rom-com montage, and “The farm” gives off a Sheryl Crow-infused vibe. The contemplative “Everybody’s trying to figure me out”—co-written by Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon—also offers a meditation on self-acceptance: “Everybody’s got their own decisions, and I know that I’ve got mine/And I’ll be fine.” \n\nUltimately, though, the sibling rockers see their new work as fit for the stage, and that’s important to how they create their music, Este explains: “We always think about our live show when we are writing songs, because that’s really where our heart is—playing live.” \n\n<b>“Gone”</b>\nAlana Haim: “‘Gone’ was actually the last song that we wrote for this album. We were listening to the album and it felt like we really needed an introduction to the world of <i>I quit</i>. Before ‘Gone’ was written, it felt like it was going into, it needed that breath of, ‘Okay, we’re starting the album.’ We started with that guitar line—I think Danielle had this—and it kind of just came out. I think every songwriter would say this: There’s this spiritual muse that comes into your brain sometimes, and we love that muse. We pray for that muse to kind of let us be the vessel. But we were kind of hanging on this one note, and Danielle just kind of blurted out, ‘Can I have your attention, please?’ And we were like, ‘Oh, we’re starting now.’”\n\n<b>“All over me”</b>\nAH: “Maybe other people are very open with their siblings. We are not! I don’t want to know! But when we were making ‘All over me,’ we had fallen into this time where we were all single and we were all having very different experiences, but they were all coming kind of from the same point of view: We were all having these one-night stands and we were all having these crazy-ass stories about these one-night stands. ‘All over me’ kind of just blossomed from that time.”\n\n<b>“Relationships”</b>\nDanielle Haim: “This was one of the hardest songs to crack—and honestly, there’s always one on every album. It’s always kind of like our favorite one. ‘The Wire’ was very tough to crack; ‘Want You Back’ was super tough to crack; ‘The Steps,’ super, super tough to crack. This is in the same lineage as those. It went through a bunch of different versions, but it’s one of my favorite songs we’ve ever written.”\n\n<b>“Down to be wrong”</b>\nDH: “We knew we were writing songs in the studio with Rostam and he’s always so supportive of searching for different sounds. I know we were like, ‘Yeah, we’re making an album,’ but it wasn’t until we wrote that song where we were like, ‘Okay, wow, we have one super down.’ Not to sound weird, but it was just that was the one where we were like, ‘Holy shit, I do think we have a great song here.’ And when we got that chorus, I think it kind of just opened up something within all of us.”\nAH: “When we wrote that chorus of just screaming, we were visualizing just playing it live and screaming with everybody and getting that weight off your shoulders. It was a very cathartic day in the studio.”\n\n<b>“Take me back”</b>\nDH: “Our friend Tobias Jesso Jr. was in the area when we were working on this in the studio. Honestly, we didn’t plan on writing anything; we just wanted to show him an update of what we had been making. He’s from Vancouver, and we somehow got on this conversation about high school, and what we were doing during high school.”\nEste Haim: “I’m just going to say, to be fair, all three of us went to the same high school, so we don’t really have any perspective on what it was like to go to school anywhere else.”\nAH: “That day, it was filled with so much joy and this nostalgic feeling of reminiscing about that funny time.”\n\n<b>“Love you right”</b>\nDH: “That was one of the first songs we wrote. ‘Love you right’ came from a drumbeat. I feel like we needed to have this kind of moody, really in-the-pocket drum, like roomy-sounding. I had this whole vision in my head.”\nAH: “We’re extremely inspired by the drums. A lot of these songs were birthed out of Danielle cooking on the drums.”\n\n<b>“The farm”</b>\nAH: “It was a somber day in the studio. When we made this album, we were all across the board extremely happy that we were single. But then there are those moments where you have to be self-reflective and you’re in your home alone and you realize that you’re a human being that has emotions, and you’re looking around your house where there’s no noise. You’re just sitting in silence and you realize: You know what? I’m alone. ‘The farm’ is that kind of song where you’re reflecting on that time of being alone. Learning to be okay alone with yourself is the most important lesson you can learn just being alive.”\n\n<b>“Lucky stars”</b>\nDH: “It’s a very optimistic song. There were some really amazing times through these last couple of years where we were meeting new people. There were some that just fully came into our lives, maybe for not that long, but it was truly so fun and inspiring. It just was like, wait, this person’s amazing. It’s reflecting on putting yourself out there and then also wondering why some people come into your life and being so thankful for that, but also just kind of being like, ‘Wow, I’m so happy that I met this person.’ Is it in the stars or what, I wonder, or is this just kind of happening?”\n\n<b>“Million years”</b>\nAH: “Saying, ‘I’ll carry you on my back even if it takes a million years,’ to me, that is kind of like an ode to my siblings. Anytime I’m feeling low, I’m so lucky that I was born with my two best friends. In [my] low points, I get to call my siblings and they know exactly what to say. It’s an ode to anyone in your life that you’ll have forever, that has your back.”\n\n<b>“Everybody’s trying to figure me out”</b>\nDH: “That song’s really close to my heart. It’s probably my favorite one on the album. It started after a bit of a panic attack after tour. I just remember sitting down and writing, ‘Everybody’s trying to figure me out and that’s all right,’ which I think, at the time, I lost track of a bunch of people and got really in my head. I used the whole song as a bit of a mantra to remind myself that I’m okay, and you think you’re going to die, but you’re not going to die. When I’m having a bit of a panic moment, it’s a really helpful mantra.”\n\n<b>“Try to feel my pain”</b>\nDH: “It’s a bit like holding up a mirror, maybe to yourself, and maybe a bit to your partner, and realizing that sometimes you can feel yourself a bit numb within a relationship. And I think that’s a bit like putting everything on the table and putting a mirror up to it.”\n\n<b>“Spinning”</b>\nAH: “The first song that I’ve ever sang lead on—so daunting! I had just started dating someone, and I was so fucking obsessed with that ooey-gooey first four days where you are falling down the rabbit hole. You’re getting calls and you see their name and you get all butterflies and all those ooey-gooey first moments. The relationship lasted very little time after I wrote the song. I fall head first into every relationship; I really throw all caution to the wind. The man that it’s about has no idea. And in the grand scheme of things it was a very insignificant part of my life, but for that moment, it was great. I wish I could bottle the feeling, but it’s now bottled in a song.”\n\n<b>“Cry”</b>\nEH: “This is the first song I’ve sung lead on by myself—like Alana said, super daunting. I fashion myself a bass player first and maybe a singer after that. When we came into the studio [that day], I was crying, which is not a rare occurrence. I tend to feel things—maybe not deeper than most people, but I’m a pretty sensitive bitch. I was with someone for almost five years and we left on completely amicable terms, but even when that happens, you’re still mourning the loss of something, almost like having a best friend and then all of a sudden they’re gone. I was talking about it in the studio, and I said his name, and I just burst into tears. I can’t remember what sister it was—it might even have been Rostam—but someone was like, ‘We should probably talk about this with music. Let’s harness this feeling while it’s fresh.’ I had been bottling up a lot of what I was feeling in order to just survive. Hopefully I’ll be able to get through it on tour. Even when I was hearing it in the studio, I just starting crying. So hopefully I’ll get my shit together and get tear duct surgery before that and just plug them up.”\n\n<b>“Blood on the street”</b>\nAH: “On our first album, we had ‘The Wire.’ On our third album, we had ‘Hallelujah.’ And I think when it came to ‘Blood on the street,’ we really wanted a song where we each sing a verse. And me and my siblings grew up jamming together. I will say, we were in a very interesting place mentally when we wrote that song, but it was like this feeling of just being like, to be frank, ‘Fuck you for fucking me over.’ We really did get all of our aggression out. We’ve been playing it live, and that song live is the biggest release.”\n\n<b>“Now it’s time”</b>\nAH: “We were just kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall when we were making this. Obviously we love U2; we interpolated their guitar riff from ‘Numb.’ It was an exchange because U2, they have a song on <i>Songs of Experience</i> called ‘Lights of Home’ where they interpolated Danielle’s guitar riff from ‘My Song 5.’ This album really is this beautiful journey of self-exploration for us, of feeling comfortable in your own skin and being okay with just being with yourself. In this song, we’re standing on this solid ground with our six feet of being like, ‘We have now given you every emotion that we felt like in this chapter of our lives—and now we’re on the other end and just we’re complete.’ This feels like the end of this chapter and we can close the book, put it on the shelf and just say, fucking, ‘I quit.’”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"I quit (deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1844932319","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-quit-deluxe/1844932319","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0UcALdLFt3jVDg7N21BzeN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844932319/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"164483115","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/164483115?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760715272560,"RTCI":0}}},"1844933878":{"id":"1844933878","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844933878?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dei V","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dei-v/1515317241","artwork":{"bgColor":"050606","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"91d1ce","textColor2":"7cd4c9","textColor3":"75a8a6","textColor4":"64aba2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/cb/fa/3ecbfab4-3c63-3804-954e-fa5788e5dcd6/199806061510.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dddbd0","textColor2":"d5c7b4","textColor3":"b4b2a9","textColor4":"aea294","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/50/20/a7/5020a775-95ba-0311-34eb-15a1c206b335/4db0ad3c-f314-42b2-9f50-4ccc3f9b4157.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Puerto Rican star invites listeners to dive right in.","standard":"After whetting fans’ appetites earlier in the year with the EP-length <i>LOS FLAVORZ</i>, Dei V returns with his second project of 2025, <i>Underwater</i>.

The EP-length effort devotes itself to the tropical and the sentimental, with her vivid voice central to these six robustly composed songs. Joy and pain characterize the ultimately triumphant “QUE LLUEVAN FLORES,” while “INSENSATA” slowly smolders and burns until all that remains is pure passion. Even though she’s switched up the beat, she’s still the same Nathy, her confidence and defiance undeniable on “NO ES OTRA CANCIÓN ROMÁNTICA” and her storytelling skills intact for the baroque “A CABALLO.” The title track adds Venezuela’s own Rawayana to the mix, making the already lush instrumentation and playfully naughty themes even fuller and bolder.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Música tropical","Music","Latin"],"name":"MALPORTADA - EP","playParams":{"id":"1845077446","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/malportada-ep/1845077446"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845077446/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1336405189","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1336405189?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760716049701,"RTCI":0}}},"1845087512":{"id":"1845087512","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845087512?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Meteora","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/meteora/1543036380","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f1c5a6","textColor2":"f1b98d","textColor3":"c09e85","textColor4":"c19470","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c4/ae/18/c4ae1866-00b0-6917-aa30-d5a4f8c9d16d/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Broken Mind - EP","playParams":{"id":"1845087512","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/broken-mind-ep/1845087512"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845087512/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1543036380","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1543036380?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1760715970883,"RTCI":0}}},"1845342571":{"id":"1845342571","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845342571?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ed Sheeran","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ed-sheeran/183313439","artwork":{"bgColor":"351522","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"dfacc1","textColor2":"cdb2bd","textColor3":"bd8da1","textColor4":"af939e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d0/b7/81/d0b7813b-4a5a-0218-ddfa-9599859953b6/5026854072494.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Indian stars lend their talents to the EP from the singer-songwriter.","standard":"Ed Sheeran holds the original version of “Sapphire”—co-written by Hindi film music icon Arijit Singh, who also provides backing vocals—in high regard. “Arijit is their version of me for the UK in terms of love songs, singer-songwriter,” Sheeran told Apple Music when <i>Play</i> first released. “It’s definitely the most important song on the record, and I do think that it will stand the test of time in terms of fusing Western pop culture with Indian [culture] in a respectful way.”\n\nSo naturally, Singh joined for his own feature on the remix of the joyful Bollywood-esque cut that appears on Sheeran’s four-track EP <i>Play (The Remixes)</i>.

Despite the ceremonial finality that surrounded his 2022 full-length farewell, <i>LEGENDADDY</i>, the Puerto Rican icon didn’t exactly go away, performing live and dropping singles as he saw fit in the subsequent years. Still, the arrival of <i>Lamento en Baile</i>, a faith-based outing from the perreo pioneer, seems less an extension of his prior work than a reinvention that opens him up to new audiences who’d otherwise have avoided an oft salacious genre. \n\nSparked by his public conversion to Christianity, this roughly hour-long effort sees him sidestep his King of Reggaetón title to preach about a kingdom greater than his own, beginning with the rhythmic appeal of “Tan Invitao’” and continuing through such profoundly positive fare as the thumping yet tropical “Sonríele.” Shifting from such ecstatic joy to a more studious seriousness, he looks deeper into Scripture on the cautionary salsa “Jezabel y Júdas” and revives the Noah’s Ark parable on the sleek “Súbete.” Yet he can also find humor in life’s mishaps and small ironies, shrugging it all off for the bubbly “DTB.”\n\nEven Yankee’s love songs now carry a devotional bent, evident on the praise-laden “Jardín Rojo.” His gratitude in this new phase of life imbues so much of <i>Lamento en Baile</i>’s contents, bursting out of the dance floor-ready “Ayo Ayo,” “Tu Amor Me Conviene,” and “El Toque.” Truly, his commitment to
