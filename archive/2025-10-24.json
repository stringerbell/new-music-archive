about time: the re-energized trio’s first album of new music in 19 years.","standard":"You can call this a comeback, but don’t call it a happy ending. In his memoir, <i>Rumours of My Demise</i>, which arrived tandem with this album, The Lemonheads founder Evan Dando recalls his band’s lurch towards international fame during the early ’90s and the lifestyle that came with it—before addiction led to his often-public unmooring. Three decades later, his dependency on hard drugs, he writes, has no end. He’s only ever in periods of using or not using. If the first Lemonheads album of original material in 19 years doesn’t mark the redemption of Evan Dando then, there’s still plenty of joy and triumph to be had from its existence. Largely recorded in his new home of Brazil, with bassist Farley Glavin and drummer John Kent, and wholly recorded with Dando in an enduring “off” period, it’s a robust and rangy reminder of his way with wistful, indelibly catchy guitar pop.\n\nAt 58, Dando understandably presents as a little more worn-in than the catwalk-handsome slacker who fronted 1992’s succinct and spotless <i>It’s a Shame About Ray</i> and gold-selling follow-up <i>Come on Feel the Lemonheads</i> (1993). The voice is deeper and more frayed, especially when straining to break out of a mumble on “Be-In” and its portrayal of salvation found in new love. But if aching closer “Roky” offers a rueful and bruised reflection on past behaviors and “Deep End” sets an ominous tone amid zippy riffs and a J Mascis guitar solo (“Watch the clouds come over/Canary in a coma”), he’s equally defiant and galvanized elsewhere. “I’ll be out here if you want to find me/I’d rather die than let your thoughts confine me,” he sings on the urgent power pop of “In the Margin,” while he’s unapologetic about speaking his truth—whoever it upsets—on scruffy freak-folk ballad “The Key of Victory.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative","Rock"],"name":"Love Chant","playParams":{"id":"1816916150","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-chant/1816916150","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Osl9AyobrS97S5qxEeWJo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816916150/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"312507","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/312507?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761239181991,"RTCI":0}}},"1819762019":{"id":"1819762019","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819762019?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Big Wreck","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/big-wreck/150589","artwork":{"bgColor":"be5e46","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0f0404","textColor2":"140c0b","textColor3":"321611","textColor4":"361d17","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4f/14/51/4f145115-5b0c-5823-e8b0-969daddc6696/25SYMIM19572.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"The Rest Of The Story","playParams":{"id":"1819762019","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rest-of-the-story/1819762019","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7temZ6v1c69UOhyXHq6vOp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819762019/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"150589","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/150589?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761291187987,"RTCI":0}}},"1820752397":{"id":"1820752397","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820752397?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Spiritual Cramp","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/spiritual-cramp/1328013525","artwork":{"bgColor":"b4b7ac","hasP3":false,"height":3750,"textColor1":"1a1714","textColor2":"292825","textColor3":"393732","textColor4":"454540","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0d/b8/b7/0db8b7d3-c56d-1259-4c0a-947015bcb980/199350749124.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3750},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"bdb59d","gradient":{"color":"bdb59d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"353225","textColor3":"403f3d","textColor4":"5c5a4f","textGradient":["000000","353225"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/77/af/ef/77afef33-7a26-8e56-fc10-60e9bb71e48b/Jobd160fb80-b11c-4872-9161-b817689fd0c6-199199989-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389971664_2278634322-Time1754308046433.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"bdb59d","gradient":{"color":"bdb59d","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"2f3025","textColor3":"453931","textColor4":"57584f","textGradient":["000000","2f3025"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ed/09/74/ed0974a8-11c7-1e7c-e460-ad8a6fde8062/Joba1e30cd4-1d9c-4a49-a8c6-e1db724b7e45-199199988-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389971665_2278634323-Time1754307108060.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b1aaaa","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"11120a","textColor2":"11140e","textColor3":"31302a","textColor4":"31322d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d2/bb/89/d2bb89da-881e-8191-f5ee-ca64cb6d44f3/b7f67f71-9097-4700-ad05-a919f1517f6d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A love letter to the indie punks’ San Francisco stomping grounds.","standard":"On their second album, indie-rock punks Spiritual Cramp take you on a spin through the fictional radio station Wild 87 and their “San Francisco rude boy” sound.

metalcore heavyweights deliver a bleak and brutal sci-fi opus.","standard":"After exploring doomsday scenarios on past albums, shape-shifting metalcore heavyweights The Acacia Strain offer a vision of a distant future in an alternate reality. <i>You Are Safe From God Here</i> imagines a timeline in which humanity tries to escape the wrath of an omnipresent being run amok. The Acacia Strain vocalist Vincent Bennett calls it the “existential dark low fantasy era” of the band, which plays out in dual meanings across the songs. Bookend tracks “eucharist i: BURNT OFFERING” and “eucharist ii: BLOOD LOSS” provide a snapshot of the stark musical contrasts that permeate the album; the former short, fast, and brutal, the latter long, crushing, and featuring a mournful guest shot from Sunny Faris of all-female psych-rock troupe Blackwater Holylight.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"You Are

hard-rocking country songs crackle with spontaneity.","standard":"James Johnston’s 2023 debut <i>RAISED LIKE THAT</i> saw him nominated for a stack of awards and propelled its title track to platinum sales. The Australian country singer builds on that success with <i>WHERE YOU’LL FIND ME</i>, which is even more direct and rock-centered than its predecessor. That’s thanks partly to producer Jared Adlam, who juggles various guitars and keyboard instruments and co-wrote several tunes—including “I OUGHTA KNOW BETTER,” a raucous, ’90s-style take on the requisite drinking song. Driven by Johnston’s big, yearning vocals, it’s all about how one harmless sip turns to many more, complete with cheeky references to Bridget Jones, “Stairway to Heaven,” and a colorful way of describing lovemaking. Johnston also collaborates twice with his mentor, Morgan Evans: “ONE MORE” is a rousing anthem about not wanting a night to end, while “BACK IN THE DAY” gazes tenderly back to a time that didn’t feel quite so hectic. And the <i>Australian Idol</i> and <i>The X Factor</i> alum duets with South African singer Appel on “COUNTRY IS FOR ME,” a song about how the titular genre can easily traverse cultures and continents alike.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"WHERE YOU'LL FIND

well-traveled rodeo cowboy shares his unique experiences.","standard":"Early into Wade Forster’s second album, the Australian calls himself the last of a dying breed. He’s not wrong: Forster makes his living as a rodeo cowboy, hitting the road for long, arduous stretches and only later making the time to write songs about the experience. <i>Gooseneck Party</i> draws heavily on such dust-caked tales, complete with Forster promising to win the top rodeo prize in Vegas and “bulldog my way to fame” on “Take That Buckle Home.” Yet, it’s not all glory and swagger: On that same track, he describes how homesickness hurts more than any broken bone, even if it’s just the simple fact of traveling through a land that doesn’t serve his trusty Bundy and Coke. Such touches put a modern spin on Forster’s old-school themes of rambling, drinking, and competing, and these 22 tracks certainly feel lived-in. It helps that he’s got the resonant, occasionally creaky pipes of a classic crooner, as heard on ballads like “Emily” and “Nothing to Write Home About.” Between his grounding delivery and penchant for rich details of character and geography, these unique stories turn out to be very much worth writing home about.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Gooseneck Party","playParams":{"id":"1832699929","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gooseneck-party/1832699929","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5ppTk9ksMUCGmPvbvhENLZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832699929/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1576096307","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1576096307?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761270023238,"RTCI":0}}},"1833254692":{"id":"1833254692","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833254692?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Machine Girl","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/machine-girl/295258685","artwork":{"bgColor":"524c4a","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"d6d7ea","textColor2":"fbaaaa","textColor3":"bbbbca","textColor4":"d99797","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f8/98/a3/f898a371-e3d6-74bc-9ee9-70156bfdf08d/198704673764_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hardcore","Music","Dance"],"name":"PsychoWarrior: MG Ultra X","playParams":{"id":"1833254692","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/psychowarrior-mg-ultra-x/1833254692","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1CjHj5Gs3eWmxCZ7HsHjOv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833254692/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"295258685","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/295258685?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761291537388,"RTCI":0}}},"1834035084":{"id":"1834035084","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834035084?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Serj Tankian","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/serj-tankian/82647909","artwork":{"bgColor":"d7c4b3","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"000812","textColor2":"4a241a","textColor3":"2b2d32","textColor4":"664439","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/12/dc/60/12dc60ca-ca3c-409e-9ba9-b02fdc24539a/663918453940.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f1f1f1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"111111","textColor2":"262626","textColor3":"3d3d3d","textColor4":"4f4f4f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/73/00/8b730039-cc21-1d2f-7418-b97ee61f1c93/f9a3aec6-9322-428f-b5ca-54b9007b11b0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The System of a Down singer surfaces more curios from his vault.","standard":"No one can accuse Serj Tankian of false advertising.

But she is on a short list of artists who can boast that her own album is a direct result of having been Mitchell’s close collaborator. “I had finished playing the Hollywood Bowl [in 2024] with Joni, and it took up so much of my spiritual space and my mind space,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I felt really emotionally make-or-break, because I just wanted that to be a pivotal moment for Joni.” Carlile’s stewardship of her hero’s comeback performances, alongside <i>Who Believes in Angels?</i>, her 2025 team-up with Elton John, another one of her idols and mentors, left her little time to tend to her own music. “It became so overwhelming and so all-consuming that this little voice did start to say, ‘OK, you’re not going to live very long if you keep setting the bar for yourself in these really stressful places,’” she says. “‘And you’re also hiding a little bit.’”\n\nFollowing her time in LA with Mitchell, she headed to Aaron Dessner’s Long Pond Studio in upstate New York to begin work on <i>Returning to Myself</i>. “I didn’t know whether we were going to be writing songs for someone else, or writing songs for me, or what we were going to be doing,” she explains. Though she admits to struggling initially with the process, the end result runs from the sweet and sentimental (“Anniversary”) to the angry (“Church & State”) and, of course, an emotional ode to Mitchell herself (“Joni”). Read below for Carlile’s thoughts on a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Returning to Myself”</b>\n“I didn’t even bring a guitar. I went upstairs to the bedroom, and I sat on this bed looking at a blank wall, and I was so stressed to be that alone. I wrote the poem for <i>Returning to Myself</i>. It was just a poem; it didn’t have music or anything yet. I was just almost rejecting it. I was almost feeling like, ‘OK, this is it. This is a noble pursuit, me staring at this wall. This is what it means to learn to be alone. I guess I’m evolving right now. I feel like I’m not doing anything at all but just indulging myself and sitting here on this bed.’”\n\n<b>“Human”</b>\n“I do feel that every generation since recorded history believes that their generation is the one living through the end of the world. I think that’s really comforting. And we do. We all see our conflicts and our wars and our political upheavals and tyranny and democracy in constant balance. We are in a loop, and the loop is the loop of humanity. And don’t be apathetic. Don’t ignore it. Don’t look away. Do fight. Do be an activist. Do get out of bed every morning and think about how you can serve humanity. But also touch grass. Also realize that you’re here for a split second and that you don’t want to look back and realize you missed the whole thing because you believed you were living through the end of the world.”\n\n<b>“Church & State”</b>\n“We were set up to jam and that song was really carnal. We were in a circle. It was like rock ’n’ roll time, and it was November 5th, the night of the [2024] election. I went into the studio, laptop open, spiraling, just not doing great emotionally. I mean, I knew what was coming. I had written ‘Human’ the night before, and it was like a primal cry for self-preservation in a way, and not just for me, for everybody.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"Returning To Myself","playParams":{"id":"1835483605","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/returning-to-myself/1835483605","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3e2Q0TkwIIfmWUAssLAJ8U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835483605/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"64387579","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/64387579?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761297763039,"RTCI":0}}},"1835769599":{"id":"1835769599","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835769599?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bruce Springsteen","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-springsteen/178834","artwork":{"bgColor":"434343","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"f2f5f5","textColor2":"f2e2e5","textColor3":"cfd1d1","textColor4":"cfc2c4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d6/fe/3d/d6fe3d00-46b5-0a47-10a4-958bef533db4/196873495354.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f2e1e3","textColor3":"cfd1d1","textColor4":"cfc2c3","textGradient":["ffffff","f2e1e3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/80/81/30/80813080-b3ae-808e-7250-7cc6591b6670/Job715cfa0c-990c-475c-abe9-617601425047-201920434-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395062448_2320599745-Time1756844943284.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor3":"b9b9b9","textColor4":"a8a8a8","textGradient":["ffffff","d2d2d2"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/70/cd/5b/70cd5b52-2ec8-5951-d74a-160b42dbd67e/Job3aa443c2-77ce-4d0b-baee-04305f6c7dce-201920433-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395062449_2320599744-Time1756843474480.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"f8f9f9","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0a0a","textColor2":"120808","textColor3":"393a3a","textColor4":"403838","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/47/d3/90/47d3904c-4493-4f66-8da6-77891c2e7795/a1c3c50d-6797-44b4-aafe-0c0016b5825f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"474949","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7f8f8","textColor2":"f7f8f8","textColor3":"d3d5d5","textColor4":"d3d5d5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/22/eb/d6/22ebd6ec-a2bc-9b0d-3dda-ac8a375b5181/eb4c02e9-1330-457b-941a-3151ae35b1fe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The legend of his sixth album grows with revelatory electric versions.","standard":"Not much about Bruce Springsteen’s sixth album could have felt mythical upon its arrival in 1982. Coming after 1980’s double-album garage-rock opus <i>The River</i> and before the 1984 supernova <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, this was a set of 10 uncharacteristically stark, unaccompanied acoustic songs, each more haunted than the last, that shifted Springsteen’s reputation from ebullient bandleader to evocative author of stories about desperate characters getting crushed by an American dream that turned out to not be for them. “I would say the closest I ever came to doing that would have been unintentionally, maybe <i>Nebraska</i> during the Reagan years,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2020. “I think if you wanted to find a body of work that expressed what it was like to be an American, say from 1970 to now, in the post-industrial period of the United States, I’d be a place you could go and get some information on that.”\n\nAs Springsteen’s stature grew, so did that of his most modest-sounding album. Within a decade, the kind of rough-hewn four-track bedroom recordings that marked <i>Nebraska</i> would become a genre unto itself. Author Warren Zanes’ 2023 book <i>Deliver Me from Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska</i> recontextualized the album not just as a sonic and thematic departure, but as a pivotal moment in which Springsteen wrestled with depression and doubt about where he stood and where he was going. Scott Cooper’s 2025 movie based on the book, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, only raised the stakes and the profile, although for Springsteen diehards, this period needed no help being mythologized. \n\nThis four-LP reissue makes it clear that <i>Nebraska</i> did not always know it was going to be <i>Nebraska</i>, as the songs written during this time included ones that would eventually find their way to <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> in decidedly glossier fashion. The rough acoustic demo of that album’s title track, which opens this box set, is relentlessly dour, and a million miles away from the bombast that tricked millions into thinking it was a jingoistic anthem. “Downbound Train,” “Working on the Highway,” and beloved B-side “Pink Cadillac” also appear here as sparse sketches.\n\nBut the draw here for many fans will be the long-rumored “Electric Nebraska” tracks—six of the album’s ten songs performed with the E Street Band, before Springsteen ultimately reverted to the original acoustic solo versions. A collection like this does not intend to convince anyone that these decisions were mistakes, but it’s hard not to do a double take hearing well-worn songs like “Atlantic City” and “Mansion on the Hill” and the haunting title track so divorced from their trademark vibe. It is, however, a reminder that Springsteen comes by his blue-collar bard reputation honestly: Even his most understated album required heavy lifting. \n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition","playParams":{"id":"1835769599","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":37,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nebraska-82-expanded-edition/1835769599","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Cd23zUXeW83jRFlUiwcPM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835769599/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"178834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/178834?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761315659234,"RTCI":0}}},"1836226516":{"id":"1836226516","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836226516?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tame Impala","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tame-impala/290242959","artwork":{"bgColor":"404041","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fdfdfd","textColor2":"e4e4e4","textColor3":"d7d7d7","textColor4":"c3c3c3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/54/11/80541122-c1c4-50ad-a673-ff79f4cf8aa7/196873555331.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"513b36","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f3c460","textColor2":"dfc06c","textColor3":"d3a857","textColor4":"c3a561","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/19/94/af/1994aff8-034d-c59b-0aca-563500bf1515/8bcb1c5c-9e99-4a03-8ca5-04f4750c608d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"0b120a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ccbca6","textColor2":"d3b891","textColor3":"a59a87","textColor4":"ab9776","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e7/76/de/e776de76-ccaf-e0bb-5a94-d2fa37bb1586/651b2605-f150-43d9-b905-b1e5c78fc986.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Aussie psych auteur completes his journey from rock to rave.","standard":"“That’s always something that I get a kick out of: just shaking up expectations,” Kevin Parker tells Apple Music, and after nearly two decades at the helm of Tame Impala, the Australian auteur has left no expectation unshaken. Throughout his zigzagging career, Parker has played the role of headband-sporting hard rocker, cinematic psychedelic architect, indie-R&B crossover king, Diana Ross’ <i>Minions</i> soundtrack dance partner, and Dua Lipa’s go-to studio Houdini, but each pivot has only reinforced his reputation as alt-pop’s premier purveyor of hazy-headed dream-state vibes. \n\nWhile Tame Impala’s fifth album <i>Deadbeat</i> initially took shape thousands of miles away from his studio in Perth, it nonetheless represents something of a full-circle move for Parker, embracing the coastal environment, isolationist methodology, and liberating blank-slate ethos that spawned his earliest forays into recording. “The album officially started in Montecito,” explains Parker, who decamped to the Californian coast with his wife and toddlers in tow. “My thing is I get an Airbnb somewhere on the coast—I just find places literally as close to the water as you can get. Staring at the ocean for me just helps me get lost, and there’s a tranquility that comes along with it.” And from that oceanic inspiration, Parker was reminded of an essential truth: The beach is a great place to hold a rave. \n\nParker has, of course, been incorporating electronic textures into his work since 2015’s <i>Currents</i>, albeit in a manner that still adapted easily to Tame Impala’s arena-rocking live spectacle. But with <i>Deadbeat</i>, he surrenders fully to the spartan, strobe-lit allure of dance music, breaking down his traditionally maximalist approach to the most essential raw materials. The opening “My Old Ways” functions as a microcosm of Parker’s journey up to this point: Beginning with an iPhone recording that sounds like a dusty old John Lennon demo, the track hitches its core piano melody onto a hard-hitting house pulse, seamlessly bridging Parker’s classic-rock roots with his current beatmaking mindset. \n\nHe spends much of <i>Deadbeat</i> savvily toeing the line between pop economy and dance-floor abandon. The cheeky, horror-themed “Dracula” is destined to join Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” in the canon of Halloween electro-disco delights; “Piece of Heaven” gorgeously unfurls like an ’80s synth-pop spin on <i>Pet Sounds</i>; and “Afterthought”—an 11th-hour addition recorded while the album was being mastered—is an irresistible New Order-esque earworm that makes it clear why this Aussie outsider has managed to infiltrate pop’s A-list inner sanctum. \n\nBut <i>Deadbeat</i>’s most thrilling moments come on extended out-of-body experiences like “Ethereal Connection” and “End of Summer,” where Parker layers psychedelic synths over tough techno rhythms like fluorescent paint splattered on a concrete wall. And yet, even as he’s traded trippy guitar solos for blitzkrieged beats, Parker’s deeply personal songwriting has retained the wistful, self-interrogating quality that fortifies the emotional bond with his listeners. \n\n“I’ve always had a sick satisfaction from being hard on myself in my lyrics,” he says. “For me, it’s freeing to make beautiful music and then put a sticker on it that says, ‘That piece of shit!’ It flips around all those feelings that have followed me around my whole life and gives them purpose.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Dance"],"name":"Deadbeat","playParams":{"id":"1836226516","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-17","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deadbeat/1836226516","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5WulAOx9ilWy1h8UGZ1gkI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836226516/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"290242959","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/290242959?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761208162625,"RTCI":0}}},"1836281105":{"id":"1836281105","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836281105?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Miguel","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/miguel/29254083","artwork":{"bgColor":"0c0b0b","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cf9fa1","textColor2":"fa2f36","textColor3":"a88283","textColor4":"ca282d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/fd/28/d5fd2830-093a-de97-68b7-b145992b9c69/196871232944.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"b8b7af","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0f0f","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"30302f","textColor4":"3a3a37","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/11/23/5d/11235de6-8516-9ce7-1fef-0478434450ce/29772671-df2a-4b2d-9dcd-1b4ef57597c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c9d6d7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0a0e","textColor2":"161317","textColor3":"343336","textColor4":"393a3d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/04/61/c9/0461c923-15bd-8bee-5e91-acb28098605d/240d6a3c-b418-406c-9bc4-02eb5168eb28.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B auteur’s first LP in eight years embraces darker sounds and themes.","standard":"A lot has changed in the eight years since Miguel last released an album, from the state of the world to his personal life. (In 2023, his divorce from longtime partner Nazanin Mandi was finalized.) If 2017’s <i>War & Leisure</i> hinted at turmoil both personal and political, the fifth album from the R&B auteur lands directly in the thick of it. On <i>CAOS</i>, the fight for peace is messy, but cathartic. Previous hits like “Adorn” and “Coffee” reveled in the bliss of intimacy, but here Miguel ventures beyond soulful psychedelia to embrace darker sounds and themes, landing somewhere between P-Funk and Nine Inch Nails. \n\nIn the dark underbelly of the present, love feels a lot like rage, and vulnerability and anarchy coexist more easily than you’d think. He’s masked, strapped, and ready for whatever on “New Martyrs (Ride 4 U),” a Bonnie and Clyde anthem for uncertain times. He sings in Spanish on the apocalyptic title track, interpolates 2Pac on “The Killing” (“I ain’t a killer, but don’t push me”), and flips a poignant piano ballad into a scuzzy house thumper on “RIP.” A streak of primal lust flashes through the darkness, and on “Angel’s Song,” he swoons amidst the flames (“I forget the world’s unraveling when I look at you”). And on the grungy “Always Time,” he delivers an elegy for his marriage, singing: “Maybe this time, love means letting go.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"CAOS","playParams":{"id":"1836281105","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-23","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/caos/1836281105","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2KKtiR6wEIINGF0p82NPRa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836281105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"29254083","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29254083?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761259038975,"RTCI":0}}},"1836284568":{"id":"1836284568","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836284568?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"bgColor":"a1a2a6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"080d1f","textColor2":"3a1215","textColor3":"262b3a","textColor4":"4e2f32","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e2/a9/4d/e2a94d4b-735f-fabb-3e9b-1c23e2fd7814/117141.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Music For Everyone Vol .2","playParams":{"id":"1836284568","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/music-for-everyone-vol-2/1836284568","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Pf5Jtp5XIBNVoxAC6Ig4i"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836284568/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761216783032,"RTCI":0}}},"1837231979":{"id":"1837231979","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837231979?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Elton John","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/elton-john/54657","artwork":{"bgColor":"644845","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"eee9b2","textColor2":"adddcd","textColor3":"d2c99c","textColor4":"9fbfb2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/02/08/7c/02087c77-47ff-f071-197b-17a3c69453ad/25UM1IM16070.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1a2126","gradient":{"color":"1a2126","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ed9b5e","textColor3":"c5a686","textColor4":"c48454","textGradient":["ffffff","ed9b5e"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fa/5a/86/fa5a866c-af33-c93d-1f6f-68740d0b4537/Job14ba8633-2872-4926-bcdc-da4def68a7ab-205898281-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402210782_2380265625-Time1760353597271.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1a2126","gradient":{"color":"1a2126","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ef8f58","textColor3":"9fa381","textColor4":"c57a4f","textGradient":["ffffff","ef8f58"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/4f/69/194f69f7-8cea-4052-007e-0268c50113f7/Jobe4caa206-dd23-4c57-a138-32f86403aa5e-205898280-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402210781_2380265624-Time1760351763933.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"efe1d1","textColor2":"e2d2bf","textColor3":"bfb4a7","textColor4":"b5a898","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/b7/0e/6bb70e35-714b-e690-37f6-e76399d9b0e0/b75c8aca-e3b7-4286-874d-7bc770130ec6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Captain adds unreleased demos and live takes to his concept album.","standard":"This sharply honed and impeccably catchy concept album casts Elton John as Captain Fantastic and lyricist Bernie Taupin as the Brown Dirt Cowboy in a semi-autobiographical version of the pair’s struggling early days.

soul-searching odyssey that feels both organic and psychedelic.","standard":"The early 2020s was a period of leveling up for Daniel Caesar. The Toronto R&B artist signed to a major label, logged No. 1 hits with Justin Bieber and Tyler, The Creator, and with 2023’s <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, scored his highest-charting album to date and graduated to arena-headliner status. But as a child of the church, Caesar has always seemed less interested in indulging in the spoils of stardom than in forging a deep spiritual connection with his congregation of fans. In the lead-up to the release of his fourth full-length, <i>Son of Spergy</i>, Caesar hosted surprise pop-up concerts in various cities, turning up in local parks on a few hours’ notice with just an acoustic guitar—a fitting prelude to his most intimate and off-the-cuff album to date. \n\nNamed for his gospel-singer father, <i>Son of Spergy</i> is a moment for Caesar to recalibrate after years of whirlwind success, and reconnect with family, old flames, and the church. “Lord, let your blessings rain down,” he sings on the opener, “Rain Down,” a hazy-headed hymn that sets the soul-searching tone for the album. Compared to the beat-driven experimentation of <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, <i>Son of Spergy</i> is both a more organic and psychedelic experience, favoring folky instrumentation that Caesar weaves to delightfully daydreamy effect on openhearted serenades like “Have a Baby (With Me)” and the Bon Iver-assisted beauty “Moon,” where jazzy piano wafts through the dulcet acoustic arrangement like a misty drizzle. \n\nBut <i>Son of Spergy</i>’s Zen vibe is counterbalanced by Caesar’s growing confidence at drawing far outside the lines of R&B: “Call on Me” is an upbeat outlier that pairs crunchy

sound-effect samples with White Album-style wanderlust.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Son Of

a hard-rock pivot, a celebratory return to house, EDM, and club pop.","standard":"Shortly before releasing her eighth album in 2022, Demi Lovato posted a photo dressed in all black with her middle fingers up, captioned “a funeral for my pop music.” That album, <i>Holy Fvck</i>, channeled heavy feelings through hard rock and pop punk, abandoning the sweetness of her biggest hits to embrace her early inspirations. Lovato’s first remix album, 2023’s <i>REVAMPED</i>, doubled down on the pivot, reworking songs like “Heart Attack” and “Cool for the Summer” into tough rock numbers. But as she teased her ninth studio album in summer 2025, the 33-year-old singer captioned a cheeky TikTok from the studio: “My pop music coming back to life after we held a funeral for it.” Popvato had officially returned.\n\nOn <i>It’s Not That Deep</i>, Lovato sweats it out under the strobe lights, reveling in the sultry, celebratory sounds of house, EDM, and club pop. “I wanna go fast/I wanna go hard,” she sings on “Fast,” a pulsing ode to letting go of inhibitions. She breaks out the choreo for the first time in years in the video for “Here All Night,” a synth-pop jam about hitting the club after a breakup. Executive producer Zhone (whose past credits include Troye Sivan’s “Rush” and Kesha’s “Joyride”) maintains the frisky, fully embodied mood. “It’s not that deep, unless you want it to be,” Lovato winks on the electro thumper “Kiss,” though it’s not shallow, either. See “Sorry to Myself,” a sparkling synth-pop reckoning: “I was my favorite hater, but I’m tired,” she belts out. “Now I’m flirting with hope.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"It’s Not That Deep","playParams":{"id":"1839489366","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-not-that-deep/1839489366","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0bzP9iV2QbM6174JLfGxcc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839489366/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280215821","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280215821?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761297071870,"RTCI":0}}},"1840194869":{"id":"1840194869","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840194869?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"King Crimson","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/king-crimson/627204","artwork":{"bgColor":"654938","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e5ead8","textColor2":"c1cdeb","textColor3":"cccab8","textColor4":"afb3c7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e8/62/93/e862938c-5a8f-3521-dbef-cc9697f91f81/29175.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Prog-Rock/Art Rock","Music","Rock","Jazz"],"name":"Lizard (2025 David Singleton Elemental Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1840194869","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lizard-2025-david-singleton-elemental-mix/1840194869","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1UfojoqiWBYbUd3hM2RGt3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840194869/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"627204","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/627204?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761291471500,"RTCI":0}}},"1840734352":{"id":"1840734352","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840734352?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Björk","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bj%C3%B6rk/295015","artwork":{"bgColor":"080817","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dfc1b4","textColor2":"d5bec8","textColor3":"b49c95","textColor4":"ac99a4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/48/36/e8/4836e8ac-0806-b64c-c3a8-bce6887ed7f2/5016958108472.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Cornucopia: Live","playParams":{"id":"1840734352","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":22,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cornucopia-live/1840734352","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3RthPqHIceYcEAYWohiD8n"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840734352/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"295015","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/295015?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761291778764,"RTCI":0}}},"1840768093":{"id":"1840768093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840768093?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sophia Scott","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sophia-scott/1078472359","artwork":{"bgColor":"c8c3d1","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070809","textColor2":"08090a","textColor3":"2e2e31","textColor4":"2f2e32","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/25/52/8c/25528c14-38ef-a80c-2c07-15c21d772701/199316285703_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"b6b2c3","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"08090a","textColor2":"090a0b","textColor3":"2b2b2f","textColor4":"2c2b30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/1d/f1/85/1df185b1-6ecb-4f48-c1b3-e722e33cd9b1/Job84ca9306-8a46-4c67-8189-39dfa325ee2b-206233371-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402879353_2385655004-Time1760653846732.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"414956","gradient":{"color":"414956","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"0b0b0d","textColor3":"2c2c30","textColor4":"2e2e32","textGradient":["ffffff","0b0b0d"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/58/35/c3/5835c3d8-9827-1b59-0ed3-158f5571aac9/Job230ac7b1-f8c5-4d84-9b8b-956548084e9e-206233370-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402879354_2385655003-Time1760651130219.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Lifeboat -

A few of Santa’s friends join to deck the halls: JoJo lends herself to the sentimental “Snowing in Paris” and the a cappella group revives Frank Sinatra for a posthumous duet on “I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.” Ol’ Blue Eyes becomes the third ghost of Christmases past tapped by PTX, following Elvis Presley (“O Little Town of Bethlehem”) and Bing Crosby (“White Christmas”) on previous seasonal albums. And one special offering under the tree? “Moody Rudy,” a mashup of Chuck Berry’s “Run Rudolph Run” with Glen Miller’s “In the Mood.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Holiday","Music"],"name":"Christmas in the City","playParams":{"id":"1841523275","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-in-the-city/1841523275","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7xaP8xn3tGJYPg3xwcbe9s"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841523275/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466047278","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466047278?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761301961157,"RTCI":0}}},"1841532486":{"id":"1841532486","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841532486?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Welcome To The Big Dipper Original Cast","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/welcome-to-the-big-dipper-original-cast/1841532488","artwork":{"bgColor":"426477","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"ecf5f9","textColor2":"bfe2e1","textColor3":"cad8df","textColor4":"a6c8cb","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/57/60/fd/5760fd07-81a3-541d-0fe0-253890a937b5/610583683295.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Musicals","Music","Soundtrack"],"name":"Welcome To The Big Dipper (Original Cast Recording)","playParams":{"id":"1841532486","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-the-big-dipper-original-cast-recording/1841532486","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7zyDjV9UUavvktrSLWLaeG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841532486/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1841532488","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1841532488?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761215146310,"RTCI":0}}},"1841705578":{"id":"1841705578","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841705578?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Buffalo Traffic Jam","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/buffalo-traffic-jam/1744636210","artwork":{"bgColor":"22282b","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e5d0b8","textColor2":"dbd0c3","textColor3":"beae9b","textColor4":"b6aea5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5e/ec/c9/5eecc988-4eb4-3f9d-ece6-f8437b8809b7/196873624686.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"24282c","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ecd3b8","textColor2":"d9cfc2","textColor3":"c4b19c","textColor4":"b4ada4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/36/56/d9/3656d9bc-4b32-3386-1b03-98ca65addeb8/Job28c3ffad-a58c-4f23-a687-ad2742e66472-206616698-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_403645527_2391372894-Time1761067778349.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"212224","gradient":{"color":"212224","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"101011","textColor3":"2a2a28","textColor4":"2f2d2d","textGradient":["ffffff","101011"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/52/c9/af/52c9af52-d220-5261-ee0e-12cf8e0bbea5/Job5dc77133-f5d9-4d32-a096-688259b55205-206616699-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_403645526_2391372895-Time1761069280018.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Rustic harmonies and folksy warmth define the Montana band’s second EP.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Folk","Music"],"name":"Take Me Home -

While the track works as a tale about youthful infatuation, it can also be read as a story about parasocial fascination—a complexity of attraction that Hearts2Hearts expand on across <i>FOCUS</i>’s five glossy tracks. The intimacy of female friendship is sugar-sweet on the sleepover-coded nu-disco track “Apple Pie,” while a delicate romantic love takes center stage on the city-pop bop “Flutter” and dreamy ballad “Blue Moon.” “Pretty Please” evokes the spirit of first- and second-generation girl groups in its vocally driven, midtempo exploration of connection.","tagline":"New Mini Album"},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"FOCUS - The 1st Mini Album - EP","playParams":{"id":"1841828519","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-20","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/focus-the-1st-mini-album-ep/1841828519"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841828519/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1793698498","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1793698498?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761171904800,"RTCI":0}}},"1841991346":{"id":"1841991346","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841991346?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hit-Boy & The Alchemist","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=264191430-28446224","artwork":{"bgColor":"ea6d29","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"050505","textColor2":"161110","textColor3":"331a0c","textColor4":"402315","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/38/db/ee/38dbeeeb-c639-0397-3fcc-3a251095df79/199316291193_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"eb7135","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"050606","textColor3":"331a0e","textColor4":"331b0f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/94/6d/3e/946d3eb5-7345-d8b3-3494-b6b613f3b9ce/Joba3aff973-390c-48fc-b6e4-ce230f956727-204840226-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_400258471_2364235475-Time1759365278845.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"eb6f33","hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"050606","textColor3":"331a0f","textColor4":"331b0f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0f/99/e4/0f99e47b-5b5e-35ac-1b43-ea6427155082/Job2497f5ac-e9e7-4bf0-b770-5ba57def0483-204840225-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_400258470_2364235476-Time1759363567227.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"252626","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e3e3e3","textColor2":"cccccd","textColor3":"bdbdbd","textColor4":"aaaaac","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/27/9e/6e/279e6e20-b466-e099-f016-49d7fdcd728e/bcd1859d-8d07-49c7-84c4-890d927019b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The hip-hop hitmakers flex in the vocal booth and behind the boards.","standard":"At this point in their respective production careers, Hit-Boy and The Alchemist are responsible for so many hip-hop hits and faves that it seems pointless to try and list them. Their contributions to the culture span generations, with decades in the game and no signs of slowing down for either artist. Yet one area where the two don’t get nearly enough shine is in the vocal booth, their rap talents often overlooked by contrast with their widely recognized instrumental prowess. That’s precisely what makes <i>GOLDFISH</i> and their prior duo collabs of the past few years: their skills both behind the boards and on the mic put on proud display. \n\nOff the rip, they’re in fighting form with the one-two punch of “Doing My Best” and “Business Merger,” maintaining energetic confidence for the album’s full 50-minute runtime. “God Is Great” snarks at lesser beatmakers and wack wannabes with a pointed use of gospel flair, while “Show Me the Way” covers both parenthood and personal ambition as powerful midlife motivators. Indicative of Alchemist’s lengthy history with Mobb Deep, Havoc’s appearance on “Celebration Moments” emphasizes his own dual lane. Other rapper guests like Boldy James, Conway the Machine, and Jay Worthy offer features that serve to remind listeners of the headliners’ curatorial clout. Yet perhaps it’s the presence of Hit-Boy’s father, Big Hit, on “All Gas No Breaks” that best drives home the intimacy of the core duo’s partnership—one that hopefully has plenty of road ahead of it.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"GOLDFISH","playParams":{"id":"1841991346","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/goldfish/1841991346","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6EXDkyvi5H3Ys8KCYDkE6g"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841991346/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"264191430","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/264191430?l=en-US"},{"id":"28446224","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/28446224?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761291560119,"RTCI":0}}},"1842155112":{"id":"1842155112","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1842155112?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"AratheJay","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arathejay/1565866436","artwork":{"bgColor":"221a12","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3d2c1","textColor2":"f5bfa1","textColor3":"c9ad9e","textColor4":"cb9e84","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e2/b0/bd/e2b0bde9-1130-75d6-2ee3-e080e7f8a64a/199538955651.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c6c2be","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"100c0a","textColor2":"1a1615","textColor3":"34302e","textColor4":"3c3836","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9a/68/fc/9a68fcb0-a082-7367-c02f-a4176fa90f04/cc9b4656-91d1-48e9-a37c-4712e476ecc5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Ghanaian breakout star reflects on his blistering rise.","standard":"When AratheJay released his debut project <i>Finding Nimo Series: The Capsule</i>, in June 2024, he was already on his way to being regarded as one of Ghana’s next great musical hopes. During the months that followed, high-level performances on collaborations with Black Sherif and Bella Shmurda only seemed to confirm the masked singer’s inevitable ascent. On his full-length debut, <i>The Odyssey</i>, AratheJay (born Samuel Ofei Ankrah Badu) details his journey to stardom without pulling any punches. His thoughts on navigating rocky terrains and testing moments are delivered with a firm conviction that underscores the rigorous approach that has propelled him towards superstardom.\n\nAratheJay’s epic journey of resilience and self-discovery is built on a slick Afropop framework, but faith is the through line that connects the project’s 17 songs. A tale of divinely orchestrated success on “Zion” is followed by a plea for continued protection from the Most High on “Cover Me.” When he switches the mood, AratheJay proves that he’s just as capable of soundtracking nights out on the town. “Only Fans” is a delightful slow-burner built around a spartan percussive base and sprightly guitar licks, while the balmy “Alhaji Popping” is hinged on a promise to show a lover a great time. Even when guests show up, they ultimately complement AratheJay’s vision. Fellow Ghanaian Stonebwoy is a foil for the singer on “Talisman”, adding a new dimension to the quasi-worship song. Kumasi stars Beeztrap Kotm and O’Kenneth lean on their vocal dexterity on “Ahuofe” while Kenyan singer Savara joins a grand romantic declaration on “Say I Do.”","tagline":"New

R&B singer hits a milestone—and the reset button: “I was born to do this.”","standard":"The day Queen Naija turned 30, she knew exactly how she wanted to honor the occasion. “I wanted to hike a mountain,” she tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “So, I did it. I just wanted to do something that was really empowering, something I’d never done before, and to challenge myself. And when I got up there, I was able to see the sunset, and it was beautiful. It was serene.”\n\nAfter years of documenting the highs and lows of her life online, the YouTube star turned R&B singer is learning to quiet the noise. “I used to be such an oversharer,” she says. “Now I’m trying to find the balance between maintaining my peace and family while staying true and relatable.” Looking back on her twenties, she sees how heartbreak and healing have shaped the woman she is now. She walks through that growth on <i>30.</i>, a project that marks both a personal reset and creative evolution. “People know me as, like, the heartbreak girl, the lover girl, and that’s my core. I am. But I also want people to know that, like, outside of that, I’m really an artist. I was born to do this. I can do anything. I can sing anything.”\n\nExecutive produced by No ID (Kanye West, JAY-Z, J. Cole) and Poo Bear (Justin Bieber, USHER, Lupe Fiasco), <i>30.</i> is the most fun she’s had making music since her 2020 debut, <i>missunderstood</i>, and it sounds like it. She radiates That Girl energy on “put it on (eat)…,” a sassy self-love anthem for both get-ready playlists and the club, proclaiming, ”Forgive me if I shine too bright/My heart’s full of light.” And yes, she’s still a lover girl, hyping up her ride-or-die on “my man…” and embracing her sensuality, narrating the heightened anticipation of waiting for a lover to come home (“tipsy…”) and the intimacy that follows (“rain…”). “Even though this is a versatile project, I really wanted people to know, like, I’m still here, still R&B,” she says of the latter song.\n\nAmid the fun and creative experimentation, <i>30.</i> still makes space for vulnerability. Riding an Afrobeat groove, Queen lets go of a past love with maturity (“what u lookin 4 [wyl4]...”) and requires that her next match her energy (“i deserve…”). But it’s the title track’s stormy, self-deprecating introduction that lays her bare, exposing her flaws. “Some of the recording was me just ranting in the studio, and I was like, ‘Wait, keep that on there,’” she recalls. But like sun peeking through the clouds, the song is cautiously hopeful: “Please be sweet to me/Don’t you do me dirty,” she pleads to the decade ahead, while also reminding herself, “You got this, pop yo’ shit.” <i>30.</i> is Queen Naija stepping into her highest self. “It seems like you have to have some sort of drama for a rollout, and I’m just like, I don’t know.

But in recent years, the superstar DJs have seemed less interested in chasing the highs of their radio-friendly megahits, burrowing into moodier melodies and more nuanced productions. On <i>Breathe</i>, their sixth EP (following 2024’s <i>No Hard Feelings</i>), the duo gets heady and hedonistic—obsessing over a star-crossed lover on “Veins,” channeling UK garage on “White Wine & Adderall,” and hurtling towards emotional oblivion on “The Cure.” Guest vocalists include British singer-songwriters Absolutely and Beau Nox, plus a reappearance from Daya of “Don’t Let Me Down” fame.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"name":"Breathe","playParams":{"id":"1844692222","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/breathe/1844692222","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4x5UzbvkvyvBPBfF3h6t9h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844692222/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"580391756","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/580391756?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761322954737,"RTCI":0}}},"1844702099":{"id":"1844702099","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844702099?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Grupo Frontera","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grupo-frontera/1613772487","artwork":{"bgColor":"160a02","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f2c733","textColor2":"f4c03b","textColor3":"c6a129","textColor4":"c89c2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/fc/de/c1fcdead-fd84-3ff8-c729-70232de68637/199806082607.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d8d6d4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"261d18","textColor2":"2a2420","textColor3":"49423d","textColor4":"4d4844","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/39/cc/b4/39ccb4b5-8671-232d-2691-c3fe4a4474fa/a8017477-5fad-4cfa-99c6-49e8e49d9e19.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“Cumbia magically enters with everything” on the Texans’ third album.","standard":"Música mexicana stars Grupo Frontera got used to making music on the road, out of necessity more than anything else. “We had to record a song literally onstage, before going out to a concert,” singer and bajo quinto player Adelaido “Payo” Solís III tells Apple Music, recalling having to hit various studios in whatever city they happening to be in when putting together what ultimately became their 2024 album <i>JUGANDO A QUE NO PASA NADA</i>. But when it came time to follow that one up, they opted instead to bring it all back home. \n\n“We decided to take a break from touring this year so we could focus a little more on the music,” Payo says of recording <i>LO QUE ME FALTA POR LLORAR</i> in a studio of their own in McAllen, Texas, mere minutes from where they got their start in Edinburg. Through this, they were able to slow things down and get to the core of what has made Grupo Frontera so compelling, even as they maintained the collaborative streak fans crave from them. “Obviously, we don’t like to leave our sound behind either, the cumbia, what we bring to give it our touch,” says bajo quinto player Alberto “Beto” Acosta. \n\nThis comes through naturally on team-ups here with other elite artists operating in their chosen genre, such as Los Dareyes De La Sierra on “mi droga” and Tito Double P on “échame la mano.” Yet it also extends to their tracks with reggaetón hitmakers Ozuna and Myke Towers, who find their place in fusions both subtle and otherwise. “If the artist wants to have their essence, we have it there too,” accordionist Juan Javier Cantú says. “Cumbia magically enters with everything.”\n\nThough such prominent guests naturally raise the expectations here, on their own, Grupo Frontera prove as formidable a unit as ever before—possibly more so now that they’ve given themselves space to create. They offer honesty amid heartbreak on the deeply relatable and beautifully arranged “monterrey,” a quality that extends to other such highlights as “si me quiere” and “tranqui.” “We are where we are because of the fans,” Beto says. “God gave us this opportunity to be this high up.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"name":"LO QUE ME FALTA POR

singer-songwriter tells the heart-rending story of a relationship souring.","standard":"Seven years have passed since Lily Allen bagged herself a Mercury Music Prize nomination for <i>No Shame</i>, a peppy yet vulnerable record that chronicled the singer-songwriter’s attempts to pick up the pieces following the breakdown of her first marriage. Her fifth studio album, <i>West End Girl</i>, adheres to a similar formula—eviscerating themes concealed within bright pop melodies—pulling the listener into a tightly contained soap opera that arrives in the wake of her second marriage (to <i>Stranger Things</i> star David Harbour) ending. Announcing the record, she said it was an attempt to document “the events that led me to where I am in my life now” while also describing it as a “mixture of fact and fiction.” \n\nSetting the scene with the title track—a dreamy, orchestral number that depicts a couple moving into a new home but hitting a bump when one of them lands a role in a play—the album narrates a bait-and-switch story in which the boundaries of a relationship (and Allen’s narrator along with them) warp and mutate. “Ruminating” is a drum ’n’ bass spiral into her racing thoughts after an admission of infidelity, while “Relapse” finds her struggling to maintain her sobriety in the wake of ever more painful revelations, her vocals chopped and echoing. Later, “Beg For Me” taps into heartbreak over a pitch-shifted sample of Lumidee’s “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh),” before resigning herself to the stark reality of her situation on “Let You W/In,” a soft, folky production.\n\nThere are, it must be said, very few moments of levity to be found throughout <i>West End Girl</i>, but tracks like “Nonmonogamummy” and “Dallas Major,” which portray reluctant participation in a newly opened relationship, are patterned from the same sardonic cloth as the more biting cuts from her early catalog—albeit dampened by the weary sadness that permeates the album at large. <i>West End Girl</i> closes the window on the drama at the same time as Allen closes the door on her marriage, leaving the listener to mull over events with no return for a triumphant encore—but her razor-edge lyricism and stunning attention to production detail provide ample reasons to wind back to the start and press play all over again.","tagline":"New

Latin star sends another love letter to Jamaica and Curaçao.","standard":"Ryan Castro knows the importance of dancehall as a foundational pillar in the current Latin music landscape. A continuation of the Jamaica-by-way-of-Curaçao vibes curated on <i>SENDÉ</i> from earlier in 2025, the Colombian star’s follow-up makes it known that his reggae tastes are no mere dalliance or trend. Some of the tracks here, like “BOTAPAFO” and “LA MINI,” directly draw from that Caribbean base, though others, such as the Afrobeats-infused “HABLA CLARO” and the beat-switching Major Lazer team-up “PELINEGRA,” speak more to the adaptable genre’s global impact. “LA VILLA” with Kapo directly draws from the seminal Sister Nancy single “Bam Bam,” while the “Ba Ba Bad” remix places him alongside dancehall hitmakers Busy Signal and Sean Paul from the Kybba-produced original. Though he makes the connection to reggaetón technique abundantly clear, Castro quite naturally takes to the cadences of a patois-centric delivery on “AY MI PAPÁ” and “MONA,” albeit in Spanish, of course.

He lays out his fears most explicitly on “Selfish,” another James Blake joint, reeling off a litany of sins and self-suspicions over ominous chords and haunting vocal samples. “My 27th Birthday” underscores his inner conflicts across almost eight minutes of restrained piano and hi-hat-centric percussion: new money clashes with old, moral conviction with the ethics of consumption, work ethic with the sacrifice of ambition. The state of the world weighs heavy; “How can you be King?/How can you be King?/Don’t speak for the people,” he asks on the title track, closing out the record with a powerful interrogation of his own commitment to social justice and a sage reminder that the push for change is a collective, intergenerational effort.\n\nThe introspection is admirable but the album’s highlights occur when Dave steps outside of himself, whether it’s to position himself as a narrator—unpicking the psychology of a criminal with “Marvellous,” calmly outlining the reasons women may fear men on “Fairchild”—or to engage with his peers as on the sultry Tems teamup “Raindance” or “Chapter 16,” which sees him form an inquisitive dialogue with grime heavyweight (and <i>Top Boy</i> co-star) Kano. And while <i>The Boy Who Played the Harp</i> is a more sonically somber affair than his previous works, the standard of observational insight and lyrical wordplay that have so far earned him an Ivor Novello, a BRIT, and the Mercury Music Prize, remains unchanged. Bending the word “Exodus” so that “there’s repentance in the Bible...” lands with the punchline “…God, remind my ex of this” (“175 Months”) is a shining example. It’s a timely record, arriving in a moment where problems seem insurmountable. In the Bible, Dave’s namesake was tasked with playing his harp to soothe a mind plagued by evil spirits—<i>The Boy Who Played the Harp</i> rises to the same challenge with aplomb.","tagline":"New
