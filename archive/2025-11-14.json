metalcore vets stretch out: “We felt like we had more freedom to explore.”","standard":"“Sometimes things happen for reasons that are beyond us.” That’s what Of Mice & Men lead vocalist Aaron Pauley says when asked about the title of the California metalcore band’s ninth album. “We have the notion that miracles are a once-in-a-lifetime thing, but the whole idea of another miracle implies that there already is one and you have to look for it.” On <i>Another Miracle</i>, Pauley and his bandmates—drummer Valentino “Tino” Arteaga, guitarist Phil Manansala, and guitarist Alan Ashby—took the opportunity to pursue new sonic territories, most notably the heavy ’90s shoegaze vibe of “Wake Up.” “We really don’t know what we’re going to make before we make it,” Pauley says. “We just set out on these random little expeditions and follow what excites us, which leads us in all different directions. But for us on our ninth record, we felt like we had a little more freedom to explore.”\n\nThe one thing that didn’t change is Of Mice & Men’s full control of the production process. The album was engineered and produced by all four members, with Pauley handling the mix and master—just as they did for 2021’s <i>Echo</i> and 2023’s <i>Tether</i>. “We’d already set the precedent that we were capable of doing it ourselves,” he says. “And because we really enjoy it, we’re able to be as prolific as we want to be. We’re not bound by studio time and producer schedules and things like that. When you can’t sleep at 2:30 am, you can just fire up the computer and work on the album.” Below, he comments on each track.\n\n<b>“A Waltz”</b>\n“We picked this for the first track because it has what I guess you’d call a ‘wow factor’ out of the gate. The song is incredibly theatrical. It lived as an instrumental for a long time because it’s one of the most track-dense and sound-dense songs on the record. Lyrically, I think that one, in the zeitgeist, was probably the result of a bad news day or just one of those days when I was feeling misanthropic and hopeless, which is sort of a go-to topic in rock and metal. But I like the counting and the repetition that happens naturally here. If you allow yourself to sink into the song a bit, it will kind of hypnotize you. And that’s by design.”\n\n<b>“Troubled Water”</b>\n“This one is about one-sided relationships and the idea of not wasting your energy and materials building bridges that go nowhere over waters that you don’t really want to fall into if for some reason that bridge fails. It’s all proverbial, of course. Imagine if it was literal, like it’s about structural engineering. I think if you want to remain effective in your life, just as a human being who can affect the shared reality, you really have to guard your resources and your energies. There’s a lot of tension in the instrumental, which kind of told us what the song should be about. It just felt like it was talking about a struggle or a conflict.”\n\n<b>“Safe & Sound”</b>\n“I wrote that one for my daughter when my wife and I found out that we were going to be first-time parents. I kept having this daydream or recurring vision, wondering what it’s like for a soul coming down to Earth, coming from something that’s infinite to something that’s so small and fragile. The idea of keeping your child safe and sound—you can’t really make that promise, as much as you want to. The song is about acknowledging that. Even though the lyric is ‘I promise you’ll be safe and sound,’ it’s acknowledging that we’re powerless in a lot of ways. I think recognizing that is not a bad thing, as long as you don’t let it steal your joy.”\n\n<b>“Hourglass”</b>\n“Instrumentally, this is like a tornado of fire. It’s unrelenting and seems to have this twirling, spinning quality about it. In my mind, I just kept seeing an hourglass, with the sand swirling down. It’s playing off the idea that the bigger your mountain gets, the more you realize it’s built out of sand. This was one of the songs I wrote before I found out I was going to be a dad, so at the time, I was just a 36-year-old metal musician on a ninth record feeling a little burnt out and just a little unsure of what my place in the world was. We used to call that a midlife crisis and people used to buy Corvettes, but not in this economy. So, the song is really about wanting to find purpose.” \n\n<b>“Wake Up”</b>\n“It started off as an instrumental loop that our drummer Tino came up with, where he did all the acoustic guitars and everything. It was just this super powerful ’90s alt-rock shoegaze thing, like you’ve just transformed into an eagle and you’re soaring over the Grand Canyon. It feels very dreamlike. Lyrically, it’s about being present and practicing your awareness, which sounds like some esoteric hippie bullshit, but you can actually do it, and it can actually improve your life. It’s not pseudoscience. All we have is now; the past is gone; the future is inaccessible. So just be here and smell the roses a little bit.” \n\n<b>“Flowers”</b>\n“This one is really heavy, but it has this sort of tender quality to it. Lyrically, the song is about the things in your life that you could call a storm inside of you—it’s different for everybody—and understanding that while that never goes away, you can use the rain from the storm to feed the flowers. Personally, I suffer from a major depressive disorder, anxiety, and just being neurotic and offbeat and weird, like a lot of musicians are. But the things that make me sad are often the inspiration for the songs, which can then make other people less sad, which then makes me feel less sad.”\n\n<b>“Another Miracle”</b>\n“This one’s definitely a both-hands-up-to-the-sky, pleading-to-the-universe kind of song. If you can just dole out miracles, what’s another miracle? Can I get another one? If you’ve got a hundred dollars, what’s a dollar? I think everyone has moments in life when they either speak to a higher power or, if you don’t believe in that yourself, you can still ask for a miracle. Hopelessness is a last resort. This is a plea to not end up that way.” \n\n<b>“Contact”</b>\n“This is your quintessential UAP disclosure song. We’re in an era now where they’ve been having congressional meetings about it. I’ve been a science fiction fan since I was born, and probably before that in a past life. When we were working on the record, there was just so much exciting stuff happening all at once in this field. Now it’s kind of slowed down, but for a minute there it was super saturated. And this song is just the idea of ‘take me with you,’ written from the perspective of somebody who’s maybe a little bit too far gone. That’s always kind of fun.”\n\n<b>“Parable”</b>\n“I would say this is in the same vein as ‘Another Miracle.’ It’s when you’re having one of those moments when you sort of disassociate from your life when your circumstances get either bad or just so far removed from what you think you want, and you’re like, ‘Holy shit, am I in a play right now? Is this some sort of Shakespearean tragedy that’s meant to teach a major life lesson?’ I think sometimes we all feel like we’re in <i>The Truman Show</i>, where we think, ‘Surely this is some kind of manual for what happens if you make the wrong decisions.’ You’re learning what not to do.”\n\n<b>“Somewhere in Between”</b>\n“This one is about not knowing how you feel, which, I think, is just as devastating as knowing that you feel bad. I think sometimes uncertainty and unknowing and feeling like you're in between two feelings is sort of like not being on one island or the other when the rescue plane comes. You’re somewhere in the water, and you’re gonna get left behind.” \n\n<b>“Swallow”</b>\n“This one’s probably the most feel-bad song. It’s the idea of feeling disconnected from yourself and how what society pushes on us as we get older is mostly self-destructive. Like the remedy for feeling disconnected is to do things that would cause more disconnection, just for the sake of selling you something. And the three things society will sell you are transience, decadence, or dissidence—which are all things that just lead to more emptiness. The song is saying, ‘Pick your poison and swallow it.’” \n\n<b>“Infinite”</b>\n“It’s funny—this was one of the first songs we wrote, at least instrumentally, and it ended up as the last song on the album. It just felt like a capstone in the same way that ‘A Waltz’ felt like a good opener. They both feel like bookends. Lyrically, it’s about the idea of trying to connect more with our consciousness rather than just our bodies or just this limited reality, because our minds are really, really powerful. They're the source of a lot of our joy but also of a lot of our suffering, so be mindful.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Another

therapy for the brokenhearted.","standard":"Five years elapsed between the release of Austra’s fourth album (2020’s <i>HiRUDiN</i>) and her fifth, and so on <i>Chin Up Buttercup</i>’s opening track, Katie Stelmanis conveniently provides a recap of her journey up to this point. “Amnesia” begins as a baroque piano ballad that provides a distant echo of the labyrinthine art pop she released in the late 2000s under her birth name, before a mid-song shift thrusts us into the strobe-lit electro underworld she’s created as Austra. “My heart is not the same without you in my arms,” she cries out at the chorus, setting the thematic tone for an album that provides rave-based therapy for the brokenhearted, whether she’s setting love-triangle drama to a Kylie-esque nu-disco thump on “Math Equation” or channeling her innermost desires into the equally dreamy and dramatic techno odyssey “Fallen Cloud.” But, true to its name, <i>Chin Up Buttercup</i> is also a reminder to not surrender to the sorrow, and with the breakbeat-fueled irreverence of the title track and the sassy synth-pop of “Think Twice,” Stelmanis wields her cathedral-sized voice to playfully theatrical effect like a goth Gaga.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Chin up

searching artistry makes these pearls of the Baroque repertoire glisten.","standard":"Most of the music on French pianist David Fray’s album <i>Baroque Encores</i> is drawn from <i>L’Enfant oublié</i>, a theatrical project cocreated in 2023 with Fray’s actress wife Chiara Muti about Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France. Appropriately some of the pieces are by 18th-century French composers, with Fray’s delicate legerdemain in Rameau's trill-filled <i>Le rappel des oiseaux</i> making a delectable impression. Fray brings a whimsical, quasi-improvisational approach to Couperin’s <i>Les baricades mistérieuses</i>, and vividly catches the topsy-turvy twists of temperament in Royer’s <i>Le vertigo</i>.\n\nThe rest of the album is dominated by Bach, a favorite composer of Fray’s. His stately account of the “Andante” from Organ Sonata No. 4, which opens his program, mingles grandeur and mystery, while the popular “Air” from the Orchestral Suite No. 3 is imbued with a serene poetry. The “Larghetto” from Harpsichord Concerto No. 1 highlights the luminous tonal beauty of Fray’s playing, a constant pleasure in this soul-warming recital.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano","Baroque Era","Solo Instrumental"],"name":"Baroque Encores","playParams":{"id":"1827629889","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/baroque-encores/1827629889","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5W3fCWV43YTLzAv4i0cim2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827629889/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"206471475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/206471475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763099559632,"RTCI":0}}},"1829710309":{"id":"1829710309","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829710309?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"1914","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/1914/1076835062","artwork":{"bgColor":"1b1312","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d7ae7c","textColor2":"e79d59","textColor3":"b28f67","textColor4":"be824b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/db/6a/35/db6a3579-712e-2de8-b269-e5b2cff9489f/810185193820.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"1b1312","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"d7ae7c","textColor2":"e79d59","textColor3":"b28f67","textColor4":"be824b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/db/6a/35/db6a3579-712e-2de8-b269-e5b2cff9489f/810185193820.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Viribus Unitis","playParams":{"id":"1829710309","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/viribus-unitis/1829710309","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7qzCmpi5YBUt8Wcug8Kiz7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829710309/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1076835062","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1076835062?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763097671674,"RTCI":0}}},"1829835370":{"id":"1829835370","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829835370?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cheap Trick","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cheap-trick/461577","artwork":{"bgColor":"8b8c8c","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"150e08","textColor2":"1d1918","textColor3":"2c2722","textColor4":"33302f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2f/2c/0d/2f2c0d85-8d18-dcae-6710-c8222a9be2cc/4099964186307.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ececec","textColor2":"d3d3d3","textColor3":"c0c0c0","textColor4":"acacac","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0d/b9/0b/0db90bec-53fa-14f5-f10d-d65fc7910834/4d917de5-41f3-48cd-9585-679060c4cd5b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"8b8c8c","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"150e08","textColor2":"1d1918","textColor3":"2c2722","textColor4":"33302f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2f/2c/0d/2f2c0d85-8d18-dcae-6710-c8222a9be2cc/4099964186307.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"On their 21st album, the kings of power pop still want you to want them.","standard":"As it turns out, the kings of power pop still want you to want them. “Go ahead and touch me,” Robin Zander sings on the title track of Cheap Trick’s 21st(!) album.

TDWP introduced the album to fans with double singles “Where the Flowers Never Grow,” an emo anthem about finding calm in the mundane, and “Wave,” a hushed ballad about following life where it leads us.

More like WTF. Even when you consider Faith No More growler Mike Patton’s long history of outside-the-box collaborations with everyone from Björk to Sparks to The Melvins to John Zorn, this alliance with North Carolina folk-rock crooners The Avett Brothers could be the most unlikely. Then again, when you’ve spent your whole life dedicated to the art of transgression, what could be stranger than making something more traditional? \n\nFrom the opening acoustic refrain of “Dark Night of My Soul,” it’s clear that their debut as AVTT/PTTN is planted firmly in the Avetts’ brand of cinematic Americana. And for the most part, Patton plays the role of respectful houseguest, by leaning into the smooth, soulful baritone he first flexed on Faith No More’s cover of The Commodores’ “Easy,” and providing the extra oomph required to push rootsy power ballads like “Too Awesome” and “Received” over the top. However, his corrupting influence is given room to roam on the bizarro New-Waved rocker “Heaven’s Breath” (which sounds like Nick Cave covering ZZ Top’s <i>Eliminator</i>) and a gloriously gonzo rendition of the Pete Seeger standard “Ox Driver’s Song,” where Patton adopts the fire-and-brimstone affectations of a Southern preacher.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Folk-Rock","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"name":"AVTT/PTTN","playParams":{"id":"1834178993","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/avtt-pttn/1834178993","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5EYC96Q4BEQFr2Xtk3BJlf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834178993/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"62487918","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/62487918?l=en-US"},{"id":"2987396","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2987396?l=en-US"},{"id":"1834238691","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1834238691?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763113393684,"RTCI":0}}},"1834212767":{"id":"1834212767","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834212767?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Thee Headcoats","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/thee-headcoats/6742630","artwork":{"bgColor":"051018","hasP3":false,"height":4016,"textColor1":"bdd2da","textColor2":"dacea0","textColor3":"98abb3","textColor4":"afa884","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/38/c4/de/38c4de6d-2ab5-6190-9709-0d3811725005/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4016},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"051018","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"bdd2da","textColor2":"dacea0","textColor3":"98abb3","textColor4":"afa884","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/38/c4/de/38c4de6d-2ab5-6190-9709-0d3811725005/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"The Sherlock Holmes Rhythm ’n’ Beat Vernacular","playParams":{"id":"1834212767","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sherlock-holmes-rhythm-n-beat-vernacular/1834212767","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2yeWJ5nN6Bv93XfUbHSco8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834212767/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6742630","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6742630?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763097275762,"RTCI":0}}},"1834732561":{"id":"1834732561","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834732561?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lawrence Hart","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lawrence-hart/286587757","artwork":{"bgColor":"141515","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"ff00ad","textColor2":"f4019c","textColor3":"cf048e","textColor4":"c70581","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b6/a1/f1/b6a1f1c3-7c5f-955f-2356-238c379d1f42/887832019963.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"121412","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f4b786","textColor2":"9cc5f1","textColor3":"c7966f","textColor4":"80a2c5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/92/79/5d9279ed-d021-79ce-1517-7a7bee232b91/bf8bb284-681b-4c30-9c7a-639efeccb8ef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"141515","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ff00ad","textColor2":"f4019c","textColor3":"cf048e","textColor4":"c70581","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b6/a1/f1/b6a1f1c3-7c5f-955f-2356-238c379d1f42/887832019963.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The UK producer’s second project of 2025 is for movement, not reflection.","standard":"Lawrence Hart’s <i>ASKING FOR A FRIEND</i> arrives seven months after his debut album, <i>Come in Out of the Rain</i>.

It opens with “HYPERSTATE” and “LOSE CONTROL,” restless tracks teetering on the edge of unraveling in their climb toward ecstasy. From there, more textures emerge: The classic house of “THEN YOU’LL KNOW” erupts into blown-out techno fuzz, “JUST BELIEVE” channels Burial’s spectral groove, and “TRYING” ascends to a sky-high level of serenity. While moments of melancholy and vulnerability weave throughout the record, the hands-in-the-air euphoria of closing track “LIVING WITHOUT U” is pure release.","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"ASKING FOR A FRIEND","playParams":{"id":"1834732561","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/asking-for-a-friend/1834732561","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1mwn3eJUlBO1M2eNrQUBGz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834732561/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"286587757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/286587757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763114095000,"RTCI":0}}},"1834785609":{"id":"1834785609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834785609?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Nightmares On Wax","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nightmares-on-wax/39883158","artwork":{"bgColor":"b2963f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0806","textColor2":"110f08","textColor3":"2c2512","textColor4":"322a13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/37/fc/a1/37fca1b8-bef9-c0ed-86ed-b20c91a27675/5056818802324.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111b15","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1f3a2","textColor2":"a8cfa7","textColor3":"c4c786","textColor4":"8aab8a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d2/13/31/d21331a9-6949-a4e0-3430-1fb8f9ed3499/2b0a6432-ecea-4eb7-99a1-2c14310f1a04.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"b2963f","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0a0806","textColor2":"110f08","textColor3":"2c2512","textColor4":"322a13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/37/fc/a1/37fca1b8-bef9-c0ed-86ed-b20c91a27675/5056818802324.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"George Evelyn on his eclectic creation: “It’s got the rough and the smooth.”","standard":"The 10th Nightmares On Wax album is named after a speaker George Evelyn’s mum bought him when he was 13. “It changed my world,” he tells Apple Music. “Once I had it, everybody wanted to be around me. It’s like that fork in the road.”\n\nNow based in Ibiza, Evelyn is feeling nostalgic for his early days in Leeds and the speaker box that led him to meet his Nightmares On Wax collaborator, Kevin Harper, through the Bradford body-popping scene. “Music has been saving my life constantly,” he says. “Sometimes these memories come up, and I realize I could have made one step in a different direction and the situation would be different.”\n\nEvelyn has produced a glorious celebration of heritage, soundsystem culture, and the heroes who shaped him, with a cast of characters who all bring their own details and distinctions including Yasiin Bey taking on a more melodic role in “Bang Bien” and Greentea Peng’s formative experiences of listening to Fugees and stopping off at Nando’s in “I Remember.” From the dubplate drop of “Echo45” to the edgy soul of “True,” Evelyn has taken care of every detail. “They call me Mr Tweaks,” he says. “When an album’s been mastered and it’s ready, I go back and listen to it fresh because I’ve forgotten all the nuances that I’ve been picking apart and being analytical about. As much as I love sharing my music with the world, it’s me who’s got to live with it. I love it so much that I have to be comfortable with everything in it.”\n\nThe real test comes when he hears it while he’s in the kitchen, driving, or going for a walk. “You can sit down and be very analytical, but actually that’s not how you listen to music,” he says. “It’s good for it to float in the background.” So what would his 13-year-old self think as he listens to it? “It fills me with gratitude,” he says. “My intention for every day is to feel great and to spread light and love and be kind.”\n\nRead on as Evelyn takes you through <i>Echo45 Sound System</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Echo45, We Are!” (with Oscar Jerome)</b>\n“Oscar [Jerome] and I already had a connection because I did a remix with him, and I think he’s an incredible musician. I curated an unplugged event out at El Silencio in Ibiza and invited him out. This project was in the back of my mind, and I was like, ‘Look, I want to do this thing, but it’s not a song.’ I wanted to do a soulful, ’80s-style jingle, so it’s like a signature. Even though you’ve got different expressions of <i>Echo45</i> all the way through the project, I wanted this to define what it’s about. It needed to be soulful—not cheesy—and Oscar pulled it off amazingly.”\n\n<b>“Dive Into” (with Louis VI)</b>\n“The track was actually recorded in Leeds back in 2018 with a great friend and amazing guitarist, Chris Dawkins, playing bass and JD73 on keys. Initially, it was just a vibe and then I worked more on it in my studio in Ibiza, bringing in the flute samples. I used some chopped-up guitar samples from some ancient records, I was doing a bit of alchemy, and I sent Louis [VI] two or three tracks, but this is the one he resonated with. He sent the track back to me, and I’m like, ‘Whoa, I didn’t see that.’ It was so deep and rootsy. He brought something out in the music, but the music also brought something out in him.”\n\n<b>“Desire” (with Liam Bailey, Haile Supreme)</b>\n“I first heard Haile Supreme’s track ‘Danjahrous’ in 2019 and two weeks later we got in touch with him. He lived in Brooklyn, and it turned out I had a gig there, so he came and we spent a night out together. A few weeks later, he came to my studio out in Ibiza and we wrote five or six songs in three days. It was like we’d always known each other. He appeared quite heavily on my last project, [2021 album] <i>Shout Out! To Freedom...</i>, but the first thing we wrote in those sessions was ‘Desire.’ Liam brought a rawness, and I love the message.”\n\n<b>“Bang Bien” (with Yasiin Bey)</b>\n“It was just after lockdown, and I’d sent four or five tracks to Yasiin Bey’s team and he was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I love them all.’ Everybody was shocked, even me. He lives in Barcelona and was coming to Ibiza for three days. This was the track I was gunning for. When I’m in recording sessions, we always get into deep chats, and I think that connection’s really important. Yasiin was telling me about his lineage and how he had Native American heritage in there. I already had this idea that I wanted him to be more melodic and meditative, with a spiritual undertone, rather than straight-up rapping. He let loose completely in the studio—this feels like an ancient call. It was beautiful to watch.”\n\n<b>“Echo45” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“Liam [Bailey] totally freestyled it. He came out to Ibiza and we got into a vibe. Here, we’re going into the zone of being in a soundclash dance where you’d drop your dubplate, the moment that represents your sound. I’ve always got loops and ideas, so I’d play stuff and Liam would start freestyling, and I’d get my phone and record. Once all the artists are out, I go back into my zone and work on this stuff in solitude. It’s such a pleasure to do.”\n\n<b>“True” (with Sadie Walker)</b>\n“I first started working with Sadie [Walker] in 2018 when she came on the <i>Shape the Future</i> tour, and she’s an amazing vocalist. She’s such a lovely soul and she’s got a vulnerable purity in her voice. I said to her, ‘You need to write something that’s true. It could be celebrating something, you could be missing somebody.’ The song’s about her grandma, which is such a beautiful thing. We did that rough and smooth thing again within the production. I got a good friend of mine—Big Danny Kane—on the bass, and I really wanted him to just slap it, so it’s got a sleazy and sluggish edge.”\n\n<b>“I Remember” (with Greentea Peng)</b>\n“The connection with Greentea Peng happened remotely in lockdown. This is her remembering herself as a kid and growing up in music. What she’s delivered is so beautiful, and I love how it connects the dots from a generational point of view, that lineage from DJing, MCing, and breakdancing. Hip-hop has been a big part of my life. There are no rules of what you’re inspired by, and hip-hop culture taught me that I can create anything with minimal means. Before I even knew what sampling was, I got into music by turning the turntable into an instrument and chopping in bits of records.”\n\n<b>“Starwood Bound” (with Sadie Walker)</b>\n“When I’m putting a band together to go on tour, I always like to get in the studio and jam with them because it’s good for camaraderie. Back in 2017, Sadie and I had gone in to work on a completely different track, but it wasn’t really happening. I put the beat there and the music evolved over time as I got deeper into it. With my DJ head on, the approach was not a verse and chorus, but just a groover. I think it creates a nice space within the record as well. Again, it’s got a dirty bass and this angelic voice floating over the top.”\n\n<b>“Ain’t so…” (with LSK)</b>\n“LSK—Leigh Stephen Kenny—is a very good old friend of mine. He was one of the co-collaborators in the artwork for [legendary 1995 Nightmares On Wax album] <i>Smokers Delight</i>. We wrote this song together in 2016. It feels like you’re in church. Production-wise, it’s quite different for me. It’s got a bit of an eerie kind of feel to it. This is the only track on the album that you only get a snippet of in the continuous mix. But go to listen to the full version and the message gets even deeper.”\n\n<b>“Mumzie Cut” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“My memories of soundclashes are that you’d always have a moment where the selector’s been playing these songs, but then they’ll come and drop a dubplate. Me and Liam [Bailey] were talking about Dennis Brown, who we sample here, and all these amazing singers who would do specials for soundsystems. And this is our special. I’ve got to give credit to Liam for the lyrical content and the vibe that he brings.”\n\n<b>“Holding On” (with Ladi6)</b>\n“This was recorded with Ladi6 in Wellington, New Zealand. It was another song that was floating around, so she wrote what it brought out in her. She brings a very different energy—this feels like an expression of something that has been held onto that needs to be let go of, which I love. To me, soul music is not a style, it’s a feeling, an expression, which is what this song is. Then you’ve got the dirty, dubby, disgusting bassline rumbling away underneath.”\n\n<b>“Wind of Change” (with Yarah Bravo)</b>\n“Yarah and I always have deep and wonderful chats. She came out to Ibiza to do a sunset session at El Silencio, and in the studio she was attracted to this particular beat. Yarah brought that reminder that everybody has the opportunity to change, no matter where they are or what they’re going through. It’s important to be aware of what you’re saying, what you’re expressing and what people are going to feel when they hear your music. Throughout my time, it’s amazing to hear some of the feedback I’ve had on songs—somebody will come and say the most random thing to you about a track and what it’s done for them. Even if it raises one person’s vibration, that’s more than enough.”\n\n<b>“Hop — To — Mystic” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“Liam freestyled the first two lines and we decided to write the rest off that. It’s a beautiful ending to the project. This is like when someone comes in at the end of the night and puts a blanket over you. The song tucks you in! Pulling more on the roots side of reggae, I keep giving nods to amazing singers like Dennis Brown and Mykal Rose. I think Liam has the capacity to deliver in that realm, with his incredible energy. When he came up with that line, ‘It feels right just where we are,’ I’m like, ‘Yo, man. My spine’s getting cold.’”\n\n<b>“Echo 45 Sound System (Full Continuous Mix)”</b>\n“The continuous mix came first. When you’re putting albums together, the hardest part is always the running order. I’ll give a shout-out to Skratch Bastid, who did the cuts and scratches to give it more of a live feel. It just brings a bit more. Compiling it was actually the most enjoyable part for me.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Echo45 Sound

themes, brash electronics: 5SOS embrace chaos and change on LP6.","standard":"Released just months after the debut solo albums from members Michael Clifford and Calum Hood, this sixth studio album sees 5 Seconds of Summer reflect on recurring themes of loneliness and change. It also flirts with edgy, anthemic electronics inspired by Gorillaz, N.E.R.D. and The Prodigy, from the title track’s baggy throwback beat to the moody alt-pop of “Telephone Busy” and “No. 1 Obsession.” \n\nAs broadcast by the shout-along refrain of lead single “NOT OK”—“Hey, I’m not OK/I like the darker side of me”—the album spends considerable time exploring downbeat lyrical concerns. “Ghost” and “Sick of Myself” are back-to-back portraits of co-dependency (with some chemical dependency in there too), while “The Rocks” drops a pointed parallel to the band’s homeland of Australia over spiky pop punk: “Don’t you get sick of it?/Living in isolation/Cut off like an island nation.” On “Boyband,” 5SOS hit back at that term’s crowd-pleasing connotations, likening themselves to monkeys dancing on command. Even the more polished balladry on <i>EVERYONE’S A STAR!</i> betrays an undercurrent of anxiety, as on “I’m Scared I’ll Never Sleep Again.” That’s not to say the four band members sound at a loss for answers, though. If anything, these songs embrace the careening chaos of messy life transitions and the smirking fun of partying out of pure desperation.","tagline":"New

throwback singer-songwriter leans into his classic country influences.","standard":"You’d be forgiven if you thought Colter Wall hailed from a bygone era. His gruff baritone alone is enough to make Wall an outlier in contemporary country music, while song titles like “It’s Getting So (That a Man Can’t Go into Town Just to Have Him a Drink)” read like the vintage-tinged musings of a truly old soul. On his fifth studio album, the Saskatchewan-born singer-songwriter takes an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach to his beloved sound, leaning into the classic country influences that first earned him a cult following. \n\nAs such, Wall and co-producer/touring guitarist Pat Lyons set up shop at famed Nashville recording outpost RCA Studio A, seeking to connect to the space’s long history of hosting country icons like Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. There are honky-tonkers galore, like the winking opening track “1800 Miles,” a tough-guy two-step on which Wall asserts, “I don’t know what you think you’ve been told/If I ever was for sale, I’ve never sold,” and the juke joint lament “Living by the Hour.” Softer moments like the Bill Callahan-esque ballad “My Present Just Gets Past Me” are equally striking, showcasing Wall’s range as not just a celebrated vocalist but a compelling storyteller.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"name":"Memories and

innovative club sound continues on this electrifying sequel.","standard":"Don’t expect to relax into <i>EUSEXUA Afterglow</i>, the companion record to FKA twigs’ highly acclaimed January 2025 release <i>EUSEXUA</i>. Despite the soft connotations of the title, <i>…Afterglow</i> is perhaps even more intense and experimental than its predecessor, and undoubtedly hits just as hard. From the bone-rattling industrial boom of “Love Crimes” through to “Stereo Boy,” with its squelching, futuristic synths and detached, floating vocals, twigs crafts an otherworldly sonic experience that explores the erotic thrill of falling in love with life itself.\n\nThemes of freedom, pleasure and maximizing every moment recur—Wwhether it’s “Slushy” playing out like a dreamy reading of twigs’ gratitude journal, the slow, syrupy hip-hop beats of “Cheap Hotel” (co-written with enigmatic production outfit Two Shell), or “Piece of Mine,” beginning with glitchy beats and whispering tones before evolving into smooth, seductive R&B. In anchoring the innovation with shrewd pop sensibilities—see also: garage-influenced PinkPantheress collaboration “Wild and Alone” and “HARD,” a raunchy dance cut that invokes echoes of Janet Jackson—twigs strikes the perfect balance between her underground roots and her well-measured transition into the mainstream. “Sushi,” five-and-a-half minutes of thumping groove and an earworm chorus which sees twigs narrate a week-long date (dancing! Paris! Pilates!), is perhaps the best example of her ability to straddle the line between both worlds—a clear standout with limitless replay value.","tagline":"New

She channels the bluster of 2000s NYC on “Get Money” and brushes off a breakup on the sneering yet soulful “Pain.” And on the Biggie-referencing rags-to-riches number “It Was All a Dream,” she details the setbacks that led to her time off, then pushes past them: “Now I pay my mom’s bills off rap/From this day forward, I ain’t ever holding back.”","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"iight bet!","playParams":{"id":"1843982350","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/iight-bet/1843982350","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7eeKZCUXa6fxPOCGaCPqfY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1843982350/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1233293139","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1233293139?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763132425586,"RTCI":0}}},"1844260739":{"id":"1844260739","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844260739?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Young Oceans","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/young-oceans/513397875","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"1e3337","textColor2":"582031","textColor3":"4b5c5f","textColor4":"794d5a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/46/0b/87/460b87f0-f5b6-8642-de06-391ee882109b/859719438471_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"ffffff","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"1e3337","textColor2":"582031","textColor3":"4b5c5f","textColor4":"794d5a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/46/0b/87/460b87f0-f5b6-8642-de06-391ee882109b/859719438471_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Christian","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Love Like Raindrops Made of Light","playParams":{"id":"1844260739","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-03","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-like-raindrops-made-of-light/1844260739","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6EwSzxPcvgqlgHngQ0x2SU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844260739/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"513397875","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/513397875?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763104299755,"RTCI":0}}},"1844485682":{"id":"1844485682","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844485682?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Lil Gnar","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-gnar/548373501","artwork":{"bgColor":"171916","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"dbb73a","textColor2":"d6b021","textColor3":"b49733","textColor4":"b0911f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6a/c2/21/6ac2210a-a966-4cb3-3639-4860d381a266/4099964207842.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c6d5f0","textColor2":"f1ad7d","textColor3":"a1aec3","textColor4":"c48e67","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/7d/11/f3/7d11f324-89bd-50ee-099a-dfdd51ecffd9/27dacf0f-1e64-47aa-9ce0-d6b8482bd020.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"171916","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"dbb73a","textColor2":"d6b021","textColor3":"b49733","textColor4":"b0911f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6a/c2/21/6ac2210a-a966-4cb3-3639-4860d381a266/4099964207842.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Bask in bass and vibes on the ATL phenom’s DIE BOUT IT follow-up.","standard":"After initially rising amid a youthful wave of Atlanta rap talents in the late 2010s, Lil Gnar showed his staying power with the release of 2022’s <i>DIE BOUT IT</i>.

It was on the same stage two years earlier that the singer-songwriter’s struggles with anxiety and Tourette syndrome were publicly exposed in a vulnerable performance. By then one of Britain’s biggest pop stars, as beloved for his playful self-awareness as his breakup ballads, Capaldi soon took the decision to step back from performing to work on his health. \n\nGlastonbury 2025 marked his reintroduction to the limelight, and he performed a new song, “Survive,” as part of a surprise set. That song opens this EP, released four-and-a-half months later, and there’s unavoidable poignancy to a slow-burning pop-rock anthem that confesses fragility and hopelessness in its verses but roars with defiance and resilience in the chorus (“I swear to God I’ll survive/If it kills me to/I’m gonna get up and try/If it’s the last thing I do”). The three songs that follow—the folky “Something in the Heavens,” a skillfully restrained “Almost,” and piano-ballad-cum-stadium-anthem “The Day That I Die”—underline that Capaldi is still a master of transmitting yearning in ways that feel both firmly personal and relatable. The struggle to persevere in the face of heartbreak and loss remains one of his key lyrical currencies—but, given his journey to recording them, these songs also carry a sense of new and happy beginnings.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Survive - EP","playParams":{"id":"1845325742","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/survive-ep/1845325742","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4HXHuDnVGEl2Mwz6X1xlOe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845325742/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1213405916","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1213405916?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763114350120,"RTCI":0}}},"1845569485":{"id":"1845569485","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845569485?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Summer Walker","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/summer-walker/990402287","artwork":{"bgColor":"0d1114","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ddebff","textColor2":"cbdaee","textColor3":"b3bfcf","textColor4":"a5b1c3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/10/9c/a0109c6c-8226-3b4b-ccef-ff4c9da2935e/25UM1IM55562.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"0a0d11","hasP3":false,"height":2,"textColor1":"f2f2f3","textColor2":"e6e6e7","textColor3":"c4c5c5","textColor4":"babbbc","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/54/83/20/54832087-7e14-8734-0635-2308ebc20dfe/6e4789120f81c20bd3e9f9c2c4f0e5ef_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407663522_2422896257.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"cbd7ee","gradient":{"color":"cbd7ee","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"e6e7e7","textColor3":"c4c5c6","textColor4":"babcbc","textGradient":["000000","e6e7e7"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/72/c2/dc/72c2dcf5-1823-716d-5b4a-8a46f24ce54c/1674d3fb6f3bfe66f3e8bca58f2b051c_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407736367_2423553371.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ccd2dd","textColor2":"b8c1cd","textColor3":"a3a8b1","textColor4":"939aa4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ec/30/3e/ec303e40-3500-a09d-6f50-378fd9c1a255/a35b2121-4561-4b20-95a1-803add29827c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"a7a49f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"111012","textColor2":"262323","textColor3":"2f2e2e","textColor4":"3f3d3c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/e2/80/b6e280d8-a027-7a2c-b068-9b2181e2a204/03748de3-a661-4ec7-a07a-56b8da1448be.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"0d1114","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ddebff","textColor2":"cbdaee","textColor3":"b3bfcf","textColor4":"a5b1c3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/10/9c/a0109c6c-8226-3b4b-ccef-ff4c9da2935e/25UM1IM55562.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B powerhouse chooses herself on the finale of a modern-classic trilogy.","standard":"Summer Walker spent nearly a decade after the release of her 2018 mixtape <i>Last Day of Summer</i> wearing her heart on her sleeve. The R&B powerhouse has invited listeners into her tumultuous world through honest lyricism, storytelling, and diary-like ruminations that chronicle the messiness of romance, self-love, and everything in between. Her 2019 debut album <i>Over It</i> and its 2021 follow-up <i>Still Over It</i> offer a layered narrative of self-discovery as she navigates her ever-evolving perspective on the sobering truths about relationships and emotional boundaries. However, with <i>Finally Over It</i>—the final chapter in the trilogy—she retires the self-proclaimed lover-girl persona and chooses herself, no matter what that looks like to others. Along for the ride is an all-star lineup of guests, including Latto, Mariah the Scientist, Doja Cat, SAILORR, Chris Brown, Anderson .Paak, GloRilla, Sexyy Red, Monaleo, 21 Savage, Brent Faiyaz, Teddy Swims, and frequent collaborator Bryson Tiller. \n\nAcross 18 tracks, <i>Finally Over It</i> is divided evenly into two parts, For Better and For Worse, which mirrors the album art’s wedding theme and alludes to the project’s unifying idea: the cynicism that can come from the pursuit of romantic relationships and the choices that are left when love feels impossible. The first half showcases Walker’s ability to save herself from entanglements that no longer serve her (“Robbed You,” “Situationship”). “No,” which interpolates Beyoncé’s 2003 song “Yes,” is about standing firm against one-sided demands: “You want me to cater to you, never tell you no/You want me to lose myself just to keep your home/But the answer’s no.” Yet on “1-800-Heartbreak,” she croons about her loneliness after the end of a relationship. Not every song on the first half deals with fed-up declarations and self-assured boasts. Walker still leans into her lover-girl ways (“Baby,” “Give Me a Reason”) and gives second chances (“Heart of a Woman”), but even the most broken relationships are opportunities to learn something new. \n\nThe second half, For Worse, finds Walker giving up on finding unconditional love, trading the idea of a traditional relationship for one that prioritizes material comforts. She ditches the idea of being with her usual type on “FMT” and lets it be known she’s only into men who can provide for her needs financially on the swaggering “Baller,” while keeping her walls up even though she might be falling in love (“Stitch Me Up,” “Allegedly”). Throughout all the ups and downs within the different vignettes Walker explores, there’s solace in knowing that through all the choices depicted—good, bad, and possibly terrible—she emphasizes choosing oneself, for better or for worse.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Finally Over It","playParams":{"id":"1845569485","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/finally-over-it/1845569485","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5X1Y5kGtPQyu4UhjSuTRhx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1845569485/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"990402287","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/990402287?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763131081742,"RTCI":0}}},"1846236584":{"id":"1846236584","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846236584?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ITZY","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/itzy/1451964345","artwork":{"bgColor":"3c3937","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f2ece8","textColor2":"d9d4d2","textColor3":"cec8c5","textColor4":"bab5b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c2/9e/8b/c29e8be0-0898-86a0-11e7-927214dff34f/8809928954103_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"06070a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f2cec6","textColor2":"d7c9ce","textColor3":"c3a6a1","textColor4":"ada2a7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0d/b6/8e/0db68e4b-860d-e49f-9545-a312c1d50af7/ce549210-ca49-44c7-830d-26f5425cc25e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3c3937","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f2ece8","textColor2":"d9d4d2","textColor3":"cec8c5","textColor4":"bab5b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c2/9e/8b/c29e8be0-0898-86a0-11e7-927214dff34f/8809928954103_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A six-track project that focuses on...focus.","standard":"<i>TUNNEL VISION</i>, the 11th mini album from K-pop girl group ITZY, is far from a debut for the five-member JYP Entertainment squad (Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna), which has been active since 2019, but it embraces the kind of goal-oriented ambition usually associated with rookies. The EP opens with the mantra-like self-empowerment track “Focus” before launching into its main, anthemic statement: “TUNNEL VISION.” The Dem Jointz-produced dance track blends hip-hop and Afrobeats elements for a declaration that the group is “never backing down” from the grind required for their pop star dreams. Elsewhere on the six-track project, ITZY brings the theme of “focus” to the subject of relationships, challenging a would-be lover to make a move on the punchy dance-pop track “DYT” and giving up on an unfulfilling romance to concentrate on yourself on the retro-video-game-inspired “8-BIT HEART.” ","tagline":"New Mini Album"},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"TUNNEL VISION -

Canadian house duo crafts a laidback set to match your flow.","standard":"Canadian producer/DJ duo Bob Moses “wanted to craft a mix that would take listeners on a journey,” Tom Howie, one-half of the group, tells Apple Music about their exclusive Fitness mix for yoga. “It goes from warming up to building intensity, and then cooling down and settling back into a chill vibe.” Music has always been a key part of their exercise regimen, whether they’re at home (New York for Howie; LA for his partner, Jimmy Vallance) or during one of the many days they spend on the road every year performing their sprawling house sets. “We listen to something every time we work out,” says Vallance. “It’s one of the only times we get to take in music more passively—just let it move us instead of analyzing it.”\n\nEarly on in the set, Jamie xx’s “Breather” is a gentle suggestion to remain present. “As soon as we heard it, we were struck by the message in the vocal,” Howie says. “We thought it would be perfect near the beginning, after some cinematic buildup, to remind you to be intentional once the energy increases.” Later, DJ Koze’s “Buschtaxi” pushes the mix toward euphoria. “It’s so deep and trancey,” Vallance says. “We placed it when the workout might be testing people—it’s fun and ecstatic, taking you from that darker intensity into release and calm.” They extend that calm with “No One Has to Know,” from their own 2025 album, <i>BLINK</i>. “We get a bit more ethereal and vibey at the end,” adds Vallance, “bringing you back down to a place of rest and accomplishment.”","tagline":"New

That’s clear on opener “gettin’ old,” a melodic and relatable account of feeling rudderless while trying to transition from adolescence into adulthood.

The “panic attack version” of “tin foil hat” finds Cooke at her most inventive, taking the wild-eyed imagery of conspiracy theorists and applying it to the all-consuming feeling of romantic jealousy and paranoia.

Spanish star finds her muse in theology books: “This is maximalism.”","standard":"For ROSALÍA, her fourth full-length album <i>LUX</i> only has “little pieces” of her in the lyrics of its songs—and she prefers it that way. “I think the best fiction has this blurry line, the sweet spot between what’s personal and what’s universal, what’s detailed and what’s abstract, what’s implicit and what’s explicit,” the Spanish star tells Apple Music. “It’s both. Because I wrote it, there has to be some sort of truth for me in it. But at the same time, I think it’s much more about the other than about myself.” \n\nThe “other,” in this case, is a group of saints—Saint Rose of Lima, Anandamayi Ma, Hildegard von Bingen, Sufi mystic Rabia al-Adawiyya, and other martyrs across cultures, centuries, and continents—that ROSALÍA voraciously studied in the wake of her third album, 2022’s <i>MOTOMAMI</i>. Instead of immediately writing about the emotional turmoil she’d weathered in its aftermath—a period that included the end of her engagement to former collaborator Rauw Alejandro—she found the muses of her next project in theology books. After immersing herself in the stories of these women of faith, ROSALÍA blended their experiences, and their tongues, with hers. “Where did they come from? What was the language that would be spoken there?” she says. “There were a lot of women that were extremely interesting to me that were nuns, they were poets. And I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to read what they actually wrote. I’m going to try to explain these stories.’”\n\nAcross <i>LUX</i>, ROSALÍA sings in multiple languages—her native Spanish and Catalan, but also Arabic, Japanese, French, Portuguese, Italian, Ukrainian, and German, among others—to invoke these saints while telling stories of flower-strewn funerals, doomed romance, unrequited love, and crises of faith in multiple forms. If 2018’s <i>EL MAL QUERER</i> introduced her singular fusion of flamenco and pop to the world, and <i>MOTOMAMI</i> brought reggaetón into the mix, <i>LUX</i> builds on that work from a high-drama, operatic foundation, one that pairs her lyrical intensity with vocal prowess and orchestral flourish. A cajón and handclaps blend seamlessly with urbano bass, Auto-Tune, and somber strings, often with many or all of these elements weaving throughout the same track (as they do on “De Madrugá”). Her voice soars over each flamenco run with ease (“La Rumba Del Perdón”), only to growl over sinister cello (“Porcelana”), breathlessly trip through a softly strummed waltz (“La Perla”), or reach the rafters of any grand opera house (the exquisite “Reliquia”; her version of an aria, “Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti”; the severe and surreal “Berghain,” which features Björk and Yves Tumor). \n\nROSALÍA worked with the London Symphony Orchestra to give <i>LUX</i> the symphonic heft it deserves, and at times, the gravity of the undertaking felt insurmountable. “I definitely had chills so many times while recording vocals,” she says. “I don’t think I ever cried so much making an album. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so much recording vocals. I think that I didn’t maybe want to go through this before. I was like, ‘I’m not ready.’ I know I had to do an album like this, but I wasn’t ready.”\n\nWhether or not she realized it at the time, she was, indeed, ready for <i>LUX</i> and all it entails. It’s the destination she’s been writing towards, uninhibited by instrumentation, devastation, or language. “<i>MOTOMAMI</i> was minimalist,” she says. “This is maximalism.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rock y Alternativo","Music","Latin","Worldwide"],"name":"LUX","playParams":{"id":"1848167516","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-06","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lux/1848167516","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3SUEJULSGgBDG1j4GQhfYY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848167516/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"313845115","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/313845115?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763128709801,"RTCI":0}}},"1848188060":{"id":"1848188060","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848188060?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cameron Whitcomb","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cameron-whitcomb/1542957700","artwork":{"bgColor":"94854a","hasP3":false,"height":1425,"textColor1":"040302","textColor2":"070302","textColor3":"211d10","textColor4":"231d10","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/78/93/b0/7893b00d-aeff-491d-c7ee-33cebe28db84/075679593436.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1425},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"010000","gradient":{"color":"010000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"070302","textColor3":"211d11","textColor4":"241d11","textGradient":["ffffff","070302"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/84/60/e4/8460e411-3fae-4bca-5e80-d6534009af27/Job3b58965a-322a-4228-9c68-1555d0462700-208009349-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_406496299_2413794869-Time1762459883824.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"010000","gradient":{"color":"010000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f9d1a9","textColor3":"dcd5b3","textColor4":"dfb793","textGradient":["ffffff","f9d1a9"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/44/e0/a6/44e0a6d6-0541-122f-89dc-b4516b0dbe19/Job5c77843e-5109-40a1-a38c-fc0407582180-208009350-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_406495728_2413794868-Time1762462607822.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"94854a","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"040302","textColor2":"070302","textColor3":"211d10","textColor4":"231d10","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/78/93/b0/7893b00d-aeff-491d-c7ee-33cebe28db84/075679593436.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Five new tracks build on the BC singer’s lessons learned in the school of life.","standard":"Cameron Whitcomb took a roundabout path to country music. The 22-year-old rising star left home at the age of 17 to work on the Trans Mountain pipeline, a job he pursued until the songs he began posting online found an audience and landed him on Season 20 of <i>American Idol</i>. An addict since adolescence, Whitcomb also found sobriety during this period, and these formative experiences serve as a thematic foundation for the 15 tracks on his full-length debut. Produced by Jack Riley, <i>The Hard Way</i> is rootsy country music in the vein of Zach Bryan or Sam Barber, though Whitcomb’s own sound expands to include shades of melodic pop, alt-rock, and even a touch of punk. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a wrenching account of facing and overcoming the demons that accompany addiction and depression. That tune also takes sonic cues from the stomp-clap folk of the 2010s, an influence also heard on tracks like “Options” and “Hundred Mile High.” Other highlights include “Quitter,” a clear-eyed chronicle of chasing sobriety that acknowledges the interpersonal challenges of addiction, and “As I Stand Before the Coffin,” on which Whitcomb grapples with loss and grief with compassion and self-awareness. Whitcomb ups the personal ante of this collection with periodic spoken interludes, lending the album a lived-in intimacy that underscores its immense vulnerability.\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"name":"The Hard Way (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1848188060","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hard-way-deluxe/1848188060","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5RHdOTPKxJ63HPEAslOZhv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848188060/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1542957700","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1542957700?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763131608991,"RTCI":0}}},"1848189293":{"id":"1848189293","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848189293?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"PhaseOne","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/phaseone/293699062","artwork":{"bgColor":"3e3c30","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f4f6de","textColor2":"f8d453","textColor3":"cfd0bb","textColor4":"d3b64c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/16/34/05/1634056a-63d8-4d58-56dd-5aa7dd7440e0/9305000440728.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3e3c30","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f4f6de","textColor2":"f8d453","textColor3":"cfd0bb","textColor4":"d3b64c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/16/34/05/1634056a-63d8-4d58-56dd-5aa7dd7440e0/9305000440728.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Dubstep","Music","Electronic"],"name":"Terranova (Remixes)","playParams":{"id":"1848189293","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":28,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/terranova-remixes/1848189293","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7yi3MbGJNdy2SeLGdPPfKC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848189293/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"293699062","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/293699062?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763092205401,"RTCI":0}}},"1848272861":{"id":"1848272861","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848272861?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"NF","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nf/898094630","artwork":{"bgColor":"161e20","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6b965","textColor2":"eca964","textColor3":"c99a57","textColor4":"c18d57","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/31/77/ae317733-57e3-cd62-6bfe-0b1223d7e401/25UM1IM68345.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d9f0d6","textColor2":"d9eed5","textColor3":"b1c3af","textColor4":"b1c1ae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c9/16/e0/c916e0f1-1a04-1470-c365-070b265bb354/ce5cf49b-1d42-4ba1-b65e-b832349f40d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"161e20","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f6b965","textColor2":"eca964","textColor3":"c99a57","textColor4":"c18d57","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/31/77/ae317733-57e3-cd62-6bfe-0b1223d7e401/25UM1IM68345.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A third EP from the Michigan rapper.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"FEAR -

In the months leading up to <i>FX De La Rose</i>, the Puerto Rican singer positioned herself as one of the most consistent in Latin music, appearing prominently on albums by Rauw Alejandro and Dei V in addition to her own singles. A handful of those previously released solo tracks appear here alongside new ones on her debut album. Yet, in this format, her emerging artistry feels far more solid as a contextualized whole than do most first timers’ full-lengths. \n\nThe production choices here help, changing up her sound from track to track while largely riding a future-facing vibe, evident on the dancehall deconstruction “BRINCAR” and the indulgently sleek, 420-friendly “Peldío.” Topically, she’s covering an emotional spectrum, getting in touch with her needs on the sex-positive “5 minutos” and unapologetically taking down an unworthy ex on the brash, reggaetón-infused “Palgo.” Features from the likes of Eladio Carrión on the streetwise yet sultry “$extape” and repeat collaborator Omar Courtz on the passionate perreo “NUBES” only serve to enhance her aesthetic. \n","tagline":"New

Having recently turned the country <i>and</i> hip-hop worlds on their respective heads with the release of his country-leaning <i>I Hope You’re Happy</i>, the “biggest, largest” presence in rap today knew he needed to show up and show out when it came to a one-night-only show at Nashville’s legendary Ryman Auditorium. Listen to him tear through the album’s hits—along with a couple of fan favorites from his catalog—in front of a live audience and recorded in Spatial Audio, and enjoy a couple of surprises X put together for his special night.

Spanning heartache, insecurity, friendship, and the inevitable passage of time, the EP is an appropriately personal follow-up to Ballerini’s ambitious fifth studio album <i>PATTERNS</i>.\n\n“I have always made records—whether songs, EPs, or albums—to capture a moment in time,” she tells Apple Music. “<i>Mount Pleasant</i> is a collection of six songs I’ve written throughout the summer, marking a chapter of heavy self-examination, longing, and stepping further into who I am as a 32-year-old woman.”\n\n“I Sit in Parks” opens the EP on a vulnerable note, as Ballerini recounts watching families picnic together while wishing she had children and a family of her own. Musically, the song sounds almost chipper, structured as an uptempo waltz that wouldn’t sound out of place in a nursery rhyme or on a carousel. Ballerini’s voice is clearly downcast, though, especially when she sings lines like “Is it my fault for chasing things a body clock doesn’t wait for?” Such cutting insights abound on <i>Mount Pleasant</i>, like on standout “Emerald City,” where Ballerini grapples with romantic insecurity, and closing track “Check on Your Friends,” a clear-eyed reminder that we can’t always see the struggles faced by those closest to us.\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Mount Pleasant - EP","playParams":{"id":"1850028350","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mount-pleasant-ep/1850028350"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850028350/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"382270241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/382270241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763127625127,"RTCI":0}}},"1850030668":{"id":"1850030668","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850030668?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tee Grizzley","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tee-grizzley/1177271472","artwork":{"bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d0d6d4","textColor2":"c4c4c2","textColor3":"a7acaa","textColor4":"9e9e9c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1c/12/1d/1c121d55-2922-eb15-79e9-a4b1ac72ad05/075679593412.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"882895","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"efc5fc","textColor2":"eab2fa","textColor3":"dba6e8","textColor4":"d696e6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/af/7b/9d/af7b9d60-d092-0f55-bf32-628d9c2ec649/35187388-f418-4742-88ab-0be42253b3b1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b580c6","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"200919","textColor2":"260f16","textColor3":"3e213b","textColor4":"432539","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2c/b4/e3/2cb4e318-45de-353d-abce-cd94dcbdb9a7/c34872e6-1e3e-4a85-b8a8-c5ecc41bdb6b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"050505","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"d0d6d4","textColor2":"c4c4c2","textColor3":"a7acaa","textColor4":"9e9e9c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1c/12/1d/1c121d55-2922-eb15-79e9-a4b1ac72ad05/075679593412.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"One of rap’s most consistent writers delivers some of his catchiest songs.","standard":"Few know better than Tee Grizzley that success doesn’t always last. The rapper’s first taste of stardom arrived in 2016 when his post-prison-release single “First Day Out” went viral. Fans like LeBron James and Lil Yachty helped boost his star power, but Grizzley knew he would have to build a sustainable bullpen of strong releases to keep up in the most competitive game of them all. The Detroit rapper has remained one of the most consistent songwriters in hip-hop, routinely dropping one or two projects each year. His second of 2025, <i>Street Psalms</i>, came just months after he dropped the powerfully introspective <i>Forever My Moment</i>. \n\n<i>Street Psalms</i> features some of Grizzley’s catchiest songs to date, though he never sacrifices his street savvy or hard-hitting bars for commercial success. “Make Em See” finds Tee using accents within his rhyme scheme to give the song a palpable rhythm, while on “Voicemail” he teams up with Rod Wave for an emotional and intense reflection on whether or not his success as a rapper even matters. “Talked to my daughter on FaceTime, it’s healing my heart,” he raps, before admitting: “Sometimes it get to killing me, hope this ain’t how she remember me.”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Street Psalms","playParams":{"id":"1850030668","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/street-psalms/1850030668","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0F81kdKteOdZ5fBofqn3NN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850030668/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1177271472","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1177271472?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763120848250,"RTCI":0}}},"1850512050":{"id":"1850512050","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850512050?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jessi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jessi/911707693","artwork":{"bgColor":"c4c2c3","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"161813","textColor2":"272a27","textColor3":"383a36","textColor4":"464846","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/3a/db/aa3adb17-4176-91ff-1785-1611db2b926e/4099964209693.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"c4c2c3","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"161813","textColor2":"272a27","textColor3":"383a36","textColor4":"464846","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/3a/db/aa3adb17-4176-91ff-1785-1611db2b926e/4099964209693.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"P.M.S. -

new tracks only widen the range of the Southern singer’s second album.","standard":"The Athens, Alabama, native grew up on pop and country, fell in love with hip-hop, and then blew up on social media with covers that combined all of the above. Since her 2021 debut single “Upgrade,” the 20-year-old singer has collaborated with Jelly Roll, Teddy Swims, and BigXthaPlug; briefly relocated to Nashville, then LA; and landed a handful of hits about heartbreak and dangerous love. Despite her gritty voice and outlaw predilections, Murph refrained from delving too deep into her own personal story on her 2024 debut album <i>That Ain’t No Man That’s the Devil</i>. \n\nHer follow-up, <i>Sex Hysteria</i>, fearlessly unpacks her past. “I’m from Alabama, I’m ’bout 4’11”/I’ve got a shitty father, and I’d like to go to heaven,” she drawls candidly on intro “Gucci Mane,” which country-fries a subtle sample of its namesake’s “Lemonade.” In Murph’s musical melting pot, trap, pop, and country meld into a twangy, swaggering hybrid. She flexes her hip-hop chops alongside a few of her faves, holding her own with Lil Baby on the snarling “Best Behavior” and Gucci himself on “Donuts.” The doomed romance of “Heroin” falls somewhere between Lana and Loretta Lynn, while the Amy Winehouse-inspired “1965” offers up a winking satire of trad-wife femininity. But the rawest moment is “The Man That Came Back,” a stark piano ballad about her violent upbringing and her father’s attempts at redemption—transcending her trauma by writing her way through it.\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Sex Hysteria (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1851283792","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":23,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sex-hysteria-deluxe/1851283792","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6TpEUt1l3llFkDLbIgpinr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851283792/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1548067332","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1548067332?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763131701496,"RTCI":0}}},"1851288328":{"id":"1851288328","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851288328?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Selena Gomez","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/selena-gomez/280215834","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"51bfd4","textColor2":"3ebdd6","textColor3":"439bac","textColor4":"3399ad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/e3/24/55e324b7-e77d-a3b8-9af9-f77f8ccd36f7/25UM1IM49161.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"51bfd4","textColor2":"3ebdd6","textColor3":"439bac","textColor4":"3399ad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/55/e3/24/55e324b7-e77d-a3b8-9af9-f77f8ccd36f7/25UM1IM49161.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Songs you love, reengineered to help you focus, relax, or sleep."},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Selena Gomez Sollos Relax Collection","playParams":{"id":"1851288328","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2022-11-03","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/selena-gomez-sollos-relax-collection/1851288328"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851288328/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280215834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280215834?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763129348202,"RTCI":0}}},"1851395787":{"id":"1851395787","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851395787?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"G Herbo","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/g-herbo/1036753321","artwork":{"bgColor":"bfad99","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"31140a","textColor2":"34190f","textColor3":"4d3327","textColor4":"50362b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0f/ea/54/0fea54db-0ed3-1b18-64b0-aea38421a111/25UM1IM75437.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"794f17","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fccfa3","textColor2":"fdc98b","textColor3":"e2b587","textColor4":"e3b174","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/1c/df/0b/1cdf0b62-1b1d-90ad-985d-c60514d4ab1d/b86cd477-e3be-426a-a3da-50a649bebc8e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"bfad99","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"31140a","textColor2":"34190f","textColor3":"4d3327","textColor4":"50362b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0f/ea/54/0fea54db-0ed3-1b18-64b0-aea38421a111/25UM1IM75437.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Chicago drill star revisits his past: “Just trying to find the hunger again.”","standard":"When the rapper known as Lil Herb broke through in 2012 with his searing Lil Bibby duet “Kill Shit”—an instant classic in the Chicago drill canon—he was a baby-faced 16-year-old with the voice and gravitas of a grizzled veteran. Since then, G Herbo (as he’s been known since 2015) has watched the genre he helped pioneer become a worldwide juggernaut. Meanwhile, he grappled with the trauma of the lifestyle that informed his storytelling on albums like 2020’s <i>PTSD</i> and 2022’s <i>Survivor’s Remorse</i>, which upped the studio gloss without sacrificing his visceral intensity. Stardom fit the former street rapper like a glove.\n\nBut for his seventh album, titled after his original alias, the 30-year-old rapper felt drawn back to his past, revisiting old songs like 2015’s “Briks & Mansions” or 2017’s “Street.” “I was just trying to tap into that stage and that era—just trying to find the hunger again,” Herbo tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “I never do that. Once the music come out, I’ve always been on to the next. But listening to my old projects, watching old videos, it just got me in that mode.”\n\nThe photo on the cover shows a teenage Herbo in one of his early mugshots—a snapshot from a childhood he describes vividly on “Give It All,” juxtaposing school-bus crushes and juke parties with untimely funerals. “It’s tough making it in Chicago,” Herbo says. “Generational curses that just get put on you. Certain people grow up with a chip on their shoulder being from Chicago, because you just experience so much death. You think it’s normal, but it ain’t normal.” “Radar” details nightmarish scenes from his past with writerly precision; on “1 Chance,” he wakes from nightmares about lost friends.\n\nAlternately somber and celebratory, with cameos from Jeremih, Wyclef Jean, and Anderson .Paak, Herbo takes time on <i>Lil Herb</i> to marvel at how far he’s come. Still, he’s as passionate about his craft as he was when he dropped <i>Welcome to Fazoland</i> 11 years ago. “I still read the dictionary,” he says. “I try to learn new words all the time, different kinds of flows. I love rapping, so I don’t ever want to get boxed in.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Lil Herb (Extended)","playParams":{"id":"1851395787","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-10","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lil-herb-extended/1851395787","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0aqpG80oRkiQRMjaS4saAi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851395787/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1036753321","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1036753321?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1763130273683,"RTCI":0}}},"1851536992":{"id":"1851536992","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1851536992?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Neton Vega","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/neton-vega/1686896695","artwork":{"bgColor":"c19bcb","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"12101f","textColor2":"291826","textColor3":"352c42","textColor4":"483247","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fe/ad/ef/feadef86-683c-658f-2109-ec5d52e533a9/1963623994936_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111822","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f9fdfd","textColor2":"96acd7","textColor3":"cacfd1","textColor4":"7b8eb3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8f/5c/d2/8f5cd2fa-4a7c-53c5-cd06-6a93a2570255/3e71e11d-af90-4dae-a821-ae3e3507faaa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"c19bcb","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"12101f","textColor2":"291826","textColor3":"352c42","textColor4":"483247","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fe/ad/ef/feadef86-683c-658f-2109-ec5d52e533a9/1963623994936_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The música mexicana star takes an adventurous genre leap.","standard":"After dropping riveting corridos opposite the likes of Peso Pluma and Tito Double P, among others, Neton Vega made a definitive statement about his rising-star status in música mexicana with the full-length debut <i>Mi Vida Mi Muerte</i>. Some nine months later, the Baja California artist returns with his second substantial project of 2025, one markedly different from its predecessor. <i>DELIRIUM</i> opener “Montate” starts out with the familiar strums and accordion but then swiftly switches to a more reggaetónesque rhythm. Such is the nature of this 15-song outing, an adventurous leap across genres both as a soloist and in tandem with other artists. \n\nThere are vibrant, dance-floor-ready moments like “Weekenes” and the acid-soaked “Tramadol,” yet also bold divergences from the expected, like the bachata-adjacent “3 Dias +” and the hip-hop meets pop-rock hybrid “Turistico.” Vega gets his perreo on with the help of acclaimed reggaetoneros such as Jowell & Randy on the slo-mo “Baby De Los 2 Miles” and Myke Towers on the throwback “90 60 90.” It’s only on the raw, romantic closer, “Desvelaos,” that he circles back to his core sound, one undeniably altered by what came before.","tagline":"New

asks the tough question and we’ve finally got an answer.","standard":"It’s been seven years since Cardi B’s debut album, 2018’s record-breaking <i>Invasion of Privacy</i>, which debuted atop the Billboard 200 with the largest female rap streaming week of all time and made the Bronx superstar the first solo female artist to win the Best Rap Album Grammy. For anybody wondering what she’s been up to in the meantime, allow her to set the record straight: When she wasn’t flexing at Fashion Week, she was mostly holed up in the studio, battling a mean case of writer’s block. “I really went through a crash where nothing was pleasing me—nothing,” the artist born Belcalis Almánzar tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Despite spending more time in the studio than at home, Cardi describes recording song after song that just didn’t feel right while fans clamored for <i>Invasion of Privacy</i>’s hotly anticipated follow-up.\n\nRather than brush off the funk, Cardi harnessed the full force of its power on <i>AM I THE DRAMA?</i>, her long-awaited sophomore album, named for a revelation after a vain attempt to stay out of the headlines. “For some reason, I’m getting tried even when I’m not saying nothing,” she says. “And it’s like, damn—do drama chase me, or am I just the drama?” Here, the unapologetic MC channels her pent-up aggression into belligerent trap bangers that remind you who’s the “first rap bitch on the cover of <i>Vogue</i>.” “I tried to come in peace/They tore me into pieces/Now I gotta RIP it,” she snarls on “Dead,” which opens with a report of a recent crime spree targeting “bloggers, journalists, and, most chillingly, several female rappers” before Summer Walker sings about pulling off her enemies’ lacefronts.\n\n“I’m a very colorful person,” Cardi tells Lowe. “But this past year, I feel like something kind of was dying inside of me. My humbleness, me trying so much to be unproblematic, me trying to avoid drama, avoid the disses, avoid the bitches—that’s dying out in me. Because I’m really about to show you, bitch, that you are not fucking with me. The cockiness is being born again.” The attitude comes through on “Imaginary Playerz,” Cardi’s riff on the 1997 JAY-Z classic, which was born on a bad day in the studio during the summer of 2024. “I was really caught in a funk,” she explains. “It was the third, fourth day that I’m sleeping on the couch in the studio. I’m exhausted. I’m pregnant as fuck. And I was just going through some drama in my life, and I just was so tired, so over it.” Trying to lighten the mood, her engineer blasted the JAY-Z original, and a light bulb went off. “I’m like, ‘Yo, imagine if I flip this, but my way,’” she thought, suddenly remembering that she had an awful lot to brag about.\n\nAmidst all the <i>DRAMA</i>, there are moments of levity—she recruits Selena Gomez, Tyla, and Lourdiz for a trio of sultry R&B bops, flips a Janet Jackson classic for the buoyant “Principal,” and reps her roots on “Bodega Baddie,” a high-octane norteño banger. But first, there are shots to be fired—whether at her so-called peers or at the low-down, dirty dogs she disses over the Triggerman sample on “Outside.” And on “Man of Your Word,” she opens up about the demise of her marriage over mournful steel drums. Between the flexing and the reflecting, <i>DRAMA</i> feels like catharsis—and that’s before it ends on 2020’s record-shattering, zeitgeist-capturing “WAP.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"AM I THE DRAMA?
