And if longtime fans are wondering whether the title of <i>Leo Rising</i> is a full-circle reference to Danko’s 2002 full-length debut, <i>Born a Lion</i>, their suspicions are confirmed by the

alternate, behind-the-scenes view of the Fab Four’s legendary run.","standard":"The long-awaited fourth installment of The Beatles’ archival <i>Anthology</i> project—marking the 30th anniversary of the first three volumes—may not be a vault-clearing revelation on par with its predecessors; after all, 23 of its 36 tracks have appeared on previous reissues. But if Peter Jackson’s eight-hour <i>Get Back</i> docuseries proved anything, it’s that we can never get enough of eavesdropping on The Beatles’ creative process in the studio, and <i>Anthology 4</i> extends that ethos to the group’s entire 1963-1969 evolution, presenting a concise chronological overview of their career filtered through an intimate, fly-on-the-wall perspective. \n\nThrough its array of rough takes, improvised jams, BBC rehearsal recordings, and mid-song giggle fits, <i>Anthology 4</i> is an opportunity to savor the details that you might’ve overlooked in the pristine finished products. Stripped of its beaming harmonies, a mostly instrumental version of “Nowhere Man” lets you marinate in the song’s jangly melancholy; a brass-free “Got to Get You Into My Life” foregrounds its fuzzy garage-rock edges; and the isolated string tracks of “I Am the Walrus” are every bit as disorienting and dramatic as the song itself. And then there are those glorious moments when you get to hear a song you’ve played a thousand times before in a completely different way: Who knew that, when you subtract the orchestration and perform it on electric guitar, the White Album ballad “Good Night” is basically the world’s first lo-fi bedroom-pop tune?\n\n<i>Anthology 4</i> stretches the timeline past The Beatles’ 1970 breakup to include the recombinant singles that Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr put together for the 1995 <i>Anthology</i> series, with fresh remixes of “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love” that bring greater clarity to John Lennon’s original cassette-demo vocal through the same technology that allowed them to complete the bittersweet ballad “Now and Then” in 2023. That song was billed as the final Beatles single, but like Shakespeare, Brothers Grimm, and the Bible, the Fab Four story has been told many times before and—as <i>Anthology 4</i> reaffirms—that tradition will continue for years to come. The version we get here is less a comprehensive catalog of The Beatles’ greatest achievements than a finely curated gallery exhibit of inspired rough sketches, capturing the playful spirit of four lads who taught generations of musicians how to use the studio as their sandbox.","tagline":" New Compilation"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Anthology 4","playParams":{"id":"1834473847","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":36,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anthology-4/1834473847","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0L7ggz4vMdACCCnGV2lioZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834473847/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"136975","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/136975?l=en-US"}]}}},"1834474392":{"id":"1834474392","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834474392?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Replacements","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-replacements/206276","artwork":{"bgColor":"748188","hasP3":false,"height":1728,"textColor1":"000304","textColor2":"010304","textColor3":"171c1e","textColor4":"181c1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ef/52/5e/ef525e7a-3f49-a280-ca1e-be5c3d3353e9/603497810475.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1728},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"212020","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"dcdddd","textColor3":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"b6b7b7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/84/57/76/84577675-3fa2-831f-5c71-1da2fdac9fe1/764ad52c-fa11-4488-9370-4eb2c7c08340.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"748188","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"000304","textColor2":"010304","textColor3":"171c1e","textColor4":"181c1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ef/52/5e/ef525e7a-3f49-a280-ca1e-be5c3d3353e9/603497810475.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Let It Be (Deluxe Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1834474392","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"1984-10-02","trackCount":53,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-be-deluxe-edition/1834474392","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5ePgTxUYBrhKvE69AbxD0j"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834474392/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"206276","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/206276?l=en-US"}]}}},"1834785609":{"id":"1834785609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834785609?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Nightmares On Wax","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nightmares-on-wax/39883158","artwork":{"bgColor":"b2963f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0806","textColor2":"110f08","textColor3":"2c2512","textColor4":"322a13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/37/fc/a1/37fca1b8-bef9-c0ed-86ed-b20c91a27675/5056818802324.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111b15","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1f3a2","textColor2":"a8cfa7","textColor3":"c4c786","textColor4":"8aab8a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d2/13/31/d21331a9-6949-a4e0-3430-1fb8f9ed3499/2b0a6432-ecea-4eb7-99a1-2c14310f1a04.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"b2963f","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0a0806","textColor2":"110f08","textColor3":"2c2512","textColor4":"322a13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/37/fc/a1/37fca1b8-bef9-c0ed-86ed-b20c91a27675/5056818802324.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"George Evelyn on his eclectic creation: “It’s got the rough and the smooth.”","standard":"The 10th Nightmares On Wax album is named after a speaker George Evelyn’s mum bought him when he was 13. “It changed my world,” he tells Apple Music. “Once I had it, everybody wanted to be around me. It’s like that fork in the road.”\n\nNow based in Ibiza, Evelyn is feeling nostalgic for his early days in Leeds and the speaker box that led him to meet his Nightmares On Wax collaborator, Kevin Harper, through the Bradford body-popping scene. “Music has been saving my life constantly,” he says. “Sometimes these memories come up, and I realize I could have made one step in a different direction and the situation would be different.”\n\nEvelyn has produced a glorious celebration of heritage, soundsystem culture, and the heroes who shaped him, with a cast of characters who all bring their own details and distinctions including Yasiin Bey taking on a more melodic role in “Bang Bien” and Greentea Peng’s formative experiences of listening to Fugees and stopping off at Nando’s in “I Remember.” From the dubplate drop of “Echo45” to the edgy soul of “True,” Evelyn has taken care of every detail. “They call me Mr Tweaks,” he says. “When an album’s been mastered and it’s ready, I go back and listen to it fresh because I’ve forgotten all the nuances that I’ve been picking apart and being analytical about. As much as I love sharing my music with the world, it’s me who’s got to live with it. I love it so much that I have to be comfortable with everything in it.”\n\nThe real test comes when he hears it while he’s in the kitchen, driving, or going for a walk. “You can sit down and be very analytical, but actually that’s not how you listen to music,” he says. “It’s good for it to float in the background.” So what would his 13-year-old self think as he listens to it? “It fills me with gratitude,” he says. “My intention for every day is to feel great and to spread light and love and be kind.”\n\nRead on as Evelyn takes you through <i>Echo45 Sound System</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Echo45, We Are!” (with Oscar Jerome)</b>\n“Oscar [Jerome] and I already had a connection because I did a remix with him, and I think he’s an incredible musician. I curated an unplugged event out at El Silencio in Ibiza and invited him out. This project was in the back of my mind, and I was like, ‘Look, I want to do this thing, but it’s not a song.’ I wanted to do a soulful, ’80s-style jingle, so it’s like a signature. Even though you’ve got different expressions of <i>Echo45</i> all the way through the project, I wanted this to define what it’s about. It needed to be soulful—not cheesy—and Oscar pulled it off amazingly.”\n\n<b>“Dive Into” (with Louis VI)</b>\n“The track was actually recorded in Leeds back in 2018 with a great friend and amazing guitarist, Chris Dawkins, playing bass and JD73 on keys. Initially, it was just a vibe and then I worked more on it in my studio in Ibiza, bringing in the flute samples. I used some chopped-up guitar samples from some ancient records, I was doing a bit of alchemy, and I sent Louis [VI] two or three tracks, but this is the one he resonated with. He sent the track back to me, and I’m like, ‘Whoa, I didn’t see that.’ It was so deep and rootsy. He brought something out in the music, but the music also brought something out in him.”\n\n<b>“Desire” (with Liam Bailey, Haile Supreme)</b>\n“I first heard Haile Supreme’s track ‘Danjahrous’ in 2019 and two weeks later we got in touch with him. He lived in Brooklyn, and it turned out I had a gig there, so he came and we spent a night out together. A few weeks later, he came to my studio out in Ibiza and we wrote five or six songs in three days. It was like we’d always known each other. He appeared quite heavily on my last project, [2021 album] <i>Shout Out! To Freedom...</i>, but the first thing we wrote in those sessions was ‘Desire.’ Liam brought a rawness, and I love the message.”\n\n<b>“Bang Bien” (with Yasiin Bey)</b>\n“It was just after lockdown, and I’d sent four or five tracks to Yasiin Bey’s team and he was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I love them all.’ Everybody was shocked, even me. He lives in Barcelona and was coming to Ibiza for three days. This was the track I was gunning for. When I’m in recording sessions, we always get into deep chats, and I think that connection’s really important. Yasiin was telling me about his lineage and how he had Native American heritage in there. I already had this idea that I wanted him to be more melodic and meditative, with a spiritual undertone, rather than straight-up rapping. He let loose completely in the studio—this feels like an ancient call. It was beautiful to watch.”\n\n<b>“Echo45” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“Liam [Bailey] totally freestyled it. He came out to Ibiza and we got into a vibe. Here, we’re going into the zone of being in a soundclash dance where you’d drop your dubplate, the moment that represents your sound. I’ve always got loops and ideas, so I’d play stuff and Liam would start freestyling, and I’d get my phone and record. Once all the artists are out, I go back into my zone and work on this stuff in solitude. It’s such a pleasure to do.”\n\n<b>“True” (with Sadie Walker)</b>\n“I first started working with Sadie [Walker] in 2018 when she came on the <i>Shape the Future</i> tour, and she’s an amazing vocalist. She’s such a lovely soul and she’s got a vulnerable purity in her voice. I said to her, ‘You need to write something that’s true. It could be celebrating something, you could be missing somebody.’ The song’s about her grandma, which is such a beautiful thing. We did that rough and smooth thing again within the production. I got a good friend of mine—Big Danny Kane—on the bass, and I really wanted him to just slap it, so it’s got a sleazy and sluggish edge.”\n\n<b>“I Remember” (with Greentea Peng)</b>\n“The connection with Greentea Peng happened remotely in lockdown. This is her remembering herself as a kid and growing up in music. What she’s delivered is so beautiful, and I love how it connects the dots from a generational point of view, that lineage from DJing, MCing, and breakdancing. Hip-hop has been a big part of my life. There are no rules of what you’re inspired by, and hip-hop culture taught me that I can create anything with minimal means. Before I even knew what sampling was, I got into music by turning the turntable into an instrument and chopping in bits of records.”\n\n<b>“Starwood Bound” (with Sadie Walker)</b>\n“When I’m putting a band together to go on tour, I always like to get in the studio and jam with them because it’s good for camaraderie. Back in 2017, Sadie and I had gone in to work on a completely different track, but it wasn’t really happening. I put the beat there and the music evolved over time as I got deeper into it. With my DJ head on, the approach was not a verse and chorus, but just a groover. I think it creates a nice space within the record as well. Again, it’s got a dirty bass and this angelic voice floating over the top.”\n\n<b>“Ain’t so…” (with LSK)</b>\n“LSK—Leigh Stephen Kenny—is a very good old friend of mine. He was one of the co-collaborators in the artwork for [legendary 1995 Nightmares On Wax album] <i>Smokers Delight</i>. We wrote this song together in 2016. It feels like you’re in church. Production-wise, it’s quite different for me. It’s got a bit of an eerie kind of feel to it. This is the only track on the album that you only get a snippet of in the continuous mix. But go to listen to the full version and the message gets even deeper.”\n\n<b>“Mumzie Cut” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“My memories of soundclashes are that you’d always have a moment where the selector’s been playing these songs, but then they’ll come and drop a dubplate. Me and Liam [Bailey] were talking about Dennis Brown, who we sample here, and all these amazing singers who would do specials for soundsystems. And this is our special. I’ve got to give credit to Liam for the lyrical content and the vibe that he brings.”\n\n<b>“Holding On” (with Ladi6)</b>\n“This was recorded with Ladi6 in Wellington, New Zealand. It was another song that was floating around, so she wrote what it brought out in her. She brings a very different energy—this feels like an expression of something that has been held onto that needs to be let go of, which I love. To me, soul music is not a style, it’s a feeling, an expression, which is what this song is. Then you’ve got the dirty, dubby, disgusting bassline rumbling away underneath.”\n\n<b>“Wind of Change” (with Yarah Bravo)</b>\n“Yarah and I always have deep and wonderful chats. She came out to Ibiza to do a sunset session at El Silencio, and in the studio she was attracted to this particular beat. Yarah brought that reminder that everybody has the opportunity to change, no matter where they are or what they’re going through. It’s important to be aware of what you’re saying, what you’re expressing and what people are going to feel when they hear your music. Throughout my time, it’s amazing to hear some of the feedback I’ve had on songs—somebody will come and say the most random thing to you about a track and what it’s done for them. Even if it raises one person’s vibration, that’s more than enough.”\n\n<b>“Hop — To — Mystic” (with Liam Bailey)</b>\n“Liam freestyled the first two lines and we decided to write the rest off that. It’s a beautiful ending to the project. This is like when someone comes in at the end of the night and puts a blanket over you. The song tucks you in! Pulling more on the roots side of reggae, I keep giving nods to amazing singers like Dennis Brown and Mykal Rose. I think Liam has the capacity to deliver in that realm, with his incredible energy. When he came up with that line, ‘It feels right just where we are,’ I’m like, ‘Yo, man. My spine’s getting cold.’”\n\n<b>“Echo 45 Sound System (Full Continuous Mix)”</b>\n“The continuous mix came first. When you’re putting albums together, the hardest part is always the running order. I’ll give a shout-out to Skratch Bastid, who did the cuts and scratches to give it more of a live feel. It just brings a bit more. Compiling it was actually the most enjoyable part for me.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Echo45 Sound System","playParams":{"id":"1834785609","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/echo45-sound-system/1834785609","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4sHDNrCOWuHeTLvukNmQpp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834785609/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"39883158","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/39883158?l=en-US"}]}}},"1837458733":{"id":"1837458733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837458733?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Olly Murs","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/olly-murs/382815022","artwork":{"bgColor":"50501f","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f2caac","textColor2":"dec4af","textColor3":"d2b190","textColor4":"c1ad92","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8f/b0/88/8fb088e7-1b6c-89ce-db75-a7e350187497/4099964167788.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"4f501e","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f2c9ab","textColor2":"dec3ae","textColor3":"d2b18f","textColor4":"c1ac91","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9d/5e/de/9d5ede2b-9490-0ea0-8616-9a2a905a2fb5/Job772ba008-04e1-492d-8d64-931f5b70f22e-208373394-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407218279_2419234316-Time1762860927146.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"bfa78f","gradient":{"color":"bfa78f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1a1912","textColor3":"322b22","textColor4":"3b3327","textGradient":["000000","1a1912"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/34/71/69/34716941-ab86-1f6e-3085-4f9f3fd6c727/Job0bc37a38-a8e9-447d-88d1-900a894c8e65-208373395-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407218280_2419234317-Time1762861820140.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c2bbb2","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0c1116","textColor2":"11161a","textColor3":"303335","textColor4":"353739","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/81/68/12/81681211-80a7-a751-64f5-123b824cb624/ad026645-824b-458b-990f-9df4d63fe1d3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"50501f","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f2caac","textColor2":"dec4af","textColor3":"d2b190","textColor4":"c1ad92","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8f/b0/88/8fb088e7-1b6c-89ce-db75-a7e350187497/4099964167788.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Quirky, authentic, and vulnerable: “This is the album I always wanted to make.”","standard":"Since springing to fame as a runner-up in 2009’s <i>The X Factor</i>, Olly Murs has gone beyond the promise of his cheeky chappy persona to become an enduring pop star and household name. His eighth album, <i>Knees Up</i>, promises a good time, but it has the sensitivity and self-deprecating charm of a man getting to grips with a new life stage, as a husband and father of two young children.\n\n“It’s a full-circle moment for me,” Murs tells Apple Music. “I feel like this is the album that I always wanted to do, but I never really got the chance. Now I’m in my dad era, but still a bit of a lad at the same time.” Murs might be examining that dual identity, but when it comes to his sound there’s a clear direction: British ska that draws on the heritage of Madness, The Ordinary Boys, and The Streets, but is uniquely his. Murs worked with Ed Drewett (who co-wrote 2013’s “Dear Darlin’”), Iain James (Little Mix), and Sky Adams (Doja Cat) on the 12 tracks, which show a range of emotions. He brings his “limited edition” self to the party on “Bonkers” and thanks the universe for sending love his way on “Love = Madness.” That permission to be himself is hard won, and he’s grateful for it. \n\n“I think back to 2010 and I didn’t have the freedom to express how I feel because I wasn’t a good enough songwriter,” he says. “Now I’m more experienced and I know who I am.” Not only does Murs know who he is, but he also has a good idea of who his fans are—and he’s under no illusions that men often get dragged to his gigs by their girlfriends. “If I wasn’t who I am, I’d probably be one of those guys going, ‘What am I doing here?’ I’ve had many guys come up to me after a show that were like, ‘I wasn’t expecting much tonight and you surprised me.’ Maybe there’ll be a lad down the pub saying to his mates, ‘Press play on this album, you’ll really enjoy it,’” he says. Read on as Murs takes you through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Knees Up”</b>\n“I always felt like this would be the start of the show. Imagine if I was at a festival and I was walking past a stage and I heard it, I’d be like, ‘What’s that?’ When people come to my shows, I always say, ‘Look guys, whatever you’re going through, leave it at the door. Let’s come and have a good time tonight, deal with that in the morning.’ Just forget your troubles and have some fun—that’s what ‘Knees Up’ is, in a nutshell.”\n\n<b>“Save Me”</b>\n“‘Save Me’ was the spearhead—that was the first song we’d written that I got really excited about, and it started the ball rolling. At the time, I was writing loads of different types of songs trying to find out where this album was going to go. That ska sound triggered everything that followed, and I thought, ‘That song is going to be on my setlist for life. I want to sing it on tour.’ I’ve had that little glimpse in the mirror and gone, ‘Oh, my god, you look an absolute mess,’ and that’s what it’s about. Now it’s out in the world, and I’ve performed it live to thousands of people and the reaction was amazing.”\n\n<b>“Guilty”</b>\n“This came after ‘Save Me,’ and it’s me admitting I’ve been a bit of a geezer and a lad about town, but all I’m guilty of now is loving you. It’s me saying to my wife, Amelia, I’m sorry if I’ve ever upset you, but I love you so much, I’ll do anything for you. ‘Guilty’ was one of those songs where we all looked at each other after we finished and went, ‘That’s a pretty good song.’ Like ‘Save Me,’ I think it’s one of those songs I could have put on any of my albums.”\n\n<b>“Bonkers”</b>\n“We had the chorus, but then someone suggested what would be more bonkers than if I was rapping? So we came up with the Essex-y, Mike Skinner-like, Olly Murs version of rap. I thought, ‘Yeah, that’s bonkers. Let’s do it.’ This song is me telling my fans that I am a little bit limited edition and reassuring them that ultimately, if you feel like that, don’t question yourself. When you look out the window, it’s a mad world and we’re all a little bit crackers. It’s a song about not really taking myself too seriously. I wanted to be daring, show people my versatility and that I was doing something unexpected. The writers I worked with saw my vision, and they really allowed me to open up.” \n\n<b>“Honest”</b>\n“Hands down, this is my favorite song on the album. I can’t wait to sing it a million times. It’s a follow-on from ‘Save Me,’ with the long walk home after having a night out you dream of, knowing your wife is annoyed with you and you’re going to have to deal with that. People know me as that cheeky chappy, and there’s this daring side of me that comes out once in a while, but I think my fans have fallen in love with the fact that I’m in love. The album is about evolving as a writer: How can I write about me and my wife? Can I write a song about knowing I’ve pissed her off, but I have no idea what I’ve done wrong? I think people can relate to it.”\n\n<b>“Love = Madness”</b>\n“The lyric in this song I absolutely adore is: ‘Think of all the lonely hearts/We don’t know how lucky we are.’ I was that lonely person who wanted to find the love of my life and I did. Me and Amelia found each other, and now we’ve got two beautiful kids. What else can I dream of? But to put that in a song is quite hard. I played it to Amelia, and I know she loves it, but there’s always a reality check with us. ‘Great song, now go change a nappy.’” \n\n<b>“Run This Town”</b>\n“This was written with [The Ordinary Boys singer] Samuel Preston. What a man. We spent a lot of the first three albums together and I love The Ordinary Boys, so it was nice to rekindle that. I always wanted to be in an indie band, so writing with Preston was the coolest thing ever. Back in 2010, he said to me, ‘I’ve got this song called “Run This Town,” do you want it?’ I had the demo in my phone for 15 years, and I thought it would fit the vibe of the album, so I spoke to Sam again and it hadn’t been taken by anyone. I re-vocaled it, and we sprinkled a bit of stardust on it, and now it’s out there in the universe.” \n\n<b>“Yesterday’s News”</b>\n“There’s a double meaning to this song. I love the sentiment that I’m yesterday’s news, but I wanted to come out of the shadows again, especially in the music world. I also wanted to have a bit of fun with the media and to be a bit cheeky. Sometimes, the papers write things about you that aren’t true, so it’s me saying don’t believe everything you read. When I’d just come off tour and I was really ripped and the newspapers wrote about how my fans didn’t like me any more because I didn’t have a dad body…Anyway, these stories will be yesterday’s news tomorrow because I’m not as famous as I used to be. When you first start out as an artist, everyone’s excited about what you’re doing, but then you become part of the furniture.”\n\n<b>“Cut to the Chase”</b>\n“This song is about married life and being who I am. We really are like ships in the night and we miss each other. Amelia’s got her own life and I’m doing what I’m doing, so this is me saying, ‘I miss being with you and we need to have our moment without everyone else.’ I think most people can relate to that feeling of when you are in a relationship and you’ve got commitments with the kids and work, so it’s important to make time for you. It’s great when we get a whole day together, then we’ll be flat-out busy with work.”\n\n<b>“Still Getting Used (To the Ring)”</b>\n“We wrote this song last and it’s about how I’m not the perfect husband. I’m rubbish at DIY and I always leave the toilet seat up, but give me some slack. I was nervous playing it to Amelia because the last thing I want to do is to piss off the wife. And actually she went, ‘Oh, please tell me that’s going on the album.’ A lot of the songs are quite self-deprecating because I’m being honest with myself. When we got together, I said to Amelia, ‘Look babe, I’m a terrible cook, the kitchen is always a mess, but I’ll make you laugh every day.’ I think I’m quite a fun person to be around, and she accepts my flaws and that’s why we have a great relationship.”\n\n<b>“Lovin’ Really Hurts”</b>\n“I was reflecting on how I’d feel if Amelia ever left me. You can never become complacent because that’s a dangerous place to be. I’ve always got to be on my toes. There’s a lyric in there: ‘The silence speaks so loud,’ and when I come home to an empty house and Amelia’s out with the kids, it’s horrible. People can relate to heartbreak, and when I think about it now, it actually hurts me thinking, ‘I really don’t want Amelia to ever leave me.’ It was a weird song for me to put on the album because I haven’t lost Amelia and I love her so much, but I love it.”\n\n<b>“Chin Up”</b>\n“I’m really proud of this song. It’s encouraging men to speak out if they’re having a difficult time, whether that’s with a phone call or a chat, and it was important to get the sentiment right. A lot of friends, or people around me I knew, have struggled, and I’ve been there in the past. I’ve spent many hours on the phone to my friends over the last couple of years, hearing their problems, being an ear for them and hopefully giving them some good advice. I want people who are struggling to know there’s always someone out there who wants to help. When I finished that song, I got on the tube and I listened to it on the way home and I cried. I’m proud of this song, and I put it at the end of the album because I really wanted it to have that moment.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Knees

sequel includes beloved songs from the musical and two new originals.","standard":"Turning the Broadway blockbuster <i>Wicked</i> into two Hollywood mega-movies seemed like a feat fit for a wizard. Luckily, the voices of multihyphenate Cynthia Erivo and pop powerhouse Ariana Grande are more than strong enough to carry the beloved reimagining of L. Frank Baum’s Oz into a new era. The two actors’ portrayals of Elphaba (aka The Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda the Good are rooted in their own personalities—and that extends to the way they sing composer Stephen Schwartz’s songs. \n\nPicking up five years after the first movie’s ending, <i>Wicked: For Good</i> finds Elphaba in exile and firmly established as an evil entity, while Glinda is ensconced in Oz’s upper echelons, working for Jeff Goldblum’s Wizard of Oz. The film follows Elphaba and Glinda on their separate paths that eventually intertwine once more, with songs like the bittersweet “Thank Goodness,” the vengeful mini rock opera “No Good Deed,” and the enticingly campy “Wonderful” possessing a newfound vigor. \n\nWhile the first half of the <i>Wicked</i> diptych, which came out in 2024, had no new songs on its soundtrack, the music for the second installment has two fresh tracks, both penned by Schwartz: “No Place Like Home,” an initially rueful yet ultimately resilient anthem about summoning inner strength in the face of adversity sung by Erivo’s Elphaba; and “The Girl in the Bubble,” a fluttery, regretful ballad performed by Grande’s Glinda.\n\nThe emotional climax of the film is the storied duet “For Good,” in which Elphaba and Glinda look at the journey their friendship has taken and ruminate on how meeting each other altered their fates. The two actors’ performances are measured yet full of intensity, allowing complex emotions to bubble to the surface. \n","tagline":"New Soundtrack"},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"name":"Wicked: For Good – The Soundtrack","playParams":{"id":"1839569160","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wicked-for-good-the-soundtrack/1839569160","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6pamCzTowX31m57z8dC1Sk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839569160/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1772364470","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1772364470?l=en-US"},{"id":"306141506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/306141506?l=en-US"},{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}}},"1839704429":{"id":"1839704429","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839704429?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Aerosmith & YUNGBLUD","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=115386-213048599","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4e4e4","textColor2":"c6cdcc","textColor3":"b6b6b6","textColor4":"9fa4a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/b8/d5/80b8d51a-ace9-8e15-5f6c-9ae0eaf5f0b8/25UM1IM35144.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e0b79e","textColor2":"d6b7a1","textColor3":"b69682","textColor4":"af9684","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d2/51/60/d25160f0-3366-0424-ba2f-38e5ce69ec74/892b416d-2f8b-433e-b2e0-deac03efe669.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e4e4e4","textColor2":"c6cdcc","textColor3":"b6b6b6","textColor4":"9fa4a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/b8/d5/80b8d51a-ace9-8e15-5f6c-9ae0eaf5f0b8/25UM1IM35144.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The UK upstart caps off his year of honoring his idols in grand style.","standard":"It’s hard to imagine someone having a bigger 2025 than YUNGBLUD. He dropped a sprawling homage to the rock music that shaped him with his album <i>Idols</i> in June, then backed up that hero worship with his cover of “Changes,” the breakout performance at the final Black Sabbath show in July. After Ozzy Osbourne died a couple weeks later, he performed a tribute alongside Aerosmith at the MTV Video Music Awards. “A lot of my idols took note of that and have given me crazy opportunities that I was ready to grab by the horns, and it’s been a mental year,” he tells Apple Music. And now a capstone: luring Aerosmith out of semi-retirement for <i>One More Time</i>, a five-track EP that includes a new version of the band’s 1976 song “Back in the Saddle.” \n\nYUNGBLUD is clearly relishing his role as interlocutor of, and heir apparent to, the legends who influenced him and is gladly accepting their advice in return as his own star rises quickly. “Everyone that I’ve met, from Steven to Ozzy to Glenn Danzig, they’ve always said, ‘Block out the noise, be as authentic as you can, and people will understand it later,’” he says. “It always hits me so hard, because especially in rock music, there’s always a negativity to something new.”\n\nIn sound and tone, <i>One More Time</i> taps into Aerosmith’s mid-’90s renaissance period, channeling the wit and radio-friendly sheen on songs like “Problems,” “Wild Woman,” and the de rigueur power ballad “A Thousand Days.” But YUNGBLUD is taking his newfound proximity to greatness with humility and wonder: “I really feel like I’m a cat who’s been thrown off a building and finally landed on his feet.”\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"One More Time - EP","playParams":{"id":"1839704429","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/one-more-time-ep/1839704429"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839704429/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"115386","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/115386?l=en-US"},{"id":"213048599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/213048599?l=en-US"}]}}},"1839961330":{"id":"1839961330","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839961330?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sub Focus","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sub-focus/152742627","artwork":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e9c631","textColor2":"dba828","textColor3":"bca029","textColor4":"b18922","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/de/ef/f3/deeff38d-f2c0-b82f-01e0-9c1ef483d91f/24UMGIM80263.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f1e151","textColor2":"e5c232","textColor3":"c3b643","textColor4":"b99d2a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/48/50/b3/4850b34d-fbe6-ac31-8b0f-7c6e821bee70/Job7317b0a8-e208-440e-aacb-ba2d6fdf178c-204131903-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399020752_2353736669-Time1758799494818.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"111111","gradient":{"color":"111111","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dcb72f","textColor3":"a79688","textColor4":"b29427","textGradient":["ffffff","dcb72f"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/6e/f7/69/6ef76979-0b06-79e8-0897-3c5138fceaf1/Job2ab6ad47-2c5d-4cca-ac5b-02d80ede54b7-204131902-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399020751_2353736668-Time1758798068217.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"42596c","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fad9bc","textColor2":"fcd2af","textColor3":"d5c0ac","textColor4":"d7baa2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/f6/f8/48f6f8ae-bec1-fc97-adc1-0f172a329df2/21ff8cb2-5dae-4f8f-b85d-9ecf35cf8b25.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e9c631","textColor2":"dba828","textColor3":"bca029","textColor4":"b18922","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/de/ef/f3/deeff38d-f2c0-b82f-01e0-9c1ef483d91f/24UMGIM80263.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Sub Focus on his love letter to D’n’B: “It’s the sound I always come back to.”","standard":"“I wanted to make an album that was unapologetically about the genre I love—drum ’n’ bass,” Nicolaas Douwma tells Apple Music. “I’ve done multigenre records before but <i>Contact</i> is rooted in the sound I always come back to.” As Sub Focus, Douwma has spent the past two decades honing a percussively propulsive sound that straddles the frenetic world of drum ’n’ bass as much as the earworming melodics of pop. Across four albums and remixes for the likes of The Prodigy, deadmau5, and Dizzee Rascal, Douwma has built a loyal following who have witnessed his colossal sound headline stages from Reading and Leeds Festival to Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nOn his fifth album, <i>Contact</i>, Douwma pens a love letter to the genre that first made him, alongside a starry list of collaborators he has long admired. Old-school ragga breakbeats drive “Original Don,” featuring legendary dancehall MC IRAH, while “Entwined” delves into the darker side of drum ’n’ bass with the help of Grimes. “Push the Tempo” leans into the anthemic sound of UK dance vocal pioneer Katy B, and “Water & Fire” showcases the choppy sound of liquid D’n’B with vocals from singer-songwriter Connie Constance.\n\n“Drum ’n’ bass has been growing massively in popularity recently,” Douwma says. “We’re reaching bigger stages with this sound, and each of these songs have been road-tested to make sure the crowd goes wild.” Read on for his in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track. \n\n<b>“Ecuador” (with Fireboy DML)</b>\n“I’ve been a fan of Fireboy DML for a while, and one day, when I was doing a session in Manchester, I suddenly got a message from my A&R telling me to come back to London because Fireboy had a few hours in the studio. It all came together super last-minute, and once I started playing this instrumental for him, he got on a crazy vibe, making up lyrics about him being in a block party in South America. It was amazing to watch since he hadn’t heard any music like this before, and his lyrics embodied that excited feeling.”\n\n<b>“So Many Colours” (with Poppy Baskcomb)</b>\n“I’ve worked with Poppy a number of times and she’s an amazing writer. She sent me the idea for this, which featured her singing with just the bass in the background, and as soon as I heard the rough concept, I knew exactly what I wanted it to sound like. The vocal was so well done it all slotted into place very quickly. I was writing this before my Alexandra Palace headline show [in March 2025] and visualizing it in that space. When we premiered it there, it was incredible.”\n\n<b>“Original Don” (with Fireboy DML, IRAH)</b>\n“IRAH is one of the quintessential drum ’n’ bass voices of our time [and] has this amazing capacity to alternate between singing and MCing baritone dancehall lyrics. The idea for the track started with that concept of vocal switching, and I also wanted the production to reference the original dons of drum ’n’ bass by using breakbeats and old-school production techniques. It’s since become one of the biggest songs in my sets this year.” \n\n<b>“Elevate”</b>\n“I worked with the amazing songwriter Jo Hill on this and, since she’s from a more indie background, we were trying to channel an indie, electro, noughties vibe with the track. It all comes together on the gang vocals in the song, which I love doing because it always turns into a sing-along in the live set. It’s a fun technical challenge to get those vocals right because you have to make it sound like loads of different voices even if it’s just one person layering takes in the studio.” \n\n<b>“Entwined” (with Grimes)</b>\n“Ever since she released her first album, I’ve always wanted to work with Grimes. She reached out to me about a year ago out of the blue, which was really exciting, and we started working together in LA. She loves the cyberpunk aesthetic of the music I make, and I wanted to showcase her voice over a darker, heavier side of drum ’n’ bass, channeling acts like Bad Company and Noisia, who I grew up listening to.” \n\n<b>“On & On” (with bbyclose)</b>\n“bbyclose is another great writer I was very keen to work with after hearing her viral hit ‘Kisses’ last year. We wanted to make a track that was like a dance music manifesto encouraging the scene to keep going, and the instrumental I made used UK garage production techniques with choppy vocals, referencing people like Todd Edwards, who I listened to a lot in the early noughties.”\n\n<b>“Roll Too Deep” (with Subsonic)</b>\n“‘Roll Too Deep’ is a mashup of a few different things, and I think it’s more of a track for the hardcore drum ’n’ bassheads. On the vocal side I was inspired by Marlon Hoffstadt’s track ‘It’s That Time,’ which references early-’90s rap over house music, while the riff is very noughties trance inspired. This has been another big song in my sets this year.” \n\n<b>“Go Back” (with John Summit, Julia Church)</b>\n“I wanted to make a tempo-change track, since I’d heard it in old Chicago house tunes like Lil’ Louis’ ‘French Kiss’ but it’s not a technique you hear today that much. It worked really well once I started writing the song though, and it’s since become the biggest track in mine and Julia’s sets. This feels like the song that has opened my sound up to a whole new audience in the US.”\n\n<b>“Water & Fire” (with Connie Constance)</b>\n“I’m always really keen to show off the different subgenres of drum ’n’ bass and ‘Water & Fire’ gets into the more melodic realm of it. The track all came together when I decided I wanted a choppy lead vocal, and since Connie is an amazing vocalist with such a great tone, it all just fit together with the chords and melody perfectly. It has a really different feel from the other stuff I’ve done and I’m very proud of it.”\n\n<b>“Lost in Heaven” (with Emily Makis)</b>\n“I saw Emily post this idea as a reel on Instagram, where she was singing it at an airport over an instrumental track and I was mesmerized. I DMed her about it and she was up for collaborating. I wanted to keep the beatless feeling of the original idea for a long time in the song since it reminded me of ‘devil mixes,’ which are grime instrumentals where rappers would improvise over a beatless song. I love the atmosphere that creates, and it’s one of the few down moments on the record.”\n\n<b>“Push the Tempo” (with Katy B)</b>\n“I’ve known Katy for a long time because we actually go to see the same personal trainer! She is a legend, and when we started this idea together at the studio in London, it brought me right back to classics of hers like ‘Katy on a Mission,’ but in a drum ’n’ bass context. It was so exciting to finally work with her.”\n\n<b>“Let Your Body Rock”</b>\n“I made this song a while back for the first Circular Sound live show I did at [South London venue] Printworks. I love to channel techno in my productions, and this one is heavily influenced by that type of music. I really wanted a moment in my set like this where it’s a palate cleanser with a cinematic breakdown, instrumental evolution, and lots of changes. It’s a more hypnotic sound that really suits the narrative of a live show.” \n\n<b>“Wildfire”</b>\n“When I wrote this with Jo Hill I knew it would end up being the first single—it has such an infectious feel. When I’m thinking about the journey of an album, it’s nice to have new stuff at the start and things people might know at the end, which is why this is the penultimate track. I was listening to a lot of early-noughties trance with choppy synth melodies, and it inspired where I went with the instrumental.”\n\n<b>“Fade” (with Inez)</b> \n“I came up with ‘Fade’ right at the end of making the album at the 11th hour with the label calling me every day. Inez happened to be in London the exact week I needed to record the vocal—it was amazing timing. Everything came together really quickly, and as soon as I put down the chords, I realized it has such an epic closer feeling and has since been the closer to all my sets. When you play tracks live it’s a litmus test and you can tell right away from people’s reactions whether they’re ready to release or not. Thankfully, this one has always resonated.”","tagline":"New Album and

Following a series of fruitful collaborations with The Weeknd (including writing and production on <i>After Hours</i>, <i>Dawn FM</i>, and <i>Hurry Up Tomorrow</i>), 2025’s <i>Tranquilizer</i> further fixes his Eno-like ability to create music that that feels both abstract but surprisingly easy to listen to, touching on jazz ballads (“Modern Lust”), reggae (“Cherry Blue”), and Windows 95-era

in bass and vibes on the ATL phenom’s DIE BOUT IT follow-up.","standard":"After initially rising amid a youthful wave of Atlanta rap talents in the late 2010s, Lil Gnar showed his staying power with the release of 2022’s <i>DIE BOUT IT</i>. Some three years later, he doubles down on that project’s promise with <i>IN MY GLORY</i>, a trunk-rattling set where his raspy, half-sung rhyming hits as hard as ever. He crafts snappy hooks and angular rhyme schemes even in the noisiest environs, demonstrated on “Crack Dat” and the blown-out “Pass Da Lighter.” Adding to the momentum are repeat collaborators like Ski Mask the Slump God and UnoTheActivist, who bring their subversively impactful styles to “Beam” and “Soar (Rocket Power),” respectively. \n\nYet he also links with some less expected artists, tapping a punchline-prepped 2 Chainz for the gospel-tinged “Prayer” and KARRAHBOOO on the casually narcotized “Higher Than Yall.” Naturally, his 43B label boss Chief Keef comes through with multiple features, getting brazenly raunchy on “Welcome 2 Da Game” and dropping bands on brands for the drill redux “Almighty Gnar.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"IN MY

triumphant, heart-tugging return from pop’s master of yearning.","standard":"Only the coldest hearts refused to be stirred by the sight of Lewis Capaldi walking onto Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in late June 2025. It was on the same stage two years earlier that the singer-songwriter’s struggles with anxiety and Tourette syndrome were publicly exposed in a vulnerable performance. By then one of Britain’s biggest pop stars, as beloved for his playful self-awareness as his breakup ballads, Capaldi soon took the decision to step back from performing to work on his health. \n\nGlastonbury 2025 marked his reintroduction to the limelight, and he performed a new song, “Survive,” as part of a surprise set. That song opens this EP, released four-and-a-half months later, and there’s unavoidable poignancy to a slow-burning pop-rock anthem that confesses fragility and hopelessness in its verses but roars with defiance and resilience in the chorus (“I swear to God I’ll survive/If it kills me to/I’m gonna get up and try/If it’s the last thing I do”). The three songs that follow—the folky “Something in the Heavens,” a skillfully restrained “Almost,” and piano-ballad-cum-stadium-anthem “The Day That I Die”—underline that Capaldi is still a master of transmitting yearning in ways that feel both firmly personal and relatable. The struggle to persevere in the face of heartbreak and loss remains one of his key lyrical currencies—but, given his journey to recording them, these songs also carry a sense of new and happy beginnings.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Survive -

songwriting about the rough transition into womanhood.","standard":"The song titles on this project from Ashley Cooke read like a list of phobias: There’s “gettin’ old,” “baby blues,” even “(my worst fear).” The country artist is fearless as a songwriter, though, speaking frankly about issues that, in particular, plague women in their mid- and late twenties. That’s clear on opener “gettin’ old,” a melodic and relatable account of feeling rudderless while trying to transition from adolescence into adulthood. There’s still room for playfulness, too, like on the double-entendre-heavy cut “the f word,” a rose-colored ballad that likens the idea of “forever” to a four-letter word. The “panic attack version” of “tin foil hat” finds Cooke at her most inventive, taking the wild-eyed imagery of conspiracy theorists and applying it to the all-consuming feeling of romantic jealousy and paranoia. As Cooke zigs and zags between hopes and anxieties, her nimble voice—reminiscent of Kelsea Ballerini or Megan Moroney—keeps the project grounded.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"ace","playParams":{"id":"1846964570","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ace/1846964570","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0dnzbhASSeQxRlWfTnbZ42"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846964570/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"346835058","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/346835058?l=en-US"}]}}},"1847333395":{"id":"1847333395","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847333395?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Black Dog","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-black-dog/137162588","artwork":{"bgColor":"2f2d27","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ffab19","textColor2":"d2b1b4","textColor3":"d5911c","textColor4":"b19697","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ee/55/e2/ee55e20e-0404-db8d-d691-83aaf0975992/4250101489235_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"2f2d27","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ffab19","textColor2":"d2b1b4","textColor3":"d5911c","textColor4":"b19697","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ee/55/e2/ee55e20e-0404-db8d-d691-83aaf0975992/4250101489235_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","IDM/Experimental"],"name":"Loud Ambient","playParams":{"id":"1847333395","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loud-ambient/1847333395","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5a1UTBrZDRr3rOFxoDCh08"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847333395/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"137162588","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137162588?l=en-US"}]}}},"1847487292":{"id":"1847487292","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847487292?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ransom & Conductor Williams","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=135293272-1352366685","artwork":{"bgColor":"76523f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6f4f6","textColor2":"fae6d8","textColor3":"dcd4d1","textColor4":"dfc9b9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a4/9e/e3/a49ee344-96a3-0c92-7b14-6782330662ca/199806114346.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"775240","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"fae6d8","textColor2":"ead4bf","textColor3":"e0c9b9","textColor4":"d3baa5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/95/3a/82/953a827d-c9ec-24b6-9a5f-a71b92569588/Job8f1ab66f-1994-43b6-8b64-c57a536f3ff7-209148267-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407750143_2423663083-Time1763647581766.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2a1d15","gradient":{"color":"2a1d15","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"df9075","textColor3":"c3b2a8","textColor4":"c17d65","textGradient":["ffffff","df9075"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/37/ed/a9/37eda9c0-9220-94b2-b1c4-1d9caba462a0/Jobebea5623-c5c1-4242-8fcc-2280bf0bbd4b-209148266-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_407750144_2423663084-Time1763646662624.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1f1c26","textColor2":"2d2933","textColor3":"49474f","textColor4":"55525a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ec/b5/6f/ecb56f50-efaf-e8a6-6fd7-c7dc7643ca95/b6808e6c-9eec-43f8-b224-3dbf1332d59e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"76523f","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f6f4f6","textColor2":"fae6d8","textColor3":"dcd4d1","textColor4":"dfc9b9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a4/9e/e3/a49ee344-96a3-0c92-7b14-6782330662ca/199806114346.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Fresh sounds for old heads from a street-rap lifer.","standard":"Like Roc Marciano and the Griselda crew, Ransom’s one of those rappers whose place in the culture seemed to open as he got older—a traditionalist whose dusty, soul-sampling mixtapes (all the Nicholas Craven collaborations, but let’s say <i>Directors Cut Scene 3</i> for starters) affirm Core Values for the old heads while appealing to the underground refinement of new ones.

The 22-year-old rising star left home at the age of 17 to work on the Trans Mountain pipeline, a job he pursued until the songs he began posting online found an audience and landed him on Season 20 of <i>American Idol</i>. An addict since adolescence, Whitcomb also found sobriety during this period, and these formative experiences serve as a thematic foundation for the 15 tracks on his full-length debut. Produced by Jack Riley, <i>The Hard Way</i> is rootsy country music in the vein of Zach Bryan or Sam Barber, though Whitcomb’s own sound expands to include shades of melodic pop, alt-rock, and even a touch of punk. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a wrenching account of facing and overcoming the demons that accompany addiction and depression. That tune also takes sonic cues from the stomp-clap folk of the 2010s, an influence also heard on tracks like “Options” and “Hundred Mile High.” Other highlights include “Quitter,” a clear-eyed chronicle of chasing sobriety that acknowledges the interpersonal challenges of addiction, and “As I Stand Before the Coffin,” on which Whitcomb grapples with loss and grief with compassion and self-awareness. Whitcomb ups the personal ante of this collection with periodic spoken interludes, lending the album a lived-in intimacy that underscores its immense vulnerability.\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"name":"The Hard Way (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1848188060","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-26","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hard-way-deluxe/1848188060","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5RHdOTPKxJ63HPEAslOZhv"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848188060/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1542957700","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1542957700?l=en-US"}]}}},"1848209591":{"id":"1848209591","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848209591?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Parris Goebel","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/parris-goebel/1835798474","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e1c5d7","textColor2":"c5c8d6","textColor3":"b49eac","textColor4":"9da0ab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8b/22/71/8b22714f-d2df-6310-3e8f-3850ea0c6878/4100.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e1c5d7","textColor2":"c5c8d6","textColor3":"b49eac","textColor4":"9da0ab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8b/22/71/8b22714f-d2df-6310-3e8f-3850ea0c6878/4100.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The A-list choreographer steps out on her own: “I just feel like it's my time.”","standard":"For over a decade, New Zealand dancer and choreographer Parris Goebel has created show-stopping routines for pop icons, from music videos for Justin Bieber (“Sorry”) and Lady Gaga (“Abracadabra”) to Rihanna’s Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show. Now, she’s ready to be the star in the spotlight. “I just feel like it’s my time,” Goebel tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I’ve been of service to so many artists for years now, and I just feel like it’s time to pour into myself.”\n\nExecutive-produced by Aussie producer/songwriter Kito (with additional production from PARISI and Baauer), <i>A GIRL IS A DRUG</i> is Goebel’s first release since 2016’s <i>Vicious</i>. Her long-held love of dancehall connects both projects, but now club music joins the party, as on the stuttering vocal whirlwind of the title-track intro and the walloping, bratty techno of “ITS MY WORLD”: “Do what I like when I like how I like,” she brags over jagged synths. From there, Goebel gets to flirting over the piercing sirens and booming bass drum of “GYAL LIKE ME” with rapper BEAM, makes the mood sweatier and steamier with the commanding “BACKSTROKE,” and punctuates pleasure with squeaking bed springs on the Khia-sampling “LICK THE BEAT.” Meanwhile, “DONT BREAK MY HEART BABY” reveals her softer side: “I’m just a lover girl.” \n\nAs a choreographer, Goebel tells Lowe that, for her, producing music is like “working backwards”—making the sounds before the movement, even envisioning movement as she creates. It’s a new perspective to carry, along with the lessons she’s learned throughout her multi-faceted career: “There’s only one you in this world, and I think working with so many beautiful artists, especially women, they’re all so different, and I’ve been able to dive into how they see the world,” she says. “That’s what makes their music and their artistry so unique and timeless, because they really trust themselves. It just inspired me in a way to be like, if I’m going to do this, I’m going to do exactly what I want, on my time, and on my terms. And if it’s not there, I don’t want to do it.”","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"name":"A GIRL IS A DRUG","playParams":{"id":"1848209591","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-20","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-girl-is-a-drug/1848209591","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1RGfe07wazAbln9mx2XjtI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848209591/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1835798474","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1835798474?l=en-US"}]}}},"1848867193":{"id":"1848867193","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848867193?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Eric Lu","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eric-lu/1371546062","artwork":{"bgColor":"080c09","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fcee09","textColor2":"d4996e","textColor3":"cbc109","textColor4":"ab7c5a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/08/21/320821be-51c1-076c-f9a4-54c87de9fccd/25UM1IM44214.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"261910","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f5b291","textColor2":"d5a790","textColor3":"cb9377","textColor4":"b28b76","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/04/78/78/047878ae-2922-7312-fb7c-9779fbc080bc/92202163-a6bf-4bff-b954-54b7e5236caf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"080c09","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"fcee09","textColor2":"d4996e","textColor3":"cbc109","textColor4":"ab7c5a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/08/21/320821be-51c1-076c-f9a4-54c87de9fccd/25UM1IM44214.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Eric Lu’s winning performances at the 2025 Chopin Competition.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Piano","Romantic Era"],"name":"Winner of the 19th International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition, Warsaw 2025 (Live)","playParams":{"id":"1848867193","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/winner-of-the-19th-international-fryderyk-chopin/1848867193"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1848867193/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1371546062","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1371546062?l=en-US"}]}}},"1849833416":{"id":"1849833416","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1849833416?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kiana Ledé","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kiana-led%C3%A9/1121723557","artwork":{"bgColor":"a77675","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"050000","textColor2":"060101","textColor3":"261717","textColor4":"261818","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/80/09/73/8009735b-84ea-a55c-abc8-78f4fe9a91db/4099964215861.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"411417","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"efe0db","textColor2":"e5c7c4","textColor3":"ccb7b4","textColor4":"c4a3a1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/7b/0a/0a7b0a45-782d-d9ee-ffd6-eda56b11d568/c3d9e02f-be24-4c0f-80c5-dfa28307d31c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"dacebf","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1e110b","textColor2":"3d281d","textColor3":"43372f","textColor4":"5c493d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/42/33/64/42336479-8645-8018-4d10-a3e92b7ffd72/49667cb0-45fc-4e81-bcdd-a70af31e1ac1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"a77675","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"050000","textColor2":"060101","textColor3":"261717","textColor4":"261818","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/80/09/73/8009735b-84ea-a55c-abc8-78f4fe9a91db/4099964215861.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The LA singer adds a few features to her personal third album.","standard":"Kiana Ledé is known for her signature blend of authentic storytelling and unapologetic lyricism, which is evident across all her albums. Her sophomore effort, <i>Grudges</i>, was a raw exploration of trauma, mental health, and relationship struggles. Now, on her third LP, <i>Cut Ties</i>, she reflects on her personal growth and evolution, and embraces her inner strength.\n\nThroughout the album’s 11 tracks, Ledé narrates a story of a past romantic entanglement, grappling with the uncertainties of their connection. She explores the internal battle between embracing a newfound love and her instinct to protect herself (“LTF”) while also realizing the inconsistencies within their partnership (“U Can’t Remember”) and discovering the unreciprocated feelings that are taking place (“Space and Pussy”). On the candid and mellow track “Too Many Strings,” the singer-songwriter uses metaphorical imagery to describe the progression of their relationship, which has gotten a bit too deep after investing a lot of time and energy into it. She continues this motif on the title track, finding the strength to break free of her attachment by choosing loneliness rather than dealing with continuous heartache. She doubles down on her decision of refusing to settle for mediocrity on the reflective and swaggering track “Outta Luck.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Cut Ties (Deluxe Version)","playParams":{"id":"1849833416","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":15,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cut-ties-deluxe-version/1849833416","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6dkIA6cPbDA99Q3zNon5iS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1849833416/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1121723557","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1121723557?l=en-US"}]}}},"1850018237":{"id":"1850018237","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850018237?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Hellp","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-hellp/1143680187","artwork":{"bgColor":"2d3448","hasP3":false,"height":2400,"textColor1":"e8dfcb","textColor2":"ded8c8","textColor3":"c2bdb0","textColor4":"bab7ae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/00/c1/b5/00c1b53e-d86d-ca2a-4590-6037b988948b/075679593276.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2400},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"2d3448","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e8dfcb","textColor2":"ded8c8","textColor3":"c2bdb0","textColor4":"bab7ae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/00/c1/b5/00c1b53e-d86d-ca2a-4590-6037b988948b/075679593276.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Riviera","playParams":{"id":"1850018237","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/riviera/1850018237","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0LPWPtswtDiBc9lD7mydld"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850018237/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1143680187","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1143680187?l=en-US"}]}}},"1850025724":{"id":"1850025724","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850025724?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ERNEST","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ernest/1450042443","artwork":{"bgColor":"ece9e4","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0b0b0a","textColor2":"2c2b29","textColor3":"383736","textColor4":"52514f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9c/a8/6d/9ca86d84-d572-7a0c-60f8-d88757988c6c/25UM1IM70765.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"ece9e4","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0b0b0a","textColor2":"2c2b29","textColor3":"383736","textColor4":"52514f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9c/a8/6d/9ca86d84-d572-7a0c-60f8-d88757988c6c/25UM1IM70765.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Nashville native gives a colorful primer on his roots and Southern life.","standard":"ERNEST gives a colorful tour of his slice of the American South on this seven-pack of tunes, whose title has more to do with Southern living than it does a live performance.

An in-demand pen-for-hire turned solo artist, ERNEST is a great vocalist, too, turning in deceptively easeful performances on tracks like “Hate a Small Town,” on which he channels the slick soulfulness of Thomas Rhett, and “I’ll Be Around,” an old-fashioned joint that recalls John Prine.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Live From The South","playParams":{"id":"1850025724","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-the-south/1850025724","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3UHKcv71bC72LeO5xu2K7p"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850025724/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1450042443","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1450042443?l=en-US"}]}}},"1850028350":{"id":"1850028350","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850028350?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kelsea Ballerini","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kelsea-ballerini/382270241","artwork":{"bgColor":"76a5b4","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"031814","textColor2":"061815","textColor3":"1a3434","textColor4":"1c3435","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5b/d9/88/5bd98863-cadc-5917-2374-3a489e85b105/199806047866.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"accbc1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"050706","textColor2":"101d1a","textColor3":"262e2b","textColor4":"2f3f3b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ed/13/6d/ed136db7-8ee7-0102-c307-64d37c7f759b/5ef77523-5026-4a89-b0a1-316976c655de.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"858d6f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"121211","textColor2":"121212","textColor3":"292a24","textColor4":"292b25","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/20/7f/5a/207f5a16-909b-d10d-6272-a633e2628717/143308b7-4ee0-46e3-be2d-13ef373b5cb3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"76a5b4","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"031814","textColor2":"061815","textColor3":"1a3434","textColor4":"1c3435","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5b/d9/88/5bd98863-cadc-5917-2374-3a489e85b105/199806047866.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A personal, contemplative six-song EP: “Stepping further into who I am.”","standard":"Kelsea Ballerini shares the latest dispatch from her colorful life on this EP, which she wrote in mid-2025 during a period of intense introspection and co-produced with frequent collaborator Alysa Vanderheym. Spanning heartache, insecurity, friendship, and the inevitable passage of time, the EP is an appropriately personal follow-up to Ballerini’s ambitious fifth studio album <i>PATTERNS</i>.\n\n“I have always made records—whether songs, EPs, or albums—to capture a moment in time,” she tells Apple Music. “<i>Mount Pleasant</i> is a collection of six songs I’ve written throughout the summer, marking a chapter of heavy self-examination, longing, and stepping further into who I am as a 32-year-old woman.”\n\n“I Sit in Parks” opens the EP on a vulnerable note, as Ballerini recounts watching families picnic together while wishing she had children and a family of her own. Musically, the song sounds almost chipper, structured as an uptempo waltz that wouldn’t sound out of place in a nursery rhyme or on a carousel. Ballerini’s voice is clearly downcast, though, especially when she sings lines like “Is it my fault for chasing things a body clock doesn’t wait for?” Such cutting insights abound on <i>Mount Pleasant</i>, like on standout “Emerald City,” where Ballerini grapples with romantic insecurity, and closing track “Check on Your Friends,” a clear-eyed reminder that we can’t always see the struggles faced by those closest to us.\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Mount Pleasant - EP","playParams":{"id":"1850028350","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-14","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mount-pleasant-ep/1850028350"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850028350/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"382270241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/382270241?l=en-US"}]}}},"1850324993":{"id":"1850324993","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1850324993?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"5 Seconds of Summer","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/5-seconds-of-summer/538811449","artwork":{"bgColor":"a37987","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"010203","textColor2":"030304","textColor3":"211a1e","textColor4":"231a1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/48/1a/12481a50-b23d-7e08-00b7-6c5694635e0d/25UM1IM74668.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"e5e9f0","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"222123","textColor2":"2b292a","textColor3":"49494c","textColor4":"504f52","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5d/88/ca/5d88cacb-c2c0-5863-22a8-f6920e31c137/32cacba9-afed-49aa-8f01-907310b8c028.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"010101","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ebebf4","textColor2":"c1c5bc","textColor3":"bcbcc3","textColor4":"9a9e97","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/03/4b/9d/034b9ddc-e5d4-0381-1ab4-23a39632be95/1b4023a8-4f6c-4bb4-8fb1-25d44e879657.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"a37987","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"010203","textColor2":"030304","textColor3":"211a1e","textColor4":"231a1e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/48/1a/12481a50-b23d-7e08-00b7-6c5694635e0d/25UM1IM74668.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"This expanded edition adds four open-hearted new songs.","standard":"Released just months after the debut solo albums from members Michael Clifford and Calum Hood, this sixth studio album sees 5 Seconds of Summer reflect on recurring themes of loneliness and change. It also flirts with edgy, anthemic electronics inspired by Gorillaz, N.E.R.D, and The Prodigy, from the title track’s baggy throwback beat to the moody alt-pop of “Telephone Busy” and “No. 1 Obsession.”\n\nAs broadcast by the shout-along refrain of lead single “NOT OK”—“Hey, I’m not OK/I like the darker side of me”—the album spends considerable time exploring downbeat lyrical concerns. “Ghost” and “Sick of Myself” are back-to-back portraits of co-dependency (with some chemical dependency in there too), while “The Rocks” drops a pointed parallel to the band’s homeland of Australia over spiky pop punk: “Don’t you get sick of it?/Living in isolation/Cut off like an island nation.” On “Boyband,” 5SOS hit back at that term’s crowd-pleasing connotations, likening themselves to monkeys dancing on command. Even the more polished balladry on <i>EVERYONE’S A STAR!</i> betrays an undercurrent of anxiety, as on “I’m Scared I’ll Never Sleep Again.” That’s not to say the four band members sound at a loss for answers, though. If anything, these songs embrace the careening chaos of messy life transitions and the smirking fun of partying out of pure desperation. And on the album’s expanded edition, four new songs continue this open-hearted immediacy, including the hectic rocker “Chest,” the folk-tinged “Wishful Dreaming,” and a pair of pleading ballads.","tagline":"New Expanded Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"EVERYONE'S A STAR!

Even after the untimely passing of co-founder Dave Jolicoeur in 2023, just as their long out-of-print first few albums for Tommy Boy Records were finally receiving a digital release and remastering campaign, surviving members Vincent “Maseo” Mason and Kelvin “Posdnuos” Mercer felt compelled to press on in his honor.\n\n“It obviously gives homage and reference to our brother Dave,” Posdnuos tells Apple Music about <i>Cabin in the Sky</i>, De La Soul’s first studio album in nine years, its evocative title a nod to existential questions about the nature of the afterlife. All three MCs appear here, with their departed friend’s contributions essential and invaluable to the proceedings. “He’s there, he’s with us,” says Maseo. “For me, that’s how it’s been to get through it and to run these rhymes and ideas. It’s been, like, just joyful and therapeutic.”\n\nIndeed, the ethos of persistence rings out on “YUHDONTSTOP,” the notion of ending the group being akin to the end of Dave himself and, thus, a nonstarter for the remaining duo. “My interpretation is definitely the epitome of joy and pain,” Maseo says, citing the group’s time opening for Nas and Wu-Tang Clan on the 2023 NY State of Mind tour as an influence on the album’s sound. “Knowing that we played a significant part of joy is what’s going to continue to be implemented in the music, but the pain part is knowing that we all can identify with loss.” \n\nBoth extremes get their time here, soundtracked by such production luminaries and De La Soul familiars as DJ Premier, Jake One, and Supa Dave West. Some of the material was originally intended for a Pete Rock collaboration album, including the pensive “Palm of His Hands” and “The Package,” the latter its lead single. “I remember Dave, when he would hear something, he would, like, see colors,” Posdnuos says of that track’s creation, which features Dave doing his best Spike Lee impression. “I think his presence helped give everyone some closure and also allows us to even move on into some of the next things we had planned to do.”\n\nJoining De La in this celebration of this life and the next are a cavalcade of rap stars, such as Black Thought, Q-Tip, and the aforementioned Nas. Killer Mike steps into the maternal appreciation cipher “A Quick 16 for Mama,” while both Common and Slick Rick update a bona fide rap classic on the soul-affirming “Yours.” This chorus of vocalists sends Dave off in style while also helping to map out a future for a group with even more potential for great works as they carry on in his honor.","tagline":"New

Dallas rapper extends his foray into country with new tracks.","standard":"You could say that BigXthaPlug has always been country, from his deep Dallas drawl to the cowboy hat he rocked in the video for one of his earliest hits, 2022’s “Texas.” But his first official foray into country as a genre was in April 2025 with “All the Way,” a duet with rising country star Bailey Zimmerman featuring trap drums and steel guitar. With his hypnotic voice and over-the-top charisma, BigX has spent the past few years establishing himself as a bona fide star. But “All the Way” was the biggest hit to date for both BigX and Zimmerman.\n\nThroughout the 2020s, the lines between country and rap have blurred: Morgan Wallen and Lil Durk scored a hit with their 2021 collab “Broadway Girls,” onetime rappers like Jelly Roll and Post Malone have been embraced by Nashville, and the biggest song of 2024 was Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a twangy rework of an old ringtone rap hit. With his third album, <i>I Hope You’re Happy</i>, BigX straddles that line with a foot firmly planted in each terrain. Besides a pair of interludes, each track features a duet with a country star, mostly centered around country music’s favorite topic: heartache.\n\nSpeaking to Thomas Rhett on Apple Music Radio, BigX explained his methodology for choosing the album’s nine features: “The way I went about it, I looked for anybody who I felt like had some type of soul in them.” Hence the assist from Jelly Roll on the bittersweet “Box Me Up,” or the bluesy hook from Darius Rucker on the title track. Alabama’s Ella Langley is gorgeously petty on “Hell at Night,” an ode to taking the low road. (“It’s just one of those situations where you could tell two people was going through some of the same things, just in their own separate ways,” said BigX of the collaboration.) But on the Thomas Rhett duet “Long Nights,” BigX takes a moment to appreciate how far he’s come: “I thank God like every day, ’cause, shit, he helped me find my purpose/I was hurting/I went from hearing shots to hearing fans behind those curtains/So I know that it’s working.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Country"],"name":"I Hope You're Happy

Elestee, who has little problem floating between airy melodies and polished rap cadences, eases into the project with some laid-back rapping on “On the Road,” before drifting into the warm, tropical sway of “Company.” On “Space,” her bars land with surety, the MC rapping, “Gravity don’t know me, so she sure as hell can’t hold me.” The Ayra Starr-assisted “On a Low” is a blend of attitude and vulnerability, which gets complemented by the playful looseness she brings to “Liar Liar.” By the time we reach EP closer “Designer Baby,” we’ve been spoiled by her dexterity, Elestee seeing fit to bring us out on an upbeat, danceable rhythm, her finesse fully intact.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Afro-Beat","Music","African"],"name":"Mentally, I'm Here -

Powered by a twitchy, squelching beat, “Energize Bunny” sets that narrative in motion, with Woods combing the club for his next conquest, before the atmospheric textures and gentle bongo rhythms of “One Night Stand” thrust us into that dreamy dance-floor moment when you lock eyes with your future partner for the first time and everything around you starts moving in slow motion. But it wouldn’t be a Roy Woods album without a whole lot of drama, and—spoiler alert—there is no happy ending to be had here: The album reaches its emotional breaking point with the barbwire ballad “Supposed to Be My Lover,” while the closing “Crazy” sees a jilted Woods spiraling out in a state of dubby delirium.","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Flower City

change, but the singer’s dedication to partnership endures.","standard":"To let Odeal tell it, the process of making July 2025’s <i>The Summer That Saved Me</i> rejuvenated the singer after a long spell of feeling unsettled, but on this album, which arrived a few months later, something still feels amiss. Across the nine songs of <i>The Fall That Saved Us</i>, Odeal rekindles an old flame, confessing his feelings and making grand promises that he promises to uphold deftly. But as most spins around the block prove, persistence is rarely the answer to incompatibility.\n\n<i>The Fall That Saved Us</i> is guided by beguiling neo-R&B-soul fusions that are both expansive and moving. Odeal sings the praises of his lover on “Reason,” humanizing her sweetly on the glowing “Children of Yeshua.” The album’s production grounds the star’s declarations of desire and admiration in his knack for storytelling, making room for subtle additions like the smoky drums of “Addicted” and a bebop bounce on “Blur.” For all of the besotted highs he reaches at different points on the album, Odeal is keenly aware of the toxicity that comes with this particular coupling. “Girl, you’re deprived/So tired/But you couldn’t trade it for the world if you tried,” he grimly sings on “Cold World.”\n\nAs the project nears its end, Odeal oscillates between acceptance and grief for a love that never quite seems to work. “Act like you want me/Prove it and show me,” he pleads on “Pretty Girls,” before squarely laying the blame for the relationship’s collapse at her feet on “Wicked.” It’s an instructive look into the dynamics of a relationship that promises so much but still implodes in a uniquely devastating way.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"The Fall That Saved

pop sensation adds “TIT FOR TAT” and four more cuts to her third album.","standard":"Canadian multihyphenate Tate McRae has barely stopped to take a breath since kindergarten: The 21-year-old began intensive dance training at age six, scored a record deal at 16, and tied for top nominee for the 2025 JUNO Awards. Her third studio album—expanded here with five new songs—arrived just a few months after the end of her 2024 world tour in support of her sophomore album, 2023’s <i>THINK LATER</i>. “Being on tour for a year feels like a million years—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I have been gone for a lifetime,’” McRae tells Apple Music, though naturally she used the time as a learning opportunity. “Being onstage every night and analyzing yourself that much, you become uber-aware of yourself and what’s going on.” She began paying closer attention to exactly what kind of songs inspired her to move, what beats triggered her dancers to get—in a word—“nasty.”\n\n<i>So Close to What</i> is not exactly a club record—more like a pop record you can viscerally feel, conducive to the kind of choreo that makes a killer stage show. Prominent on McRae’s mood board were Timbaland and The Neptunes, whose kinetic productions made the aughts feel like the future. Echoes of sparkly, club-friendly 2000s R&B abound: “bloodonmyhands” recruits Flo Milli for a Miami bass throwback, while “Purple lace bra” lands somewhere between The-Dream’s <i>Love vs. Money</i> and Lana Del Rey’s <i>Born to Die</i> (which checks out, given the latter album’s producer, Emile Haynie, among the credits). And on “Sports car,” McRae and co-writer Julia Michaels found unlikely inspiration in a 2005 crunk classic. “[Michaels] had been dying to reference the Ying Yang Twins’ ‘The Whisper Song,’ and I was like, ‘That’s crazy,’” she says. Sure enough, the concept worked.\n\nThe secret to writing her most grown-up album to date, as McRae explains, was a writer’s room that skewed heavily towards women (including Michaels and songwriter Amy Allen). “With music and finding perspective on situations, no one quite understands like another girl,” McRae explains. “You need another girl to know exactly what we’ve gone through and to know what it actually feels like in order to write a song. When you’re in a writing session, you have to be one brain together, and if it’s not that, that’s when chaos happens,” she went on. “It is so liberating to be with other girls and talk about things that are so frustrating and then feel so satisfied and accomplished after.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"SO CLOSE TO WHAT???

But after accomplishing everything a tunesmith for hire could possibly dream of—including credits for A-list stars like Adele, Dua Lipa, and Justin Bieber; a Grammy win for Songwriter of the Year; and a back-catalog sale to investment firm Hipgnosis—Jesso has blown the dust off the ivories as if the preceding decade never happened. That said, <i>s h i n e</i> is by no means <i>Goon II</i>. Where Jesso’s debut nodded to the Paul McCartney/Elton John golden age of ’70s singer/songwriters, <i>s h i n e</i> is a more off-the-cuff and eccentric affair, where the hissy in-the-room ambiance and squeaky-chair sounds feel like members of his phantom backing band. \n\nIn many respects, the album feels like Jesso’s solo-piano companion piece to two major albums he worked on in 2025: Justin Bieber’s <i>SWAG</i> and Dijon’s <i>Baby</i>. Like those records, <i>s h i n e</i> is an unfiltered, intimate meditation on life, love, and family, vacillating between expressions of paralyzing self-doubt (“Bridges”) and awestruck gratitude (“Green Eyes”). For all its unvarnished qualities, there are hints of a pro songwriter at work: With its pulse-pounding tempo, you could easily imagine Jesso embellishing “Black Magic” into a dance-pop bop for one of his chart-topping clients. But <i>s h i n e</i> is ultimately the work of a singular artist whose unlikely career trajectory and surprise return are reflected in his unconventional production choices: Just as the tender ballad “I Love You” lulls you into a blissfully slumberous state, the song is bombarded by an onslaught of percussive shocks that will have you checking to see if your media player is glitching out.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"s h i n

alté R&B superstar offers her blueprint for living in love.","standard":"Being an internationally adored superstar doesn’t absolve you from wanting to be understood—or looked after. And from the sound of Tems’ <i>Love Is a Kingdom</i> EP, it may, in fact, exacerbate those notions. But fear not, because in addition to being a groundbreaking alté R&B singer, Tems can be both educator and healer, reminding an adoring fanbase that the strongest love is self-love.  \n\nFrom the outset, Tems is “moving different” on project opener “First,” which is exactly where her own personal happiness now sits on her list of priorities. If she’s second-guessing the devotion of a lover on “I’m Not Sure,” “Big Daddy” carries the epiphany that you didn’t actually need someone else in the first place. “Lagos Love” and “Mine” may be vocally dazzling showcases of devotion, but things escalate to a religious degree on “Is There a Reason,” which sounds like both prayer and testimony. Love may indeed be a kingdom, but in Tems’ world, it isn’t one simply for the anointed. It’s for any and all who are willing to build and protect it.\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"name":"Love Is A Kingdom","playParams":{"id":"1853635930","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-21","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-is-a-kingdom/1853635930","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3aI43F5shWPnoW4KMfxM1c"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853635930/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1413909060","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1413909060?l=en-US"}]}}},"1853661941":{"id":"1853661941","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853661941?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Fabio Capri","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fabio-capri/1694023349","artwork":{"bgColor":"833f38","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f8f1d3","textColor2":"f9cba7","textColor3":"e1cdb4","textColor4":"e2af90","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/af/62/cbaf6289-3fbc-79de-bf6c-803cb5cb4aef/198704857263_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"833f38","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f8f1d3","textColor2":"f9cba7","textColor3":"e1cdb4","textColor4":"e2af90","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/af/62/cbaf6289-3fbc-79de-bf6c-803cb5cb4aef/198704857263_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Christmas","Music","Holiday"],"name":"Llegó Navidad - EP","playParams":{"id":"1853661941","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-22","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lleg%C3%B3-navidad-ep/1853661941"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853661941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1694023349","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1694023349?l=en-US"}]}}},"1853782825":{"id":"1853782825","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853782825?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"VVUP","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vvup/1734915247","artwork":{"bgColor":"d1eff1","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"23271f","textColor2":"212a23","textColor3":"464f49","textColor4":"44514c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/57/4d/15/574d159d-e47a-e600-be30-aad3dd05e8fc/888272171327.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"d1eff1","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"23271f","textColor2":"212a23","textColor3":"464f49","textColor4":"44514c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/57/4d/15/574d159d-e47a-e600-be30-aad3dd05e8fc/888272171327.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"VVON","playParams":{"id":"1853782825","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-20","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vvon/1853782825","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0lJ71UcwMYWJKeulIvyXmn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853782825/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1734915247","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1734915247?l=en-US"}]}}},"1853929060":{"id":"1853929060","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1853929060?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Summer Walker","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/summer-walker/990402287","artwork":{"bgColor":"d4d9e8","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"000103","textColor2":"0e1007","textColor3":"2b2c30","textColor4":"353834","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/20/4b/93/204b9390-42cb-c42f-cf95-1c059edbef3d/25UM1IM86719.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"d4d9e8","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"000103","textColor2":"0e1007","textColor3":"2b2c30","textColor4":"353834","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/20/4b/93/204b9390-42cb-c42f-cf95-1c059edbef3d/25UM1IM86719.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B powerhouse chooses herself on the finale of a now-classic trilogy.","standard":"Summer Walker spent nearly a decade after the release of her 2018 mixtape <i>Last Day of Summer</i> wearing her heart on her sleeve. The R&B powerhouse has invited listeners into her tumultuous world through honest lyricism, storytelling, and diary-like ruminations that chronicle the messiness of romance, self-love, and everything in between. Her 2019 debut album <i>Over It</i> and its 2021 follow-up <i>Still Over It</i> offer a layered narrative of self-discovery as she navigates her ever-evolving perspective on the sobering truths about relationships and emotional boundaries. However, with <i>Finally Over It</i>—the final chapter in the trilogy—she retires the self-proclaimed lover-girl persona and chooses herself, no matter what that looks like to others. Along for the ride is an all-star lineup of guests, including Latto, Mariah the Scientist, Doja Cat, SAILORR, Chris Brown, Anderson .Paak, GloRilla, Sexyy Red, Monaleo, 21 Savage, Brent Faiyaz, Teddy Swims, and frequent collaborator Bryson Tiller. \n\nAcross 18 tracks, <i>Finally Over It</i> is divided evenly into two parts, For Better and For Worse, which mirrors the album art’s wedding theme and alludes to the project’s unifying idea: the cynicism that can come from the pursuit of romantic relationships and the choices that are left when love feels impossible. The first half showcases Walker’s ability to save herself from entanglements that no longer serve her (“Robbed You,” “Situationship”). “No,” which interpolates Beyoncé’s 2003 song “Yes,” is about standing firm against one-sided demands: “You want me to cater to you, never tell you no/You want me to lose myself just to keep your home/But the answer’s no.” Yet on “1-800-Heartbreak,” she croons about her loneliness after the end of a relationship. Not every song on the first half deals with fed-up declarations and self-assured boasts. Walker still leans into her lover-girl ways (“Baby,” “Give Me a Reason”) and gives second chances (“Heart of a Woman”), but even the most broken relationships are opportunities to learn something new. \n\nThe second half, For Worse, finds Walker giving up on finding unconditional love, trading the idea of a traditional relationship for one that prioritizes material comforts. She ditches the idea of being with her usual type on “FMT” and lets it be known she’s only into men who can provide for her needs financially on the swaggering “Baller,” while keeping her walls up even though she might be falling in love (“Stitch Me Up,” “Allegedly”). Throughout all the ups and downs within the different vignettes Walker explores, there’s solace in knowing that through all the choices depicted—good, bad, and possibly terrible—she emphasizes choosing oneself, for better or for worse.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Finally Over It (The
