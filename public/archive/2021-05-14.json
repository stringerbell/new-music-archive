That was the wheelhouse that I wanted to play in. I wanted to make new stories with older sounds.”<br />\nRecorded with <i>MASSEDUCTION</i> producer Jack Antonoff, <i>Daddy’s Home</i> draws heavily from the 1970s, but its title was inspired, in part, by recent events in Clark’s personal life: her father’s 2019 release from prison, where he’d served nearly a decade for his role in a stock manipulation scheme. It’s as much about our capacity to evolve as it is embracing the humanity in our flaws. “I wanted to make sure that even if anybody didn't know my personal autobiography that it would be open to interpretation as to whether Daddy is a father or Daddy is a boyfriend or Daddy is a pimp—I wanted that to be ambiguous,” she says. “Part of the title is literal: ‘Yeah, here he is, he's home!’ And then another part of it is ‘It’s 10 years later. I’ve done a lot in those 10 years. I have responsibility. I have shit I'm seriously doing. It’s playing with it: Am I daddy's girl? I don't know. Maybe. But I'm also Daddy, too, now.” Here, Clark guides us through a few of the album’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Pay Your Way in Pain”</b>\n“This character is like the fixture in a 2021 psychedelic blues. And this is basically the sentiment of the blues: truly just kind of being down and out in a country, in a society, that oftentimes asks you to choose between dignity and survival. So it's just this story of one really bad fuckin’ day. And just owning the fact that truly what everybody wants in the world, with rare exception, is just to have a roof over their head, to be loved, and to get by. The line about the heels always makes me laugh. I've been her, I know her. I've been the one who people kind of go, ‘Oh, oh, dear. Hide the children's eyes.’ I know her, and I know her well.”<br />\n<b>“Down and Out Downtown”</b>\n“This is actually maybe my favorite song on the record. I don't know how other people will feel about it. We've all been that person who is wearing last night's heels at eight in the morning on the train, processing: ‘Oh, where have we been? What did I just do?’ You're groggy, you're sort of trying to avoid the knowing looks from other people—and the way that in New York, especially, you can just really ride that balance between like abandon and destruction. That's her; I've been her too.”<br />\n<b>“Daddy's Home”</b>\n“The story is really about one of the last times I went to go visit my dad in prison. If I was in national press or something, they put the press clippings on his bed. And if I was on TV, they'd gather around in the common area and watch me be on Letterman or whatever. So some of the inmates knew who I was and presumably, I don't know, mentioned it to their family members. I ended up signing an autograph on a receipt because you can't bring phones and you couldn't do a selfie. It’s about watching the tables turn a little bit, from father and daughter. It's a complicated story and there's every kind of emotion about it. My family definitely chose to look at a lot of things with some gallows humor, because what else are you going to do? It's absolutely absurd and heartbreaking and funny all at the same time. So: Worth putting into a song.”<br />\n<b>“Live in the Dream”</b>\n“If there are other touchpoints on the record that hint at psychedelia, on this one we've gone completely psychedelic. I was having a conversation with Jack and he was telling me about a conversation he had with Bruce Springsteen. Bruce was just, I think anecdotally, talking about the game of fame and talking about the fact that we lose a lot of people to it. They can kind of float off into the atmosphere, and the secret is, you can't let the dream take over you. The dream has to live inside of you. And I thought that was wonderful, so I wrote this song as if you're waking up from a dream and you almost have these sirens talking to you. In life, there's still useful delusions. And then there's delusions that—if left unchecked—lead to kind of a misuse of power.”<br />\n<b>“Down”</b>\n“The song is a revenge fantasy. If you're nice, people think they can take advantage of you. And being nice is not the same thing as being a pushover. If we don't want to be culpable to something, we could say, 'Well, it's definitely just this thing in my past,' but at the end of the day, there's human culpability. Life is complicated, but I don't care why you are hurt. It's not an excuse to be cruel. Whatever your excuse is, you've played it out.”<br />\n<b>“…At the Holiday Party”</b>\n“Everybody's been this person at one time. I've certainly been this person, where you are masking your sadness with all kinds of things. Whether it's dressing up real fancy or talking about that next thing you're going to do, whatever it is. And we kind of reveal ourselves by the things we try to hide and to kind of say we've all been there. Drunk a little too early, at a party, there's a moment where you can see somebody's face break, and it's just for a split second, but you see it. That was the little window into what's going on with you, and what you're using to obfuscate is actually revealing you.”","short":"“I wanted to make new stories with older sounds.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1567455268","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567455268?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/f6/1b/48/f61b484d-82bc-843c-62e7-72976eb8c347/21UMGIM42530.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"410828","textColor1":"fffcf1","textColor2":"b6aad9","textColor3":"d8cbc8","textColor4":"9f89b5"},"artistName":"Nicki Minaj","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beam-me-up-scotty/1567455268","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":23,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Beam Me Up Scotty","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602435571690","copyright":"℗ 2020 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1567455268","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The rapper’s classic mixtape arrives on streaming with some new additions."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1566843813","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566843813?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/95/73/0f/95730f39-afa1-5c68-0075-b7d61cda8a0b/886449233359.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"051c22","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"f3e2e5","textColor3":"ccd1d2","textColor4":"c3babe"},"artistName":"21 Savage","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/spiral-from-the-book-of-saw-soundtrack-ep/1566843813","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Spiral: From the Book of Saw Soundtrack - EP","recordLabel":"Slaughter Gang, LLC/Epic Records","upc":"886449233359","copyright":"℗ 2021 Slaughter Gang, LLC under exclusive license to Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1566843813","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The <i>Saw</i> films were supposed to end in 2010 with the seventh installment.

It's a fitting assignment: The Atlanta rhymer's sinister raps align with the gruesome bent of the franchise. On the opening track of his <i>Spiral</i> EP, he raps over a bass-boosted sample of the movies' spine-tingling theme music, detailing revenge fantasies spawned from his animus for enemies—“call me Saw 'cause I laugh when I body shit,” he announces. On closer “Emergency,” he links up with Young Thug and Gunna for a track that feels more teaser than thematic. In between, he lets his progeny shine with Young Nudy's “You Ain't Hard” and Real Recognize Rio, 21 Lil Harold, and SG Tip offering their own takes on their mentor's style on “Down Bad.” The EP is short and sweet and may leave listeners craving more from 21 Savage, whose deadpan delivery is ripe with potential for translating true horror.","short":"The Atlanta rapper's sinister style aligns with the franchise's gruesome bent."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1562742266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1562742266?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/f8/0b/21/f80b21be-f3ad-2311-7647-14684cfd1bd5/075597913989.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"3e3935","textColor1":"e7eee9","textColor2":"dce7e8","textColor3":"c5cac5","textColor4":"bcc4c4"},"artistName":"The Black Keys","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/delta-kream/1562742266","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Blues","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Delta Kream","recordLabel":"Nonesuch","upc":"075597913989","copyright":"℗ 2021 Nonesuch Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1562742266","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If 2019’s <i>“Let’s Rock”</i> allowed The Black Keys to go back to basics with their blues-smoked garage rock, then on <i>Delta Kream</i>, they honor the source. “Any chance we get to turn people on hill country blues, we want to do that, because it means that much to us,” singer-songwriter-guitarist Dan Auerbach tells Apple Music. “We love this music and definitely feel a close connection to it.”<br />\nRecorded during a two-day session in Nashville with local musicians Kenny Brown and Eric Deaton, the Nashville-by-way-of-Akron, Ohio duo’s 10th LP features reworkings of North Mississippi hill country blues standards they’ve been listening to since they were in their teens. Their passion for the genre shows in their raw and effortless performances—whether they turn John Lee Hooker’s “Crawling Kingsnake” into a six-minute incendiary jam or give the full treatment to R.L. Burnside’s “Mellow Peaches” with a soulful guitar interplay that rises into an intense crescendo. But for the most part, Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney are not interested in adding any bells and whistles, like on “Sad Days, Lonely Nights,” where they capture the live essence of Junior Kimbrough’s 1994 original. “Some of the best roots music are those spontaneous records,” Auerbach adds. “You can just feel this kind of nervous energy, but it was just fun.”","short":"“Any chance we get to turn people on hill country blues, we want to do that.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1563007618","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1563007618?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8f/96/29/8f962954-e2db-bc3d-d8a1-f1a23e2a8fdb/196006390891.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"a50027","textColor1":"edd7cd","textColor2":"e3cbcc","textColor3":"dfacac","textColor4":"d6a2ab"},"artistName":"Jorja Smith","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/be-right-back/1563007618","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"Be Right Back","recordLabel":"FAMM","upc":"196006390891","copyright":"℗ 2021 FAMM","playParams":{"id":"1563007618","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If it wasn’t already clear from her soul-baring 2018 debut album <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>, then perhaps her 2019 single “Be Honest” made it extra clear: Jorja Smith is, amongst others things, incredibly truthful where her music is concerned. “I was actually going to call this <i>This Is Not My Second Album</i>,” the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music of the EP <i>Be Right Back</i>. “Because these are songs that I love and I've written in the past two years, but I'm not yet ready to do 'the album.' When it’s time, I want to tour that album. And also: I know that there's another level that I can get to—musically, creatively, and all other aspects.” The British singer-songwriter has, of course, previous experience when it comes to non-album material making a splash. Her silky, soulful appearances on Drake’s <i>More Life</i> “playlist” are arguably what opened her up to a global audience, while a slew of post-<i>Lost &amp; Found</i> collaborations with artists including Brent Faiyaz, Popcaan, and ENNY mean Rihanna-style anticipation for an eventual album two.<br /> \nThis eight-track set of evocative ballads—a self-described sonic “waiting room”—finds Smith continuing to thoughtfully navigate her way through a changing world. “Music's great,” she says. “It’s a little escape, and that's why I gave the project this title. I just wanted to dip in and dip out. But I want it to be a safe escape for my fans—for right now—because I know they miss me.”<br />\nPerhaps fittingly, then, it’s a striking and spare collection of moods and moments. “Bussdown” is gorgeous: a sultry hookup with UK rapper Shaybo that recalls Smith’s “Blue Lights” in potent storytelling. The bracingly direct “Addicted” glides over guitar licks that wouldn’t be out of place on <i>In Rainbows</i>, while “Gone” memorializes the tragic loss of a friend. “Anyone who listens will hear it differently to what it actually means in the first place,” she says of the track. “That’s what I love.” Elsewhere, “Home” feels like chancing on Smith at an open mic night with a diary entry, and “Weekend” brings us to a dreamlike, considered climax. Smith’s falsetto on this track, by the way, has never sounded so angelic.<br />\nThe minimalist makeup of this music—notably trekking free of the soul and jazz borders of <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>—hint at fresh, exciting levels to come. After being cued up as the UK’s next R&amp;B/pop powerhouse, <i>Be Right Back</i> is the sound of an artist taking a breath before her next play. “I only dropped my first album three years ago,” she says. “And now I’ve been able to take in everything I've done in the last three years. I’m actually able to look at [plaques and records on] my walls like, ‘Oh my god, I did this.’ I appreciate everything, but I miss my fans, and I miss [doing] shows. The last year and this year has been so tough. I wanted to give them something.”","short":"“I miss my fans.

From his 1990 studio debut <i>Here in the Real World</i> onward, Jackson has stayed true to traditional country music, earning a legion of fans who adore him for doing exactly that. <i>Where Have You Gone</i>, his first new album in six years, continues in that vein. “When I look at this album and its whole content, I don't think that it's much different than almost any album I've made,” Jackson tells Apple Music. “I've always had the same subject matter.” That subject matter includes small-town living (“Back,” “Where the Cottonwood Grows”), family (“I Do,” “Where Her Heart Has Always Been”), tossing back a drink or two (“Wishful Drinkin’,” “Way Down in My Whiskey”), and, of course, country music itself, as on standout track “That’s the Way Love Goes,” which pays tribute to the late Merle Haggard. Below, Jackson shares insight into a few of <i>Where Have You Gone</i>’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Where Have You Gone”</b>\n“I wrote it from this perspective as though it were a woman that had left you. I let people hear that song when I was finished and first thing they would hear is, ‘Oh, here's another heartbreak song.’ And they get to the chorus and it kind of flips a switch there.”<br />\n<b>“Back”</b>\n“It kind of started as a joke, really. I don't know, several years ago, I don't know about that music so much, but my kids were talking about how Justin Timberlake had this ‘bringing sexy back’ song. And they were just laughing, talking about it. And I never even heard it. I said, ‘Well, I think I'm going to write one about how I'm going to bring country back.’ Anyway, they kept asking me about it every now and then, so I ended up writing it. And I didn't write it from a position of ‘I'm going to bring country back.’ I think it was just more of a fun song. And I ended up talking all these memories, visual memories of things that I remember growing up in the South in a small town, which is so relatable to country music.”<br />\n<b>“Where the Cottonwood Grows”</b>\n“It just came to me one day. I was probably driving along, that's when a lot of them come. I just remember that hook coming up, and that melody, too, and I just stuck with it. Nowadays, it's easier with the phones, because I can record a melody real quick. Because it can be five minutes later, and I couldn't remember that melody again. I hadn't had an album in six years, and it wasn't intentional, just things kind of happened this way. I've had hundreds of little hooks and clips like that recorded on my phone. And when I started writing last fall, I kind of sat down and said, ‘How am I going to write for this album?’ Because I hadn't felt like writing for a while, but then I took all those out and I had about 200 of them on the phone.”","short":"“I hadn't had an album in six years.

The music itself reflects these personal stories: It’s more stripped-back and intimate than anything she’s released before. “I used an entirely new approach for creating the album,” she says. “I approached it like a biography. I wrote the majority of the songs in my home in Los Angeles at my white piano, after thinking and talking through a life experience.” The resulting effort led to more than 60 songs, written alongside Matthew Copley and Marla Altschuler. “They created a safe space for me to tell these stories with freedom and transparency,” she says. The album was also recorded live, unlike her earlier releases, with “no sounds or effects”—leaving it to feel as raw and truthful as the stories within. Below, Goodrem talks through each song on <i>Bridge Over Troubled Dreams</i>.<br />\n<b>“Keep Climbing”</b>\n“‘Keep Climbing’ sets the tone for the whole album. It’s about the resilience in never giving up and having the strength to keep reaching for your dreams. Oftentimes, we might feel stuck between where we are and where we want to be; sometimes fear is holding us back or limiting our beliefs. Change can be scary, but we must stay focused.”<br />\n<b>“Everyone's Famous”</b>\n“I kept thinking about the difference in growing up now and when I was a kid. I wanted to reach for the stars—I was so inspired by the legends, obsessed with learning the craft. But kids are growing up with social media fueling an impossible aspiration of fame and popularity. I wanted to write an ode to the greats, sharing gratitude and admiration for those I continue to be inspired by. It’s about striving for greatness, whatever industry you work in or life you are living.”<br />\n<b>“Solid Gold”</b> \n“‘Solid Gold’ is about a relationship where someone has taken you for granted. I wanted it to have an empowering message. The lyrics speak to reminding that person of your value, worth, and strength. From time to time, we all have people come into our lives who criticize us or don’t appreciate all that we have to offer. This is a reminder to never forget that you deserve to be treated with kindness and love.”<br />\n<b>“Dear Elton”</b>\n“My hands wrote the piano part by themselves. Looking back, I don’t even know how it happened. The song is a letter to Elton John. I was brought back to a moment when I was young and he reached out to me. It was when I was at my weakest, physically, undergoing chemotherapy. His kindness and belief in my music has always stayed with me. His generosity of heart gave me tremendous light, but don’t think I fully understood the weight of that moment until much later. I’ve always had this deeply inspired connection to him and his music: the way he plays the keys, and the artistry in his music and lyrics will always be an inspiration. The song is a metaphor, too—in some ways it’s an empowered message to myself, saying, ‘Here I am.’”<br />\n<b>“Billionaire”</b>\n“‘Billionaire’ is one of my favorite songs on the album. It’s gritty and unfiltered girl power, and there’s a toughness to its femininity—like a Nancy Sinatra track, but with the lyrical vibes of her father’s ‘I Did It My Way.’ ‘Billionaire’ is for all of the girls who lead with their hearts and make it happen for themselves. Also, life isn’t about how much material wealth you accumulate, it’s about being rich in what counts: family, friends, love, understanding, and kindness.”<br />\n<b>“Paralyzed”</b>\n“As a songwriter, I write about my own experiences, and this one’s about a forced reset that I wasn’t expecting. I’ve learned to lean into change and uncertainty. Life is fluid and constantly changing—when we embrace resets and change and use them to our advantage, our perspective shifts and opens up new opportunities and experiences. This song carries a message of hope and love. Getting through the tough times is hard, but with hope and love we can get through anything.”<br />\n<b>“All of My Friends”</b>\n“‘All of My Friends’ was inspired by and written through tears, when I was missing home, family and friends. It’s a raw, vulnerable moment when you wonder if your decisions and sacrifices in life are worth it, and contemplate striking the balance between all that is most important to you.”<br />\n<b>“Kill Them With Kindness”</b>\n“‘Kill Them With Kindness’ was written on August 4, 2019, the same day I wrote ‘Paralyzed’ and ‘Everyone’s Famous.’ A lot of music came flooding out that day. Growing up, my mum always taught me that you never know what someone else is going through, and if someone projects anger and negativity on you, the best response is to smile back and to be kind.”<br />\n<b>“Crash”</b>\n“‘Crash’ tells the story of the start of my life. Lyrically, it plays out like a movie scene. It’s a moment that my parents have explained to me over the years in different ways, and here I’m singing the story as I’ve always imagined it: My mum was driving alone, while pregnant with me, when someone crashed into her. Even though she was alone, I know something spiritual happened—it wasn’t just us in the car. We had faith in the front seat and hope by our side. The angels heard us cry. I was born 10 weeks premature, in that wreck, and the first moments of my life were touch and go for mum and I. I’ve experienced a series of resets and sliding-door moments in my life, which I never take for granted.”<br />\n<b>“The Power”</b>\n“This was one of the first songs I wrote on this record, originally called ‘The Power of a Prayer.’ I always loved it, but so much changed in the world and myself since it was written. Just before I was due to hand in the final mastered album, I rewrote the verses and went back into the studio to record it again. The meaning had changed and I suddenly heard themes of strength and empowerment, rather than the original sentiment. A gospel choir brought the energy I was hearing to life. Listening to the song literally lifts me up.”<br />\n<b>“Play”</b>\n“This last song starts with an audio sample by Alan Watts from the <i>Tao of Philosophy</i> talk ‘Coincidence of Opposites.’ We listened to this recording before starting any of the writing for this album, and it has such important messages that resonated with me: You don't work the piano, you play the piano; the whole purpose of the dancing is the dance; how life is like an analogy of music. It is a musical thing and you are supposed to dance while the music is being played. So, just go and 'Play.'”","short":"“Many of the stories on this album had been in my heart for some time.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1565510601","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565510601?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/e7/33/55/e7335510-80e8-44bf-9afd-2837d53ce1a0/NCTD_01_Hot_Sauce_DC-F_0429.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"dfff00","textColor1":"0b0e12","textColor2":"003300","textColor3":"353e0f","textColor4":"2c5c00"},"artistName":"NCT DREAM","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hot-sauce-the-1st-album/1565510601","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-10","name":"Hot Sauce - The 1st Album","recordLabel":"SM Entertainment","upc":"888735937989","copyright":"℗ 2021 SM Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1565510601","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The K-pop group bring the heat with a host of certified bangers."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1562174369","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1562174369?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/2d/b4/12/2db41244-a15c-afe4-c895-48c906546324/4062548027068_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"191b1a","textColor1":"e2acc8","textColor2":"d89fb5","textColor3":"b98fa5","textColor4":"b28596"},"artistName":"Jayda G","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dj-kicks-jayda-g-dj-mix/1562174369","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-05-14","name":"DJ-Kicks: Jayda G (DJ Mix)","recordLabel":"!K7 Records","upc":"4062548027068","copyright":"℗ 2021 !K7 Music","playParams":{"id":"1562174369","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"!K7’s long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix series has generally been <i>the</i> place for established legends—or legends in the making—of dance music to show off their one-of-a-kind skills as technicians and selectors.

Limiting himself to a pared-down set of musical elements, his structure drew from ’60s minimalists like Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Melodically, he incorporated snippets of ancient Scandinavian folk songs, which he slowed and rearranged into haunting refrains. And thematically, he was influenced by the late philosopher Mark Fisher, whose writings on capitalism, futurism, and melancholy Nordmark found profoundly inspiring. A similar set of guidelines had yielded the formal austerity of 2019’s <i>Eternal Words</i>, but with <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, “I decided I wanted to be more personal,” he tells Apple Music. Fisher’s work, in particular, made him ask himself, “Why am I doing this music?” In search of answers, the London-based artist began work on the album just before the city went into lockdown. It’s not hard to hear how the experience of the following months may have shaped its direction. Although soft and contemplative, Nordmark’s mostly wordless pieces harbor a deep-seated unease. “My friend who is releasing the album said, ‘It’s so dark and so dense,’” he says. “I didn’t really reflect on that when I made it.” Here he does a bit more thinking about each of the LP’s tracks.<br />\n<b>Exit</b>\n“This was one of the first tracks I did for the album. I see it as a bridge between the previous album and the new one. When I started making <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, I made a sound palette based on <i>Eternal Words</i>, but then I added a few more sounds to that palette. One was a really processed electric guitar, which is frozen, in a way. Maybe that’s because I’m a guitarist and it’s a more tactile instrument, so that’s a more personal side I’m letting into the project.”<br />\n<b>Ghosts (feat. Waterbaby)</b>\n“Where other tracks used these ancient Swedish melodic fragments, ‘Ghosts’ uses the ‘Tristan chord,’ from Richard Wagner’s <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, which for its time was very spectacular. I deconstructed that, just using those first notes from <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, and built the track from it. It’s also different because there are voices on it. They’re singing a line that I picked from a Swedish neo-gothic novel. The book starts with a feverish dream: The protagonist is dreaming and there’s a ghost whispering to this character, asking him if his sleep has been refreshing. There are a lot of layers embedded in this track.”<br />\n<b>Dreaming</b>\n“It’s very cinematic. I was thinking about film scores when I was making this album, and how you use cues to enhance the drama in a film. That’s definitely happening in ‘Dreaming’: It goes up and down in that way and creates the drama.”<br />\n<b>Spirit</b>\n“It feels really medieval; there’s something that might be a flute sound. This rhythmic element—I call it the space-jazz drummer—feels organic. It’s actually processed noise. When I did that sound, I was thinking a lot of Arthur Russell’s <i>World of Echo</i>, which is one of my favorite albums. It’s so out there, rhythmically. He seems to just play and all these rhythms happen. And how he distorts his cello is so beautiful. That was the inspiration for that sound, which returns in other places, but most significantly in ‘Spirit.’ Maybe that’s the spirit of Arthur Russell that pokes into the song.”<br />\n<b>Aftertime</b>\n\"This is one of the few tracks where you could actually hum the melody. Coming from a background in pop music, melody is something that I really appreciate. I’m doing this skewed instrumental music, but sometimes it just happens that these layers present a melody. I think of it almost as a symphonic track, in a way.”<br />\n<b>Nights</b>\n“I think of this more as an opera. I’ve been working with an opera director on a few projects. We did an opera together, really avant-garde stuff, and a film as well. There’s a sound in this, a human sound, that you might recognize as an operatic voice. This is one of the tracks I haven’t really come to terms with. But then I thought, ‘Maybe that’s a good sign,’ because it has a weirdness that I haven’t really accepted.”<br />\n<b>Becoming</b>\n“Before I did <i>Exit Ghosts</i>, I started to make an album that was totally ambient. I did half and then I just said, ‘No, this is not what I want to do.’ But some made its way into <i>Exit Ghosts</i>. ‘Becoming’ is what I took from that project. It’s more serene and ambient, and it doesn’t have many percussive elements. It prepares us for the end of the journey. Maybe I see it as a transition as well, because it transitioned from the project I trashed and made its way into this album anyway.”<br />\n<b>Outsides</b>\n“If you listen to the album in full, there’s a drama: You start out one way, go up in the middle, and then you’re being washed out toward the end. There’s actually a quote from Mark Fisher’s <i>The Weird and the Eerie</i> that I connect with this track: ‘What the weird and the eerie have in common is a preoccupation with the strange. The strange—not the horrific…. It has, rather, to do with a fascination for the outside, for that which lies beyond standard perception, cognition, and experience.’ And I think that’s a summary of my thoughts on this album.”","short":"“I decided I wanted to be more
