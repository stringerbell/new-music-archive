It's all of the things that we're kind of afraid to share, afraid to say, afraid to do.” Within the opening minutes, on “We Made It,” that sentiment is clear, as the multi-hyphenate singer-songwriter drinks in the moment and the success that's taken her from nights she was uncertain to the Grammy stage and beyond. The percussion is crisp, and her guitar wails through a solo, and right away, we're engrossed in the lush, technical precision that has made H.E.R. one of the most gifted musicians of her generation. <br />\nOver the course of the album's 21 songs, she offers the many modes which make up H.E.R. Sultry slow jams run up against funky grooves while stripped-back ballads exist alongside trap beats—together, they span the modern history of R&B and position H.E.R. as both a student of the genre and a bellwether in her own right. “There were a lot of records on this album that I realized were like elevated versions of songs on my first projects, <i>Vol. 1</i> and <i>Vol. 2</i>, where sonically, it's vibey. It's like that alternative, kind of new R&B sound,” she says in the film. “But with live instrumentation, it just took it to another level. It's a celebration of all things that make R&B—the different aspects, the different sounds of R&B. R&B is the foundation of all music.”<br />\nOver the years, H.E.R.'s work within the genre has only grown more expansive. Where once she was an artist defined by her anonymity, she's now unafraid of her own light, a full-fledged star whose versatility is matched only by her musicality. <i>Back of My Mind</i> effectively captures her at, arguably, the most brilliant, confident, and freewheeling she's ever been. In an often overprogrammed world, it's the instrumentation that takes the project to another level—the space where she's finally able to fully express herself. “This album is representing this freedom of creativity that people are now accepting of me,” she says. “Music is my playground, and I can do whatever I want.”","short":"The singer's debut album is here, along with an exclusive short film."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1565416439","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565416439?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"height":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8c/e9/c6/8ce9c6bc-7d8b-741c-1489-cdf732032254/075679787170.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"fcfcfc","textColor1":"000c1b","textColor2":"030f1f","textColor3":"333c48","textColor4":"353e4b"},"artistName":"Gucci Mane","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ice-daddy/1565416439","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"Ice Daddy","recordLabel":"Guwop Enterprises/Atlantic","upc":"075679787170","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1565416439","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Before Gucci Mane was <i>Ice Daddy</i>, he was <i>the</i> Ice Daddy. Those unaware that Gucci's latest project is named for his youngest son are likely still well familiar with the prolific MC’s affinity for jewelry, something that once inspired a magazine listicle about his “greatest chains.” Rap spoils aside, Gucci himself has claimed to have “fathered” more rap careers than he’ll ever get credit for. <i>Ice Daddy</i> isn’t about much of any of that, though. Across the project, Gucci is mostly focused on bigging up the crew (“Posse on Bouldercrest,” “Like 34 & 8”), his continued financial success (“Never Runnin Out of Money,” “Fold Dat Money Up,” a new version of “Rich N***a Shit”), and how he is still not to be played with (“Shit Crazy,” “Gucci Coming 4 You,” “Lately”). Along for the ride are Lil Baby, Lil Uzi Vert, Young Dolph, E-40, 2 Chainz, Project Pat, Peewee Longway, BIG30, Pooh Shiesty, BigWalkDog, and, maybe most interestingly, “Baby Got Back” MC Sir Mix-A-Lot. If <i>Ice Daddy</i> has anything to do with fatherhood specifically, it’s that it plays out kind of like a baby shower, Gucci passing cigars—or, more accurately, the microphone—to a bevy of friends who’ve all come out to celebrate his latest, greatest accomplishment.","short":"Break out the champagne!

On the heels of the Hertfordshire-born singer-songwriter receiving the year’s Rising Star Brit Award, it's as fitting for Griff’s cusp-of-superstardom status as it is for this EP's exploration of moving on from heartbreak. “It felt like how I feel towards everything, whether that’s my relationships with my family, with myself, with my love life, or with my music career,” the singer, real name Sarah Griffiths, tells Apple Music. “There’s this sense of vulnerability and the unknown, and all you can really do is just put one foot in front of the other.”<br />\nThe tracks here were largely written, recorded, and produced by Griff during the 2020 lockdown, which brings raw edges to her open-hearted music: ’80s-style pop inspired by HAIM, Lorde, and Taylor Swift, among others. “It was just me experimenting, messing about in my room and seeing what comes of that,” she says. “I was trying to write honest, reflective lyrics. I think a lot of it is quite rough and ready, but that’s what I love about it.” But while the singer deals with some tough topics on <i>One Foot in Front of the Other</i>—from allowing yourself to trust again after heartbreak (“Heart of Gold”) to pleading with a loved one to get their priorities in order (“Earl Grey Tea”)—by its end, she’s ready to stand tall (see the uplifting “Walk”). Read on as Griff talks us through the mixtape, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“Black Hole”</b>\n“This was written in my last session before COVID happened. I was writing with [UK songwriter] Lostboy and [producer] SIBA. We landed on there being this big black hole. On one side, there’s a real honesty and ruthlessness about talking about the emptiness we can all feel. But then the production brings lightness and humor to that. The lyrics are so melodramatic, and it’s almost trying to create that sense of dancing through your heartbreak. It’s about owning that feeling.”<br />\n<b>“One Foot in Front of the Other”</b>\n“I guess this song is a bit of a part two to ‘Black Hole.’ ‘Black Hole’ is all minor, and then you hit ‘One Foot in Front of the Other,’ which is very major. It’s about someone talking about how it feels to suddenly and slowly make progress out of this dark place. No one else realizes that you’re making progress, but it’s in those small things where suddenly it feels like there’s light at the end of the tunnel. It’s that vulnerable feeling of walking a tightrope. It’s scary, but you’re getting there.”<br />\n<b>“Shade of Yellow”</b>\n“A song that’s about escape. There were many times in my childhood where, because it was either chaotic or not that great at home, I’d find refuge in my best friend's house or something. The lamp in this song is a metaphor for always coming back to a person, and it’s good to admit that you’re coming back for them. But the beat is quite tumultuous all the way through. For me, I was picturing driving at nighttime. Which, I guess, is kind of what this song is about. It’s about just trying to find safety and home in different places.”<br />\n<b>“Heart of Gold”</b>\n“This is very sparse in its production. It was quite inspired by ‘Royals’ by Lorde, in the sense that the song is just drums and vocals. It’s about being a cautious lover and being a bit broken with someone that’s almost this perfect person. It’s about not wanting to be hurt again and about not really knowing how to open up again. There’s a contrast in this fragile girl who has a heart of stone.”<br />\n<b>“Remembering My Dreams”</b>\n“It’s about the fact that, in the daytime, we can be busy and fine, and then suddenly, the moment you’re asleep, things come back—whether it’s your ex or your fears or anxieties. It’s about the frustration of thinking you’re fine, yet these things always seem to find a way back.”<br />\n<b>“Earl Grey Tea”</b>\n“This song is about priorities. In this case, it’s about someone who’s really obsessive about their health, and about how you can be so focused on that, whilst all the important stuff around you is falling apart. But you could replace health with a career or whatever—it’s just about being too focused on one thing and how, by the end of it all, the most important people around you won’t be there. The Earl Grey tea thing specifically came from the fact that my dad started to drink lots of it because he heard it was really good for you.”<br />\n<b>“Walk”</b>\n“I’m not going to leave you on a downer, so this was a bit of a release. It’s a love song, but it’s more platonic than anything. It’s just about anyone in your life who does’t realize how much potential they have or how great they are. The song is happy and encouraging, and it has all my main influences in it. It’s a fun one to end on.”","short":"“A lot of it is quite rough and ready, but that’s what I love about it.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6CR4ozv4yOdaA3f6PPQepA"}},{"id":"1562653222","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1562653222?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/2f/a2/55/2fa255c5-b3fb-4d5a-2a14-e41eca740858/21UMGIM26582.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"aaada2","textColor1":"080807","textColor2":"1e2528","textColor3":"282926","textColor4":"3a4040"},"artistName":"Kings of Convenience","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/peace-or-love/1562653222","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"Peace Or Love","recordLabel":"Virgin Records Ltd","upc":"00602435726854","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"An EMI release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1562653222","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Even after a 12-year absence, Norway’s Kings of Convenience haven’t had a change of heart concerning the perils of love. As the album’s title suggests, peace and love can’t simply coexist when it relates to matters of the heart. But contrary to these fairly pessimistic acoustic cuts, Eirik Glambek Bøe and Erlend Øye's relationship as songwriters feels very much alive. The time and space they gave each other to refine these love-averse confessions—five years, to be exact—paid dividends, whether they’re gently harmonizing over elegant acoustic fingerpicking about the one who got away (“Comb My Hair”), the one who’s about to leave (“Rocky Trail”), or the one who should stay away (“Angel”). “Love is not true/Love is pain,” they sing alongside Canadian singer-songwriter Feist (who guests on two tracks) on the soothing yet bleak lullaby “Love Is a Lonely Thing.” Songs this downcast shouldn't have the right to sound this gorgeous.","short":"The

But the raw vulnerability of Emanuel’s lyrics was answered by his supreme confidence in unconventional production choices, as he used his elastic, highly expressive voice to anchor beatless piano ballads (“Thought It’d Be Easy”), dizzying orchestral swirls (“Magazines”), and trembling Radiohead-esque atmospheres (“Black Woman”).<br />\nBoth of those EPs are reprised on <i>Alt Therapy</i>, supplemented with an additional six tracks that help bring Emanuel’s story to an optimistic conclusion. “After <i>Disillusion</i> and <i>Transformation</i>, I wanted to see some sort of growth and come full circle to a place of finality to the story—which for me, personally, is getting to a place where I know what I want in my life,” Emanuel tells Apple Music. You can sense that newfound contentment in the late-album track “Worldwide,” a heady neo-soul fantasia that conflates the thrill of a budding romance with Emanuel’s excitement to tour his music around the globe. For Emanuel, <i>Alt Therapy</i> doesn’t just represent the light at the end of a very long tunnel, but a gateway to the next phase of his evolution. “Though it’s the end of this project,” he says, “I want this to be the beginning of something special.”","short":"“I wanted to come to a place of finality to the

of power metal, Helloween has been active since 1983, with distinct eras marked by key lineup changes. Their 16th album is unique in that it’s the first to feature a seven-piece band, comprising original bassist Markus Grosskopf and guitarist Michael Weikath and long-serving members Andi Deris (vocals), Sascha Gerstner (guitar), and Dani Löble (drums) alongside returning guitarist/vocalist/founder Kai Hansen and classic-era vocalist Michael Kiske. This triple-vocal “Pumpkins United” formation embarked upon a massively successful world tour in 2017 and decided to start writing together. “We went 15 months all over the planet and got to know each other again,” Deris tells Apple Music. “Mainly Michael Kiske and myself, because Helloween parted with Michael in the mid-’90s and brought me in. But we became friends in two or three weeks, and suddenly you realize, we could have been friends for the last 20 years.” Below, Deris takes us through the tracks on <i>Helloween</i>.<br />\n<b>“Out for the Glory”</b>\n“That’s a Michael Weikath song, and he's talking of all the feelings we had on the tour. We did not dream it would be so successful. I remember us sitting in the rehearsal room and saying, ‘Okay, what's your vision, what's going to happen?’ And everybody was more or less saying that it would be great to have double as many people in the concert hall. At the end of the day, we sometimes had 10 times more people in the concert hall. It was unbelievable.”<br /> \n<b>“Fear of the Fallen”</b>\n“This song has the A/B singing from Michael Kiske and myself. I wrote this one about the old myth that says if fallen angels would try to destroy mankind, other angels would step in to rescue us. Kind of like guardian angels, but not your or my guardian angel—mankind’s guardian angels. It’s very much rooted in Catholic religion, but I have read it in the Koran and the Torah as well. So this idea is something we all have in common.”<br /> \n<b>“Best Time”</b>\n“Sascha wrote these lyrics, and we just made a little video for it. ‘Best Time’ is one of these fun metal rockers. I would say it’s in the vibe of ‘I Want Out’ or ‘Dr. Stein’—it gives you a good mood when you listen to it. It’s about living now—carpe diem, so to say. Don’t look back, and don’t dare to look into the future, because the future most of the time brings something completely different than what you imagined. You have to learn to live for today.”<br /> \n<b>“Mass Pollution”</b>\n“‘Mass Pollution’ is a description of being onstage. We want to sweat together; we want to have a loud, fantastic party. And we know there are lots of people out there who think metal is noise—or worse. In the ’80s, people thought metal was about killing yourself or something—I’m thinking about when Judas Priest got sued for the suicides of two teenage fans—but that’s not right at all. Metal is about having a good time, banging your head and maybe drinking a little too much. So don’t take it too serious—it’s entertainment.”<br /> \n<b>“Angels”</b>\n“This is another Sascha song, mainly sung by Michael. But I think the moral of the story is about avoiding temptation. It’s when angels cause you nightmares. If you give in to the temptation, everything can turn out to be very satanic.”<br /> \n<b>“Rise Without Chains”</b>\n“This song came from a dream I had. I was flying over different parts of the world, with the oceans in between. There was this shimmery thing connecting me to the ground, like a little silver chain that can never rip. I ended up in Sweden and had conversations with people even though I didn’t know their names. But now I connect their faces with certain living people and sometimes I get goosebumps because there could also have been some already deceased people among them.”<br /> \n<b>“Indestructible”</b>\n“Our bass player Markus Grosskopf wrote this one. After the tour, he was the happiest man on the planet. If he would drink too much after a show he would hug and kiss everybody in the band and say, ‘We’re fucking indestructible.’ And suddenly he came up with this song, which is about the band and all the ups and downs we went through—and believe me, there were a lot.”<br /> \n<b>“Robot King”</b>\n“I guess you could say this is Michael Weikath’s dystopia. It’s about a world that could evolve out of artificial intelligence. I went through the lyrics and thought there’s a bit of that Schwarzenegger movie <i>Terminator</i>, but maybe not as brutal. There’s a war between robots and humans, but the robots actually behave like humans. Then the actual humans become slaves and the robots fight each other. Being ruled by robots is not a world I would look forward to.”<br /> \n<b>“Cyanide”</b>\n“This is a song about consumerism and capitalism. My main example is when you go to a hospital nowadays and they tell you that you need surgery. We live in a time where you have to ask, ‘Do I really need surgery, or do they just want to make money?’ This is the world we live in, and I personally think it cannot get any more cruel or dishonest. I use the cyanide reference because cyanide destroys everything but gold. It’s the perfect symbol for our society.”<br /> \n<b>“Down in the Dumps”</b>\n“Another Weikath song. I think of it as like a personal apocalypse: When you’re down, you’re really down, it looks like you have no chance to get up again. Look at the homeless—they’re probably never getting up again. I even know people who voluntarily went down in the dumps because they cannot take it anymore—the pressure of life, the constant sorrow and stress. So this is when there is no more down because you’re already there.”<br /> \n<b>“Orbit”</b>\n“This is the intro to ‘Skyfall.’ As far as I remember, Kai wanted to have something where people fly away a little bit, like an alien far away from Earth, but suddenly he crashes—that’s ‘Skyfall.’”<br /> \n<b>“Skyfall”</b>\n“This is about an alien who happens to be near Earth when something goes wrong with his starship and he has to crash-land here. Now he’s confronted with mankind. You could say it’s a mixture of <i>E.T.</i> and some social stuff. He goes through lots of funny stories, but the song has more of a serious background, I would say.”","short":"“We went 15 months all over the planet and got to know each other again.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1I2USdbvrmhAsEAJz0NuXD"}},{"id":"1565459710","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565459710?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/04/bd/98/04bd9818-e05c-b6c1-566b-cb58c5e9cbdd/196006676971.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"0d0e0d","textColor2":"19191d","textColor3":"3d3e3e","textColor4":"47474a"},"artistName":"Prado","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/prado-monroe-ep/1565459710","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"PRADO MONROE - EP","recordLabel":"tmwrk records","upc":"196006676971","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2020 Prado under exclusive license to tmwrk records","playParams":{"id":"1565459710","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Prado has never lacked for confidence. Back in 2019, when the Vancouver artist was turning heads with the irreverent indie/rap&B hybrids she uploaded to SoundCloud, she would tell journalists about a debut EP that was set to drop—even though, at the time, it didn’t technically exist. “I was talking out of my ass,” she admits to Apple Music. “I wasn’t ready at all.” But now, following two years of artistic and personal evolution, Prado is primed for her close-up. If the title of her inaugural release—<i>Prado Monroe</i>—didn’t make it clear that she’s a star in the making, then its six diamond-cut tracks seal the deal, presenting a genre-bounding, globe-trotting synthesist in the mold of M.I.A., Santigold, and Kali Uchis. <i>Prado Monroe</i> is a fierce, take-no-prisoners takedown of all those ignoramuses getting in the way of her living her best life—be they white male oppressors, noncommittal lovers, or players at the club—but its profane, streetwise sass is balanced by the sort of angelic pop hooks that got her scouted as a songwriter for Skrillex’s OWSLA label. “These tracks took a bit of time,” she says, “but they sound stellar. I feel properly grown into the person I am today.” Here, Prado gives us a track-by-track introduction to <i>Prado Monroe</i>.<br />\n<b>Stephen</b>\n“‘Stephen’ could be [former Conservative Canadian Prime Minister] Stephen Harper or any oppressive male figure—it’s always a f**king Stephen. I’m Aboriginal, so first and foremost, f**k the state and f**k the church. [The lyric] ‘bad b**ches’ is like a warrior cry for me to give strength and call upon the bad b**ches. We ride out!”<br />\n<b>Drip</b>\n“My sister wrote this track in poem form, and we ended up tweaking it together to be a song of manifestation. This is our ‘na na na boo boo’ track where we’re like, ‘Yeah, hoes, we the s**t.’ It’s a song celebrating Black women. The beauty and dreaminess is heightened by the production from Hamb Sun.”<br />\n<b>Likeline</b>\n“I originally wrote this on a BBJuelz beat in 2017 for a group called So Loki out of Vancouver. I ended up keeping it for myself. It’s always such a s**t situation when I fall for someone 30 times more than they do for me, but I wrote this straight from the heartstrings. This song has a crazy pop dynamic and reminds me of a circus or a roller-coaster ride—which just so happens to be most of my relationships.”<br />\n<b>Gucci Store</b>\n“I came up with the synth line out of the first-bar melody—‘I’m not gonna play with n****s anymore’—and added the production as soon as I got home from my receptionist job. It was literally the moment I decided I wanted to take myself seriously in music and give it my all. I quit my job after I got back a bounce of Franco Maravilla’s drums on ‘Gucci Store’!”<br />\n<b>Louis Tee</b>\n“This record is very true to my sound. Bennyman [from Coventry, UK] and I were in the studio together all summer of 2020, and this was my final addition to the project. I wanted something fresh and reflective of where I’m headed with nods to where I’m at in <i>Prado Monroe</i>. Bennyman contributed a grimy edge and deep appreciation for hip-hop to the project that I’m happy to have explored and everyone should see more of soon.”<br />\n<b>Men in Black</b>\n“‘Men in black/All sluts no lie/Can’t get in the club at night.’ Purrr. N****s be having the audacity to act like they have a spot in the club when we’re the reason they got in for free. This is based on real-life events.”","short":"A dynamite debut brimming with streetwise sass and angelic hooks."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1569656997","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569656997?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/cf/e0/f1/cfe0f1bd-5c57-cc7b-bfed-926fad3b4082/8718723176057.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"cca691","textColor1":"190704","textColor2":"451a08","textColor3":"3c2720","textColor4":"603623"},"artistName":"Blawan","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/soft-waahls-ep/1569656997","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"Soft Waahls - EP","recordLabel":"Ternesc","upc":"8718723176057","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Ternesc","playParams":{"id":"1569656997","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569654193","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569654193?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b2/0a/47/b20a47e3-4d01-5f42-dbc1-c1292786836e/5060913701024.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"161f26","textColor1":"dde3f2","textColor2":"a8cad8","textColor3":"b5bcc9","textColor4":"8ba8b4"},"artistName":"Trinity Carbon","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/s-t/1569654193","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dubstep","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"S / T","recordLabel":"ESP Institute","upc":"5060913701024","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 ESP INSTITUTE","playParams":{"id":"1569654193","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1570166417","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570166417?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a6/44/c7/a644c7aa-b1ab-dbdc-782a-feef10b6f1de/4250101430039_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ce9bf8","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"231b2b","textColor3":"291f31","textColor4":"453554"},"artistName":"Jonathan Kaspar","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/connecting-the-dots-dj-mix/1570166417","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-18","name":"Connecting the Dots (DJ Mix)","recordLabel":"Kompakt","upc":"4250101430039","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Kompakt","playParams":{"id":"1570166417","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5H0Qskk7Vz7cZUwjwGnjvB"}},{"id":"1567724864","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567724864?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/0d/69/f2/0d69f291-3eec-542d-ba33-deb0c2dc0280/859747761879_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"111e28","textColor1":"f2edce","textColor2":"d99b75","textColor3":"c5c3ac","textColor4":"b18266"},"artistName":"Smithfield","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-town-ep/1567724864","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-16","name":"New Town - EP","recordLabel":"SmithField","upc":"859747761879","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 SmithField","playParams":{"id":"1567724864","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
