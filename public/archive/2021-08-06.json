In this case, that’s another full-length project co-executive-produced by celebrated Fontana, California-hailing beatsmith Hit-Boy, this time featuring a handful of eyebrow-raising moments like the pairing of hip-hop legends EPMD and Eminem (“EPMD 2”), a revisitation of the static—and eventual reconciliation—he shared with 2Pac (“Death Row East”), and a brand-new rap verse from the illustrious Ms. Lauryn Hill (“Nobody”). Not unlike its predecessor, <i>King’s Disease II</i> features a small handful of guests, something Nas saw fit to acknowledge in rhyme on “Moments”: “My whole career I steered away from features/But I figured it’s perfect timing to embrace the leaders.” While that first statement is a bit of revisionist history, we won’t pretend that sharing airspace with the don hasn’t always been—and isn’t still—something of an honor, one he’s chosen to bestow here upon A Boogie wit da Hoodie, YG, and Hit-Boy. He contextualizes this particularly well toward that same song’s end, reminding us of his impact when he cites “moments you can’t relive/Like your first time bugging from something that Nas said.”","short":"Richer in spirit than ever, with still more stories to tell."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6CM5qhYBvpgYNek5kYwuOJ"}},{"id":"1577329560","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577329560?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/17/2f/0a/172f0a2d-3621-7eaa-af8b-0805f89e0534/192641784224_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"0c1f05","textColor1":"dbdccb","textColor2":"d1ceba","textColor3":"b1b6a3","textColor4":"aaab96"},"artistName":"Tinashe","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/333/1577329560","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"333","recordLabel":"Equity Distribution","upc":"192641784224","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Tinashe Music Inc., under exclusive license to Equity Distribution","playParams":{"id":"1577329560","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Tinashe parted ways with her label in 2019, she welcomed the opportunity to take full control of her creative output. First came <i>Songs for You</i>, an acclaimed album that found the singer basking in her newfound liberation. <i>333</i> follows suit, as she bends and blurs lines to meld pop and R&B with electronic and hip-hop elements. In an interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, she points to the stunning title track, a shape-shifting adventure that morphs from a stripped bed of harmonies into an orchestral dreamscape, as an example of her genre-busting pursuits. “I've always been inspired by James Blake and his use of silence, so I wanted to incorporate that on this project,” she explains. “I think that song is a perfect example of— to me, it doesn't fit like a particular genre at all. That's why I love it, is because it's just a sonic experience.”<br />\nElsewhere, songs like “Let Me Down Slowly” or “Bouncin’, Pt. 2” further highlight her experimental streak, playing with tempos and atmosphere. Such moments stand in contrast to the album’s more constrained moments, but taken together, they all create a collage of both Tinashe’s inspirations and aspirations. “I'm really proud of myself with this project because I just feel like I took all of the things that I learned about what I didn't want to do, about how I didn't want to move, about like what doesn't feel right,” she says. “It's really helped me develop just a much more centered idea of what my art and my project and my purpose is.”","short":"“A centered idea of what my art and my project and my purpose is.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0LHqiYYOsVM9lh9c9w0G1j"}},{"id":"1570285951","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570285951?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3600,"height":3600,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/20/29/df/2029df6a-54cf-b4fd-54a1-2ee654619404/886449242238.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"ab1e2e","textColor1":"fffffd","textColor2":"f5d0d5","textColor3":"eed1d3","textColor4":"e6adb3"},"artistName":"Barbra Streisand","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/release-me-2/1570285951","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"Release Me 2","recordLabel":"Columbia/Legacy","upc":"886449242238","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Columbia Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1570285951","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Barbra Streisand had to rethink plans for an upcoming album after the coronavirus forced the world into lockdown in 2020, she pivoted: Instead of seeking out new sounds, she reacquainted herself with her own vintage recordings. “I actually was collecting songs to make a new studio album,” she tells Apple Music. “But as you know, when you make a record, you have to see people; you have to talk to arrangers and producers and musicians. I can't sing with a mask, obviously. So this was the time to go back into the vault and find things that I haven't released yet.”<br />\n<i>Release Me 2</i>—which follows 2012’s <i>Release Me</i>, her first collection of previously unreleased material—features 10 tracks that surfaced during Streisand’s latest return to the treasure trove of her musical archives. It features duets with fellow icons that were recorded across decades, from Willie Nelson (who joins her on “I’d Want It to Be You”) and Barry Gibb (on “If Only You Were Mine,” a jazzy, playful romp for her and her old friend and “Guilty” collaborator) to Kermit the Frog (with whom she harmonizes on a human/Muppet rendition of “Rainbow Connection”). It also features a number of songs that resonate with her now far more than they did when she initially laid them to tape, like “Be Aware,” a social justice anthem she first recorded in the ’70s. “I wanted to help the world,” she says of the album’s lead-off track, which was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. “I wanted to help our country. I couldn't stand what was going on in the Vietnam War. It seems like yesterday.”<br />\nAnother standout, her take on Carole King’s “You Light Up My Life” off her 1973 album <i>Fantasy</i>, reflects the soul and intention of <i>Release Me 2</i>: Sometimes a beautiful musical moment is worth the wait—even if it means revisiting an old vocal take nearly five decades later and sprucing it up. “I remember recording it in 1973, but it was like a lousy arrangement—it had no magic, so I never released it,” she says before praising the newly revamped instrumentation for the <i>Release Me 2</i> version. “I know I did a good vocal on it, but I let it disappear. So to reexamine it now—it's even a better feel than when I recorded it. I think it had to do with my own psyche at the time. I don't think I was really happy, and now I'm happy. I'm grateful. And I think it shows.”","short":"“It was time to go back into the vault and find things I haven't released.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ele2n7DDMGy8S4CSZCykm"}},{"id":"1578365847","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578365847?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/8a/16/f1/8a16f1d6-1e2b-d063-4904-1c047286252c/886449461974.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"080609","textColor1":"fefefc","textColor2":"e4c6a6","textColor3":"cdcccb","textColor4":"b89f87"},"artistName":"Young Nudy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rich-shooter/1578365847","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-04","name":"Rich Shooter","recordLabel":"PDE Records/Same Plate/RCA Records","upc":"886449461974","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Young Nudy, LLC, under exclusive licence to RCA Records","playParams":{"id":"1578365847","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4jJODKPtcYY2ApUwms1hNY"}},{"id":"1570554138","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570554138?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/0f/c9/40/0fc9400a-604b-b079-de8d-d048d8b8a52b/886447502129.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"3c3a3b","textColor1":"fac396","textColor2":"00d1f3","textColor3":"d4a884","textColor4":"0cb3ce"},"artistName":"Chris Young","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/famous-friends/1570554138","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"Famous Friends","recordLabel":"RCA Records Label Nashville","upc":"886447502129","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment.

Our routines? Our wildest impulses, or our ability to control them? The historical touchpoints remain familiar: T.

And for his <i>an hour with</i> set for Boiler Room and Apple Music, the legendary DJ, a veteran of Chicago and New York’s soulful-house scenes, was intent upon telling a very specific tale. The New York-based DJ recorded his set in the summer of 2021, just as dance clubs around the world were gingerly beginning to reopen after more than a year of COVID-related lockdowns. “The way I delivered it is very old-school: I take on the ethos of the guys that came before me,” Trent tells Apple Music, naming pioneers like Nicky Siano, David Mancuso, Larry Levan, and Frankie Knuckles. “You listen to the themes in the music, or the moods—it’s putting you somewhere.” Given the stresses of the preceding year and a half, the “where” in this case was simple. Trent says that he wanted to make it “like a summer groove”—happy music for stepping out, seeing old friends, and sharing good times together after being cooped up alone for far too long. In order to create that vibe, Trent looks to classics of an unabashedly feel-good bent. The majority of his selections come from the late ’70s and early ’80s—a magical period in which disco was fading from the mainstream and, having headed back underground, morphing into funky new shapes, paving the way for the arrival of house music a few years later. Trent kicks off with the dreamy Rhodes licks and vocal harmonies of Ned Doheny’s “To Prove My Love,” then slips seamlessly into The McCrarys’ weightless “Love on a Summer Night,” setting up the blissful tenor of the hour to come. What follows is nothing less than an expression of pure, moonlit ecstasy. The falsetto vocals of Edgar Winter’s “Above and Beyond” give off a sweet, almost innocent air; Roy Ayers’ “Don’t Stop the Feeling” is infused with the kind of uplift that Ayers delivers better than just about anyone. Prince’s “I Wanna Be Your Lover” and Grace Jones’ “Pull Up to the Bumper” make for a pair of crowd-pleasing picks a little over halfway through, while Trent’s own “Pop Dip and Spin” takes dancers on a detour into the deepest reaches of house. After climaxing with Wood Brass & Steel’s “Funkanova”—which heads might know as the source of Black Science Orchestra’s “New Jersey Deep”—Trent takes us out on a velvety note with a soft, slow-dancing R&B number by Philly jazz-fusion group Pieces of a Dream. Even the title suits the story that Trent has spent the past hour telling: “Warm Weather.”","short":"A blissed-out hour of the deepest funk, disco, and soul."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578211879","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578211879?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1655,"height":1655,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ca/fe/8f/cafe8f8f-176a-7bb3-ecfd-1d3b9f6dfb21/ANTCD-A0000004880.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"d5d3d6","textColor1":"0b0609","textColor2":"241f21","textColor3":"332f32","textColor4":"484345"},"artistName":"BiSH","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/going-to-destruction/1578211879","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-04","name":"GOiNG TO DESTRUCTiON","recordLabel":"avex trax","upc":"4515793972152","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 AVEX ENTERTAINMENT INC.","playParams":{"id":"1578211879","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7iW6gI1UXbrYAfg07WlsIy"}},{"id":"1577868227","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577868227?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/05/7e/e6/057ee6a7-b0f8-a9e1-8670-8d134395e67f/21UMGIM60258.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"e7e6eb","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"181818","textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor4":"424142"},"artistName":"Hope Tala","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-hope-tala-single/1577868227","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"Apple Music Home Session: Hope Tala - Single","recordLabel":"EMI","upc":"00602438564422","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A PMR / EMI / Republic Records release; ℗ 2021 Hope Tala, under exclusive license to Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1577868227","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Hope Tala has been performing mash-up covers of her favorite songs since she was 14, making the West London singer-songwriter especially prepared for this Apple Music Home Session. “It enables me to be creative and have more fun than I would doing a standard cover of a song,” she tells Apple Music. “I’ve been doing these covers of other artists’ songs even before I started writing my own music.” For her Apple Music Home Session, Tala splices together Justin Bieber’s 2020 single “E.T.A.” with “Ice Cold” by Atlanta rapper K CAMP—and also provides a stirring, stripped-back rendition of 2020 single “Cherries,” taken from her dazzling <i>Girl Eats Sun</i> EP). “These chords are so nice,” she says of her cover. “And although the styles of both songs are different, they complement each other well.” And while challenging, Tala feels the pandemic—and its shaking up of her routine—has improved her songwriting. “I’ve reverted to my old process of writing at home,” she says. “Now I feel comfortable doing both again—I think my writing is more personal and introspective now for that reason, and I’ve learned that my will to write will prevail no matter what, which has strengthened my sense of purpose.”","short":"“I’ve learned that my will to write will prevail no matter what.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1577332003","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577332003?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"height":1400,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/dd/73/e8/dd73e887-f8af-f592-cffd-eb24b3fb9d15/816144021593_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"1a1a1a","textColor1":"5acba8","textColor2":"fe9f4b","textColor3":"4da78b","textColor4":"d08441"},"artistName":"T3r Elemento","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/exotic-corridos/1577332003","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"Exotic Corridos","recordLabel":"DEL Records","upc":"816144021593","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 DEL Records, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1577332003","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"From the breakout success of their signature corridos verdes to the creativity and diversity present on 2020’s <i>Our Wave Nuestra Ola</i>, T3r Elemento rightfully earned their place as one of the most popular contemporary acts in música Mexicana.

They deal in heartbreak on “Copas de Champagne” and “Cinderella de Mis Noches,” with ashen lovers looking back mournfully on failed romances.

Exploring relationships, betrayal, and self-assurance on <i>19 & Dangerous</i>, the artist chronicles the transition from adolescence to adulthood. “One day, it just struck me that I’m not scared of failing, I’m not scared of mistakes—I’m ready to work hard to get to where I want to,” she tells Apple Music. “No matter how much I fall, I’m prepared for it. When you know that you’re not scared of mistakes, you become dangerous, because you have nothing to lose, really. I’m 19 and I’m dangerous. I’m ready for everything.”<br />\nThroughout <i>19 & Dangerous</i>, Starr remains bold and unapologetic, whether exhibiting her grandeur in banging earworms or acknowledging her vulnerabilities in heartfelt ballads. She showcases her vocal and emotional range as the project’s mood shifts from sunny to gloomy when her lyrics dictate. Ranging from R&B to pop, soul, and Afropop, the album features production by London, Kel-P Vibes, and Don Jazzy while Ayra and her brother, Dami Aderibigbe (aka Milar), penned most of the songs. Here, she takes us through her coming-of-age story, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Cast (Gen Z Anthem)”</b>\n“In Nigeria, when we say somebody is ‘cast,’ it’s like, ‘Everybody knows her. She’s been around.’ So, I always get a lot of advice: ‘Ayra, don’t go and cast.’ Even with the smallest thing, a woman has to be a hundred times more careful than a guy. She can’t go to this place; she can’t do that because she doesn’t want to cast. The smallest thing can ruin a woman’s reputation. But I’ve come to this industry to break boundaries. So, if I cast, let me cast. In the beginning of the song, I used an Eartha Kitt interview, one of my favorite interviews of all time. She said, ‘Life is not problematic. We make it problematic.’”<br />\n<b>“Fashion Killer”</b>\n“I wrote this song with my brother. We are fashion-obsessed. My brother is an A$AP Rocky fan, I’m a Rihanna fan, so we grew up with a lot of fashion. ‘Fashion Killa’ by A$AP Rocky, we loved that song. So, when London sent us the beat, we wanted something hard, something people would feel themselves, too. I could just see people on the runway to this beat.”<br />\n<b>“Lonely”</b>\n“‘Lonely’ is a sweet love song. The album has different moods: You have the badass, ‘Cast,’ then you have the vulnerability—that’s where ‘Lonely’ comes in. ‘Lonely’ is me telling a guy, ‘If you don’t like me back, remember that I’m only human. Watch the way you talk to me and all that. Let’s vibe and all that.’ So, ‘Lonely’ is like a lost-love heartbreak song.”<br />\n<b>“Snitch” (feat. Fousheé)</b>\n“‘Snitch’ features one of my favorite artists, Fousheé. I love her with all my heart. She’s such an amazing musician. The whole song was a freestyle. She had sent me a DM that she thinks I’m dope. Just imagine me seeing a DM from one of my favorite artists of all time. I was like, ‘I have this song that I really want you on.’ I shot my shot and she was down with it, so that was great.”<br />\n<b>“Toxic”</b>\n“I wrote the song with my brother and posted it in December 2019. Don Jazzy saw it and he was like, ‘Come to the studio and let me see what you can do.’ I recorded it in studio properly in January 2020. The song is about genuine heartbreak, the type of love that breaks you. When you become obsessed with someone but don’t know how obsessed you are until the person leaves you and you can’t function without this person. Growing up, I moved from one place to another, [and] I experienced that, leaving friends behind and all that. I also watched a lot of people’s experiences. I put that pain into the music.”<br />\n<b>“In Between”</b>\n“I wrote ‘In Between’ in my sleep. I was depressed and I remember I was singing it in my head. I was like, ‘Two feet and I’m under/I feel my body.’ It was around 3 am. I got up and I took my phone and I recorded the whole thing from the beginning to the end, without a beat. I was just pouring my emotions out. I went to the studio the next day, and London and I made a beat to the song.”<br />\n<b>“Beggie Beggie” (feat. Ckay)</b>\n“‘Beggie Beggie’ is almost like ‘Lonely.’ It’s almost the same topic. The chorus means, ‘See the way I’m begging you. Do I look like those people on the streets begging for money? You’re making me feel like I’m one of those people because of the way I’m begging you. And I know you are a fine guy and all the girls like you, but I’m also a badass—some other guys like me. So, don’t use me.’ It’s a from-friends-to-lovers type of story. And I remember when I was in the studio recording it. I was like, ‘I want, like, a male POV on this story.’”<br />\n<b>“Karma”</b>\n“My brother and I wrote this song in 2018 when we were still in school. This was one of the first songs we finished writing. Just thinking about it now, back then, we didn’t know that this was going to be our life. We didn’t even know we were going to record it one day. It was just something we did for fun. My brother wrote the first verse, I wrote the second one. We would imagine that he featured me on the song. We would write the whole music video treatments. Then, when Don Jazzy signed me, the first day in the studio, I started to record ‘Karma’ and I was like, this song is such an amazing song. It’s my love story with karma. Karma is such a good lover, because I didn’t ask him to do the revenge—he did it for me.”<br />\n<b>“Bloody Samaritan”</b>\n“I’m used to very slow beats and all that. I’m just singing my heart out. But when it comes to ‘Bloody Samaritan,’ it was a whole different case. I had this beat for six months and I kept begging the producer, ‘London, please don’t give it to anybody. I’m sure I can do this. I’m sure I can work on this beat.’ We know the story of the good Samaritan. Bloody Samaritan is the opposite—people that pretend to be good Samaritans, but they’re hypocrites, people that judge you and criticize you. So, it’s like, you can’t kill my vibe. I’m going to do what I want to do. I’m dangerous. Nobody should come to me with bad energy.”<br />\n<b>“Bridgertn”</b>\n“‘Bridgertn’ was inspired by the series <i>Bridgerton</i>. Seeing a Black queen ruling and all that, we didn’t get to see that growing up. As a teenager now, watching that and how I even put it in a song, I can just imagine how confident I would have been if I’d seen it when I was younger.<br />\n<b>“Amin”</b>\n“‘Amin’ means ‘amen’ in Islam, and also in Yoruba, which is one of the native tongues in Nigeria. I wrote this song last year before I ever knew what it meant. It was just something I wrote and just recorded. But now, listening to the song, it speaks so much to me. It’s just like, ‘Don’t let the fame take you away. Just always pray for what you want.’ It’s also like my future self is speaking to me in the verse. It’s like, ‘Do you really want it all? Say you have it all. Say you have all the things you want. Do you really need it?’ Because I remember when I was younger, wanting and that. Then, growing up, you realize life is not about that. Life is not about these materialistic things. It’s just about love and just who you love.”","short":"“When you know that you’re not scared of mistakes, you become dangerous.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2QJmrSgbdM35R67eoGQo4j"}},{"id":"1571131917","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571131917?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a2/97/74/a2977458-cd19-f0e9-83d0-d346e54be343/20UM1IM16148.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","bgColor":"5c4229","textColor1":"e9c99c","textColor2":"dbb987","textColor3":"cdae85","textColor4":"c2a174"},"artistName":"Baltic Sea Philharmonic & Kristjan Järvi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/richter-exiles/1571131917","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral","Contemporary Era"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-06","name":"Richter: Exiles","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948604517","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 StudioRichterMahr, under exclusive license to Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1571131917","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Max Richter’s <i>Exiles</i> is a moving tribute to people across the world fleeing war and their suffering. Written in response to the humanitarian crisis arising from the Syrian civil war, the album’s 33-minute title work is an atmospheric wash of sound, its stillness underpinned by a gentle, insistent walking beat. Gradually, the music edges toward a joyful climax, before finally coming to rest. All of which benefits from a beautiful full orchestration, performed by the Baltic Sea Philharmonic, who also offer new versions of five Richter classics. Among them is a rich, ominous performance of “The Haunted Ocean,” from his acclaimed soundtrack to <i>Waltz With Bashir</i>, the 2008 animated documentary on the 1982 Lebanon War. There’s also Richter’s most famous piece, “On the Nature of Daylight,” from the composer’s second album, <i>The Blue Notebooks</i>. Here, it shines anew, its lament for the victims of the 2003 Iraq War all the more poignant.","short":"A moving tribute to people across the world fleeing war and their suffering.

Scored for piano, strings, and synths, this beautiful album recreates the intimacy and spiritual experience of losing yourself to the ritual of dance music. “Welcome Home” invites listeners in, its rising melody and repeating piano patterns creating a trancelike atmosphere. From there, Meredi guides us on a transcendent journey through the intense, insistent “Trance”—with its thrumming bass and minimalist rhythms—to the ethereal “A Walk Into the Garden” and “When I Was You,” a deeply personal, meditative track that brings us up close to every musical and ambient detail. An exquisite homage to a city’s musical nightlife.","short":"Joy, hope, and longing infuse this love letter to Berlin’s nightclubs.
