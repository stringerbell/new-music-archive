I felt like all I was doing was paying attention and being rewarded tenfold with things that would not just lift my mood, but legitimately inspire me.” The death of her dog, Pearl, in 2019, slowed down the production of the album, but what Lorde learned from him—the joy of being outside, even if it’s just at your local park—flows through the finished product.<br />\nExpressing all of that in the twisted, spring-tight pop of 2013’s <i>Pure Heroine</i> and its dizzying 2017 follow-up <i>Melodrama</i> was never going to work. So she turned instead to a (somewhat unlikely) palette crafted alongside returning producer Jack Antonoff—shuttling between LA and New Zealand in 2019 and 2020 and finishing it remotely during the pandemic—of ’70s Laurel Canyon and early-2000s pop. “I think, on paper, it doesn’t make any sense,” she says. “But I was like, ‘What’s something that’s captured the experience of being outside or feeling the sun and a certain kind of joy?’”<br />\n<i>Solar Power</i> might well be seen as just that: an album to kick back with on a summer’s day. But there is, as Lorde puts it, “deep and shallow” to this record. There are meditations on celebrity culture (“California”) and the wellness industry (“Mood Ring”), alongside sorrow for the destruction of the natural world. This isn’t, however, a climate change album (“It definitely wasn't a goal of mine to make people care; I can't make that happen for you”). If it’s about anything, she says, it’s about “the passing of time and being OK with that. All my work is sort of about that. All these works are just me trying to ask a series of questions. And if that makes people ask their own questions of their world, then I’ve done a good job.” Read on as Ella Yelich-O’Connor guides us through <i>Solar Power</i>, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“The Path”</b>\n“This was the first one I wrote for the album, and I always knew it would open it. I wanted to bring people right up to speed: This is where I'm at. This is the wave. As I get older, I feel the absurd nature of our modern life more every day, and some of the images in this song really play into that. I’ve also been thinking more about people in my position and the worship that comes towards someone like me. I thought about dismantling that and saying, ‘Let's leave that at the door for this one and make it about something else.’ It was really fun, golden and sassy to be like, ‘It's not going to be me. I'm sorry. Let's redirect.’”<br />\n<b>“Solar Power”</b>\n“This song was featherlight. It’s just a song about being happy in the sunshine, which is kind of a crazy move for me. But It's a bit dark and weird, with lots of cult and commune imagery. I knew that people would kind of be like, ‘What the fuck is she talking about?’ On the surface it’s light, but it’s got a lot to it.”<br />\n<b>“California”</b>\n“California and LA are places I have a huge amount of affection for. I find it really alluring and mystical and kind of dreamy, but it also totally freaks me out. It isn't where I am supposed to be right now, so I've tapped out. I've been listening to a lot of The Mamas & The Papas, so that was a melodic reference. There’s kind of an eeriness to this song, and a lot of people have tried to get at that when capturing LA in movies and in music. I love the line about the kids in the line for ‘the new Supreme.’ It's a classic me thing to say something that is modern, but could sound classic.”<br />\n<b>“Stoned at the Nail Salon”</b>\n“This was one of the first few we wrote. I think of it as coming right at the tail end of <i>Melodrama</i>. My life is very low-key and very domestic. It's like the life of a hippie housewife. It really struck me when the Grammys or VMAs were on and I was trying to get a stream on my computer and I couldn't. It felt so outside of that part of my life. I was starting to have these thoughts like, ‘Am I choosing the right path here by hanging up the phone, so to speak? And just hanging out with my dog and making lunch every day?’ The vocals that are on the song are the ones that we recorded the day we wrote it. So it kind of has this loose, organic quality that came to be a big part of <i>Solar Power</i>.”<br />\n<b>“Fallen Fruit”</b>\n“I was going to LA to write with Jack and I started this on the plane. There’s always a slightly kind of unhinged or unfiltered quality to songs I write on planes, because I’m at altitude or something. I had been very careful before that point about not being preachy or like, ‘Hi, I’m a pop star and this is my climate change album!’ But I just had this moment where I was like, ‘This is the great loss of our lives and this will be what comes to define all of our lives and our world will be unrecognizable for my children.’ I loved trying to make it sound like this flower child’s lament and making it sound very Laurel Canyon, essentially. At the same time, there’s only one 808 on this record—and it’s in the breakdown of this song. It’s me describing an escape to somewhere safe that takes place in the future when our world has become uninhabitable. I liked snapping into a kind of modern thing for that.”<br />\n<b>“Secrets From a Girl (Who's Seen It All)”</b>\n“This is me talking to my younger self trying to impart some of the things that I learned. It was a fun place to write from. To me it’s very Eurythmics meets Robyn. And then we got Robyn to do the incredible spoken part. She’s someone I have learned a huge amount from, through song. She really completed the experience.”<br />\n<b>“The Man With the Axe”</b>\n“I wrote this track almost as a poem. I was very hung over and I think that fragile, vulnerable quality made it in here. It’s funny because it’s kind of melancholy, but I also think of it as very cozy. I’m expressing a huge amount of love and affection for someone. To me, it sounds very private—I sort of don’t even like thinking about people listening to it because it's just for me. [US producer] Malay did the coolest chords. I really didn’t change the poem, apart from maybe taking one line out. That was one of the biggest accomplishments of the album.”<br />\n<b>“Dominoes”</b>\n“<i>Solar Power</i> is about utopias, and wellness is very much a utopia. It was also a big facet of the kind of ’60s, ’70s, New Age enlightenment, Age of Aquarius—seeking this thing that will give us the answers and make us feel whole. I feel like everyone kind of knows someone like this. It really cracked me up to say, ‘It’s strange to see you smoking marijuana, you used to do the most cocaine of anyone I’ve ever met.’ We all know that guy.”<br />\n<b>“Big Star”</b>\n“The title of this song is a nod to Big Star the band, who I absolutely love. When I think about a song like ‘Thirteen’ by Big Star, there’s something so kind of childlike about it, and the song channels a similar thing. But I also loved the image of the people that we love being like celebrities to us. When I see a picture of a loved one, I feel like you get the same chemicals as if I was seeing a celebrity. They’re famous in my heart. But really, this is just a song about my dog. I wrote it when he was a puppy. I was just like, ‘Holy shit, I’ve never loved anything as much in my life.’”<br />\n<b>“Leader of a New Regime”</b>\n“I wanted to have a little reprieve and go in that Crosby, Stills & Nash direction a little bit and be like, ‘Where’s it going to go from here?’ Whether it’s culturally, politically, environmentally, socially, spiritually. I felt that desire for doing something new.”<br />\n<b>“Mood Ring”</b>\n“It’s full satire, inhabiting a person who’s feeling really lost and disconnected in the modern world and is trying to feel well, however she can. I felt like so many people would be able to relate to that. It was funny and gnarly to write. The melodies and the production were a great blend of that early-2000s sound and then that kind of Age of Aquarius energy. They both very much had to be present on this song.”<br />\n<b>“Oceanic Feeling”</b>\n“I knew this would be the last track. I really wanted it to sound like when I get up in the morning at home and go outside and think about what the day’s going to hold. Am I going to go to the beach? Am I going to go fishing? What’s going to happen? I wanted to make something that people from New Zealand would hear and would feel like, ‘Oh, I’m this. That's where I’m from.’ But I was also ruminating on a lot. My little brother had been in a car accident and had had a concussion and was really lost and confused. And I wanted to say to him that it was going to be OK. I was thinking a lot about my parents and this deep connection we have to our land. I was thinking about my children. I really liked the end saying, ‘I’ll know when it’s time to take off my robes and step into the choir.’ It sort of connects that first sentiment of ‘If you're looking for a savior, that’s not me’ and ‘One day, maybe I won’t be doing this. Who knows?’ My music is so singular. I’m pretty much at the center of it. I thought that was a really powerful image to leave with: ‘One day, I too will depart.’”","short":"“This album is about the passing of time and being OK with that.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580625298","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580625298?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/37/0a/9e/370a9ee2-32a8-c572-b3e3-cc0df18bb486/21UMGIM80631.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"7092bf","textColor2":"77a9eb","textColor4":"618ac1","textColor1":"89b2e8","bgColor":"0c101c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Trippie Redd","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trip-at-knight/1580625298","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Trip At Knight","recordLabel":"1400 Entertainment, Inc. / 10K Projects","upc":"00842812154485","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 1400 Entertainment, Inc. / 10K Projects","playParams":{"id":"1580625298","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Sitting down with Zane Lowe just ahead of the release of his fourth studio album <i>Trip at Knight</i>, Canton, Ohio, MC Trippie Redd came clean about what keeps him going. “I sit back and just replay everything like, ‘Damn,’” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I just be thinking and I'll be like, 'Is my path going the way I need it to be or am I behind?' And then I just be pushing myself to overdrive in the studio. I feel like every beat I'm getting all right now, every song I'm doing, it feels like I'm just killing that motherfucker, because I've been in here and I got experience and I updated my sound and elevated my flow.” <br />\n<i>Trip at Knight</i> is a reflection of that confidence and energy. The more melancholy notes that dot a great much of Trippie’s discography are few and far between here, swapped out for Rolling Loud-ready mosh-pit-starters like “MP5” featuring SoFaygo, Lil Uzi Vert collab “Holy Smokes,” or “Demon Time” with Ski Mask the Slump God. There are plenty of solo outings, but the MC taps into a couple of regional vibes with the Chicago-heavy “Rich MF” (featuring Polo G and Lil Durk) and then “Captain Crunch,” which features a Detroit-centric all-star team of Sada Baby, Babyface Ray, and Icewear Vezzo. <br /> \nTrippie Redd diehards will also be happy to have official versions of “Matt Hardy 999” and “Danny Phantom,” collaborations that feature two of his generation’s most beloved dearly departed MCs, Juice WRLD and XXXTENTACION. “The two songs with Juice and Jahseh, they're actually songs that I was planning on putting out, but they got leaked,” Trippie says. “And now, on the album, they're revamped. I did new beats and put more vocals behind certain shit and just like made it sound a little better. But every song is like a moment. They weren't on streaming platforms, so I was just happy that I can get the songs on streaming platforms for my fans.”","short":"The pride of Canton, Ohio, delivers the album fans have been waiting for."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1579610453","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579610453?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c2/00/43/c2004382-02b0-c715-80e2-974252589883/194690589874_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccdcd","textColor2":"d4ad80","textColor4":"ac8c69","textColor1":"fcfefd","bgColor":"0c070b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Aaliyah","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/one-in-a-million/1579610453","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"1996-08-27","name":"One In A Million","recordLabel":"Blackground Records, LLC","upc":"194690589874","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 1996 Blackground Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1579610453","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The absence of much of Aaliyah's music in the digital streaming space had been a point of contention for fans and her estate alike; the allure of the singer who was elusive in life has only grown in death.

More than the sleek construction of her R&B, in perfect lockstep with her hip-hop mien, it's the fluttery tone that remains inescapable. Instead of the fierce, in-your-face vocal acrobatics that defined the time, Aaliyah (in the first of her fruitful collaborations with the then-rising production/songwriting team of Timbaland and Missy Elliott) took a more hushed, vibes-y approach that gave off subtle seduction and effortless cool.

The foundation for <i>Infinite Granite</i>’s more traditional song structures, nearly metal-free shoegaze, and clean vocals was laid—or at least hinted strongly at—on the band’s 2018 album <i>Ordinary Corrupt Human Love</i>. The lyrics also reveal a new level of poetic nuance from frontman George Clarke, as he weaves a narrative marked both by family history and the time the songs were written in. “<i>Infinite Granite</i> was originally centered in my relationship with extended family, but because it was written during various social and environmental anxieties of 2020, more immediate reflections were included,” he tells Apple Music. “Throughout the album there is a double narrative: one that highlights familial issues and one that reflects the current world at large.” Below, he comments on each track that contains vocals.<br />\n<b>“Shellstar”</b>\n“‘Shellstar’ deals with questioning one’s objective feelings toward emotional situations. That idea is coupled with allusions to California fires and Gulf floods.”<br /> \n<b>“In Blur”</b>\n“A song about futility. A nonbeliever, in the wake of having lost a child, reaches out to God for solace knowing nothing’s there.”<br /> \n<b>“Great Mass of Color”</b>\n“‘Great Mass of Color’ describes insomnia during the early-morning blue hour. The lyrics also reflect thoughts on boyhood—what it means to be a man, looking up to other men for a path and the constrictions and conflicts in that experience.”<br /> \n<b>“Lament for Wasps”</b>\n“A love song filled with direct references to insomnia. Blue represented a warm, safe feeling while making this album. It is also the favorite color of my partner, who I use as a character in this song—someone that represents benevolence. I exemplify this benevolence using wasps, as they're an irrational phobia of mine.”<br /> \n<b>“Villain”</b>\n“I thought about my family’s history with alcoholism and abuse, how that past affects future generations and what it means to share blood with cruel and violent people.”<br /> \n<b>“The Gnashing”</b>\n“‘The Gnashing’ looks at new parents, state violence, and an idea of taking care of who takes care of you. Like ‘In Blur,’ this song references losing a child, but focuses on a mother figure instead of a father.”<br /> \n<b>“Other Language”</b>\n“While recording ‘Mombasa,’ we were told a friend of ours had died. We stopped the session and went home. That night he was in my dream. We were in a large passenger van and I was sitting on a bench behind him as he told a story to people around us. I put my arm around the front of his chest, holding him by the shoulder while we laughed. When I woke up, I saw thick smoke from the wildfires had come in through the open windows. I laid until I had to leave for the day’s session, writing most of the lyrics in bed.”<br />\n<b>“Mombasa”</b>\n“My grandfather lived with me for a few years while I helped take care of him. When it became too difficult, my father and I worked to get him into an assisted care hospital. He would speak about how he’d become a burden. He would apologize for having not died. This song is about the kindness and freedom of death, one in which an afterlife reveals itself to be aloneness in cosmic love.”","short":"“Throughout the album there is a double narrative.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1576732424","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576732424?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/4b/5f/7e/4b5f7eae-25d7-5e7e-18f2-80f096a44d89/196292055597.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"47372e","textColor2":"2b211a","textColor4":"554b41","textColor1":"1a0802","bgColor":"fdf2e0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sturgill Simpson","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-ballad-of-dood-juanita/1576732424","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"The Ballad of Dood & Juanita","recordLabel":"High Top Mountain Records","upc":"196292055597","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 High Top Mountain Records marketed and distributed by Thirty Tigers","playParams":{"id":"1576732424","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1581626517","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581626517?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/3e/4e/39/3e4e39b3-6033-df54-be87-083107018335/21UMGIM74936.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"272727","textColor2":"292929","textColor4":"484848","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c4c4c4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tiwa Savage","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/water-garri-ep/1581626517","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Water & Garri - EP","recordLabel":"Universal Music (Pty) Ltd.","upc":"00602438792542","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Universal Music South Africa (Pty) Ltd; Motown Records; Capitol Records, LLC; ℗ 2021 Universal Music (Pty) Ltd South Africa","playParams":{"id":"1581626517","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"As the follow-up to her acclaimed third album, 2020’s <i>Celia</i>, <i>Water & Garri</i> unifies Tiwa Savage’s global influences—gleaned from spending primary years in Lagos, teenage years in London, and attending university in the US—into a collage of R&B, Afrobeats, and pop. Named after the staple cassava dish that’s enjoyed hot or cold, and released in two parts, <i>Water & Garri</i> mashes together sounds and styles with global collaborators and her own heartfelt style. On “Somebody’s Son,” she ruminates on a love to come alongside US singer Brandy, while on “Tales by Moonlight” she links up with Ghanaian singer Amaarae on a flirtatious jaunt pairing elements of soulful ’90s house with African rhythms. This half of the two-part EP also loops in the talents of Nas and Rich King (“Work Fada”) and Tay Iwar (“Special Kinda”).","short":"Part one of a special blend of Tiwa’s most formative sonic influences."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580415357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580415357?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/69/db/fa/69dbfa01-b0cd-21fa-84e7-99a32fb7b0f0/190296497100.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcecc","textColor2":"e8a169","textColor4":"ba8355","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"060b05","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Justin Quiles","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/la-%C3%BAltima-promesa-apple-music-edition/1580415357","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Urbano latino"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-19","name":"La Última Promesa (Apple Music Edition)","recordLabel":"WEA Latina","upc":"190296497100","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Warner Music Latina","playParams":{"id":"1580415357","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1580896128","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580896128?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/42/43/43/424343f4-7ef4-7d12-be44-fb24cc0d0137/859748545218_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2f34","textColor2":"0f0d23","textColor4":"313242","textColor1":"0b0911","bgColor":"bcc5c2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cleo Sol","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mother/1580896128","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","R&B/Soul"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Mother","recordLabel":"Forever Living Originals","upc":"859748545218","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Forever Living Originals","playParams":{"id":"1580896128","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580819018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580819018?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/16/36/b2/1636b2d7-f314-f9c3-7aab-8f2a51ce2969/21UMGIM79128.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7cccb","textColor2":"d0edff","textColor4":"a7bdcc","textColor1":"e4fefd","bgColor":"040203","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Eddie Vedder, Glen Hansard & Cat Power","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/flag-day-original-soundtrack/1580819018","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Flag Day (Original Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602438750207","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Seattle Surf Co.

So the singer-songwriter is well used to creating music in makeshift conditions—which would help explain why this exclusive Apple Music Home Session sounds so accomplished. You can hear a new version of <i>Europiana</i> single “Secret Life” plus a cover of the Bee Gees’ “If I Can’t Have You”—a nod to a band who had a big influence on the glittering, groove-heavy sound of the album. This session arrived just a few weeks after Savoretti was finally able to play some of<i>Europiana</i> for a crowd, at Chichester’s Pub in the Park festival in July 2021. “[Lockdown taught me] how much I love being at home being with my family and at the same time just how much I love performing live music with my band in front of our fans,” he tells Apple Music. “I stepped back on stage for the first time in over a year and it was unreal. [This period] has changed everyone, as we have all had to really understand who we are. This goes for me as a person as much as an artist. Not being able to write, record, and perform in person with other people has been extremely straining, and I know I will be doing more of that moving forward.”","short":"“Everyone has changed—we have all had to really understand who we are.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580402645","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580402645?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/a2/39/7c/a2397c0b-f5b4-b28a-6a24-8dd1e051ca46/4050538713510.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"535442","textColor2":"2f3617","textColor4":"585e46","textColor1":"282a13","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Runaway June","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/backstory-single/1580402645","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"backstory - Single","recordLabel":"Wheelhouse Records","upc":"4050538713510","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 This Is Hit, Inc. d/b/a Wheelhouse Records","playParams":{"id":"1580402645","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578971117","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578971117?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/4d/06/b9/4d06b909-0215-df26-63a2-b7b7372406d3/21UMGIM40389.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"35322f","textColor2":"002111","textColor4":"324d3b","textColor1":"040002","bgColor":"fafae2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Feid","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inter-shibuya-la-mafia/1578971117","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"INTER SHIBUYA - LA MAFIA","recordLabel":"Universal Music Latino","upc":"00602438294589","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Universal Music Latino; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1578971117","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1579432938","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579432938?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/fb/c3/40/fbc34098-7772-41b5-b646-976ad2746169/BLUEPRINT_25.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1400,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"d3d3d3","textColor4":"acabab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0f0c0d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Truncate","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blueprint-25-dj-mix/1579432938","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":24,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Blueprint 25 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381814571","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1579432938","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1577258562","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1577258562?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/45/c1/33/45c13393-2e25-aedd-3781-c90efd4128df/7002.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d1d1","textColor2":"ebd7c8","textColor4":"c3b2a6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"251e1e","hasP3":true},"artistName":"Mickey Factz, Blu & Nottz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-narrative-ep/1577258562","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"The Narrative - EP","recordLabel":"Soulspazm // SCHMTCS","upc":"824833044723","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Soulspazm // SCHMTCS","playParams":{"id":"1577258562","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1566939782","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566939782?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ae/27/7a/ae277a73-4e54-d124-ca31-d4925865c33f/781676458516.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a78666","textColor2":"d5a469","textColor4":"ab8556","textColor1":"d0a57d","bgColor":"060c0a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wolves in the Throne Room","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/primordial-arcana/1566939782","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Primordial Arcana","recordLabel":"Relapse Records","upc":"781676458516","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Relapse Records, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1566939782","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Inspired by and steeped in the wonders of the natural world, Wolves in the Throne Room are American black metal’s foremost spiritual conjurors. The band’s seventh album, <i>Primordial Arcana</i>, is their first self-contained work—recorded, produced, and mixed by drummer Aaron Weaver, guitarist/vocalist Nathan Weaver, and guitarist Kody Keyworth at their own Owl Lodge Studios in the Cascadian Mountains of the Pacific Northwest. It’s also the first WITTR record for which Keyworth was involved from the beginning. “He was there for the very first stirrings of the conceptual framework all the way through the persnickety details of the final polish,” Aaron tells Apple Music. “So, there’s a vitality and a freshness to the record, like a cool breeze flowing down off of a mountaintop, and I attribute part of that to Kody’s presence and third perspective.” Below, Aaron offers a poetic interpretation of each song.<br />\n<b>“Mountain Magick”</b>\n“There is a feeling that I love, standing high in the mountains under the full moon. Lunar light glittering upon the surface of an alpine lake. Beckoning my soul to journey into the very stones. In the heart of the mountain, I begin to feel the presence of elemental spirits. The mountain is alive.”<br /> \n<b>“Spirit of Lightning”</b>\n“I feel summer daylight in the mountains. There is a hunting lodge here. A wild river rushing nearby. Horned God! Bring bounty, vitality, and strength to the people. The spirit of swiftness is called forth. The arrows are blessed. Wild feasting and celebration after the successful hunt. Mead and meat served in epic quantities. Cernunnos is praised!”<br /> \n<b>“Through Eternal Fields”</b>\n“Autumn sunlight through leaves in the forest. Waterfalls at golden hour. Waterfall spirits draw me deeper into the mystery. To the castle in the forest. My beloved is there. Radiant energy fills me with peace. My eternal loneliness has ended.”<br /> \n<b>“Primal Chasm (Gift of Fire)”</b>\n“Tantric union of fire and ice. Cosmic forces intertwine, conjoin. Serpent channels in the body open to healing magic. The source of creativity, of art, of magic is unleashed. Call upon the eagle as your protector...for the spinning green electricity is hot, too hot for some.”<br /> \n<b>“Underworld Aurora”</b>\n“This song is a true invocation of the goddess: Freya, Inanna, Babylon. In the form of a bear. A serpent. Dancing, conjuring in the desert. Goddess! Blow upon the fires in our forge. The sun rises, new life emerges.”<br />\n<b>“Masters of Rain and Storm”</b>\n“A return to the Stone Throne Room, royal seat of the cult of the snake. Here, the mountain magic flows. Storm cloud waterfalls exploding with power. Sun-bleached fallen trees in the glory of the wildflower season. There are spirits deep under the mountain. Their fires and drums rage.”<br /> \n<b>“Eostre”</b>\n“Have we been in this glade before? Time loops back...a stream nearly forgotten. A cloaked figure crouches next to the body of the dying king. When you awake, the world will be born anew.”","short":"“There’s a vitality and a freshness to the record.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1563037226","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1563037226?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/f4/d1/00/f4d10037-92e7-cf41-5e96-7956049db028/5054429148435.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":6000,"textColor3":"39252d","textColor2":"431c03","textColor4":"5a3a26","textColor1":"1a020c","bgColor":"b4b2b0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Shire T","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tomorrows-people/1563037226","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Tomorrow’s People","recordLabel":"Dama Dama","upc":"5054429148435","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Dama Dama","playParams":{"id":"1563037226","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Maribou State’s Chris Davids reshapes dance music’s past into a bright future."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1580794063","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1580794063?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/cf/1e/fd/cf1efd9e-3618-28b3-49ba-f640d800c0d3/886449482368.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3b3e","textColor2":"242429","textColor4":"454445","textColor1":"1b1a1f","bgColor":"c7c3b8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tyler Booth","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/grab-the-reins-ep/1580794063","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Grab the Reins - EP","recordLabel":"Villa 40 LLC","upc":"886449482368","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment.

of major competition successes to his name. Indeed, it was playing <i>“Summer”</i> from Vivaldi’s <i>The Four Seasons</i> that helped him snag Junior First Prize at the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in 2018. His playing here is fresh, tight, and wonderfully alive to the ageless invention of Vivaldi’s concertos. He’s clearly read the poems behind the music and brings great imagination to his playing. The other works, again, show off Li’s style and sparkling technique. The “Tambourin Chinois” and “La ronde des Lutins,” for instance, put him in some very exalted company that he inhabits with ease.","short":"The young violinist’s stylish technique shines on this album of Vivaldi."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1567929700","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1567929700?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ba/dd/44/badd4457-0568-2a9f-4487-b9fc501078b6/8185.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f2d2d","textColor2":"0b2402","textColor4":"384b2e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ece5e1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"quickly, quickly","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-long-and-short-of-it/1567929700","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"The Long and Short of It","recordLabel":"Ghostly International","upc":"804297838304","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Ghostly International","playParams":{"id":"1567929700","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1561050024","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1561050024?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/f9/b4/3b/f9b43bd4-443c-6a5b-c615-e8231609a6f3/634457057487.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1400,"textColor3":"d2d2d2","textColor2":"d9d9d9","textColor4":"b4b4b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bnny","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything/1561050024","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Everything","recordLabel":"Fire Talk","upc":"634457057487","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Fire Talk","playParams":{"id":"1561050024","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1572912334","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572912334?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/57/ea/f4/57eaf46c-59a1-9092-1441-4b0873e389ee/810016763543.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":2000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"e9664f","textColor4":"bb513f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Between the Buried and Me","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/colors-ii/1572912334","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Colors II","recordLabel":"Sumerian Records","upc":"810016763543","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sumerian Records","playParams":{"id":"1572912334","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1576742624","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576742624?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/93/8a/14/938a1401-7fa8-e98d-51c7-0b033db101ff/4250101434105_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"424242","textColor2":"2f2f2f","textColor4":"585858","textColor1":"141414","bgColor":"fafafa","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rebar","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/phenomena-ep/1576742624","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-20","name":"Phenomena -
