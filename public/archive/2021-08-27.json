And I happen to be experiencing something that is very nuanced and very complicated.” Written while they were pregnant with their first child, <i>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</i> finds the pop superstar sifting through dark thoughts and deep fears, offering a picture of maternity that fully acknowledges its emotional and physical realities—what it might mean for one’s body, one’s sense of purpose and self. “The reason that the album has sort of this horror theme is because this experience, in a way, has its horrors,” Halsey says. “I think everyone who has heard me yearn for motherhood for so long would have expected me to write an album that was full of gratitude. Instead, I was like, ‘No, this shit is so scary and so horrifying. My body's changing and I have no control over anything.’ Pregnancy for some women is a dream—and for some people it’s a fucking nightmare. That's the thing that nobody else talks about.”<br />\nTo capture a sound that reflected the album’s natural sense of conflict, Halsey reached out to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. “I wanted cinematic, really unsettling production,” they say. “They wanted to know if I was willing to take the risk—I was.” A clear departure from the psychedelic softness of 2020’s <i>Manic</i>, the album showcases their influence from the start: in the negative space and 10-ton piano notes of “The Tradition,” the smoggy atmospherics of “Bells in Santa Fe,” the howling guitars of “Easier Than Lying,” the feverish synths of “I am not a woman, I’m a god.” Lyrically,  Halsey says, it’s like an emptying of her emotional vault—“expressions of guilt or insecurity, stories of sexual promiscuity or self-destruction”—and a coming to terms with who they have been before becoming responsible for someone else; its fury is a response to an ancient dilemma, as they’ve experienced it.<br />\n“I think being pregnant in the public eye is a really difficult thing, because as a performer, so much of your identity is predicated on being sexually desirable,” they say. “Socially, women have been reduced to two categories: You are the Madonna or the whore. So if you are sexually desirable or a sexual being, you're unfit for motherhood. But as soon as you are motherly or maternal and somebody does want you as the mother of their child, you're unfuckable. Those are your options; those things are not compatible, and they haven’t been for centuries.”<br />\nBut there are feelings of resolution as well. Recorded in conjunction with the shooting of a companion film, <i>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</i> is an album that’s meant to document Halsey’s transformation. And at its conclusion is “Ya’aburnee”—Arabic for “you bury me”—a sparse love song to both their baby and partner. Just the sound of their voice and a muted guitar, it’s one of the most powerful songs Halsey has written to date. “I start this journey with ‘Okay, fine—if I can't have love, then I want power,’” they say. “If I can't have a relationship, I'm going to work. If I can't be loved interpersonally, I'm going to be loved by millions on the internet, or I'm going to crave attention elsewhere. I'm so steadfast with this mentality, and then comes this baby. The irony is that the most power I've ever had is in my agency, being able to choose. You realize, by the end of the record, I chose love.”","short":"“I happen to be experiencing something very nuanced and complicated.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3sq0hRtlT2SYeYajr5Cx22"}},{"id":"1582496839","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582496839?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/a2/07/cc/a207ccaf-d9ea-27cc-35b0-9ca39686728f/21UMGIM70555.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d1729","textColor2":"0d1421","textColor4":"3d222e","textColor1":"0c071b","bgColor":"ff5962","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Lil Tecca","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-love-you-tecca-2/1582496839","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"We Love You Tecca 2","recordLabel":"Galactic / Republic Records","upc":"00602438640713","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Galactic Records; ℗ 2021 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1582496839","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I don’t have to practice how to sound like myself,” Lil Tecca tells Apple Music. “I got my own sound, so it’s easy.” The Long Island-hailing MC’s sound is a byproduct of his personal taste and his actualization as a rapper who can speak both to and for New York City. His <i>We Love You Tecca 2</i>, which comes roughly a year after his debut album, <i>Virgo World</i>, is less a return to his story’s origin than to an energy he recognizes from when he’d first broken out. “<i>We Love You Tecca</i> represents a point of my life where I’m having fun and I’m just free and shit,” Tecca says. “And I feel like that’s exactly where I’m at in life again. So, I just wanted to come back to the theme.”<br />\nNot unlike <i>Virgo World</i>, however, <i>We Love You Tecca 2</i> is rife with stories about his dealings with women, warnings about how protected he is as his circle’s breadwinner, and then also ruminations on how life has changed since rap stardom took hold. It’s enough to overwhelm probably any other 18-year-old, but luckily for Tecca, just doing his job is the answer to his problems. “Sometimes music is the only thing that can make me feel something,” he says. “Even after I blew up, I still didn’t know if I was <i>really</i> a music person. But there’ll be moments where I’m like, nothing has made me feel the way music does. And I just believe how I feel and don’t try to put logic behind it. I just trust my feelings.” Below, Lil Tecca goes a bit deeper into what he was feeling while creating some of the standout tracks from <i>We Love You Tecca 2</i>.<br />\n<b>“MONEY ON ME”</b>\n“When I made this song, I was just in my head. I was just like, ‘Fuck everything. Everything’s getting me mad now.’ I’m in the studio—you could look at me a type of way, I might get a little upset. Everything made me furious.”<br />\n<b>“REPEAT IT” (feat. Gunna)</b>\n“That’s definitely the biggest flex song on the whole project, and that was needed. I needed something I could just talk on, just let the swag flourish. No one got swag like people from New York. No one talks like us, no one walks like us. So, being from here, it just makes it easier to do everything I want to do.”<br />\n<b>“CAUTION”</b>\n“I don’t know why, but when I made this song, I was really low-key uncomfortable in the studio. But I knew I had something, so I was just like, ‘I’m going to finish the song.’ There was a few times while recording that song that I was going to stop, but I just kept going. I’m not a person that relies on motivation or inspiration to work. So, if I feel like I need to record or make music, that’s what I’ma do.”<br />\n<b>“YOU DON’T NEED ME NO MORE”</b>\n“I fuck with this one so hard. Honestly, it’s just a relatable song. Like the beat was really just telling me what to say the whole time. It isn’t anything that personally happened to me.”<br />\n<b>“CHOPPA SHOOT THE LOUDEST” (feat. Trippie Redd)</b>\n“So, me and Trippie recorded this shit in the studio to a whole ’nother beat. And then we was tryna figure out who to put on it. But then Taz Taylor sends me the song on a whole ’nother beat, which is what it is now. And Chief Keef hopped on that version. I can’t lie—he snapped.”<br />\n<b>“BANK TELLER” (feat. Lil Yachty)</b>\n“When me and Yachty recorded this, we did 11 songs that day. I think this was probably the second one or the first one we recorded. We just go in the booth and get a whole song done in, like, 25 minutes. And if we want to take extra time, it is what it is, but we just be snapping.”<br />\n<b>“ABOUT YOU” (feat. NAV)</b>\n“You know when you distance yourself from people, they might take it personal or whatever? But my personal decisions are basically—I’m just saying it’s not directed towards anyone. I just maneuver how I want to.”<br />\n<b>“INVESTIGATION”</b>\n“Besides the fame or whatever, everyone has that point where they’re just waiting on being the best version of themself, like the version of their self they envision in their head. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s almost like a butterfly effect, like just waiting to evolve into exactly who I see myself as. And who I see myself as, I’m still figuring that out. So, that’s why I’m just being me. No expectations about anything.”","short":"“We Love You Tecca represents a point of my life where I’m just free.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7nTvm6EgmFWPLMLxj6aksS"}},{"id":"1581002994","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581002994?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/3a/f3/7b/3af37ba9-ed73-e39b-d8b0-f1fac64457f8/886449403936.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2a2a27","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"30302d","textColor1":"090908","bgColor":"b0b0a4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Wizkid","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/made-in-lagos-deluxe/1581002994","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Made In Lagos (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Starboy/RCA Records","upc":"886449403936","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Starboy Entertainment Ltd., under exclusive license to RCA Records","playParams":{"id":"1581002994","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Having built a profile throughout the 2000s with co-writing credits and feature spots, Wizkid made his name as an Afrobeats legend through his first three LPs, <i>Superstar</i> (2011), <i>Ayo</i> (2014), and <i>Sounds From the Other Side</i> (2017). Yet it’s his fourth studio album, 2020’s <i>Made in Lagos</i>, that’s cemented him as one of Nigeria’s greatest cultural ambassadors and placed him at the vanguard of a global Afrobeats wave. His anchorage to Africa is evident here, with the instrumentation and lingo born of his hometown fusing seamlessly with hints of R&B, pop, and reggae, all culminating in a body of work that both tackles societal challenges and easily transcends borders.

I feel so surely that this is the right one.” Peters doesn’t <i>exactly</i> need to be her record’s main cheerleader. Those already in her corner include Taylor Swift—whose influence shines across all of Peters’ output—and Ed Sheeran, who signed the Brighton-born singer-songwriter to his Gingerbread Man record company in 2021 and who joined her in writing three of the songs here. “We just worked really well together,” says Peters. “This can feel like a very lonely [job], so it’s great having a teammate and having someone rooting for you.”<br />\nFeaturing previously unheard work alongside new tracks written in a Suffolk Airbnb in summer 2020, <i>You Signed Up for This</i> houses the soft indie folk the singer has built her name and loyal following on, but also forays into the ’80s (“John Hughes Movie”), the early 2000s (“Boy”), and bouncy, unabashed pop (“Psycho”). “It was very important to me that this album reflected everything that I do,” adds Peters. “I was very free and I let myself do whatever I chose.” Running through all of it, of course, is the razor-sharp lyricism and wordplay that have made Peters one of 2021’s most feted rising songwriters (and which led Sheeran to declare her the “voice of this generation” to Apple Music in 2021), as Peters deftly dissects young adult life and falling in and out of love, first with a “bolshy, dramatic, immature” attitude and then with reflection. Read on as Peters guides us through her brilliant debut, one song at a time.<br />\n<b>“You Signed Up for This”</b>\n“It's almost like a bullet point list of everything you need to know about me: I'm the narrator. This is my life right now. This is how I sing. This is how I write. But it’s really self-aware—it starts off with an eye-roll. In this track, you have the synth noises, which felt like an ode to that side of the album, as well as a guitar feel to it, then this Coldplay-esque moment which married the two together. You’re falling out of one sound and into the other.”<br />\n<b>“I’m Trying (Not Friends)”</b>\n“There's like 5,000 lyrics in this song. It’s all of my personality and everything that was going on in my life at the time. The first verse and the first chorus were actually written for <i>Trying</i> [the Apple TV+ comedy; Peters wrote the Season 2 soundtrack], but it wasn’t the vibe for it, so I took it back. This song is chaotic and bitchy and passive-aggressive and really flawed.”<br />\n<b>“John Hughes Movie”</b>\n“I wrote this when I was 17, and it just never felt right to come out at the time. We reworked it for the album, then I sent it to [LA producers] Afterhrs, who have done a lot of my stuff and who gave it a shine. This song is so naive and hopeful and stupid and embarrassing and teenage. The first half of this album hits you round the face with melodrama.”<br />\n<b>“Outdoor Pool”</b>\n“I have a voice note on my phone that says, ‘Midnight, outdoor pool.’ We wrote the chorus for this song one night in Suffolk after we wrote ‘Love Him I Don’t.’ It was such a random chorus and it was really hard to understand what it was about. Why are we in an outdoor pool? Then [Taylor Swift’s] <i>folklore</i> came out that night, and, listening to ‘betty,’ it just clicked. It was like, ‘Oh, I cannot be me all the time.’ Then I came back to it a few days later realizing it had to be from the point of view of a 15-year-old. From there it was like, bang. I wanted to make it super British and we were throwing in all the references we could: <i>Skins</i> and HMV and form on Monday, science lockers, the French exchange.”<br />\n<b>“Love Him I Don’t”</b>\n“My favorite on the album. Lyrically and musically, it feels like the combination of a lot of songwriting that I've done and a lot of learning about what I love. There’s a real heaviness but also lightness. It’s a song to sing to yourself when you don’t feel it.”<br />\n<b>“Psycho”</b>\n“Everything about this track is so wild. It was the last session we did for the album. It was like, ‘The album is done, so if we get something, great, but if not, it’s done.’ I was with Ed Sheeran and [prolific British songwriter] Steve Mac and thought, ‘If I’m here with these people who have done massive things, I’m here to win, I’m here to write a big song.’ Ed has previously said ‘Psycho’ would be a really good song title. The track only took about 45 minutes once we were in the session, but afterwards I just felt really scared of it—it’s very different for me. I actually told my manager I'd release it ‘over my dead corpse,’ but I’m so glad I got over it—I love it now. It’s so fun.”<br />\n<b>“Boy”</b>\n“[Producer and songwriter] Joe Rubel, Ed Sheeran, and I had written ‘Hollow,’ then had dinner. Afterwards, I was like, ‘Let’s write another song.’ Everyone had been drinking wine, so it was a fun vibe, and we ended up talking about fuckboys and softboys and I was educating the boys on the differences. They said we should write a song called ‘Fuckboy.’ I was crying with laughter as we wrote it, and I think you can hear that. Really last minute, I said we should take out the ‘fuck’ and just have a gap. They eventually all came around to that idea.”<br />\n<b>“Hollow”</b>\n“This is a special song. I did it with Ed, Joe, and [Snow Patrol’s] Johnny McDaid. It was the first day I’d met Ed and Johnny, and we all knew there was something to this song. It’s so simple but it also has a weird charm—it kind of harks back to what I did when I started, but also what Ed did when he started. It's very sad and has one of my favourite lyrics on the album: ‘You're the one that got away and you got away with a lot.’”<br />\n<b>“Villain”</b>\n“Up until this point, a lot of this album is very rash. It's coming from a place of being hurt and saying, ‘I was right and you were wrong.’ But ‘Villain’ is this moment where there's a cold shower of realism and you understand that you are not always the hero of the story. It felt like it almost leveled the playing field, a moment to hold your hand up and move forward. Sonically, it felt like an older sister to ‘John Hughes Movie.’ I was looking at Bruce Springsteen and Brandon Flowers and The Killers for this song.”<br />\n<b>“Brooklyn”</b>\n“This is about me and my twin sister Ellen going to New York when we were 19. We went to Gatwick, we had terrible tickets, we flew at 2 am, we had noodles for breakfast. This song literally just tells the story of that trip. I did it with [songwriter and producer] Frances [aka Sophie Cooke] and it came together quite naturally. It was funny—a lot of people wanted to produce this, but in the end Frances finished it, and it’s not dissimilar to the demo. Two women wrote and produced the song, and I think that's really amazing. ”<br />\n<b>“Elvis Song”</b>\n“One of the oldest tracks on the album. This is like stadium euphoria to me but with more realism to it, I guess. ‘I've got no right to miss you’ is something I’ve always played around with, and it's a feeling I've definitely felt before.”<br />\n<b>“Talking to Strangers”</b>\n“This is a love song and it’s really sweet. I did this with [songwriters] Brad Ellis and Jez Ashurst, and we wrote it really late at night. The vocals you hear in it are the vocals I did then. In fact, all of this song is basically the demo, apart from some harmonies I added from my bedroom studio during lockdown. The demo was very much how it needed to stay.”<br />\n<b>“Volcano”</b>\n“This is a different palette, and it’s almost the hardest to talk about because there’s so much within it. It’s really a song about people who you feel like never see the consequences of their actions. This song is just repetition all the time, because that’s how it feels, I think, when you’re in that moment, and someone has hurt you and gotten away with it. No one has called them out, so they’re able to keep living their life, and you’re just stuck in this song. It was definitely fueled by #MeToo. There’s a lot of real, simmering female resentment and the silence you take upon yourself. I was referencing Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves. It felt like the right tone for that sort of thing—no one does ‘woman scorned’ better than country musicians.”<br />\n<b>“Tough Act”</b>\n“To me, this song feels sad but also has a real air of growth in it. It’s hopeful and it’s respectful and comes from a really mature place of ‘This is nobody’s fault.’ By the end of it, you're not sure if it's meant to be a sad song or if it's meant to be a song of happiness. I listened to it recently and was struck by the second verse, when I say, ‘I got busy and you forgot how to miss me when I'm not much of who you grew up with.’ I think that speaks to so many people and so many relationships, romantic or platonic or family or anything. It's the realization that you're not who you were and that's fine, but that’s something that everyone has to accept at some point. Originally it was a piano ballad with no harmonies and it was very stripped. It ended up this really beautiful orchestral arrangement. The lyrics felt like a great way to finish this album.”","short":"“I was very free and I let myself do whatever I chose.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1581008251","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581008251?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/76/fd/67/76fd6799-83fd-01ca-cdab-55da162d35a8/21UMGIM80689.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcccb","textColor2":"f6752f","textColor4":"c65f27","textColor1":"fefdfb","bgColor":"090909","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Belly","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/see-you-next-wednesday/1581008251","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"See You Next Wednesday","recordLabel":"XO  Roc Nation Records, LLC","upc":"00810061168126","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 XO | Roc Nation Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1581008251","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"If you’d been wondering where Canadian MC Belly was since he dropped one of the most impactful projects of his career, 2018’s <i>IMMIGRANT</i>, the answer was: not in the greatest of headspaces. “I took like a heavy break, in terms of making my own music,” he tells Apple Music. “And it wasn't voluntary, at first. I was in a bad place, dealing with different mental struggles.” He’ll politely decline to detail the specific events that knocked him off his square, but as he began making music again, roughly a year and a half ahead of what would become his third proper album <i>See You Next Wednesday</i>, he saw a parallel in the backstory of one of America’s beloved movie directors. <br />\n“<i>See You Next Wednesday</i> is paying homage to John Landis. That phrase was kind of like an Easter egg that he would drop in all of his movies. Even in ‘Thriller,’ when MJ's walking out of the theater, you hear somebody whisper, 'See you next Wednesday.' The reason why is because I believe it was like the first script that he wrote—and he just never made the movie. So there was parts of this process where I felt like this might be the album that never sees the light of day. Just based on me trying to find myself again.” Luckily for Belly fans, the MC bounced back in grand fashion, delivering a 15-song project that not only features The Weeknd, Young Thug, Moneybagg Yo, and Nas (to name a few), but also some of Belly’s most honest and impassioned rapping. Below, the MC gives us insight into each song on the album, explaining track by track how <i>See You Next Wednesday</i> came to be.<br />\n<b>“Snakes & Ladders”</b>\n“‘Snakes & Ladders’ was a good way for me to set the tone and really let people know that I'm back. I think not only to remind people, but also to remind myself, when the album kicks off, that this is what I do.”<br />\n<b>“IYKYK”</b>\n“I think The ANMLS and DannyBoyStyles did a great job of just making this sound like a movie. I love when it almost sounds like there's a soundtrack behind me, as opposed to just a beat, that's like looping over and over. This was one of the songs that helped me come back around, too. Because it was one of the first times that I could really write deeply about things that were affecting me. I was writing this from a place of hurt. It was just me trying to be as honest as I could.”<br />\n<b>“Better Believe” (feat. The Weeknd and Young Thug)</b>\n“Abel [Tesfaye] played me a version and we just went from there. I had DannyBoy and The ANMLS also put their touch on it. But Zaytoven, to me, is like such a musical dude. So it was like a team effort. Thug came right at the very end. I just felt like he matched the vibe so well.”<br />\n<b>“Zero Love” (feat. Moneybagg Yo)</b>\n“I think when people hear the word ‘love,’ like they automatically think I'm talking relationships and all that. Love is a complex thing. You know, we love so many different people, on so many different levels. So at that point, I had just zero love for all the fake fuck shit—everything that was affecting me negatively, that's when I was learning to push it out of my brain, and to really have no attention for it. And that's where 'Zero Love' comes from—me not giving a fuck, really. I was trying to put a second verse on it, but every time my hook would end, I would be like, 'Man, I hear Moneybagg Yo on this shit.' I just kept hearing his voice.”<br />\n<b>“Moment of Silence”</b>\n“I was in Miami for ‘Moment of Silence.’ That was like one of the first trips I took since the hiatus. I linked up with Infamous and Ben Billions and I remember just hearing that beat and just wanting to talk my shit on it. I was just starting to find the confidence again. By the time I finished rapping on it, I was like, ‘We can't do no more on this. We've got to give these rappers a moment of silence.’”<br />\n<b>“Flowers”</b>\n“I say this all the time: If you're underrated, you've got to put blame on yourself to a certain degree. There must have been times when you could have did more. And I do feel that way. I do feel like I could have done more, certain times. And I could have been more. But at the same time, I feel like you've got to know when you're not getting your due. My reaction will always be to work harder. Nobody owes me shit—but I deserve more. And that's where I'm at with it.”<br />\n<b>“Razor” (feat. Gunna & PnB Rock)</b>\n“I’ve known PnB Rock for a long time. And we always linked up and made vibes together. This is just the first one we ended up putting on something. He's somebody that's super talented and I've always like really fucked with his sound. This is the first time me and Gunna have done something, but again, that's somebody I feel is extended family. When I was in Atlanta running around, he pulled up and always showed love.”<br /> \n<b>“Die for It” (feat. Nas)</b>\n“I went through certain stuff that affected my ideology. A lot of it stemmed from incidents that I can't really talk about due to legal stuff. You know when you grow up and you spend most of your adult life even believing something? And then there's events that can shake the way you think or believe in something? Coming back from that for me was pretty tough. Now it's not something that even affects me negatively anymore. I think about it, and I'm just happy that I made it through something as extensive as I did.”<br />\n<b>“Requiem” (feat. NAV)</b>\n“‘Requiem’ is complex. I wanted it to be more of a feeling, like a mood. A lot of the lyrics in it are obviously self-explanatory. Especially in the verse, in terms of like relationships—situations, or things that I've waited for and never got. I think the hook is more of like a mood. In the verses, I get into that feeling of almost like FOMO: the fear of missing out. I think that's what the verse kind of represents. And of course my brother NAV went in on it. I think his verse is like 24 bars.”<br />\n<b>“Two Tone” (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)</b>\n“That was like a one-take freestyle. And at first it was hard for me to take the song serious. I was like, 'This is just some cool shit we could just listen to.' And the homies were like, 'Bro, you're bugging. You've got to fucking put this on the album. We've got to put Uzi on this.' And then I remember playing it for Abel and Abel was like, 'Oh nah, this shit is out of here. You need to definitely work on this.'”<br /> \n<b>“Wu-Tang”</b>\n“When I say ‘Wu-Tang, C.R.E.A.M., wrist Dairy Queen,’ the shit's blinging, my shit's colorful. My shit is flicking. I love to pay homage to Wu-Tang, too. Because <i>36 Chambers</i> is one of the albums that made me look at themed albums differently. It made me like appreciate and love that somebody can make something so cohesive, and make something that sounded like it had a heartbeat, all the way throughout. So it felt good paying homage to one of the best rap groups, you know, if not the best rap group, of all time.”<br />\n<b>“Sucker”</b>\n“I use the word ‘bitch’ a lot. I think ‘bitch,’ to me, is a word that goes both ways. Like when I say ‘bitch,’ it could just as well mean a guy. Now when I'm saying 'sucker,' I'm talking about one specific type of woman: the kind that catches, let's say, the more docile type of man. And she's able to take advantage of such a person. And the thing is, who do you blame at the end of the day? Do you blame the guy that allowed it to happen? Or do you blame the person that did it? It could go both ways.”<br />\n<b>“Scary Sight” (feat. Big Sean)</b>\n“Big Sean is one of the most talented people I think I've seen in a session, in terms of how he approaches records. His shit just sounds like he sat for hours writing it, dope punchlines and dope bars, but he's really coming off the top of his head. So I think that's where that free-form feeling of that song came from. And I just picked up where he left off.”<br />\n<b>“Money on the Table” (feat. Benny the Butcher)</b>\n“Shout-out to Benny the Butcher. You can't be a rapper—that like enjoys the sport of rap—and not be inspired by what Benny's doing. If you actually love this shit, you've got to feel something when you hear Benny. Just to see the progression of him rapping his ass off and getting the due that he deserves, all of that to me is inspirational, motivational.”<br />\n<b>“Can You Feel It”</b>\n“I was in the studio with The ANMLS and my boy Faris was playing just songs off of YouTube. He came across this band Bedstudy and I was like, ‘Yo, we've gotta sample this. This is special right here.’ We created the beat out of that. And it took me to a place. It made me want to be a little introspective. It made me want to bare my bones on the record. So that's really what I did.”","short":"The Canadian MC talks us through his third studio album."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7jJsNB4u538DpyZckBEKsB"}},{"id":"1581645737","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581645737?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2f/58/5e/2f585e56-5239-3b0d-e39d-76e28274fccc/21UMGIM80696.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"212021","textColor2":"1d162e","textColor4":"332d41","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"8d898a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jaden","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ctv3-day-trippers-edition/1581645737","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"CTV3: Day Tripper's Edition","recordLabel":"MSFTSMusic / Roc Nation Records, LLC","upc":"00810061168140","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 MSFTSMusic / Roc Nation Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1581645737","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Following 2020’s <i>CTV3: Cool Tape Vol. 3</i>, Jaden offers up the Day Tripper’s Edition, which functions as a continuation of its predecessor but is still a unique album in its own right.

And then I think we have to evolve.” Read more about how some of the key tracks on OneRepublic’s latest release came to be below.<br />\n<b>Take Care of You</b>\n“I love the melody. I love the lyric so much. I just liked the idea of ‘I take care of you, you take care of me.’ And especially during the pandemic—I wrote this in the peak of the pandemic last summer. And it just felt like a very, I don’t know, topical song.”<br />\n<b>Forgot About You</b>\n“This is a rare instance where I was really irritated with somebody, another person in the music industry, who was threatening to sue me over the absolute most inane, outrageously ridiculous claim on Earth. I said, ‘Man, I forgot he existed until this email.’ I’ve never actually written a kiss-off record, just like literally, ‘Bye.’ And that’s what it is. It is what it sounds like.”<br />\n<b>Better Days</b>\n“This was written at the beginning of the pandemic. We had the chorus almost finished, I went to Europe and when I got back the whole world changed overnight. I was just so distraught that I was like, ‘Guys, let’s write this, finish this song now, record it, and post it on Instagram,’ which I never do. Then the CEO of Fiat Chrysler and a ton of diffrent car companies hits me up, saying they want to use ‘Better Days’ for their entire spring campaign. Then NBC calls, then NFL, ESPN. The next few months it was just the theme that all these companies were using for COVID, which is weird. This whole album was written for the most part in a pandemic, but that’s the only song that actually addresses it and you can tell that we were in the middle of it.”<br />\n<b>Wild Life</b>\n“Very, very OneRepublic, like an old-school OneRepublic song. I got hit by a bunch of songwriters that were OneRepublic fans growing up, and when ‘Wild Life’ came out they’re like, ‘Man, this is my favorite type of song that you guys do better than anybody,’ because it’s very much intrinsic to our sound, not a radio single, not a single, but just a beautiful record that I love.”<br />\n<b>Ships + Tides</b>\n“This was the oldest song that was written on tour while we were touring on [2013’s] <i>Native</i>, believe it or not. We started that song in Switzerland. I remember where we were. And we tinkered around with it for years, could never figure out how to finish it, and then we finally did. We wanted this beautiful serenity and orchestral movement. And in the past we’ve done those types of things on albums a lot. We wanted to go out on something extremely musical and kind of cinematic.”","short":"“It’s a summary of all four previous albums.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SrskI3mHcu5MzKeZNv2f6"}},{"id":"1582534154","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582534154?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/80/bc/6b/80bc6b42-1eaf-e54b-3cf6-250eb280647a/194690589584_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"d1d1d1","textColor4":"a7a7a7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jackboy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jackboy-2/1582534154","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Jackboy 2","recordLabel":"1804 Records / EMPIRE","upc":"194690589584","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 1804 Records / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1582534154","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6tzSsjGPrdaETeQ7ViSYTi"}},{"id":"1581892464","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581892464?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/5e/d8/ad/5ed8ad7e-e51c-ce3e-d675-ea9903be3aa7/886449493029.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"282728","textColor2":"191b13","textColor4":"303631","textColor1":"0f0808","bgColor":"8ea5ab","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nicky Jam","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/infinity/1581892464","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Infinity","recordLabel":"Sony Music Latin","upc":"886449493029","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC/ La Industria Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1581892464","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2nRRfeEazBN10vZdPFmQME"}},{"id":"1571575880","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571575880?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/03/01/6a/03016ab8-f732-ca90-b8c6-9d0bfc9b95c6/18094.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f4444","textColor2":"1e1c27","textColor4":"45434b","textColor1":"161e1e","bgColor":"e0dfdd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Big Red Machine","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-long-do-you-think-its-gonna-last/1571575880","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last?","recordLabel":"Jagjaguwar","upc":"656605241562","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Jagjaguwar / 37d03d","playParams":{"id":"1571575880","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"As a producer and multi-instrumentalist, Aaron Dessner has worked alongside a number of magnetic vocalists: Matt Berninger, Sharon Van Etten, Justin Vernon, and, most famously, Taylor Swift, on 2020’s <i>folklore</i> and <i>evermore</i>. But on his second LP as one-half of Big Red Machine (a sprawling collaboration with Vernon that began in the late ’00s with a song that became their namesake), he’s finally taken the mic himself. “I’m not naturally somebody who seeks the spotlight or wants to be lead singer,” he tells Apple Music. “I like the process of making and engineering and producing stuff, getting lost in the weeds. I’ve almost been a ventriloquist or something, trying to create emotional worlds for other people to inhabit. But I think I did realize that there’s another step, artistically, that I needed to take.”<br />\nThe decision to step into the foreground began, in part, with a nudge from both Swift and Vernon—after each heard a song Dessner had recently written about his twin brother (and fellow National guitarist), Bryce. “It just started happening,” he says of the transition. “I was lucky to be getting a strong push from these crazy-talented singers, who were all saying, ‘Don’t hide your voice.’” And though <i>How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last</i> offers a stage to more lead vocalists than ever before (Anaïs Mitchell and Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold among them), it’s an album that feels like Dessner’s—more personal, less opaque. Where Big Red Machine’s debut LP was, as Dessner says, a “wild” and “fairly cryptic” set of mostly electronic smudges and smears and sketches (all fronted by Vernon), its follow-up is traditional by comparison, its more song-oriented approach inspired by Dessner’s time playing with the Grateful Dead’s Bob Weir. “I wanted to be more intentional about it, but to create this feeling where there’s room for improvisation and the paint is always wet somehow,” he says. “I tried to make stuff that’s open and had this warmth, and always had this experimentation in it, too. I think we were successful on that.” Read on as Dessner takes us inside a number of the album’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Latter Days” (feat. Anaïs Mitchell)</b>\n“I’d recorded the instrumental and when Justin heard it, the very first thing that he did is whistle. There was a microphone that picked him up. And we just kept it as a sort of improvised vocal melody that I wrote words to. I’ve always liked that about records, where there’s things that you don’t clean up, even though it’s slightly out of tune. If you listen closely, you’ll hear crickets and frogs on certain songs because the doors were open. That’s kind of how I think about Justin whistling.”<br />\n<b>“Phoenix” (feat. Fleet Foxes & Anaïs Mitchell)</b>\n“I feel like Robin’s voice is timeless. I had written ‘Phoenix’ and Justin wrote the chorus melodies, and I just sent it to Robin as kind of a work in progress, imagining this multitude of voices could be a dialogue between different singers. He was really into it and moved and inspired. He wrote the song essentially as a dialogue between him and Justin, recalling the only conversation they ever had in person, which was backstage at a venue in Phoenix, Arizona, 10 years ago at a loading bay dock. That’s literally what it’s about, and when Anaïs Mitchell heard it, she rewrote Justin’s chorus lyrics, almost like a response to Robin. It’s very much the process of this record, the exchange of ideas.”<br />\n<b>“Birch” (feat. Taylor Swift)</b>\n“It’s actually a beat that The National’s drummer, Bryan Devendorf, made in his basement. He will make these kind of loopy, trippy beats in his basement on a drum machine, and then send them to me as a Voice Memo. I wrote music to it and developed it and played all the parts to it and made it. It was during a time where I wasn’t doing that well, actually—maybe in fall 2019. I sent it to Justin, and good friends sometimes know when you’re going through something and maybe he felt that. He wrote the words and melody to it and as we recorded and developed it, we played it for Taylor at some point, towards the end of <i>folklore</i>. She really loved the song, and heard harmonies, and then kind of helped to lift further into some heavenly place.”<br />\n<b>“Renegade” (feat. Taylor Swift)</b>\n“We wrote ‘Renegade’ after we finished <i>evermore</i>— I was really specifically writing music for Big Red Machine, and I think Taylor was, too. When she sent me ‘Renegade,’ it was literally another bolt of electricity. Thematically, it’s this idea of the way fear and anxiety and emotional baggage get in the way of loving, or being loved. I can just really relate to it in a very deep way. It did feel very connected to other songs and other characters in the record. But also, just the clarity of her songwriting and her sense of melody and rhythm and her diction: It’s just astonishing. She’s able to make a Voice Memo sound almost like it’s a finished record.”<br />\n<b>“The Ghost of Cincinnati”</b>\n“It’s about the feeling of someone that’s empty, overextended to the point where they feel empty and hollow, like a ghost. They’re still alive, but they kind of feel like they’re running on fumes and searching for a remedy through fleeting memories and fleeting images of the past. It’s a sense of catharsis just by giving voice to a feeling that might be bleak. It kind of helps you get over it.”<br />\n<b>“Easy to Sabotage” (feat. Naeem)</b>\n“It’s literally two bootlegs stitched together, two live recordings—one from Brooklyn at Pioneer Works and one from LA at the Hollywood Palladium. It was purely improvised, and then we took it and made a song out of it. It does relate more to the spontaneous, structured improvisation of the first Big Red Machine record, but I think it’s also a link between the past and the future of whatever this is.”<br />\n<b>“Hutch” (feat. Sharon Van Etten, Lisa Hannigan & Shara Nova)</b>\n“I wrote a sketch inspired by my friend Scott Hutchison from Frightened Rabbit, who passed away. It’s this dark, kind of spiritual, kind of gothic piano piece. I’d produced the last Frightened Rabbit record, and it was just very shocking. He’s not the first friend I’ve lost that way, but it’s just really hard, obviously, and sad. You wonder how did it get so bad, or did I check in enough, or did I miss signs, or did I not take it seriously enough? That was the sentiment, but we wanted it to feel cathartic and have this heavenly lift to it. Lisa Hannigan and Sharon Van Etten and Shara Nova sing so beautifully on it. They added their parts and really lifted it like this angelic choir almost.”<br />\n<b>“Brycie”</b>\n“I remember I wrote the music backstage in Washington, D.C. It was clear to me, in my head somehow, that it was about my brother. I think even the way that I was playing the guitar was how he and I play the guitar together, kind of—these interlocking, twin, mirrored guitar parts. That’s actually me and him playing together on the song, too. There are so many times in my life where he helped me get through a difficult time, where he refused to let me fall, and that’s what it’s about. It’s a love letter to him, thanking him for keeping me above the ground and hoping he’ll be there when we’re old. And when I wrote it, it was the first clue of what this record would become.

But unlike her acclaimed 2020 EP, <i>Flowers</i>, an intentional curation, this collection was more of a happy accident. “The reason why the EP doesn’t have its own individual name is because it wasn’t necessarily supposed to be an EP,” the London producer/DJ tells Apple Music. “It’s not like a body of work where each song is related to each other.” If anything, its purpose is to set the scene for what’s to come: TSHA’s debut LP. “It’s more related to the album and the future, because that’s what I was working towards when I was writing,” she says. Every track here sits within its own sonic universe, each with a different origin story. The title track is straight-up electronic pop, while “Power” drips with twinkling club nostalgia, and “I Know” is a fraught, melodic tale. Here, TSHA takes us through each track.<br />\n<b>“OnlyL” (feat. Nimmo)</b>\n“I actually had a different track that I wanted vocals for, and I contacted Nimmo because I really liked their sound. They had a ’80s/’90s feel to them—a bit like Eurythmics. They wrote vocals over this other track, but the voice and beat just didn’t go well together. I loved Nimmo’s vocals, so I rewrote a new track around them and chopped it up. The chopped vocals are what you hear in the chorus. I make beats ready so that I can always access stuff that I like quickly. So, I dragged a beat that I really wanted to use underneath and that just brought everything to life. Then I just built around Nimmo’s vocals and added a modular pattern that comes in as the second part of the drop. An organ sample that’s been chopped acts as the base.”<br />\n<b>“Power”</b>\n“My music is good for certain times, but I didn’t really have club tracks. That’s where ‘Power’ was born. I’m just super excited to DJ now that the pandemic is easing and play it in a set. I sampled a 1982 Brit-funk song by [early ’80s band] Direct Drive in this track, and I don’t really know what inspired me to do that. I just decided to try out sampling because I’ve never really sampled like that before.”<br />\n<b>“I Know”</b>\n“In this song, the phrase ‘I know’ could mean a lot of things. It could be about clarity, or it could reflect the hurt of realizing someone doesn’t really love you the way you thought they did. I wrote this when writing my 2019 EP, <i>Moonlight</i>. At the time of writing it, I sent it to people alongside lots of other tracks, and no one said anything about it, so I just assumed no one liked it. But it was my favorite track! Then, I sent it again when we were looking for a third track for this EP. And everyone was like, ‘Oh, this is great. This is brilliant.’ I was like, ‘You do realize I sent this to you, like, a year ago?’”","short":"“This EP is related to the future.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578018702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578018702?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/35/2a/20/352a20e1-21d7-9442-0110-eb7087a00bc6/886449455560.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"4c4032","textColor2":"30261c","textColor4":"514538","textColor1":"2b1f15","bgColor":"d4c2aa","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nelly","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heartland/1578018702","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Heartland","recordLabel":"Records/Columbia","upc":"886449455560","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Records Label, LLC / Columbia","playParams":{"id":"1578018702","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1a7BlXLCqjTxQh6X8L9JBL"}},{"id":"1582058318","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582058318?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/db/e3/54/dbe3547a-17b8-143f-c402-47dd4736f5c2/810043687300.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1425,"textColor3":"d0b9a0","textColor2":"eb9d80","textColor4":"c6816b","textColor1":"f7e3c2","bgColor":"341319","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Maria Becerra","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/animal/1582058318","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-26","name":"Animal","recordLabel":"300 Entertainment","upc":"810043687300","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 300 Entertainment / Maria Becerra","playParams":{"id":"1582058318","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Argentine singer Maria Becerra truly broke out in 2021, logging memorable singles and notable features with the likes of J Balvin, Mariah Angeliq, and TINI. As such, it only seems right that this, her most substantive project to date, keeps that same energy. An expansion of an EP released earlier in the year, <i>Animal</i> also widens her sonic palette while remaining a worthy introduction to a rising star. She balances the forward-thinking reggaetón swagger of “Hipnotiza’” and the heartbroken “Mi Debilidad” with lush pop and R&B arrangements like “Cerquita De Ti” and with subtle salsa flourishes on “Acaramelao.” The majority of the record finds Becerra in a strong solo mode, but her curatorial, sparing choice of features uplifts fellow homegrown talents Cazzu and Tiago PZK alongside Danny Ocean and Becky G., the latter of whom lends her star power to the thumping duet “Wow Wow.”","short":"The ascendant Argentine singer reveals more of her animal ambition."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2OXeXtTp8KR8TO21LbBIWP"}},{"id":"1568545711","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1568545711?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/dc/4f/22/dc4f22f3-8fa3-bc42-4ced-d100367c9ab4/5056167164074_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3600,"textColor3":"c2a997","textColor2":"e09c84","textColor4":"bd7d6b","textColor1":"e7d3bc","bgColor":"310004","hasP3":false},"artistName":"CHVRCHES","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/screen-violence/1568545711","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Screen Violence","recordLabel":"Glassnote Entertainment Group LLC","upc":"5056167164074","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 CHVRCHES Under Exclusive Licence To Glassnote Entertainment Group LLC, distributed by AWAL","playParams":{"id":"1568545711","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In late 2019, CHVRCHES frontwoman Lauren Mayberry found an old document of names the Glasgow three-piece had once considered for their band. “I saw ‘Screen Violence’ and thought there could be something in it,” she tells Apple Music. “It had multiple meanings to us at that time.” It wasn’t just that it encapsulated a horror movie aesthetic the trio have always been drawn to. It was also that Mayberry had, at that point, been experiencing her own version of “screen violence.” While touring the band’s 2018 album <i>Love Is Dead</i>, she was facing near-constant death threats from strangers online, leading her to weigh up the pros and cons of even being in the band. “Everyone’s like, ‘Don’t listen to the haters.’ But there’s a difference between not listening and being worried that someone’s going to murder you,” she says. “Coming up with that title and the concept felt quite cathartic and reassuring.”<br />\nBut when the global pandemic took hold, its title took on an even greater resonance as everything shifted onto screens—including the creation of the record, mostly worked on in 2020 over video sessions between LA (where Mayberry, along with bandmate and multi-instrumentalist Martin Doherty, are based) and Glasgow (home to CHVRCHES’ third member, Iain Cook). And so, alongside fear, confusion, and misogyny, there are also explorations of isolation and homesickness, all set against a tight electro-pop palette that’s by turns anxious (“Violent Delights,” “Nightmares”), dreamy (“California”), and wistful (outro “Better If You Don’t,” a love letter to Glasgow). And despite the heavy subject matter that fueled this album, CHVRCHES have rarely felt—or sounded—better. “Sometimes you can hear that a band phoned it in and that their hearts weren’t in it some way,” says Doherty. “I feel like every inch of ourselves went into this record. It wasn’t always an easy thing to make, for obvious reasons, and at times we had to push ourselves to the edge to make it. When this band is going well, there’s a romance and excitement that you don’t feel with anyone else.” Read on as CHVRCHES walk us through their fourth record, one song at a time.<br />\n<b>“Asking for a Friend”</b>\nLauren Mayberry: “This song is depressing but hopeful. It took a while to get the lyrics right, because the track has such a profound feel to it. If I put the wrong lyric on here, it would fuck everything up. The track felt like a cool chapter one: It’s about regret and loneliness and it’s quite vulnerable and raw. But then it’s like, ’Well, why do you feel those things?’ The next chapters are about going back to tell the rest of that story.”<br />\n<b>“He Said She Said”</b>\nMartin Doherty: “The chords felt like they had this eternal tension in them—they never actually release, even though they get really big. It feels to me like a panic attack, with this grounding force of the drums, which were rigid and quite slow and which are at half the speed of the track.” \nLM: “I liked that the percussion felt more aggressive than anything we’d done in a long time, and that informed the lyrics. It’s interesting to see how people have responded to this song, as we didn’t set out to write a message song.”<br />\n<b>“California”</b>\nMD: “Everyone who moves to LA does a California song, so we were conscious of not doing that. But no one ever makes songs about the dark side of what happens if you get stuck here and you’re a failure and your entire life almost becomes somewhat meaningless and you have to retreat. Lauren came in with those lyrics and it was like, ‘I guess we’re going there.’ The juxtaposition with the sound makes sense with that meaning—if it was all about how great it was to live in LA, it would be a terrible mistake.”<br />\n<b>“Violent Delights”</b>\nMD: “Iain and I talk about <i>Music for the Jilted Generation</i> by The Prodigy and how it’s such an influential British electronic album. This song is definitely a nod to it. I just thought it sounded like a night terror. That inspired us to go even harder on the track.”\nLM: “At first I worried it would be pretentious to put Shakespeare references into the album, but I’d rewatched Baz Lurhmann’s <i>Romeo + Juliet</i> and I found the phrase ‘violent delights’ really evocative. I feel like we’re all morbidly fascinated with the violence that happens to other people. The verse lyrics are actually a series of nightmares that I’d been having. In a hotel room on tour, I dreamed that people were trying to get into the room, and once woke up having piled a bunch of pillows and stuff up against the door—with no memory of doing it. It’s your subconscious telling you your house is on fire and you need to get out. The wheels were coming off.”<br />\n<b>“How Not to Drown” [with Robert Smith]</b>\nMD: “I use writing as a coping mechanism to find better balance as I don’t handle the constant moving around very well. We happened to be in a venue with an old beaten-up piano on it. I started playing around, bashing chords out like the way they ended up in the song. Our manager knows what huge fans we are of The Cure, and—without telling us—was trying to get us a support slot. Then he said, ‘Robert Smith has emailed me, what do we want?’ We said, ‘Let’s send him a bunch of music. The ultimate dream would be for him to sing on this record.’ A while later, we got an email out of the blue on Halloween with him singing on this track.” \nLM: “I’d been reading a lot of Virginia Woolf. She killed herself by drowning herself, which is quite dark. We always talk about how water and water imagery comes up a lot in my lyric writing. It was time to figure out why that was. I feel like it’s all a metaphor for drowning under something. But we’re here and Robert Smith’s on the song, so it’s really good.”<br />\n<b>“Final Girl”</b>\nLM: “I watched so many horror movies to research this album. There’s something about the female experience in horror that you can relate to—the feeling of being watched and hunted and chased, which has been a big part of my relationship with being a woman, I guess.” \nMD: “When Lauren came in with the chorus, I was like, ‘Look, if you want to leave [the band], just leave.’ The lyric literally said, ‘I should quit and go get married.’”<br />\n<b>“Good Girls”</b>\nLM: “We’d been having this discussion about struggling with the idea of male heroes who do terrible things and how you—as a fan or a listener or viewer—sit with those things. I’ve always struggled with it. I find it hard to be emotionally vulnerable with someone as a listener if I know they think certain things. But then I was just thinking about the time and energy we’ve spent being stressed about that and trying to figure out how to live with that. We don’t spend as much time worrying about the people who are the subject of the behavior.”<br />\n<b>“Lullabies”</b>\nMD: “We could do a whole interview about how important [Scottish band] The Blue Nile is to us, coming from Glasgow. They truly manifest the sound of the city, and when I listen, I’m immediately transported home. I was homesick and really longing for Glasgow, and that’s where those sounds—especially the strings on this song—come from.”<br />\n<b>“Nightmares”</b>\nLM: “This is the only song on the record that’s about relationships. The verses are about relationships, then the choruses are about me being frustrated at writing about relationships. It feels like you’re trapped in this horrible repeating saga.”\nIain Cook: “There’s spoken word at the end of this. A song we’ve been trying to pay homage to for many years in this band is ‘Waking the Witch’ by Kate Bush. When the almost scary groove kicks in, there’s this chopped-up, sort of frantic-sounding spoken word, which has always been such an evocative thing. We’ve always wanted to find a way to reference it.”<br />\n<b>“Better If You Don’t”</b>\nMD: “This song was almost like a love letter to our lineage as musicians. What did we sound like when we were in Glasgow, even before CHVRCHES? And what does a Tuesday at 11 am in Glasgow sound like when it’s raining so hard that you’d rather be anywhere else on Earth, but you still love it somehow? I actually wrote this song on a rare day in LA when it was pissing down and I was just watching the rain and singing, taking myself back to the old days.”\nLM: “When you can’t go home to a place or a time, there’s a grief to that. This song looks like a night out in rainy Glasgow when I was 22. I can’t go back to any of that—it literally doesn’t exist. I googled ‘sad about the passing of time’ and all these people said, ‘[That happens] to everyone. Get over it!’”","short":"“I feel like every inch of ourselves went into this

EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1580651712","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"On his full-length debut, <i>All or Nothing</i>, actor and singer Rotimi (Olurotimi Akinosho) folds multiple influences into an eclectic, yet cohesive body of work. Over 15 tracks, he draws from North American, African and Caribbean sounds and reveals his many facets. \"<i>All or Nothing</i> is my way of saying I’m giving everything that I've got,\" he tells Apple Music. \"My approach was to really focus on the artistry. I was able to take my time and spend a year-and-a-half creating without any distractions\". The outcome of this creative process is an immersive listen that relays a fluid palettte informed by a multicultural background. Between the tempered acoustics of the title track, the dancehall-infused “Fiction” alongside Busy Signal, the suave melodies of the Tank-assisted “Grown Decisions” and the groovy “Polaroid” which features Yung Bleu, Rotimi deftly weaves rhythms across multiple genres and musical eras. “I can stand behind this project and say I've made a really timeless album,” he continues. “It’s something people will be able to listen to over and over again.” He lets us in on his creative choices while revealing the album's themes and the songs that best embody them.<br />\n<b>The Journey</b>\n“My journey is really the story of the underdog. It's been a journey of consistency and perseverance and there's been a lot of favour, grace and mercy. A lot of things go into my story; which is a very unique one. I've been working hard to get to this level so it feels incredible to have the eyes of the people waiting to see what I'll do. It's the first time that I can say I'm giving people a journey through everything that I'm going through at this point in time. “Memory Lane” is the story of how I became who I am. I'm giving you everything and you're hearing clearly what my story was. A lot of people don't know my story so I wanted to give it to them in a way that’s different. I didn't want to sing it so this is basically poetry. It was also really cool to feature my mom on it.”<br />\n<b>The Collaborations</b>\n“Apart from my mother, I worked with Stacy Barthe and the incredible singer-songwriter Marquis Rashad on “Memory Lane”. The features are from artists I really respect and that I'm cool with. “Fiction” is one with a cool vibe and Busy Signal is a legend. I feel like “Polaroid” will be a fan favourite ‘cause it’s easy listening and something that’s always going to groove. Yung Bleu’s doing really well so it was the perfect time for us to get things moving. I met Alpha P when I went to Nigeria two years ago. I thought he was exceptionally talented and wanted to give him the opportunity to be in my world. He sent me some music and I remembered the record a couple of months ago. I was like, ‘Let me cut it, ’cause it's still in my head.’ I put my verse on it and it became “Fayah”. Working with FireboyDML is a blessing first and foremost and “Weapon” is probably my favourite song. It’s a cool mixture of Afrobeats, reggae and R&B. We met at a party in LA and just knew we needed to work together. We complemented each other very well and our vibes really meshed well.”<br />\n<b>The Process</b>\n“”What To Do” is a pop record—something I've never really done before and I’m really proud of. It's a fun summertime song with a cool energy. It's an unexplainable feeling... you hear it and it resonates in your spirit. That's how I move in everything; I just trust my intuition. When I hear a beat that I love I don't hesitate and start working on it. All these records came about through conversation and within those conversations we’d get the topline and melodies. It's like, ‘What do you wanna talk about Ro; what makes you happy or what makes you sad?’ [Put down] whatever you're feeling.”<br />\n<b>The Rhythm & Blues</b>\n“”Say My Name” is a record for the cocky man and is a really smooth, cool record. It's really elegant music and very eloquent. It's a song that's saying, ‘Let everybody know who that belongs to!’. It's a clever way of saying something everybody's already said but I wanted to put my own spin on it. “Decide” is a really sexy, throwback record and the first R&B song on the album. It reminds me of the ’90s and I'm a big fan of that time, so making the record was just me paying respect. It's about being a big daddy… being the one that leads the way. The video is also my first time directing and is basically a recreation of Jay Z's “Excuse Me Miss”.”<br />\n<b>The Fusion of Sounds</b>\n“The album sounds like the best way Rotimi can be Rotimi. I'm the definition and epitome of African-American so you get the Afrobeats, pop, R&B and hip hop—all the elements of who I am and what I represent. “Don't You Ever” is a record that's really dancey, simple and smooth and it was inspired by my trip to Haiti. I really loved that kompa sound over there—I wasn't too familiar with it before I visited but it felt really good. Being Nigerian, there's very similar beats and I wanted to do something to pay homage to Haitian music and culture with this one. I'd say I'm one of the bridges, playing my part in bringing Afrobeats to the States and making it digestible for people that maybe aren't familiar with it. Being in this realm I see it as my duty and I think that's my purpose right now.”","short":"\"It's the first time that I can say I'm giving people a journey.\""},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/35J4qJY7CLZzn3o682sx2V"}},{"id":"1579263876","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579263876?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/78/97/96/789796ee-28d8-e7cb-1950-806e18304693/Fatboy_Slim_-_Everybody_Loves_A_Mixtape_-_Volume_3_Ibiza.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":2000,"textColor3":"d1c1b0","textColor2":"edd7b9","textColor4":"c4af94","textColor1":"feeedc","bgColor":"1f0d01","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Fatboy Slim","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everybody-loves-a-mixtape-vol-3-ibiza-dj-mix/1579263876","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Everybody Loves a Mixtape, Vol. 3: Ibiza (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381814489","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1579263876","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1579605598","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579605598?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/49/7d/38/497d38d9-d75d-4301-70d7-d10922845b2f/194690430657_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3c1c9","textColor2":"d7dbf7","textColor4":"aeb1c8","textColor1":"f2eff9","bgColor":"08070d","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Timbaland & Magoo","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/under-construction-part-ii/1579605598","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2003-11-18","name":"Under Construction, Part II","recordLabel":"Blackground Records, LLC","upc":"194690430657","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2003 Blackground Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1579605598","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0jfrooQp2CEzzX0kwwcnM9"}},{"id":"1572878538","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572878538?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/95/8a/c8/958ac89a-ae1e-3c6f-f25b-11664f84ae09/886449291632.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"332b01","textColor2":"201a05","textColor4":"4c3f04","textColor1":"020201","bgColor":"f9d100","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Niko Moon","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-time/1572878538","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"GOOD TIME","recordLabel":"RCA Records Label Nashville","upc":"886449291632","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment.

Nearly 20 years into their career, they’re back at it with <i>Bronx VI</i>, their first to feature new drummer and former Queens of the Stone Age member Joey Castillo. Remarkably, it’s also the first Bronx album to include some songs <i>not</i> written by guitarist Joby J. Ford and vocalist Matt Caughthran. “That was pretty paramount to the sound and structure of the record,” Caughthran tells Apple Music. “For the first time, we have other members contributing songs. Everyone has their own unique identity songwriting-wise, so it gave the album a sense of balance and everything feels fresh.” Below, he details each track.<br />\n<b>“White Shadow”</b>\n“That's a pretty quintessential Bronx song, and it’s one of my favorites on the record. Lyrically, it's about coming unglued a little bit. It's about feeling the pressure of life and the pressure to be the best person that you can be and live the best life you can, but it's just not in the cards for you because you don't have the skill set or the tools necessary.”<br />\n<b>“Superbloom”</b>\n“That song's a trip, man. It was written by our bassist, Brad Magers. The chorus was an idea that Joby had, so there’s a really cool push and pull between the two of them sonically. I caught up with an old friend of mine that I hadn't seen in years, and we spent some time in the California superbloom wildflowers, just kind of tripping out and talking about life. It was a really cool experience and conversation, and stuff like that means a lot to me. When I left the flower field, I knew I wanted to write a song called ‘Superbloom.’”<br />\n<b>“Watering the Well”</b>\n“That’s a rocker jam with a big, arena-style opening. It's funny—a lot of people say that song has got some KISS feel to it, which I'm totally okay with. Lyrically, it’s almost kind of trying to fall into a Thin Lizzy ‘The Boys Are Back in Town’ type of vibe, where it's just a feel-good rock ’n’ roll song. It's just about going out, letting loose, looking for some trouble, finding some trouble and being okay with it.”<br />\n<b>“Curb Feelers”</b>\n“This is one of the more important songs on the record. We call it a ‘backbone track’ or an ‘anchor track’ because when you start writing a record, you’re looking for something that feels like a good direction. For this record, ‘Curb Feelers’ is that song. It’s about the ironies and funny shit that comes along with being an older punk.”<br />\n<b>“Peace Pipe”</b>\n “There’s always a song or two like this on every Bronx record—they’re kinda like weird sidesteps musically. Lyrically, it’s about being oblivious to what’s happening around you—or in denial of what’s happening around you. It’s a thin line between living your own life and not giving a fuck what’s happening around you without being the person who has no concept of reality. There’s a lot of crazy shit happening in the world, so you have to figure out how to balance your own life with what's happening around you and how much you want to participate in things that aren't directly on your doorstep.”<br />\n<b>“High Five”</b>\n“This song is almost like two songs in one. Melodically and lyrically, I was stuck between two different ideas, and we couldn’t figure out what to do because they both sounded good. We were just fucking around with it one night, so I plugged both lines into the song and it just felt really cool to have a stacked melody like that. Lyrically, it’s about people that you don’t really vibe with anymore. Maybe you’ll see someone you grew up with posting some crazy-ass shit online and you’re just like, ‘What the fuck?’ It’s just a playful tune based around growing apart from people.”<br /> \n<b>Mexican Summer</b>\n“We have a mariachi band called Mariachi El Bronx, and for a long time we tried to keep the bands pretty separate sonically. But then we did a livestream over the pandemic where both bands played, and it just felt right. So on this song, we definitely incorporated a little bit of that rhythmic El Bronx vibe into the verses. Lyrically, it’s about the rise and fall of a drug lord, with a <i>Scarface</i> kind of finale, where he always knew being on top was going to be temporary because it comes with the territory.”<br /> \n<b>“New Lows”</b>\n“This song is about two people who don't necessarily know what they're doing or might not belong together, but they're giving it their best shot. They both might know that it’s not going to work, but that goes undiscussed because they’re just trying put their best foot forward. When they’re together, it’s super chemically charged, with high highs and low lows.”<br />\n<b>“Breaking News”</b>\n“This is kinda our ode to ‘Media Blitz’ by the Germs. There’s so much happening in the world via media information, and everyone struggles with it because the line is so blurred between what’s real and what’s fake. I feel like there’s a link or a story to support literally any theory you can possibly come up with. A lot of it just doesn’t hold water anymore, whether it’s coming from a major network or the dark web. So this is just a classic anti-authority punk rock song about not giving in to the bullshit they try to feed you.”<br /> \n<b>“Jack of All Trades”</b>\n“We always joked about writing a song that’s based on the <i>Logjammin’</i> porno from <i>The Big Lebowski</i>, so that’s kind of what this is. It’s just that attitude of the ’80s porno guy coming over to…fix the cable. People might be like, ‘Is he trying to be sexy? What the fuck is going on here?’ But the song is super tongue-in-cheek.”<br /> \n<b>“Participation Trophy”</b>\n“We have a history of ending our records with songs that are slightly out of our comfort zone, and this is a pretty groove-heavy, almost classic-rock-style song, which is something that we haven't really done before. But when we were writing it, it just felt so good that we decided to do it.

So, she is very confident and even maybe bloodthirsty or evil. Some of these divas are pretty evil, like a queen or goddess. On the other hand, that’s something I’ve really wanted to be. But I think I never will be like this because I’m not that egocentric. My nature is pretty shy, but I would like to be like this woman for at least one day.”<br /> \n<b>“Colossus”</b>\n“The lyrics for this one were written by Eugene, and he was writing this song for as long as I was writing all the songs on the album. I asked him, ‘Eugene, please, can you do this faster?’ I didn’t know what to expect, but he told me he was inspired by some political events of the past. So, I think the colossus is a symbol of a big country—that’s really what I can tell you. But for me, it’s more than this. It has a very human nature. I imagine a massive giant, like Gulliver.”<br /> \n<b>“Vortex”</b>\n“It’s the first single and also the first song I started to write lyrics to—and also the first song I started to record. It’s dedicated to all those people like me who spend so much time thinking about their inner world that they start to be devoured by the dark thoughts. Their head is getting heavy—so heavy that it turns into a steel ball and falls off and makes a hole in the floor and then a hole in the ground and then a hole in the earth and then sucks you in. So, please don’t dive so deeply into your thoughts. It’s a bad habit.”<br /> \n<b>“Disclosure!”</b>\n“Me and Eugene did an interview with a guy who used to work for Ukrainian television, and now he has his YouTube channel. He turned every question into a political topic. And of course, in Ukraine, this is a very painful situation. I was so angry and pissed off with this dude because he asked so many provocative questions. It showed us in a very bad light, but that’s what he wanted. For three days after, I was carrying this heavy emotion in my heart. That’s why I did this song with the exclamatory, like ‘teacher, teacher!’ because it makes it more intense.”<br /> \n<b>“Copycat”</b>\n“The lyrics are about the people who spot a true artist, like a musician or a painter, and they try to copy that, taking all the credit and showing the product as their own ideas without giving credit to the owner, the pioneer. It’s very disgusting. And then the people who appreciate the art of the copycat, they have no idea that it’s stolen. It’s unfortunate that there are no filters to filter those people out.”<br /> \n<b>“Pearls and Swine”</b>\n“‘To cast pearls before swine’ is a phrase from the Bible. And it means don’t try to explain yourself in front of a fool, especially when it’s a crowd of fools. It addresses the people who shine with genius, but they cannot find like-minded people, so the crowd tries to destroy them for being different. So, don’t bloom for everyone—that’s my advice.”<br />  \n<b>“Sleep of the Righteous”</b>\n“This one is my favorite. The song is about my first experience of sleep paralysis. On some level of your sleep, your mind wakes up, but your body is still asleep. You experience this feeling of absolute helplessness, and you can see a lot of hallucinations. It’s a very terrifying thing to feel in the middle of the night. When I first experienced it, I thought there was an evil force coming to my room and pressing me against the bed.”<br /> \n<b>“Wallflower”</b>\n“The song is about introverts, like me. The old title was ‘An Introvert,’ but you can agree that this is very plain and straightforward, with zero character. But then my husband told me there’s a word in English—wallflower—that means a shy person who stands near the wall at parties, and no one wants to dance with this person. I thought this was a very romantic and poetic word, so I wanted to use it for this song and for the whole album, eventually.”<br /> \n<b>“Dead Hands Feel No Pain”</b>\n“My husband, Alex, helped me with the lyrics for this song. I was woken up one morning by a very loud noise of crowds outside my window. When I fell back asleep, I imagined myself sleeping in a cemetery with the noise of the crowd still in my head. Then, I was sitting on the gates that lead to the cemetery. I’m on the edge: Am I dead or am I alive? I’m a lost soul, probably a ghost. So, this is a song of a ghost.”<br /> \n<b>“As I Boil Ice”</b>\n“I wanted to use this as the album title at first, because it’s very strong and very harsh. But then it didn’t quite fit with our artwork. We even tried to put an icicle near the flower on the front cover, but it’s really hard to notice. The song is about me not having any social skills when I do things for the first time, because I like to sit in my shell. When I try to do something for the first time, I get frustrated and decide I’ll never do it again. That’s the wrong way of thinking, of course. It’s like the first steps of a baby.”<br /> \n<b>“Mediator”</b>\n‘‘When you are young, you wear pink-colored glasses. You see the world very bright and fun to live in. But then, with age, you realize that it’s fucking horrible. There are people who can stay positive even during the hard times, but it’s not me. The song is kind of a monologue to God, if there even is a God—me grabbing Him by the beard and showing Him all the horrors of the world.”","short":"“This album came out way different than anything we’ve done before.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3LEftQAmoSdbX1hXvA7rMT"}},{"id":"1571956933","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571956933?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/1e/d3/20/1ed32007-7c01-8fc6-cf36-78bec441cd6f/190296656675.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"322f25","textColor2":"392001","textColor4":"5f4926","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fbeeba","hasP3":false},"artistName":"vision string quartet","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/spectrum/1571956933","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Spectrum","recordLabel":"Warner Classics","upc":"190296656675","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Parlophone Records Limited, a Warner Music Group Company","playParams":{"id":"1571956933","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3QjamC1uWw55nnlKhiKo67"}},{"id":"1572902715","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1572902715?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/59/38/f0/5938f084-f10a-b152-bdfc-53f1a1aa1808/886449264438.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0b19c","textColor2":"e4955e","textColor4":"bb7d50","textColor1":"ead6bd","bgColor":"1a1f1b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Spirit Adrift","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forge-your-future-ep/1572902715","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"Forge Your Future - EP","recordLabel":"Century Media","upc":"886449264438","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Century Media Records Ltd. under exclusive license from Spirit Adrift","playParams":{"id":"1572902715","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Spirit Adrift mastermind Nate Garrett moved from Arizona to Texas on March 1, 2020. Two weeks later, the country went into lockdown due to the pandemic. He’d already begun work on a follow-up to the band’s fourth album, <i>Enlightened in Eternity</i> (which came out in October 2020, but was recorded the previous year), when his label suggested a stopgap EP to tide fans over between LPs. The result is <i>Forge Your Future</i>, which features soaring heavy metal anthems directly inspired by the pandemic. “I don’t know if the song ‘Forge Your Future’ is connected to the pandemic at all, but the other two songs, yes—100%,” Garrett tells Apple Music. “And musically, I probably wrote the title track and ‘Wake Up’ within the first week of lockdown.” Below, he takes us through the songs.<br />\n<b>“Forge Your Future”</b>\n“A lot of metal bands write songs as narratives. It can be a realistic narrative or a completely fantastical one about dragons and magic—which is something I’ll never do. But I did find it to be a new and exciting experience to write lyrics as a story. When I went back and read it, I realized it’s a pretty heavy-handed metaphor for overcoming adversity, which a lot of our stuff is about, but I focused more on imagery—a cool story that you could picture in your mind’s eye. And inadvertently, it does apply to the times we find ourselves in.”<br />\n<b>“Wake Up”</b>\n“For this one, I had the chorus riff first. I think most people would compare it to some ’80s Randy Rhoads-type stuff, but actually <i>Symbolic</i>-era Death was a big touchstone for that riff. I wrote the rest of the song around that chorus riff, and it’s an open-fifth string-based song, which is kinda hard to fuck up. Lyrically, I was just watching everybody buy up all the toilet paper and felt frustrated and disgusted to my very core. I just wanted to smack people in the face and scream at ’em to wake the fuck up and start acting right.”<br /> \n<b>“Invisible Enemy”</b>\n“This is actually a combination of three different songs I was working on that I combined into one big Frankenstein’s monster, Diamond Head-style new wave of British heavy metal song. But there are also sections where we were going for the <i>Suspiria</i> soundtrack, almost. There’s some Mercyful Fate in there, too. Lyrically, it’s not the first song I’ve written about trying and executing crooked politicians. The title is a phrase that our former President was tossing around at press conferences, which is funny because that’s exactly what he is, and a lot of people like him are: toxic enemies of humanity, basically.”","short":"“I just wanted to smack people in the face and scream at ’em to wake up.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/17cbwiZR0cSFnnaXZICOpE"}},{"id":"1581269331","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581269331?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/f2/03/d9/f203d94a-ef07-aad2-75fe-348b2045f59f/21UMGIM80705.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3600,"textColor3":"344a43","textColor2":"1e3221","textColor4":"3a534b","textColor1":"162618","bgColor":"aad8f2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Abby Jasmine","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-hate-you-2-ep/1581269331","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"I Hate You 2 -

I was trying to force it.” As the pandemic scuttled all plans to record and tour, he began “immersing” himself in his demos, refining his work, trading ideas with longtime collaborator Justin Tripp, a key player on 2014’s <i>Way Out Weather</i>. “It was transformative,” Gunn says of the experience, which saw him embrace writing on piano and classical guitar. “We talked a lot about how we wanted to make the music more melodic, to give the music more space, to not overdo it, to let the songs live and breathe in a more simple way. I think I cracked through a certain shell of myself or something. I just calmed down.”<br />\nYou can certainly hear that in <i>Other You</i>, an iridescent set of bottomless folk and gentle rock that Gunn eventually recorded in a bubble, in LA, with producer Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Beck, Guided By Voices) later that year. It’s a record that’s rooted in empathy, in stepping outside of yourself. And following the loss of a close friend to COVID in the early stages of the pandemic, it came at a crucial moment for Gunn. “It was a shock,” he says of his friend’s death. “I went through a really hard time in the beginning. But I did a lot of work to pull myself out of it, really relying on this record, on the process of making it. It was a real letting-go period for me—I started accepting a lot of things and I started feeling a lot better. Partially, I think that’s what it’s about.” Here, Gunn tells us the stories behind some of the album’s songs.<br />\n<b>“Other You”</b>\n“I was doing a lot of harmonizing, which was new to me. I couldn’t get this one note and Rob was trying to help me, playing the note on the piano. He opened this program and replicated my voice to sing the note, and he played it back to me through headphones. It was pretty incredible—it was me, but it sounded like a robot. He was like, ‘Do you hear that? Sing to that. Sing to the other you.’ I was like, ‘Oh, my God. The other you: That’s the title of the record.’ It just made so much sense. That’s essentially what the song is—finding a different space, different sorts of inspirations, a different sound.”<br />\n<b>“Fulton”</b>\n“Walking is very important to me, in particular when I was writing this record. I was wandering around my neighborhood, thinking about the people that are near and dear to me, how supportive they’ve been, and how sometimes joy and happiness can be just tapping you on the shoulder. I was thinking of me, shutting down and sitting in silence, letting a lot of things go, releasing a lot of stuff that I was holding onto really tightly. There was a particular moment that I reference in the song where I was listening to news radio, and the station just shut off. It represented what I’d been trying to achieve in enjoying silence and realizing how powerful that can be.”<br />\n<b>“Circuit Rider”</b>\n“I came up with this riff, and it’s circular—goes backwards and then it goes the other way. It’s a reel or, in modern terms, a loop. It came from a British folk style that I learned how to play a lot of and, lyrically, I feel like we’re living in a time of real science fiction. I was trying to write a song from the perspective of a cyborg, the circuit rider, who’s observing someone in modern times, who’s in a current situation, and being super distraught as they’re observing. I feel like there are a lot of detriments to the way that people interact and socialize, and the way that people perceive reality and ego. It’s dangerous territory. I was imagining this creaky robot telling us, ‘You don’t have to submit yourself to this.’”<br />\n<b>“Protection”</b>\n“In 2019, I was all over the world, and I just came back completely empty, feeling like I needed a break to figure out a lot of things in my life. I was thinking about how you can rely on a lighthouse to get back to where you’re going if you’re lost. It’s a hopeful song about trying to find your path and it’s not just about myself—it’s an empathetic song for others as well. And I have to say, it coincided with the heightened level of anxiety that we’ve been in—how unprotected we’ve all felt. There’s a new sense of vulnerability with everything.”<br />\n<b>“Reflection”</b>\n“Originally, it was just this super-simple piano thing, and it helped me sing differently, in a more emphatic way, and really use my voice. I was thinking a lot about Robert Wyatt: It almost sounds like he’s visualizing certain things, playing these chords, almost doing some free-associative language. He’s very playful with his words, and it almost feels like he’s being spontaneous as he’s composing. I just did this off-the-cuff, in a style that, perhaps, Robert Wyatt would. It feels really free and not precious. It paints a picture.”<br />\n<b>“Ever Feel That Way”</b>\n“There was this incident that happened in Atlanta—this young man, Rayshard Brooks, was murdered by the police. I was so heartbroken to read about it. He basically asked them for help. He was driving home to see his family, and he was drunk in a parking lot, trying to sober up. There’s this Tibetan exercise called Tonglen, which is where you sit and meditate and you think about others—the people you love, but also everyone that’s surrounding you and what they’re going through. This guy, he just needed a little bit of help. I was thinking about him, and turning it back on the cop to say, ‘Hey, man. Have you ever felt this way? You definitely have.’ I was just trying to convey the fact that I’ve certainly been there, and everyone I know has been there. Everyone needs help.”","short":"“I think I cracked through a certain shell of myself.

Cover versions and six original compositions by pioneering artists from the worlds of film, electronic, and contemporary classical make for a stunning album. Jon Hopkins’ 2020 piano-and-violin track “Scene Suspended” has been reworked for voices and harp to miraculous effect. Þorkell Sigurbjörnsson, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Ólafur Arnalds, and Hildur Guðnadóttir weave an Icelandic sensibility through the program while Luke Howard (a ravishing Emily Dickinson setting), Nainita Desai, and Ola Gjeilo add their own strong voices. Atmospherically recorded and imaginatively mixed, this is VOCES8 in top form.","short":"Breathtakingly beautiful music-making with its eye on the heavens."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/74eIgzLtcbJVr4NIajGzrb"}},{"id":"1570924020","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570924020?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/06/88/9e/06889ee5-811e-19a3-8752-08f159d5a503/720841219804.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"302e09","textColor2":"570e12","textColor4":"763a17","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f1e92e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Chubby and the Gang","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-mutts-nuts/1570924020","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Punk"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-08-27","name":"The Mutt's Nuts","recordLabel":"PTKF","upc":"720841219804","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Partisan Records","playParams":{"id":"1570924020","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22UMzfjPFiCsdrA3AYywzx"}}]}
