This isn’t much of an issue for die-hards—2020’s <i>Until I Return</i> was similarly independent—but for an MC with multiple collaborative projects under his belt as well as 2021 collaborations with Tyler The Creator, Migos, and Rod Wave, going it alone on his most anticipated project to date has to mean something. Luckily for fans, the answers are right here on record. <br />\n“Can you help me out, I don’t wanna explain how I feel/I don't want talk right now, I just wanna get from round here,” Youngboy sings on <i>Sincerely, Kentrell</i>’s “Hold Me Down.” Despite more upbeat selections like “Bandit” and “Make No Sense,” pain-music has become something of a calling card for Youngboy, the MC mining his early life’s struggles as well as his current life’s stresses for content. Consistent within those paradigms are women problems and issues with the law. (Upon the release of <i>Sincerely, Kentrell</i>, actually, YoungBoy sat in jail in St. Martinville, Louisiana awaiting trial on charges related to a September 2020 arrest for firearms possession.) <br />\nNearly every song <i>Sincerely, Kentrell</i> has elements of Youngboy reflecting on his life and ruminating on why things haven’t worked out for him the way he thinks they should have. He’s very clearly fighting demons and can shift in a matter of bars from apologizing to a lover he’s wronged to threatening perceived enemies with his wrath. That turmoil is maybe best articulated in the final track, “Panoramic,” when Youngboy sings, “She want diamonds/The streets want violence.” \n","short":"Baton Rouge’s native son wants you to hear it from him."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1576754113","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1576754113?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/e3/b5/b1/e3b5b12a-8b68-8489-4adb-18fa264716dc/21UMGIM62945.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"22282d","textColor2":"2c1f1d","textColor4":"3c4044","textColor1":"0a0200","bgColor":"80c1e2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mickey Guyton","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/remember-her-name/1576754113","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Remember Her Name","recordLabel":"Capitol Records Nashville","upc":"00602438607440","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Capitol Records Nashville Release; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1576754113","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"It’s not uncommon for debut artists to navigate a circuitous route to releasing their first full-length project, but few have traversed paths as long and arduous as Mickey Guyton’s road to <i>Remember Her Name</i>. The Nashville-based singer-songwriter first signed a record deal in 2011 and, 10 years later, is finally releasing her debut album. “This whole album really is my life, and my learning self-acceptance, over the last 10 years,” Guyton tells Apple Music. “The ups, the downs, the back and forth, the impostor syndrome that we all tend to get because of the downs—all of that is wrapped up in one album.”<br />\n<i>Remember Her Name</i> opens with the powerful title track, which was inspired both by the murder of Breonna Taylor and by Guyton’s own reclamation of the sense of self that 10 years in the music industry mercilessly eroded. Empowerment is a recurring theme throughout the LP, but Guyton rejects schmaltzy clichés in favor of nuanced, often painfully personal stories of working through internalized racism (“Love My Hair,” “Black Like Me”), embracing the inherently imperfect nature of a marriage (“Lay It on Me”), and fighting for space in a white-dominated industry (a particularly moving rerecording of her 2015 track “Better Than You Left Me”). “I hope people walk away from the album feeling seen,” Guyton adds. “I tried to put my life on display in an honest way, showing the good and the bad. And I hope people can hear that in that album and find hope within their own lives from it.” Below, Guyton walks us through several key tracks on <i>Remember Her Name</i>.<br />\n<b>“Remember Her Name”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Remember Her Name’ in the pandemic. And I was actually watching what happened with Breonna Taylor. Whenever someone is wrongly murdered, a lot of people say, ‘Say their name. Remember their name.’ So, I was inspired by that. And then, as I was writing the song, it turned into my own story as an artist. When I first started music, I had so much excitement and confidence in myself, and then life happened and I lost every ounce of confidence that I ever had. No matter what life did to you, that person, that fire is still in you, and you have to find that person. And the reason why I called it ‘Remember Her Name’ for the album was because it took me so long to get to this point of releasing my first body of work, ever.”<br />\n<b>“All American”</b>\n“I also wrote ‘All American’ in the pandemic while very, very pregnant. And the funny story about that is, when I tried to record the song, if I ate, I couldn’t sing because I had no room left. My baby was taking over. So, I would have to come back another day when I didn’t have any food in my stomach to be able to record it. I wanted to write a song showing that our differences make America great. I think so many people have forgotten that. And in this genre—this predominantly white genre—I wanted to sing a song that was true to me and all the different parts of America, whether it’s the Texas sky or the New York City lights, whether it’s James Brown or James Dean or Daisy Dukes and dookie braids. All of that is American.”<br />\n<b>“Love My Hair”</b>\n“I wrote that song after I watched this video on YouTube of this little Black girl with braids crying to her mother because she got sent home from school because they said her hair was distracting. I couldn’t even finish the video because it took me back to my own struggles, as a little girl, with self-love and being in predominantly white spaces in school and just being different. I had those experiences and it’s taken me a long time to get over that and to learn self-acceptance. And this song was a step in that direction.”<br />\n<b>“Lay It on Me”</b>\n“My husband and I have been together for a long time, almost 11 years. At one point in time, he was really, really sick and he almost died. I just remember, at the time, I was broke and I was working on this album; I didn’t exactly know what I was doing. He wouldn’t let me quit. Even when I wanted to just give up my apartment in Nashville and move to LA, he wouldn’t allow it. And he was giving everything so that I could pursue this dream. It’s watching someone that I love struggle and me wanting to take the load off them for a second.”<br />\n<b>“Black Like Me”</b>\n“A lot of these songs I’d written two, three years ago. And ‘Black Like Me’ was kind of the one that helped me focus on what, exactly, I was trying to say in this album. I was chasing after acceptance, and chasing after acceptance in a predominantly white genre. And that was a tough pill for me to swallow, but I took it on the chin and had to take a minute and look at myself. As I was looking at myself, I was looking at everything that I was doing in this industry and trying to just get a chance. And it broke me a little bit. ‘Black Like Me’ was that moment of me being like, ‘Hey, it’s hard. It’s really hard for Black people.’ Some have it easier than others, and I’m definitely on the easier side of the spectrum. But there’s a lot of people that it is not easy for, and I wanted to sing about that.”<br />\n<b>“Better Than You Left Me” (Fly Higher Version)</b>\n“I don’t know what came over me, but I knew that the anniversary of that song was coming up and I was like, ‘I need to do an updated version.’ It has a totally different meaning now, and I needed to put that on the album. When I first wrote the song, I wrote it about an ex that I was so brokenhearted over and that I’d moved on from. But that was forever ago, and that guy is not even a thought in my head anymore; he doesn't matter to me, but the song does. I pulled myself out of that with the help of a small group of people. I wanted to include that because I’m just so different and I am better than the town left me. I’m stronger. I love deeper. I fly higher. I’m all of those things.”","short":"“The ups, the downs, the back and forth—all that is wrapped up in one.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1586577367","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586577367?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/35/9a/5c/359a5c08-8eb0-d492-fb68-ba2dfe6175b3/886449581917.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e261b","textColor2":"24190b","textColor4":"402e20","textColor1":"0d0e05","bgColor":"b38472","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Natti Natasha","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nattividad/1586577367","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"NATTIVIDAD","recordLabel":"Sony Music Latin","upc":"886449581917","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Pina Records under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC","playParams":{"id":"1586577367","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1586065750","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586065750?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/80/fd/40/80fd4064-923f-687b-0ca9-a7984e63583d/194690618253_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1500,"textColor3":"dcdadc","textColor2":"dfcba1","textColor4":"c3b291","textColor1":"fffdff","bgColor":"545152","hasP3":false},"artistName":"D Smoke","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/war-wonders/1586065750","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"War & Wonders","recordLabel":"WoodWorks Records / EMPIRE","upc":"194690618253","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 WoodWorks Records / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1586065750","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"D Smoke knows that not everyone understands who he is yet. There’s a brief interlude tacked on to the end of “Road Rage,” from the Inglewood MC’s sophomore album <i>War & Wonders</i>, where a purported music fan states as much in a frustrated tone: “First he talking Spanish, then he tryna lead the masses, next thing you know he with the gangstas. Like, what is he really on?” The short answer: all of those things, and then some. As a former high school Spanish instructor, he can, indeed, rap in Spanish, the way he did on his way to winning the Netflix reality show <i>Rhythm + Flow</i> and also here on “Dirty Mercedes.” Additionally, he’d love to be able to “lead the masses” to individuality and intellectual freedom, the way he attempts to on songs like “Shame on You,” “Find My Way,” and “Crossover.” He surely understands the gangsta mentality, the way he addresses its trappings on the title track and also “Why Run,” but to really understand who D Smoke is, at least in the way he’d like you to, the listener has to ingest the whole of these perspectives the way they are presented across <i>War & Wonders</i>.

On “Unboxing Intro”, she seems to come apart, growing steadily more frenzied as she sings: “Need some clarity, I miss therapy/Hyperbolic, melancholic/Do I call him? I feel nauseous/Have I lost it? Have I almost hit the bottom?” But the production on “Box in the Ocean”, which immediately follows, suggests the bottom is a tropical island away from it all rather than the claustrophobic places of her mind encapsulated in the lyrics.<br />\nAccording to Cara, this is by design. She points to the soothing lullaby swing of “Sweet Dream” as an example—a song that details the difficulty of trying to sleep when it feels impossible to quiet the voice in your head. “I try to juxtapose a lot of the heavier themes with some more humorous lyrics or some more fun-sounding things,” she says. “But ultimately the root of it was a lot of struggle and a lot of difficulty.” <br />\nThematically, conflicts like heartbreak, anxiety, isolation and longing form the bedrock of the album, following up on 2018's <i>The Pains of Growing</i>. The singer typically opts to navigate her woes in words rather than with her voice, but the most arresting moments of <i>In the Meantime</i> come when she allows her vocal tone to do the heavy lifting. On “Best Days”, she leaves the poppier backdrops for plodding, minimalist drama, creating the space for genuine conviction when she questions, “What if my best days are the days I've left behind?” It's not all doom and gloom, though. “Clockwork” finds her firm in the lessons learned, and tears are transformed into glitter on the chipper closer “Apartment Song”, as if to correspond with the clarity Cara found through her own process. “I feel like on the other end, I found a lot of acceptance,” she says. “I hope I can provide some people some sort of comfort in the commonalities of our pain and the commonalities of the things that we've gone through.”","short":"“This is just a capsule of the last year of my life.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1582547856","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582547856?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/56/df/53/56df53a4-a1b8-ca4b-f01b-39547ff803e2/21UMGIM83178.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccd","textColor2":"689ada","textColor4":"547cb0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040406","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ben Platt, SZA, Sam Smith & Benj Pasek & Justin Paul","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dear-evan-hansen-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1582547856","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Dear Evan Hansen (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Universal Studios/Interscope Records","upc":"00602438779109","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Universal Studios, under exclusive license to Interscope Records.","playParams":{"id":"1582547856","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1585783193","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585783193?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/90/03/9e/90039edd-03ba-6501-1829-bc8c60cf44a6/ITZY_CRAZY_IN_LOVE_ONLINE_COVER_FINAL.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8b5b0","textColor2":"adb0f6","textColor4":"9294cc","textColor1":"dddad3","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"artistName":"ITZY","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crazy-in-love/1585783193","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","Dance"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"CRAZY IN LOVE","recordLabel":"JYP Entertainment","upc":"738676858297","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 JYP Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1585783193","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"This bold sonic confection captures the band’s iconic charisma."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1570547185","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1570547185?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3733,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/33/5e/ad/335ead46-a74e-db04-9479-37eae81ec907/4050538700398.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3733,"textColor3":"bebdb8","textColor2":"efbcaa","textColor4":"c79e90","textColor1":"e3e1dd","bgColor":"2a2a28","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Angels & Airwaves","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lifeforms/1570547185","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Lifeforms","recordLabel":"Rise Records","upc":"4050538700398","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 My Products LLC under exclusive license to Rise Records","playParams":{"id":"1570547185","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1565884195","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1565884195?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/28/ad/2e/28ad2eb5-e31c-40d0-c344-66915345ea28/21UMGIM29852.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"332f04","textColor2":"283134","textColor4":"53562d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffeb11","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ill-be-your-mirror-a-tribute-to-the-velvet-underground-nico/1565884195","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"I’ll Be Your Mirror: A Tribute to The Velvet Underground & Nico","recordLabel":"Verve","upc":"00602435920917","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Verve Compilation release;

The problem that beset preparations for studio album three in November 2019, therefore, was fairly ironic. “I just didn’t have any space,” Joshua—better known as Nao—tells Apple Music. “My own studio in East London is really, really small. So I hired a bigger space and invited loads of musicians and friends down just to jam and create and make interesting ideas.” Within 10 days, the nucleus of <i>And Then Life Was Beautiful</i> had formed, followed by periods of creative tinkering sparked by the unsettling (a pandemic) and utterly joyous (the birth of her daughter, in spring 2020). Fittingly, the final album honors change in all aspects (including breakups—a subject tapped into majestically on tracks including “Messy Love,” “Glad That You’re Gone,” and “Good Luck”) and triumphantly toasts femininity (see the Lianne La Havas duet “Woman”). It’s an album that bears its creative and personal liberation and wisdom well—bolstered by spoken-word interludes from UK poet Sophia Thakur. “It's a really cool way of tying a project together and providing a bit more context,” she says. “I love interludes, and I can remember them being on so many great albums, like Kendrick Lamar’s [<i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>] and old-school albums from Jill Scott [<i>Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds, Vol. 1</i>], where they often play around with poetry or conversations.” Below, Nao talks through her triumphant third album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“And Then Life Was Beautiful”</b>\n“The first lyrics are ‘Change came like a hurricane, 2020 hit us differently/And even though I didn't want it, the slow life got ahold of me.’ It’s about us all going through the pandemic at the same time, but also a reminder that better days are ahead.”<br />\n<b>“Messy Love”</b>\n“This is a song about creating boundaries. I think everyone has experienced someone in their life that's not good for them, whether it’s a girlfriend-boyfriend situation, a family member or friend, and when they're around you, they bring negative energy and create situations. It's not something everyone’s born with, to be able to put up boundaries or learn how to say goodbye to these people. So this song, and the track after, pays homage to that.”<br />\n<b>“Glad That You’re Gone”</b>\n“This track is about moving on and finding the people that pour life into you and water you. I've been through enough to know what I can and can’t deal with—and so I’m better at spotting red flags [in relationships]. If I see a couple from early, then I’m cutting it, dead.”<br />\n<b>“Antidote” (feat. Adekunle Gold)</b>\n“My daughter loves Adekunle—when she was born, I would use his songs to stop her crying. And I was excited, like, ‘This is a sign to reach out!’ I did, and discovered he had also just had a baby. So this song came together really quickly and easily. There was something about listening to Adekunle when my daughter was crying and her stopping and how it changes the energy in the room and lifted our spirits. And I wanted to recreate something again like that, so an Afrobeats vibe felt like the right space to finally meet each other.”<br />\n<b>“Burn Out”</b>\n“I’ve been like diagnosed with a condition called chronic fatigue syndrome, which is quite hard for a lot of people to relate to. But I basically don't have very, very much energy at all and I can't really get through the day doing ordinary tasks without having to sleep or rest for long periods of time. And so it's been this way for three years. In my first year I thought: ‘It’s just burnout?’ I would say burnout is kind of a lesser version of that. A similar feeling, you're knackered, but if you take a month off you’ll be back up on your feet. And so it was easier for me to sing ‘Burn Out’ than singing ‘Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.’”<br />\n<b>“Wait”</b>\n“This song represents lessons that I never knew and if I had known maybe situations would be different. For me, in this relationship situation, I ran away instead of staying and working through it. And learning the lesson that we are human and we all humans make mistakes. The way to deal with them isn't to run away. Going through rough times in a relationship sometimes means that it can end up being stronger. But I guess this song is almost like an apology to myself in a way.”<br />\n<b>“Good Luck” (feat. Lucky Daye)</b>\n“The songs with features came about very organically as we were thrown together in some way. I met with Lucky Daye last year; we were both nominated for Grammy Awards. I met him on the red carpet. We were mutual fans and in that moment agreed to get into the studio. So two days later, we came up with 'Good Luck.’”<br />\n<b>“Nothing’s for Sure”</b>\n“This track is a reminder to live in the moment. With the pandemic, you don't really know what's around the corner, so you learn about practicing being present and going with the flow.”<br />\n<b>“Woman” (feat. Lianne La Havas)</b>\n“This track brings together the idea that there's space for more than just one girl. Lianne is someone I've been a fan of for a long time. We kept bumping into each other at festivals, as the two British female and Black sort of alternative soul artists. And we agreed to work together, when the timing was right. Being a female artist can sometimes feel like only one woman can be big at one thing. I remember back in the day: ‘Oh, is it Rihanna or is it Beyoncé?’ ‘Is it Nicki or is it Cardi?’ So we’re playing with that notion, because actually there is space for all of us—to wear our crowns and celebrate women as a whole, just the fucking incredible species that we are.”<br />\n<b>“Better Friend”</b>\n“I won't go into the personal story here, but I guess we all have those friends that we were really close with and somehow we drifted apart from. This song serves the idea of sending that person a message, like, ‘I hope you're thriving in life, I hope you're smiling, I hope you're getting everything that you've dreamed of.’ That’s where my head was at when I was writing this song.”<br />\n<b>“Postcards” (feat. serpentwithfeet)</b>\n“This song is two love stories happening in parallel to each other. serpentwithfeet is welcoming a man into his life; they're in London, and they're looking at the gray day, and it's all really beautiful to them, and it's really exciting. Mine is about letting go of someone. I’m going through old memories and thinking about how I still think the person is an amazing human. It's unusual that you're going to have a Black man sing about loving another man on music, and having space for that, I think, is really beautiful.”<br />\n<b>“Little Giants”</b>\n“This track is about finding out someone is not the person you thought they were—and explores the different emotions around that. I think that's really prevalent now, in the age of social media, and especially online dating when you're planning on meeting a person, you don't really know what you're getting or who you're really speaking to.”<br />\n<b>“Amazing Grace”</b>\n“I was working with [UK producer] Maths Time Joy. He was playing guitar, and the lyric 'Amazing Grace' kept coming to me—like it's sung so beautifully on the chords. But I was like, what does it mean to me? I took that and turned it into this idea of facing one's fear of failing—I think that's definitely one of my biggest fears. This song's just exploring the fear of failure, and what happens if actually you do just go for it.”","short":"“I’ve been through enough to know what I can and can’t deal

and magnetic properties. In his first major masterpiece in two decades, Academy Award-winning composer Vangelis celebrates this remarkable endeavor with beautiful, dramatic music of vast sonic horizons. Using his trademark synthesizers, he incorporates electro-magnetic sounds from the planet, mission control commands, and the ethereal, wordless voice of soprano Angela Gheorghiu (”Juno’s Tender Call” and “Juno’s Accomplishments”). “Out in Space,” which places Juno’s radio signals against the vastness of the universe, is pure, vintage Vangelis. Myth meets science in “Zeus Almighty,” as the music grapples with the gas giant’s awesome power before the simple beauty of “In Serenitatem” leaves Juno wheeling silently in space.","short":"NASA’s space probe inspires beautiful and dramatic music of vast horizons."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574428298","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574428298?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ec/42/29/ec422949-4d0d-69c9-2bb9-b871dcc8be02/21UMGIM58318.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"312b2b","textColor2":"262625","textColor4":"49423f","textColor1":"09090c","bgColor":"d3b1a8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Greeting Committee","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dandelion/1574428298","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Dandelion","recordLabel":"Harvest Records","upc":"00602438477111","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Harvest Records; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1574428298","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1574537836","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574537836?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/63/9a/7f/639a7f55-2246-69de-a81a-062891037c1c/LBJ-306_10x10_300dpi_RGB.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3c2b5","textColor2":"e5cb9a","textColor4":"cbb284","textColor1":"efdfd7","bgColor":"644f2b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ada Lea","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/one-hand-on-the-steering-wheel-the-other-sewing-a-garden/1574537836","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Folk"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden","recordLabel":"Saddle Creek","upc":"648401030662","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Saddle Creek","playParams":{"id":"1574537836","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1584343055","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584343055?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/5a/b2/22/5ab2226c-d9c7-81ce-fe38-943365d63ac5/21UMGIM84885.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ded20d","textColor2":"f6e1bd","textColor4":"d9c6a5","textColor1":"fcf000","bgColor":"675845","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Philadelphia Orchestra & Yannick Nézet-Séguin","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/florence-price-symphonies-nos-1-3/1584343055","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Florence Price: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948619023","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1584343055","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Florence Price was the first African American woman to have a symphony performed by a major American orchestra: her <i>Symphony No. 1</i>, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in 1933. Nearly 90 years later, the great Philadelphia Orchestra—another major US ensemble—again puts her music center stage. And what lovely music it is, deftly scored with an open-eyed innocence and a folksy gait. The Philadelphia’s winds and strings sound quite gorgeous. <i>Symphony No. 3</i> (1938-40) shows Price’s growth as a composer and her burgeoning confidence as an orchestrator. Here, the brass play a larger role, which hints at Wagner’s influence.

artists bridge chart pop and underground club culture quite like Boys Noize. The Berlin-based DJ/producer native, born Alex Ridha, is as happy commanding festival main stages as he is dropping vintage acid house at subterranean after-hours joints. Though he won a Grammy in 2021 for his production on Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande’s “Rain on Me” (and nabbed a previous nomination for 2020’s “Midnight Hour,” with Skrillex and Ty Dolla $ign), his 2021 album <i>+/-</i> (pronounced “Polarity”) finds Boys Noize happily turning his back on the spotlight. Some of the album’s best songs reimagine old-school club aesthetics in unexpected ways: “Love & Validation” pairs house beats with gothic synths and Kelsey Lu’s Soft Cell-like vocals. “Girl Crush” plays Rico Nasty’s coquettish vocals off grinding, distorted techno. And “Affection” applies Boys Noize’s characteristically chilly palette to the hot-blooded sound of classic freestyle.<br />\nRidha completed many of the album’s tracks during the pandemic, and a fierce nostalgia for the pleasures of dancing is palpable: The vibe throughout is sexy and slightly sinister, shot through with the electrifying expectations of a first visit to a particularly eye-opening nightclub. On “Nude,” Estonian rapper Tommy Cash sings, “I wish we were all nude,” over a pounding techno beat, giving voice to clubbers’ desire for a long-overdue communion. But many of these songs got their starts long before COVID shuttered clubs; “All I Want,” an ecstatic house anthem featuring Scissor Sisters’ Jake Shears, goes all the way back to 2011. That Ridha rescued the long-lost track from a broken hard drive makes its placement here feel all the more auspicious. Full of sleazy, slow-motion tracks steeped in EBM and ’90s techno, this is Boys Noize’s love letter to late nights on low-lit dance floors, bodies heaving in sweaty unison.","short":"A love letter to

As a concept, <i>The Work</i> grew out of the progressive death metal band’s transition into full-time touring with the success of their previous LP, 2018’s <i>Where Owls Know My Name</i>. “When that happened, we got a taste of what it was like to do this as our job,” bassist, lyricist, and co-vocalist Adam Biggs tells Apple Music. “It changes your relationship with your art and what you love when you attach a monetary dependence to it. In that way, success is a bit of a violation of art. <i>The Work</i> is sort of a metacommentary on what we do when art in general and just the nature of the world becomes a lot of…work.” Below, he discusses each track.<br />\n<b>“The Tower (Theme From ‘The Work’)”</b>\n“I had the idea of this record being a cinematic experience. When we were first putting together this track, it sounded like it had a dreary, opening-credits type of feel. It has a lot of musical themes that I felt were easy to latch onto, and I felt they were delivering the bigger musical picture of the record. The idea of ‘The Tower’ itself is based on a tarot card. It’s a signifier of tumultuous times, but also an opportunity for regrowth. That’s what the lyrics touch on.”<br /> \n<b>“Dreaming Black Clockwork”</b>\n“This song is actually one that I contributed a lot to musically, which is kind of an outlier for the band. Typically, I’m not really a riff writer. I stick to writing the lyrics and the basslines—everything else has pretty much been [guitarist] Brody [Uttley] for the last few years. This has a kind of dark, grinding feel with a lot of crazy sounds and an industrial kind of clanking. It represents the beginning of the grind of your day, after you’ve just woken up and come to grips with what your life is going to be like today. The lyrics are pure existential dread and a desire to escape, but there’s also a will to live.”<br /> \n<b>“Wait”</b>\n“This is an interesting track for us and for people who are familiar with the band. I think it’ll probably throw some people for a loop, but it’s a fun track off the back of the last one. The way the tracks butt up against each other felt like an homage to a classic band, but I don’t want to say exactly who. It’s just about getting high and forgetting your worries for a while, so it’s a little break. The way that Brody put the solo together at the end felt like Guns N’ Roses to me, which I thought was an interesting direction for us.”<br /> \n<b>“Focus”</b>\n“A lot of these songs are drug tracks, if you break them down. If ‘Wait’ was more of a marijuana song, this would be an Adderall song. I grew up in the age when kids were being prescribed amphetamines like candy. I was one of those kids, for better or worse, and when you’re that age you don’t really understand that you’re being set up for a particular relationship with mind-altering substances. You feel dependent on them to function in society, but also sort of resentful towards them.”<br /> \n<b>“Clean”</b>\n“If you’re just looking at the lyrics of this track, it seems it could just be about drugs, and you wouldn’t be wrong in assuming that, but it’s also more about poverty. It’s about struggling and having to scrape by in life. When you do that, nothing around you is clean. Everything is dirty and dingy and spoiled. People don’t understand that if you can’t take a person out of a bad situation, they’re never really going to get themselves out of that hole.”<br /> \n<b>“The Void From Which No Sound Escapes”</b>\n“I came up with the elaborate title before I even knew what the song was going to be about, but it talks about the artist’s struggle. You have an audience that expects something of you, so you kind of have this monster you need to feed. You don’t want to betray what they want, but you also want to be yourself. A lot of times when I’m writing lyrics, I’m putting my worst feelings down—and then I’ll hear people sing them back to me at a show like it’s nothing. So, you’ve got people repeating these painful things you feel, and you wonder what that does to everyone involved.”<br /> \n<b>“More?”</b>\n“This is sort of like the delivery on the promise of the last track. It’s probably the only straight-up death-metal song on the whole record, which is odd for us. Lyrically, it’s kind of sarcastic, like, ‘Yeah, this is exactly what you want. We know how to give it to you, but we don’t always want to. We have other ideas that we can’t ignore.’ So, it’s a little angry at the expectation, but we’re having a good time with it.”<br /> \n<b>“Tower 2”</b>\n“The first ‘Tower’ is that intuition link with the record. It’s pulling you into the topic of the album. ‘Tower 2’ exists as a little bit of a comeback to that situation. It’s a fun little song, kind of a country tune. I get to croon for you a little bit. I like it a lot, but there’s not a whole lot more to say than that.”<br /> \n<b>“Episode”</b>\n“I think this was the first song Brody wrote the music for, but it was a hard one to put together lyrically. It’s about the stress of putting all this stuff down—and reconciling with it. We have to weigh all of this stuff that we’re making against the rest of our lives. There’s relationships in my life that have come and gone throughout this whole thing. So much of my life has to be a certain way to make this thing endure. But I think it’s common for touring musicians to make certain sacrifices. So, it’s about little moments in your life ending, and you just have to keep working through it.”<br /> \n<b>“Maybe One Day”</b>\n“We listen to a lot of theremin-based music on tour. Brody started messing with some of that stuff, so we decided to incorporate some of that kind of tone into this song. Lyrically, it’s a continuation of ‘Episode’ in a way—it’s asking if it’s maybe a better option to just move on. But it’s also a little ambiguous as to what you're moving on from. As someone who works a lot, do you make better choices for your life at home or on the road? It’s also saying that it’s OK to contemplate these things but maybe not worry about them so much.”<br /> \n<b>“Terrestria IV: Work”</b>\n“In the same way that ‘The Tower’ is sort of the opening credits, this is the ending credits. The curtain is closing—not only on this record, but also on the entire four seasonal concepts thing that we’ve run with throughout our whole career at this point. Because this record explores so much other territory sound-wise, we thought it was time for something a little more immediately crowd-pleasing. We’ve finished the work and the whole concept, and this song is asking what’s changed and if we’re happy with what we’ve done. It’s an invitation for the listener to look back with us.”","short":"“It is sort of a meta-commentary on what we do.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1581610052","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581610052?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/74/73/b6/7473b628-b10f-994d-359e-cca19fb5d7ad/5056032345904.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":4000,"textColor3":"d3cac8","textColor2":"41b0f1","textColor4":"3e97cc","textColor1":"fcf0ed","bgColor":"313338","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jackmaster-7/1581610052","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":23,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Jackmaster 7","recordLabel":"D.J.

It’s why the nocturne is one of music’s more powerful genres—and the perfect canvas for the emotionally complex music of Chopin.

It is, by turns, warm, introspective, melancholy, and comforting. “Nocturne 1” radiates serenity like a calm sea lapping at the shore, while chords in “Nocturne 5” combine and clash as if two ominous bells. “Nocturne 7\" hangs in the air, a fleeting dream, “Nocturne 9” evokes a restless mind, and from “Nocturne 11,” Armstrong brings peace, his final chapter allowing the sun to glimmer through the window.","short":"Multilayered music for two pianos, composed entirely after nightfall."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1556718998","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1556718998?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/61/cf/36/61cf36c0-0138-710f-1380-c4e63c2dbd36/669158555154.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c3b3c","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"474747","textColor1":"0e0d0e","bgColor":"f3f3f3","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Amon Tobin","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-do-you-live/1556718998","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Alternative"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"How Do You Live","recordLabel":"Nomark","upc":"669158555154","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Nomark","playParams":{"id":"1556718998","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Following Amon Tobin’s landmark 2011 album <i>ISAM</i>, the Brazilian-born, Bay Area-based electronic musician threw himself into live performance, and while he chased new horizons in video-mapping and other audiovisual technologies, his studio output tapered off for a spell. But beginning in 2019, he kicked off a wildly prolific period. That year, Tobin released two albums under his own name plus another as Only Child Tyrant, his “rock” alias; over the next two years, he released a new LP under his hip-hop-oriented Two Fingers moniker, the inaugural release from his folk-influenced Figueroa project, and the debut of still another new alias, Stone Giants. On <i>How Do You Live</i>, the ever-restless musician sounds reinvigorated by his recent rambles: His sound design as breathtaking as ever, he confidently strides far beyond the familiar hallmarks of past albums.<br />\n“How Do You Live” opens the record with a shape-shifting fusion of chamber strings, ambient atmospheres, and metal drumming; “Rise to Ashes” strikes up a conversation with The Beatles’ “Tomorrow Never Knows”; and “Sweet Inertia” (featuring Figueroa) slips further down the lysergic rabbit hole, acoustic guitars crumbling to digital dust as he plunges deeper. Tobin has always been a masterful shaper of textures, and his sounds have never been more vividly tactile than they are here. Throughout, it sounds like a battle is being waged between acoustic instruments—guitars, drums, strings—and the all-consuming digital maw, and the tension that results is truly awesome to behold. Somehow, Tobin has managed to apply the complexity of Autechre to the grooves of psychedelic rock, and the output sounds even more mind-bending than you’d expect. Tobin has always been in a class of his own, and that’s doubly true of <i>How Do You Live</i>: There’s simply no one else making music like this.","short":"The breakbeat maverick reinvents his sound from the ground up."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1573480671","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573480671?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/de/b0/8d/deb08dbe-41ad-063f-cd64-ea9415b9b199/5056321637642.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1400,"textColor3":"c6d7d6","textColor2":"d3e7dd","textColor4":"b9cdc5","textColor1":"e4f3f3","bgColor":"4e6864","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Proc Fiskal","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/siren-spine-sysex/1573480671","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"Siren Spine Sysex","recordLabel":"Hyperdub","upc":"5056321637642","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Hyperdub","playParams":{"id":"1573480671","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1569670233","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1569670233?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ad/54/ad/ad54adfb-4e15-0578-fc57-5dc68e2bd8c5/4062548027334.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":1500,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"e5b400","textColor4":"b79000","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Arp Frique","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-seed/1569670233","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-24","name":"The Seed","recordLabel":"Colorful World","upc":"4062548027334","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Colorful World","playParams":{"id":"1569670233","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1579924715","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1579924715?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/03/ed/2b/03ed2bfb-7811-5433-f850-98309a4a2991/4018939484132_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"dac7bd","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"dac7bd","textColor1":"e8e8e8","bgColor":"a44412","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Otik","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trifecta-ep/1579924715","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-17","name":"Trifecta - EP","recordLabel":"Club Qu Records","upc":"4018939484132","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Club Qu Records","playParams":{"id":"1579924715","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1446461244","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1446461244?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/3b/c0/cc/3bc0cc0f-d148-1a11-a57f-994ec1bfbaad/18UMGIM71754.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpeg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1c525","textColor2":"eb514e","textColor4":"c44648","textColor1":"fbf021","bgColor":"271a33","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Aida Garifullina, Toby Spence, Ludovic Tézier, Shanghai Spring Children’s Choir, Wiener Singakademie, Heinz Ferlesch, Shanghai Symphony Orchestra & Long Yu","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/orff-carmina-burana-live-from-the-forbidden-city/1446461244","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Modern Era","Oratorio"],"trackCount":27,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2019-01-18","name":"Orff: Carmina Burana (Live from the Forbidden City)","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948365975","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2019 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1446461244","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In October 2018, record label Deutsche Grammophon celebrated its 120th birthday by hosting a spectacular concert at Beijing’s Forbidden City (the first there since 1998) with their newly signed artists Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and maestro Long Yu. Top of the bill was a scintillating performance of Orff’s <i>Carmina Burana</i>, a work that surely matches the Forbidden City for its exotic color and boldness of ambition. The gathered forces don’t disappoint—Orff’s astonishing, often bawdy music is reinforced with a strong, focused chorus and soloists who add genuine drama. Soprano Aida Garifullina is utterly thrilling, while tenor Toby Spence’s roasting swan in “Olim lacus colueram” is deliciously sinister. The orchestral playing is big and bold.","short":"A bold performance that matches its majestic surroundings."},"isCompilation":false}}]}
