He could also mean their impending residency at a purpose-built arena in London in which all four members will perform as ABBAtars—painstakingly motion-captured renderings of their circa-1978 selves—with a live band, potentially until, or beyond, the collapse of civilization. But he’s actually referring to the fact that ABBA is releasing their first album of new music in 40 years, an event that bears little historical precedent. “I constantly have those moments when I think, ‘How the hell did this all happen? Why is it that suddenly on TikTok two million people are following what we are doing?’ It's weird. It's all weird.”<br />\nThis unlikely occurrence started becoming more likely around 2018 when Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson wrote two songs, the cheekily self-referential “I Still Have Faith in You” and “Don’t Shut Me Down,” for possible inclusion in the show, and approached their former partners, singers Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. “We asked the ladies and they were absolutely enthusiastic about going into the studio and trying their voices again,” Ulvaeus says. “And then after a while we thought, why not record a couple more? And there was absolutely nobody breathing down our necks.” The result is <i>Voyage</i>—nine new songs and one resurrected from their original incarnation, fitting for a project that renders the very notion of the passage of time meaningless. While ABBA's legacy is long since assured, their ABBAtars could revolutionize the prospects for artists looking to secure career options beyond this mortal coil. “The reason why it works is that we are still alive,” Ulvaeus says. “The cranium does not change over time. The rest of your body falls apart, but the cranium, they could take exact measurements, which they cannot with a video of Elvis. I bet you there are a lot of singers who will have these in a couple years. Everyone should have an ABBAtar.” Take a chance on these stories behind the songs on <i>Voyage</i> from Ulvaeus himself.<br />\n<b>\"I Still Have Faith in You\"</b>\n“When Benny played it to me, I thought, ‘This is really epic.’ It's about us and the bonds we have, about the loyalty we have to each other, and celebrating the fantastic career that we've gone through. Or haven't gone through—there's a lot left of it, as it seems—but there are more layers than that today in that lyric, but that I want the listener to find out by himself.”<br />\n<b>\"When You Danced With Me\"</b>\n“It's a bit Nordic, but maybe more Scottish and Irish. I lived in England for six years, between '84 and ’90, and I used to see these fairs that they had in the villages for the children. And that's what I saw before me when I heard the melody: a village fair, but somewhere in Ireland. It's about leavers and remainers. I grew up in a small town and I left it when I was 20. But somehow I'd come back to that little town and feel I have roots there.” <br />\n<b>\"Little Things\"</b>\n“Benny tells me he didn't think of it as a Christmas song, but I, the minute I heard it, I said it cannot be anything else. It is early, early Christmas morning. The stockings are hanging right there and then this couple wakes up. This could be played for Christmases to come. And that would be great, because we want to own Christmas <i>and</i> New Year's Eve, like with [1980’s] 'Happy New Year.'”<br />\n<b>\"Don't Shut Me Down\"</b>\n“At that time we were kind of getting the hang of what the ABBAtars would be. This is about a woman who has broken up and regrets breaking up. And she is going to come back and see if the guy will take her back. So she sits on a bench in a park and it gets dark. And finally she gets the courage up to go and knock on the door. That's it at face value, but I see it as us, as ABBAtars, knocking on the doors of the fans: Please take us as we are now and don't shut us down. It's a little flirt with the disco of the '70s, but other than that, I don't think that any of the old songs have had any impact on the new songs.”<br />\n<b>\"Just a Notion\"</b>\n“It's from '78 and it's never been released in its entirety before. There's been snippets on YouTube, but we thought it's a great song and it has very good vocals on it. Benny did a new backing track, so the band is new but the voices are old. And it illustrates in a way what we are doing in the ABBAtar concert in London, because we will have a live band but the original vocals.”<br />\n<b>\"I Can Be That Woman\"</b>\n“It's a country song, in essence. And a little gesture to the queen of country, as far as I'm concerned: Tammy Wynette. The good dog is called Tammy. There's a lot of stuff going into that song, but it's basically about someone who has come down from an addiction and finally come down into real life and is sorry about all the wasted years. But there's hope at the end of the tunnel: I can be that woman now. Only we know what is fact and what is fiction about our life experiences together. It's a kind of freedom that you get. With 70, you get that freedom.”<br />\n<b>\"Keep an Eye on Dan\"</b>\n“Dan is the little child; his two parents are divorced and he is being left with one parent. All of us who have been divorced know what it's like to leave that little kid and seeing how absorbed that little kid is with the other parent. And he waves, or she, and you stand there and you feel, 'Argh.' I find it interesting to explore things that happen in relationships that haven't been explored before. I don't think that this has.”<br />\n<b>\"Bumblebee\"</b>\n“I've always found bumblebees or squids as powerful symbols for what we might lose with climate change. It's a symbol of the loneliness we will feel when these creatures perhaps vanish because they cannot adapt.”<br /> \n<b>\"No Doubt About It\"</b>\n“I've known a few people who kind of flare up and can't help it, but then very quickly sort of get calm again and say, 'Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have said that.' So it is this woman, in that situation she is incensed with her husband, who is very calm. He knows, he just waits for it. And in the end it comes.”<br />\n<b>\"Ode to Freedom\"</b>\n“The concept of freedom is so intriguing and it's so different for different kinds of people. This song is so majestic. I could never say what my freedom is, because that would be received as, 'Oh, you can say that you are rich, you're famous. Da, da.' <i>This</i> is not my ode to freedom; it's about how if I ever wrote one, it would be simple. I don't know what it would be about, but I wish someone would write one.”","short":"Björn Ulvaeus on ABBA’s uncanny second life: “It's weird.

Recording sessions were tough: Thom Yorke had writer’s block, and his new commitment to electronic music—or, at least, a turn away from conventional rock—left some of his bandmates wondering about their function and purpose. As guitarist Ed O’Brien once put it, he was a guitarist faced with a bunch of tracks that had no guitar.<br />\nAt one point, producer Nigel Godrich split the band into two groups: one working with instruments in the main recording area, the other in a programming room processing sounds from next door, all under the condition that no acoustic instruments—guitars, drums, etc.—be used. The constraints opened doors: Not only did the band discover new ways of working (and, by extension, refresh their passion for music after years of unyielding pressure), but, in doing so, they shifted the template for what we think of when we think of a rock band, mixing the acoustic and the electronic (“Everything in Its Right Place,” “Like Spinning Plates”) and relatively straightforward tracks (“Optimistic,” “Pyramid Song”) with fragmentary, discursive ones (“Kid A,” “Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors”). <br />\nIn the outtakes, we get glimpses of the band’s past (the paranoiac folk of “Follow Me Around“) and future (the deconstructed, full-band sound of “If You Say the Word”), as well as versions of “Like Spinning Plates” and “Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors” that chart their evolution in real time. It’s a snapshot of a band taking step back from themselves and the way they worked, finding a way forward in the process.","short":"Two groundbreaking and career-defining albums, reissued as one."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ofEQubaL265rIW6WnCU8y"}},{"id":"1592212129","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592212129?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/c8/4b/c1/c84bc12d-3d14-cf2a-ecbf-37a3962474c0/194690653018_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"343d42","textColor2":"590209","textColor4":"7a343a","textColor1":"010c13","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":true},"artistName":"2 Chainz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/t-r-u-realigion-anniversary-edition/1592212129","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2011-11-01","name":"T.R.U.

And I think it kept me from writing for at least a year, just because I was scared. I make music because I love it, so it was really all about connecting with—for lack of a better analogy—my child self.”<br />\nMaking that connection was that much easier when Jordan found herself living with her parents again in suburban Maryland for five months, after the pandemic took hold in 2020. That’s where much of <i>Valentine</i> began to take shape, Jordan working alone in her childhood bedroom, free of distractions. Though bigger and bolder and more adventurous than its predecessor, the album is still deeply personal—indie rock that’s laced with reflections on time spent in and out of love and rehab. “Whether the actual time there was for better or for worse, it got good art out of me,” she says of being back home. “I just felt like I was just doing it for fun again, like when I was working on <i>Lush</i>, coming home from high school every day and writing for a while. I guess just sitting on that same carpet was pretty liberating for me.” Here, she guides us through the entire album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Valentine”</b>\n“I was shopping around ideas for the record long before there was one, just wanting to put a title to the thing to maybe give it a start—like if there's just an overarching vibe, then I can start to make things. It's such a heartbreaking thing, referring to someone as your valentine in a love-lost type of way, because I just think there's nothing more tender and innocent. I just think the hurt there is pretty relatable, and when I came up with ‘darling, valentine,’ it kicked me in the guts in a way that felt right for the entire thing. I just knew immediately that the record was going to be called <i>Valentine</i>.”<br />\n<b>“Ben Franklin”</b>\n“I've always been extremely self-assured, confident, and independent—especially doing this job at such a young age. And rehab just kicks that out of you in a way. You kind of have to get in touch with values in a way that is shocking. Even just in the pandemic I was like, ‘Okay, so now I need to be good at being a normal person, too.’ And that's different, and that’s not something I was so self-assured in. It was a big decision to want to just go and clean up, so that I could work again. I'm not cocky anymore. I'm dealing with what I left behind. It’s like, boom: real adulthood.”<br />\n<b>“Headlock”</b>\n“‘Headlock’ isn’t about losing someone so much as it is about really losing myself in a relationship. I worked on that one at my parents' house—all the synth lines I did in my room on my Minilogue, and I wrote all the lyrics sitting right there at my desk, just sort of dipping my toes into the deep darkness. With that line ‘Thought I'd see her when I died,’ I'm saying that the end goal of dying in this case would be to be reunited with this lost love. It came from a real dark spot that I was in.”<br />\n<b>“Light Blue”</b>\n“I wrote it for a girlfriend. It feels like I was young at the time—I was 19—and even though it wasn't that long ago, in a way it was. I guess I meant it to be a gesture, but also kind of a declaration. I don't remember it being a particular communicative relationship but it was fiery and I think that was my way of communicating my feelings at the time—and I think that comes through.”<br />\n<b>“Forever (Sailing)”</b>\n“That song was initially constructed from a sample of a song, ‘You and I’ by Madleen Kane. I heard it forever ago and I was just really moved—it has some magic that feels like I really feel. And I had never really dabbled in sampling, but I just couldn't stop thinking about being involved with the song somehow, selfishly. So I brought it to the studio in North Carolina and we isolated the sample and slowed it down. It's kind of a deep cut in a way, and random that I heard it. I don't know that much about disco at all.”<br />\n<b>“Madonna”</b>\n“I was raised Catholic and went to Sunday school. I was in the church band. And the song is about putting someone on a pedestal and worshiping them and how that just doesn't translate into anything but resentment and anger once you kind of step away from it. Using religious metaphors and my knowledge from that time of my life felt exciting and genuine. I have a deep fear of being blasphemous—I don't want to disappoint my mom.”<br />\n<b>“c. Et Al.”</b>\n“I spent a lot of time writing it in the van, actually, on tour. I had a little portable amp that hooks up to headphones and I would just play it in there because I don't like to come up with lyrics around other people. It's complex, because I’d be sitting in the van for eight hours a day or something.”<br />\n<b>“Glory”</b>\n“Very angry and upset vibes. And it's similar thematically to ‘Madonna,’ goes within the same grieving process and theme of anger. It's disenchanted as fuck. It’s like no matter how angry I am and no matter how much I try to make this something where I'm in control and I'm the one making demands, at the end of the day I still would do anything for the subject of the song. No matter how in control I feel, I don't even feel like I belong to myself because I'm so entwined in this person's life.”<br />\n<b>“Automate”</b>\n“I think that there comes a time when—through experience and through fucking up and learning about my needs and myself—love becomes less of a fantasy and less of a game. There’s so much that needs to exist for love to be healthy, and once you realize that relationships are more than what you imagined them to be as a teenager and as a kid, it just becomes a lot more loaded. Like love, real love, is unconditional in a perfect world, and it's loving somebody beyond the good stuff. Being in love with someone is taking them where they're at and having them take you where you're at, and that's the brutal truth being uncovered in that song: It’s not all about passion and fire.”<br />\n<b>“Mia”</b> \n“‘Mia’ is the only song with a full orchestra on it and the whole shebang. Originally, we sent the song to an arranger and they sent back some ideas. I wasn't crazy about the arrangement, so I played some of the arrangement myself on a synth and sent it back and was like, ‘Can I hear this?’ That synth line that got translated into an orchestral moment is one of my favorite parts of the song—it was super collaborative.”","short":"“I just felt like I was just doing it for fun again.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0zNWhYDalgisc4uweLIGZJ"}},{"id":"1591453620","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591453620?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/ed/9a/6a/ed9a6a4b-3413-4344-e104-1c032dc05906/4050538759983.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"8f89b3","textColor2":"9b9dd2","textColor4":"897fa9","textColor1":"a1aadf","bgColor":"440404","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Terrace Martin","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/drones/1591453620","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"DRONES","recordLabel":"BMG Rights Management (US) LLC","upc":"4050538759983","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sounds of Crenshaw, LLC under exclusive license to BMG Rights Management (US) LLC","playParams":{"id":"1591453620","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1cSZDrpp0lic8Y70I3JGUa"}},{"id":"1591107486","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591107486?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/f3/c8/3e/f3c83e4f-8b8a-0038-ceca-094b969b67ab/093624878216.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"322a24","textColor2":"151211","textColor4":"36302b","textColor1":"110b07","bgColor":"baa997","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dijon","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/absolutely/1591107486","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Absolutely","recordLabel":"R&R Digital/Warner Records","upc":"093624878216","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Dark Green, Dark Green, ℗ 2021 R&R Digital, LLC/Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1591107486","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4E691gbRgo2Zb6ToII2DWO"}},{"id":"1591302526","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591302526?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ac/76/fe/ac76fe04-1cce-512a-28aa-d5087f45a769/21UMGIM61686.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"4e4d4d","textColor2":"561f2d","textColor4":"784c57","textColor1":"212021","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"LANY","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gg-bb-xx-deluxe/1591302526","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"gg bb xx (deluxe)","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602445055869","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records Release;

But on my previous albums, I was talking about lots of different things, whereas I’m coming from the same place on a lot of these songs—I’m someone who’s a bit confused and feeling a limbo period in life.” The Middlesbrough-born singer-songwriter’s fourth album took root in spring 2020 after emergency gallbladder surgery had interrupted his European tour in January. Although he recovered to complete arena dates in the UK and Ireland, the pandemic soon raised the buffers again, leaving him feeling directionless at home and living with anxieties that COVID invoked in many of us. “My health problems had led to uncovering a few mental health issues again,” he says. “I was in a weird headspace. I’d say I was numb.” He eventually found purpose in his home studio in Surrey. There, he hunkered down for a prolific three-month period of songwriting. “I’ve got a bit of ADHD, so my attention span’s all over the place,” he says. “Music has always been a thing to focus me and wire me in. Once I’m in, my endurance is crazy. I can do it for hours on end. This album is the product of that. It’s me being like, ‘I’ve got to throw myself into this or I’m going to throw myself off a building,’ as dark as that might sound.”<br />\nHere, that cathartic creativity has been distilled into 14 songs that weave his reflections on life into a sound stretched and revitalized by his love of hip-hop, pop-punk, and post-hardcore. “I’m really grateful for this album,” he says. “It stabilized me and reinvigorated me. If you’re interested in where I’ve come from and where I’m going, this album is the most personal to me.” Let him take you through that journey, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Running Away”</b>\n“‘I wanna smoke ’til I can’t wake up.’ That was where I was at, back to self-medicating. Ever since I was young, I’ve had a tendency to hit these walls. Having done a bit of therapy, I realized that it was childhood trauma—pivotal moments in my life have meant I’ve kept hitting these walls. Therapy wasn’t working, smoking weed all night wasn’t working anymore. Then I called up my old friend music and it came and saved me once again—just getting in the studio, or picking up the guitar. I’m touching on some very honest thoughts, like, ‘I made a lot of bad decisions. I sang songs I didn’t believe in.’ Even the songs that I’ve written, I was writing them for other people, not for myself. But this album became one for me.”<br />\n<b>“Wolves”</b>\n“The trap percussion and that half-time guitar in the chorus is really impactful. That’s a bit of Taking Back Sunday mixed with Post Malone, I guess. It’s a cool indicator of what I’m trying to get across sonically with this album. I’m definitely giving some advice to my younger self, and to people that I’ve met that have struggled in the entertainment industry: ‘It’ll all make sense in the end.’ If I could say something to my younger self, it’d be, ‘Don’t worry too much. Don’t be so anxious. Just attack life and it’ll fall into place if you’re true to yourself.’”<br />\n<b>“Medicine”</b>\n“This one is love over adversity, looking for the positives in a dark time. I wrote it with Yami Bell, who’s a big part of this record. He really helped bring those trap vibes. And Red Triangle, the production team on this one. None of us had been in a room with anyone for months. So we all had this pent-up creative juice flowing in the room. That was glorious to do that again.” <br />\n<b>“September”</b>\n“One of the goals with this album was to maintain the classic songwriting that people might expect from me, that storytelling. But we wanted to dress it up a bit cooler. [The production here] is almost Springsteen vibes with the guitar. And the vocals are a bit raspier than normal. If you translate that onto an acoustic guitar and do a picky thing, it could be [previous hits] ‘Falling Like the Stars’ or ‘Say You Won’t Let Go,’ stuff that I’ve done before. I’m on my fourth album now. The last thing I want to be is predictable.”<br />\n<b>“Always”</b> \n“I got to a point with the songwriting where I was feeling like I should be putting my arm around other people who’ve been at the same place as me. And, again, almost putting my arm around a younger version of myself. I’ve had my life saved in a relationship and I’ve had someone be there for me and I’ve been very lucky in that sense. This is a cousin to ‘Medicine’ in that it’s celebrating people that have loved you.”<br />\n<b>“Emily”</b>\n“I came into the studio that day, and I was like, ‘Ah, having a kid is a real possibility at the minute.’ It didn’t work out, but at the time it was a real prospect and I was quite scared, actually. I was like, ‘What kind of dad will I be?’ And then, ‘Shit, what if they read some of the things? What if they see some of my behaviors from the past?’ I was a bit of a wreck back in the day. I want to be a really good dad and a role model. That provided me with a lot of material to work from. Emily was a name that I had always picked out for my possible daughter. You know you have those conversations with your missus? Emily Arthur sounded like a pretty cool name.”<br />\n<b>“Last of the Whiskey”</b>\n“I had a lot of fun with this one. It’s a real just stream of consciousness and an expressive piece. The production’s pretty sparse. It’s all about the vocal and the conversation. It really feels like that last wild night that you had with someone. It feels very visceral to me.”<br />\n<b>“Never Let You Go”</b>\n“This one came from the rear at the very end of the process. It was a really quick day with working with [songwriting/production team] TMS, who are like the biggest hitmakers in the UK. I wrote the song with Corey Sanders as well. He brings a kind of folksy vibe to the sessions. We got that chorus early on, and it was like, ‘OK, this might be an acoustic, folksy heartbreak song.’ But then I started doing this sort of hip-hop flow on the verses. It was the hardest one to put together, but it stands out because it’s quite experimental.”<br />\n<b>“4000 Miles”</b>\n“I did like coming from that angle of talking about people’s friends. There’s a bit of that on the album. People are so bothered about opinions these days and people validating them. I’ve never had that mindset. So I liked the honesty in those kind of lines [‘I don’t want to knock about with your placebo friends’]—they’re make believe as far as I’m concerned.”<br />\n<b>“Deja Vu”</b>\n“Shout-out to Ben Jones, who is one of the best guitarists in the world. I can’t take credit for that one. He absolutely nailed that. On a lot of these songs, the second verse is completely different to the first verse—you get this singer-songwriter first verse. And then the idea is how would a rapper or a trap artist approach the second verse? Travis Scott, Post Malone, or Young Thug. I approached it as though I was the feature on the record. That was really fun, so it opened up a lot of doors for me.”<br />\n<b>“Ride”</b>\n“It evokes a lot of imagery—cars, smoke, that kind of stuff. It’s probably the one that I’m doing the most rap on. Or you could say this is a <i>rap</i> verse. The other ones are rap verses, but they’re pop, lyrically. The punchlines aren’t too deep, they’re more focused on the flow and the melody. Whereas with this one, there’s a bit of a scheme to the rap. And I’m coming from quite a cold place. Drake was a bit of an inspiration for the first verse.”<br />\n<b>“Avalanche”</b>\n“We were in the session and I think I just sang the chorus—taking the piss, actually. And everyone was like, ‘Well, that’s good. Let’s build something around that.’ And it ended up being this sort of Goo Goo Dolls or Foo Fighters unplugged vibe. We toyed with making it more trap like the rest of the album, but it breaks things up a little in terms of the journey of the album.”<br />\n<b>“SOS”</b>\n“The chorus-melody and a lot of the lyrics just hit me and I just started singing them in the room. It was like, ‘How heavy can I make it?’ That’s all I wanted to do, make it as heavy as possible and make it feel authentic. It’s a song about somebody who was just broken, which is where I was in life. I felt a bit broken, a bit let down, a bit disappointed, a bit numb. It’s a song of surrender in a way.”<br />\n<b>“Take It or Leave It”</b>\n“I’m saying, ‘I’m broken. I feel like my doors are closing. I’m at the end, I’m even giving up on music in a way. I don’t even know if I want to play this game anymore. I don’t get the same thing that I used to get from it.’ And then the real confessional part of the song comes in the middle eight leading into the last chorus where I say, ‘It’ll all make sense in the end.’ It just felt like the perfect way to end the album. I want that line to creep up on you at the end and you’d feel those goosebumps when it comes in. You feel like, ‘Oh, OK, I get it all now.’ It resolves the journey and ends it in a quite organic way.”","short":"“I called up my old friend music and it came and saved me once again.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0P4xzdUBgd8cMncwM7okcd"}},{"id":"1578588480","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578588480?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/fa/7b/8f/fa7b8f66-da81-7cb4-a1a8-38ebb38f5c7b/21CRGIM28140.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"231e0e","textColor2":"1f1c07","textColor4":"3c3513","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b29844","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-future/1578588480","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Roots Rock","American Trad Rock"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"The Future","recordLabel":"Stax","upc":"00888072276819","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Stax Records, Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1578588480","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/48KAdMIRvmqIq7py0qw3rh"}},{"id":"1589514084","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589514084?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ef/14/4c/ef144c56-0274-fca3-dca8-03ad75d57f06/27316.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"4b4336","textColor2":"332619","textColor4":"554839","textColor1":"271f16","bgColor":"ddd3b8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"serpentwithfeet","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deacons-grove-ep/1589514084","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"DEACON'S Grove -

That’s cute. Trust us, you aren’t into Christmas the way Ingrid Michaelson is into Christmas. To mark the release of her first collection of traditional classics (plus one original), the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music about her love of the holiday season and the album she’s been waiting to make her whole life. In the spirit of giving for the holidays, this deluxe edition has five brand-new tracks, including a duet with Zooey Deschanel.<br />\n<b>I start listening to Christmas music in September.</b> I have almost all of my presents not only bought, but wrapped and hidden in the closet. People do get annoyed—they’re like, “It's not even Halloween.” Screw them, I can do what I want. I grew up in this big, old Victorian house, and we would have this awesome Christmas Eve party every year and the whole neighborhood would come. My father wrote Christmas carols. We’re not even religious—it was more just the joy of the season would overcome me.<br />\n<b>This is a dream I have multiple times every year:</b> It’s Christmas Day and I haven’t watched half of the Christmas movies I have to watch. Then I wake up and I’m like, “Oh, it’s only October, I have time.” I don't know what this is.<br />\n<b>I have my limits: If anyone tries to make Santa some sort of sex figure, I have a real issue with that. </b>So, “Santa Baby,” I don’t like that one. I hate when there’s Santa ornaments and he’s in a Hawaiian shirt with a fruity drink and sunglasses—that shit bugs me. Santa does not go on vacation in Aruba. He’s a mythical creature that lives in some mythical place in the North Pole and he’s cold all the time.<br />\n<b>I want this record to be in someone’s arsenal.</b> My go-to is the Charlie Brown Christmas record—I put it on while I’m cooking, just doing anything. That’s what I want—to be in somebody’s top five. I’m not interested in creating a pop record—I wanted to do something that isn’t gonna go sour in 30 years.<br />\n<b>I wanted to put a Christmas record out every year of my existence.</b> It took me this long. Does it coincide with the fact that, yes, we all need some warmth, and some joy, and something that reminds us of a happy time? Yeah, totally.<br />\n<b>My favorite is “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”</b> This is very Ingrid Michaelson, because I love songs that are happy and sad at the same time. “Through the years we all will be together if the Fates allow”—you know the Fates aren’t gonna allow it. I sang that song through my mother’s sickness, through her getting better, through her dying. I sang it through my dad’s sickness, through my dad dying.

Oh, and did we mention it’s a concept record based on the circular nature of life? And that it’s inspired by Parcels’ experiences while writing in a forest on the east coast of Australia at the start of 2020, when catastrophic bushfires were followed weeks later by horrific floods? So far, so bold. Musically, there are elements common to <i>Day/Night</i> and the band’s self-titled 2018 debut—the Daft Punk-esque smooth funk of “Somethinggreater” and the sweeping ’70s disco-soul of “Famous” and “Free”—but <i>Day/Night</i> is also a more introspective proposition (“Thefear,” “Nightwalk”). The swooning strings that envelop much of the album add a cinematic flair, which is fitting given that the band approached the album as though they were soundtracking a movie. Whittled down from more than 150 demos, <i>Day</i> is a lighter, softer side to <i>Night’s</i> deeper, darker tones, but they combine to make an album that is bursting with ambition and creativity, life-affirming upbeat moments and inward-looking solitude.","short":"The Berlin-based Aussies go big on a concept double album."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2FJj7NVoRCAwjFus0O1BXd"}},{"id":"1592272130","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592272130?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/3a/ca/04/3aca04cf-966e-aa58-ef7c-6b69c7efb7ea/8809704423427_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"c0bfc0","textColor2":"d1ced2","textColor4":"acaaad","textColor1":"ebe8ea","bgColor":"17181a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"TO1","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/re-alize/1592272130","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-04","name":"RE:ALIZE","recordLabel":"Genie Music","upc":"8809704423427","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 WAKEONE","playParams":{"id":"1592272130","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The K-pop high-flyers come into their own on a second mini album."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3uHB6cLFlt4u4M6HTbSLfy"}},{"id":"1592368004","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592368004?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ba/07/49/ba0749fc-4527-8b83-88df-57fa245d3f88/21UM1IM31098.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"22343d","textColor2":"540a0d","textColor4":"5b323b","textColor1":"0c0d0f","bgColor":"7acff4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"VeggieTales","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fruit-of-the-spirit-songs/1592368004","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Fruit Of The Spirit Songs","recordLabel":"Big Idea Entertainment Inc","upc":"00820413512569","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Big Idea Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1592368004","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3XRx77bwaJCQEtMm8HyHbe"}},{"id":"1592779625","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592779625?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/ea/85/eb/ea85ebee-72ca-8115-c7b0-cc32cf8eb529/Rezz-Rocks-3-IG-Friday.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"cdd1d4","textColor2":"edb92c","textColor4":"c09a2c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"091d29","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rezz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rezz-rocks-sep-3-2021-dj-mix/1592779625","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Bass","Music","Electronic"],"trackCount":47,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-09-03","name":"Rezz Rocks, Sep 3, 2021 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381818777","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1592779625","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1586225592","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586225592?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/90/80/0f/90800f5d-8ce8-20e7-1d92-b2a70da0e1fe/5056167167112_1.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bbd6d9","textColor2":"e5d58c","textColor4":"b7be92","textColor1":"eaf2e5","bgColor":"0062ac","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Serena Isioma","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crying-in-the-club-ep/1586225592","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-03","name":"Crying In the Club -

There are little sparks of joy when you feel the wind increasing, but the storm also brings with it all these heavy emotions, darkness, and melancholia.” On <i>Bylur</i>, most of which was recorded in Reykjavík in July 2020, Evensen explores that roller-coaster of emotions against beautifully scored, soulful music. “Midnight Moon,” featuring stunning vocals from Icelandic singer GDRN, explores the links between the beauty and power of the Icelandic landscape and the overwhelming feelings of being in love, while “The Northern Sky” is a homage to Iceland’s night sky, written while the composer was thousands of miles away in New York. “I missed the stars and mountains in New York,” says Evensen. “Even the clouds felt different.”<br />\nIceland’s long, dark winters gave her plenty of time to play the piano. “My parents are big music lovers and I started taking lessons when I was six, and composed my first piece when I was seven,” says Evensen. “By the age of 12 or 13, I’d composed maybe seven or eight pieces.” You’ll find two of them—“Deep Under” and “Vetur Genginn í Garð”—here, as well as an exploration of what came next for the pianist. At 19, Evensen left Iceland for London (and then New York) as she pursued a career in modeling and the chance to travel the world. Eventually, she needed a change and, by 2020, she returned to Reykjavík. <i>Bylur</i> is, then, laced with a sense of homecoming as Evensen charts her emotional journey back to the dark, wild, and comforting storms of her childhood. “The idea of returning home inspired my music when I was abroad,” she adds. “I always felt all these emotions, like a snowstorm, that would take me back to Iceland.” Read on as Evensen takes us through her engaging debut, one track at a time. \n<b>Deep Under</b>\n“I composed the first part of ‘Deep Under’ when I was 12, and finished the latter half of it in New York a few years ago. The initial concept of the first part was heaviness and dark emotions. I’d just moved from Blönduós to Reykjavík, so I was feeling a bit challenged by starting a completely new life. I felt a bit confused, and that’s the initial feeling of that piece. But then it takes you to a flowy state, like ocean waves. It’s a resolution to the emotions I was feeling when I started composing it 15 years ago.”<br />\n<b>Dagdraumur</b>\n“‘Dagdraumur’ translates as ‘Daydream.’ The initial idea came after a dear family friend passed away. She was a huge inspiration for me musically, and it was a challenging moment for the family. I didn’t really know how to have this conversation about this family member with everybody, and I remember sitting down amongst all this confusion, with all these emotions. ‘Dagdraumur’ is initially in an irregular 7/8 rhythm, because the death threw me off a lot. But then, later, the track levels off and there’s an acceptance, and a respect for what the person meant to us.”<br />\n<b>The Northern Sky</b>\n“This track is about the vast concept of the northern sky and about just how much incredible beauty there was growing up in the north of Iceland. I remember being a kid, and it would be dark, and I would just sit outside in the snow and observe the stars for hours. So this track is this feeling of the magic that surrounded my home and my hometown.”<br />\n<b>Wandering I</b>\n“‘Wandering I’ relates to the emotions I felt as I traveled in my work as a model during the last seven years. I was living out of a suitcase, sometimes traveling every two days or every week to a different city and shooting in different locations. This piece is about this continuous journey that I’ve been on, just wandering around the world.”<br />\n<b>Vetur Genginn í Garð</b>\n“The title of this song translates as ‘Winter Has Arrived.’ I love the winter; it’s definitely my favorite season. This piece emerged from something I composed when I was seven. I was going through a very challenging time in my life, which was why I started to compose—to get all these emotions out that I couldn’t put into words. It starts in D minor, and is very held back and intimate, but then it shifts into a major key, like a resolution, a reassurance that it’s OK to feel how I did. It made me feel that it was OK for me to go through that life event, because it brought me the beauty of being able to compose.”<br />\n<b>Fyrir Mikael</b>\n“This means ‘For Michael.’ Mikael is my little nephew. He’s eight years old and has been diagnosed with Louis-Bar Syndrome. We found out that he doesn’t have many years left. It’s scored for piano and string quartet. I wanted to capture his life essence, as he’s the happiest kid I know. The piece starts in this upbeat way, full of life, always smiling. It then takes you into a minor key, demonstrating how hard it was for us to find out about his illness, how life is unfair in many ways. It then moves back into the major, with a message that we have to make the most out of the time with our loved ones.”<br />\n<b>Wandering II</b>\n“‘Wandering II’ is the second chapter of wandering about the world. The route I took had to be taken by myself and the piano. That was what kept me grounded—being able to compose and write.”<br />\n<b>Circulation</b>\n“‘Circulation’ is the only piece on the album without a piano and is scored for string septet. When I composed it, I was out and about in New York City, feeling a bit unsettled because the energy there is so tense. So I just went back home, and I couldn’t get this specific rhythm out of my head. It came out very naturally, this circulation of emotions without any feeling of stability. Again, the piece moves into the major as well, which brings a brief positive element to the chaos.”<br /> \n<b>Innsti Kjarni og Tilbrigði</b>\n“The best way to translate ‘Innsti Kjarni og Tilbrigði’ is ‘The Innermost Core.’ It represents my innermost feelings. Firstly, the initial parts of being in love and embracing all of life’s beauty. Later, the piece moves into the minor, reflecting how daily life can affect us negatively. It’s all of these positive and negative emotions that we carry within.”<br />\n<b>Næturdögg</b>\n“I composed this piece when I was living in Cape Town, around six years ago. I was just feeling a bit down. I had a realization that I needed to change some aspects of my life.”<br />\n<b>Midnight Moon [with GDRN and Hrafnhildur Marta Guðmundsdóttir]\t\n</b>\n“I’m so fortunate that I was able to work with [Icelandic vocalist] GDRN. She’s an incredible singer. This piece—for piano, quartet, and voice—started out as a poem I wrote in Icelandic in a café in Midtown Manhattan. It’s about the emotions of being in love and everything that comes with that. I’ve been writing a lot of poems throughout the last years, but I couldn’t put this one aside. So I started writing music to it, and the whole piece came out really naturally.”<br />\n<b>Brotin</b>\n“‘Brotin’ [‘Broken’] is the last piece I composed for the album, when I had just moved back to Iceland and was feeling very emotionally broken. It’s a piece that demonstrates my most vulnerable state of being. I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to include it, because it wasn’t ready a week before the recording. But it came together as I was improvising in the studio five days beforehand.”<br />\n<b>Bylur</b>\n“I felt that leading up to ‘Bylur’ would be the right thing to do. I wrote it for string quartet, double bass, and brass, and it’s the most powerful piece on the album—everything leads up to this powerful moment. ‘Bylur’ stands for anything in a snowstorm can be beautiful. It’s a track at the end of an album that expresses all of my emotions, all the positivity that I’ve gone through, all the negative realizations and personal growth.”","short":"The Icelandic composer and pianist talks us through her engaging debut.\n"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1qNi4PwUQTGAJxDFABvGw7"}},{"id":"1584977741","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584977741?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/99/cc/31/99cc31d6-f4e1-46c6-92ca-71823f2ae7d8/5056467316838_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"b9cdc6","textColor2":"75f5b5","textColor4":"5ed89d","textColor1":"e8e8e8","bgColor":"00643e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ricky Force & Basic Rhythm","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fr001-ep/1584977741","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Jungle/Drum'n'bass","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Fr001 - EP","recordLabel":"Future Retro London","upc":"5056467316838","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Future Retro London","playParams":{"id":"1584977741","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1587078312","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587078312?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/64/84/8c/64848c17-0adb-4d6d-1523-8ae70c46a5ca/729337710221.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d2733","textColor2":"110e15","textColor4":"2c2935","textColor1":"120c12","bgColor":"9995b6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"R.

After all, a muse is often a person who can kindle the very best in someone. As part of one of the world’s most gifted musical families, Isata and Sheku have been performing together since they were very young—and have long been raising each other to new heights. “Most of the repertoire that I’ve played for cello and piano has always been with Isata,” says Sheku. “It’s been a great inspiration to be able to play with Isata for so many years.” “We know each other’s playing very well,” adds Isata, “so there’s an element of trust. Of course, we need to work together on the music and the detail, but there’s no awkward bumpiness with the playing.”<br />\nThe music on this thrilling album—Sheku and Isata’s debut as a duo—showcases the piano as much as it does the cello. Hardly surprising in the case of Russian composer Rachmaninoff, who was arguably the finest pianist of the 20th century. The Barber sonata here, meanwhile, surely owes its heart-on-sleeve romanticism and irresistible vitality to the fact that it was written by the 21-year-old US composer while still at music college in New York. “We looked through a lot of Rachmaninoff and Barber songs, and all of them seemed to work well on the cello,” agrees Sheku. “It was just a case of picking our favorite ones and also having a variety of character and styles.” Read on as the siblings share their thoughts on those favorites.<br />\n<b>Cello Sonata, Op. 6</b>\nSheku Kanneh-Mason: “The sonata isn’t actually that long, but it feels like there’s so much detail packed into it. There’s never a second where there’s no drama happening. It’s always traveling somewhere or approaching a climax. But the climaxes themselves never last for very long—they grow and come down again very quickly. Barber is very inventive and distinct harmonically, and in the middle of the second movement he experiments with intricate rhythms and notes. But then he has these wonderful romantic melodies, too.”<br />\n<b>Songs by Samuel Barber</b>\nIKM: “We didn’t know these pieces until we started searching for songs to go on this album, so they’re new to us and they’re so beautiful. What I like about them is that they’re very, very short. But Barber depicts the character of each of them immediately. He doesn’t need more than two or three minutes to paint an entire world. We read the lyrics and really tried to bring that feeling to the songs, even though we obviously don’t have a voice. So, for ‘Sure on this Shining Night, Op. 13 No. 3,’ the lyrics are expressing a deep love and appreciation of nature. You can hear that in the long, repeated chords in the piano. It sounds very ‘open plan.’ The sustained notes in the cello give the whole thing a very reverent feel.”<br />\n<b>Songs by Sergei Rachmaninoff</b>\nIKM: “The Rachmaninoff songs are so incredibly poetic—the English translation can’t do it justice! Particularly in ‘The Muse,’ which became the album’s title, the emotion is so vivid that you almost don’t really need to know what it’s about. Rachmaninoff’s use of harmony in that song, in particular, is really incredible. The chords that he’ll transition between is something that you don’t hear anywhere else. It’s very unexpected, but it really works. And there’s a very nostalgic feeling to the song, too.”\nSKM: “These songs are so rich and so expansive. ‘The Muse’ is so dreamlike in the way it starts with the rippling piano. It’s like you’re entering a dreamworld. But it ends in the same way, so you go through this amazing journey in this incredibly detailed and rich world, and then you just end it, almost as if nothing has happened.”<br />\n<b>Cello Sonata in G Minor, Op. 19</b>\nIKM: “The Rachmaninoff was one of my biggest inspirations growing up. Sheku and I have known it since our childhood, and it’s always been the piece of chamber music I most wanted to play, in terms of cello and piano sonatas. I remember the first couple of times I performed it, though, I always felt like I needed a long break after every single movement because each one is like a symphony when it comes to the emotion and the musical content, but also in terms of the technical demands on each instrument. And then, at the same time, it’s such a beautiful piece of music. It’s instantly accessible, but the closer you step to the music, the more detail there is to find. We thought we knew the piece very well before we started playing it.

It’s one of cellists’ favorite things to be able to play. For us, the second movement was the one that we really, really enjoyed playing together. It’s very vivid in terms of the image that it paints.”\n","short":"“The whole album is full of great music which has really inspired us.” "},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0n1et7GVue0KMLx5NFAgwq"}},{"id":"1584977983","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584977983?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/8e/82/d9/8e82d9d6-0922-160d-7bc9-5c9cd1353869/5056467316821_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"ccd1d9","textColor2":"eaeef9","textColor4":"bcc4d5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"041b44","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Various Artists","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/swrfr001-ep/1584977983","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Jungle/Drum'n'bass","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Swrfr001 - EP","recordLabel":"Scientific Wax / Future Retro London","upc":"5056467316821","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Scientific Wax, Future Retro London","playParams":{"id":"1584977983","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578941595","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578941595?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9a/4e/cf/9a4ecf2a-8fb4-dfc9-ebfe-960c25330f7a/25445.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3a091","textColor2":"faaa93","textColor4":"d18c78","textColor1":"fcc4b2","bgColor":"2e130c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Hana Vu","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/public-storage/1578941595","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Public Storage","recordLabel":"Ghostly International","upc":"804297838601","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Ghostly International","playParams":{"id":"1578941595","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Stories and memories pile up in an insightful alt-pop chronicle."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/31NBYL6BkDpHgYK7cWl32S"}},{"id":"1587045465","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587045465?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ec/30/7e/ec307eab-e2c8-ae77-4d26-ddc71c466b9f/8718723185516.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"122f3e","textColor2":"161614","textColor4":"122f3c","textColor1":"161615","bgColor":"0292e0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Helix","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hi-dyanmik-range-ep/1587045465","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Hi Dyanmik Range - EP","recordLabel":"Night Slugs","upc":"8718723185516","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Night Slugs","playParams":{"id":"1587045465","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1574796298","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1574796298?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/0c/ab/ff/0cabff25-e7f8-4922-0317-c995596f9fab/887828049165.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6c1b7","textColor2":"e8dfb6","textColor4":"bcb493","textColor1":"f6f0e3","bgColor":"090909","hasP3":false},"artistName":"HARD FEELINGS","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hard-feelings/1574796298","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"HARD FEELINGS","recordLabel":"Domino Recording Co","upc":"887828049165","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Domino Recording Co Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1574796298","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/54EERzhu1DlpfD8pr1NgYL"}},{"id":"1589002518","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589002518?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/b5/90/95/b59095c9-a516-9507-20ec-090e7ed593d0/21UM1IM17429.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbd0c5","textColor2":"f8efe8","textColor4":"c8c4b9","textColor1":"fdfff7","bgColor":"071901","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kito","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blossom/1589002518","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Blossom","recordLabel":"Astralwerks","upc":"00602438943999","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Astralwerks;

The composer and conductor wrote what is probably his most popular piece, “Shepherd’s Pipe Carol,” while still an 18-year-old undergraduate at Cambridge—and he has never looked back. “Once I started writing carols, somehow it seemed difficult to stop,” Rutter tells Apple Music. “I’ve been doing it ever since.” Realizing that he had a “backlog” of them led him to <i>I Sing of a Maiden</i>, an EP of five new pieces recorded in July 2021. “I’m asked, ‘Do you still enjoy Christmas?’ And actually, I sincerely do,” says Rutter. “Christmas carols are a resilient form of art—folk art, as I’ve often suggested—that have attracted some extraordinarily fine composers. They were adding their little tile to a centuries-old mosaic of devotion, praise, joy, prayer, and celebration. It all makes up that extraordinary season of the year that we call Christmas.” Each of the five songs contains its own story, which Rutter is happy to recount in this warming track-by-track guide.<br />\n<b>“Es ist ein Ros’ entsprungen”</b>\n“This is almost, I think, my favorite carol melody and the words, on the theme of the Virgin Mary, are beautiful too. It’s been set many, many times, but I was asked to contribute a setting of it for my friends The King’s Singers, who I’ve known in all their various memberships for a great many years. They were due to make an album with Albrecht Mayer, who’s the principal oboe of the Berlin Philharmonic. I thought I would write something a little more thoughtful, a little more reflective. I love the oboe—it was the instrument I was advised to take up when I had gone as far as I could with the recorder. (I knew, even though I was only 12, that I would have all the makings of a really atrocious oboe player!) And I couldn’t have been more pleased with John Roberts, who is the young principal oboist of the Royal Philharmonic. He had to postpone his wedding to be at the recording session, so I’m deeply honored and very grateful to his now wife.”<br />\n<b>“I Sing of a Maiden”</b> \n“‘I Sing of a Maiden’ is, for me, perhaps the loveliest of all the medieval English lyrics about the Virgin Mary. It’s so simple, so touching, and that’s why composers have all been attracted to it. When you say, ‘I’m going to have a go at it,’ you forget about all the other settings and say, ‘Well, today, I’m just going to look at those words as if for the first time.’ And I hope I will not be compared with any of the illustrious composers who’ve ever said those words before.”<br />\n<b>“Joseph’s Carol”</b> \n“It was written last year [2020] when we were just briefly released from lockdown at the beginning of December. I was asked by [conductor and pianist] Marios Papadopoulos and the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra to contribute to a musical tribute to the Oxford vaccine team. He said, ‘This is going to be a Christmas gift to these people who are toiling away, saving the world behind the scenes. And here in their own city of Oxford, it would be nice to honor them.’”<br />\n<b>“Christ Our Emmanuel”</b>\n“‘Christ Our Emmanuel’ actually started life as a piece for harp, ‘Lullaby for Ana Gwen,’ which I wrote as part of an album with a wonderful harpist friend of mine, Catrin Finch. She had two enchanting little daughters and said, ‘They would love it if you’d write a lullaby, one for each of them.’ And so, this was a lullaby for one of the two. It was actually a German choir director friend of mine called Nicol Matt who said, ‘John, I can just hear that as a Christmas carol. Could you write words to it and turn it into a carol?’ So, that’s how ‘Christ Our Emmanuel’ came about, simple as that.”<br />\n<b>“Suzi’s Carol”</b> \n“[British conductor] Suzi Digby has been a great force for good in the musical, and particularly the choral, world for many years now. And among her inventions is ORA, which is a wonderful chamber choir that has been commissioning all kinds of music from all kinds of composers. I have been a friend for years, and she said, ‘Oh, go on. I know everybody wants you to do Christmas carols, but would you do just one more for me?’ Of course, I couldn’t refuse, but I couldn’t think what to call it and that’s why I called it ‘Suzi’s Carol.’ I suppose knowing that I would have a professional choir—and a very excellent one—to sing it didn’t encourage me so much to make it more difficult technically, but perhaps more refined. Great refinement of blend and expression is something that a professional group can do easily, because they’re not worrying about getting the notes right.”\n","short":"“Once I started writing carols, somehow it seemed difficult to stop.”"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1585439586","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585439586?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/e5/32/83/e5328344-8c2d-0d4a-5e40-3ca1f5c5e319/26801.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"4b4b4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Chrisman","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ku-mwezi-ep/1585439586","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Ku Mwezi - EP","recordLabel":"Hakuna Kulala","upc":"742521170182","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Hakuna Kulala","playParams":{"id":"1585439586","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1578334467","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1578334467?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/6b/f8/e9/6bf8e948-b1f6-c754-3c43-0f90ee922f71/21UMGIM66362.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"cecdce","textColor2":"de894a","textColor4":"b46f3d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0c0a0b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Connan Mockasin","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jassbusters-two/1578334467","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Jassbusters Two","recordLabel":"Mexican Summer","upc":"00184923128864","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Mexican Summer, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1578334467","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4C1MZdJpmS1ffH8BWxtFiv"}},{"id":"1588956376","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588956376?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/2b/ac/c6/2bacc60c-5abc-b214-08c7-c076dee20466/8718723186421.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5e1e5","textColor2":"47f0c2","textColor4":"42d5b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"306a80","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jovonn","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/indoors-ep/1588956376","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"Indoors - EP","recordLabel":"Body'N Deep","upc":"8718723186421","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Body N'Deep","playParams":{"id":"1588956376","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
