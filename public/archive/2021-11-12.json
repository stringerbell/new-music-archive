And to take that away from guys like us, that's all we know. So we're thinking, all right, let's put an album together that sounds like a show.”<br />\nIt began with the project’s lead single, “Leave the Door Open,” a syrupy-sweet piece of retro soul that Mars considers something of a backbone for the project. After its completion, he and .Paak began building out the nine songs of <i>An Evening With Silk Sonic</i>, soliciting help, in the few instances where they needed it, from friends like Bootsy Collins, Thundercat, and even Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds. Their access to HOF-worthy firepower notwithstanding, the pair always understood that their own combined musicality was the real draw. “We just wanted it to feel special,” Mars says. “Instead of trying to get too cute with the concept, it's like, what's more special than Anderson .Paak behind a drum set singing a song and me having his back when it's my turn, you know? And the band moving in the same direction? It was just like a musician's dream.” Below, the pair talk through some of the tracks that make <i>An Evening With Silk Sonic</i> an experience fans won’t soon forget. <br />\n<b>“Leave the Door Open”</b>\nBruno Mars: “Me and Andy come from the school of performing and playing live instruments. We wrote ‘Leave the Door Open’ and it was just one of those songs like, dang, I can’t believe we a part of this, and we don't know what it's gonna do, we don't care that it's a ballad or a whatever you wanna call it—to us, this just feels right and it's important. So no matter what, if it hit No. 1 or it didn't, me and Andy both know that that was the best we could do. And we were cool with that.”<br />\n<b>“Fly as Me”</b>\nAnderson .Paak: “‘Fly as Me’ is a joint hook [Mars] had for a minute. He was trying to figure out some verses for it, trying to figure out the groove, and we spent some time on that.”\nMars: “Andy goes behind the drum set one day and says, ‘The groove gotta be like this,’ and starts playing his groove. D’Mile is on the bass, I'm on the guitar. After all the grooves we tried, I don't know what it is, there's something about someone in the studio, someone that you trust, saying, 'It's gotta be like this.’ And the groove you hear him playing, which is not an easy groove to play, was what he showed me and D. And we just followed suit.”<br />\n<b>“After Last Night” (with Thundercat & Bootsy Collins)</b>\nMars: “That one got a lot of Bootsy on it. And my boy Thundercat came in and blessed us. It’s just one of them songs—everything was built to be played live, so that song is one of those we can keep going for 10 minutes.”<br />\n<b>“Smokin Out the Window”</b>\nMars: “‘Smokin Out the Window’ was an idea we started four or five years ago on tour. It didn't sound nothing like how it does now, but we just had the idea. On [.Paak’s] birthday, I called him over. He was hysterical that night. After every take he was like, 'I'm the king of R&B! I’m the best! Tell me I’m not the hottest in the game!' We were going back and forth with the lines and who can make who laugh, and we end up finishing that song and he was like, 'I’m out, what we doing tomorrow?'”<br />\n<b>“Put On a Smile”</b>\nMars: “I had a song that I played for Andy and I said, ‘What do you think about this?’ and he said, ‘It sucks.’ I start singing it again and he gets behind the drums and that's when the magic happens. So we come up with this hook and these chords and that's when we start cooking, when everything starts moving in the studio. The song's starting to sound real good now. I don’t wanna mess it up, so I call Babyface. I only call Face to know if I got something good, you know, ’cause he’ll tell me too, 'This is wack.' For all of us to finish that record together, that was one of my favorite experiences on this album.”<br />\n<b>“Skate”</b>\nMars: “It's hard to be mad on some rollerskates. So really, that's kinda the essence of this album: If me and Andy were to host a party, what would that feel like? Summertime. Outside. Set up the congas and the drums and amplifiers, and what would that sound like? And this is what our best effort was: 'Skate.'”","short":"“If me and Andy were to host a party, what would that feel like?”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0r2RFucaW9kVjBtcBOV1"}},{"id":"1590368448","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590368448?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/15/38/9b/15389bf4-8074-06c3-11ee-655b5453af68/21UM1IM25046.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7ac94","textColor2":"d9ba9e","textColor4":"b69880","textColor1":"dad2b6","bgColor":"2c140a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Taylor Swift","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-taylors-version-a-message-from-taylor/1590368448","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":31,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Red (Taylor’s Version) (+ A Message From Taylor)","recordLabel":"Taylor Swift","upc":"00602445068036","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Taylor Swift","playParams":{"id":"1590368448","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After rerecording her 2008 album <i>Fearless</i> as part of a sweeping effort to regain control of her master tapes—or at least create new ones—Taylor Swift presents <i>Red (Taylor’s Version)</i>, an expanded take on her 2012 blockbuster that features nine never-before-released songs written in the same era as the original.<br />\n“Musically and lyrically, <i>Red</i> resembled a heartbroken person,” she wrote in a letter to fans. “It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I’m not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.”<br />\nThe hot-blooded breakup anthems you know and love are still there (“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “I Knew You Were Trouble” are two), but the new, full collection paints an even richer portrait of heartbreak. She wrestles with change on “Nothing New,” an alt-rock duet with Phoebe Bridgers; contemplates fate on a wistful pop song produced by Max Martin and Shellback (“Message in a Bottle”); and gets the final, piercing word on “I Bet You Think About Me” featuring Chris Stapleton, penned after a high-profile breakup in 2011. Longtime fans will be especially glad to see an extended cut of “All Too Well,” the project’s emotional centerpiece. It features new production from hitmaker Jack Antonoff, but Swift’s original lyrical genius is still remarkable. “And you call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest,” she sings. It’s the line she’s always said she’s most proud of from this album and era. Ten years on, it still cuts deep.","short":"Featuring nine never-before-released tracks in immersive Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1584827718","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584827718?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/af/56/0e/af560ebb-d38b-5d9b-e62f-8caefd6071d2/4050538719116.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"563d1e","textColor2":"3f190d","textColor4":"603c27","textColor1":"341b02","bgColor":"e1c88f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jason Aldean","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/macon/1584827718","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"MACON","recordLabel":"Broken Bow Records","upc":"4050538719116","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Macon Music, LLC under exclusive license to This Is Hit, Inc. d/b/a Broken Bow Records","playParams":{"id":"1584827718","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Jason Aldean’s Georgia roots run deep, so much so the country superstar titled his 10th studio album after his Peach State hometown, Macon, citing R.E.M., Trisha Yearwood, James Brown, and Otis Redding as artists whose careers have influenced his. “Between Macon and Atlanta, it was just like this melting pot of all this different kind of music that was coming in there,” Aldean tells Apple Music. “Growing up, you're kind of exposed to all that stuff, and it's just cool. It gives you an appreciation for all these different kinds of music.” Though its title references a musical melting pot, <i>MACON</i> is Aldean’s muscular take on pop-country through and through, with festival-ready party songs and heartfelt ballads cozying up to one another. Carrie Underwood joins Aldean on “If I Didn’t Love You,” Aldean’s 26th No. 1 country hit and one of his fastest-charting singles. Aldean rounds out the project with a handful of live tracks, including performances of his smash hits “My Kinda Party” and “Big Green Tractor.” Below, Aldean shares insight into a few of <i>MACON</i>’s key tracks.<br />\n<b>“Small Town Small”</b>\n“I was driving in my truck one day and I got a call from Brantley Gilbert. And he kind of does that every time we go in the studio, he'll call me up and send me some songs. And it's worked out really well in the past with ‘My Kinda Party’ and ‘Dirt Road Anthem’ and some of those. ‘Small Town Small’ was one of them. I just loved what it was saying. It just felt kind of patriotic, and a lot of stuff it was talking about was really relevant to right now, to me, and just kind of struck me in a certain way that I was like, ‘Man, I really want to say that, what that song's saying.’”<br />\n<b>“If I Didn’t Love You” (feat. Carrie Underwood)</b>\n“This song's moved [up the charts], I think, quicker than any song I've ever had. I felt like this song was something special, but you just never really know until you get it out there and get the reaction from everybody. The way it happened was so weird and just happened so quick. It was written, we went in a couple days later and tracked it, got it to Carrie. She loved it. I threw a vocal on it. And then a few days later we were cutting her vocal, and a couple weeks later it was at radio.”<br />\n<b>“Watching You Love Me”</b>\n“It's really bluesy and just melodically really cool. And it's a style that I've kind of dabbled in a little bit over the years with some things. Neil Thrasher, one of the writers on that song, is one of my favorite people in town, favorite writers. When he started singing the melody, I was just like, ‘Man, this is really cool.’ And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier when I was talking about all the influences from where I'm from. This to me is where I pull from like the Otis Reddings and those guys, to come in and do this kind of stuff.”","short":"On his 10th album, a tribute to his Peach State roots and influences."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2cydSJJLXu2TtP9VoOnGn4"}},{"id":"1575561183","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1575561183?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c1/1b/f8/c11bf85a-0e4a-77ee-77ae-0647dec973b7/21UMGIM39677.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"abb5ba","textColor2":"d89d7c","textColor4":"b18267","textColor1":"d1dde4","bgColor":"141613","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Holly Humberstone","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-walls-are-way-too-thin-ep/1575561183","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"The Walls Are Way Too Thin - EP","recordLabel":"Polydor Records","upc":"00602438297252","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Polydor Records / Darkroom / Interscope Release; ℗ 2021 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1575561183","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In late 2019, Holly Humberstone left her beloved family home in Lincolnshire and moved to a dingy flat in London. “All the walls were completely damp, the fridge was full of mold, there were mattresses with full-on nasty stains on them, and there was broken glass all over the floor,” the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “It was the worst thing possible. And I was like, ‘What have I done?’” Such grim surroundings inspired the title of <i>The Walls Are Way Too Thin</i>, but also forced Humberstone to escape, shuttling each weekend to visit friends studying in Nottingham, Newcastle, and Manchester. Then, as she journeyed back to the capital after nights out, she’d start writing. “I seem to write the best stuff when I’m hung over, maybe because I can’t overthink it,” she says. “I’d go into the studio and it would be my only constant, familiar place to work through all of the confusing stuff that was going on.” The result is an EP on which Humberstone navigates the dizzying change of your early twenties, from homesickness (“Please Don’t Leave Just Yet”) to helping your best mate through a breakup (“Thursday,” “Scarlett”) and realizing you’ve outgrown your own relationship (“Friendly Fire”). Yet <i>The Walls Are Way Too Thin</i>—influenced by ’80s pop and artists including Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, and Prince—is more upbeat that the subject matter that inspired it. “I wrote really happy-sounding songs about really sad things,” adds Humberstone. “Maybe that was part of the coping mechanism.” Read on as she walks us through her second EP, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“Haunted House”</b>\n“We were told that we had to leave our childhood home. This house is the only place I’ll ever consider as my real home. It's so quirky—it’s this really old house in the middle of the countryside that I think my friends at school were terrified of. But I feel so safe there. I feel it's raised me in a way. An elderly family member had also died. I just felt all of the really sacred, precious things from my childhood were slipping away from me all at once. I was so emotional writing the song—it just felt like I really needed to write it. Writing it helped me to understand that change is really hard, but it's really necessary for us to evolve and to grow.”<br />\n<b>“The Walls Are Way Too Thin”</b>\n“Going into the studio and making sense of everything that was going on was my salvation. The flat where I was living in London was the worst of the worst. I wrote this with [frequent collaborator and songwriter/producer] Rob Milton in Nottinghamshire and it was such an amazing excuse to leave London. Like a lot of the songs on this EP, there’s quite a depressing meaning behind them, but it was important not to make it sound depressing. This was written over a long period of time, and I remember being just obsessed with synth for ages. I wanted to write stuff that sounded fully ’80s: cheesy cringe music.”<br />\n<b>“Please Don’t Leave Just Yet”</b>\n“I wrote this with Matty Healy in between the lockdowns in 2020. The 1975 was such a huge musical influence for me—Matty wrote the soundtrack to my teenage years. I hate writing with new people, it’s my worst nightmare, but he just created such a comfortable, chill environment. I wrote this when I was living in London and I didn't have any friends. Every time I'd go and visit people or someone would come to visit me, it always felt like I couldn't really enjoy it because I was thinking, ‘You're going to have to leave soon. I'm going to be on my own again.’ I would do anything to make them stay. I wanted to mirror that in the production. I wanted to make it really conversational as well and have the lyrics almost like a phone call.”<br />\n<b>“Thursday”</b>\n“I was thinking ‘I'm on Fire’ by Bruce Springsteen with this, with that driving kind of rhythm. I was writing about my friend Scarlett, but also dwelling on my own experiences with having somebody break up with me and feeling completely rejected. This song was written a couple of months before ‘Scarlett’ and it was when she was in the midst of the breakup. It was really hard to watch her being in denial about everything. She would do anything for this guy and he was just completely uninterested. I really like the lyrics in this one—they’re so relatable.”<br />\n<b>“Scarlett”</b>\n“This song is different from the other tracks, because it’s like, ‘Actually, I’m so much better off without you. I’m not dependent on anyone.’ I wrote this when Scarlett was starting to feel hopeful and see herself the way that I had been seeing her the whole time: as her own person without this relationship. The sonics and the production of this song just felt uplifting to me and like the high point of the EP. I think Scarlett feels quite empowered by it.”<br />\n<b>“Friendly Fire”</b>\n“My relationship—like a lot of people’s—broke down during the pandemic. It was my first proper relationship and I really cared for this person. But, especially with being really busy with my music, I didn’t have any spare emotional energy. I wrote this song a few weeks before I ended it, and it made me realize what I needed to do. I often just feel really confused about stuff and I find that writing a song helps me to figure out what I need to do. The message is: ‘I really care about you. And I'm really sorry if, somewhere down the line, I break your heart. It’s nothing personal, it’s my own issues.’”","short":"Hear it in Spatial Audio, and read an interview with the singer-songwriter."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1591509653","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591509653?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/87/f5/e0/87f5e0de-c909-f4e6-9621-123565dfbc80/738676858440_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"313238","textColor2":"232e3a","textColor4":"414d5d","textColor1":"0e0d0b","bgColor":"bbc7ed","hasP3":false},"artistName":"TWICE","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/formula-of-love-o-t-3/1591509653","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Formula of Love: O+T=<3","recordLabel":"Republic Records - TWICE","upc":"738676858440","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 JYP Entertainment Company","playParams":{"id":"1591509653","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The group drop a pure K-pop potion in shimmering Spatial Audio.","short":"The group drop a pure K-pop potion in shimmering Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1571944035","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1571944035?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/c6/69/38/c6693814-6ab9-c2d7-ca21-0b0c0726bb16/5400863061258_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2d2d2","textColor2":"e3e3e3","textColor4":"bcbcbc","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Damon Albarn","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-nearer-the-fountain-more-pure-the-stream-flows/1571944035","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows","recordLabel":"Transgressive","upc":"5400863061258","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 13 under exclusive license to Transgressive Records Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1571944035","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The view from the living room of Damon Albarn’s home near Reykjavik is striking. Beyond the black-sand beaches and North Atlantic water, Esja, a volcanic mountain range, cuts across the skyline. Around it, the Icelandic weather regularly puts on a show. “It’s always extreme there,” Albarn tells Apple Music. “It doesn’t exist in a meteorological platitude.” Toward the end of 2019, Albarn gathered an orchestral ensemble to sit at his window and chart the landscape, wildlife, and climate in music. Three sessions were recorded before the pandemic stalled the project. Relocating to his UK home in Devon, Albarn found he just couldn’t let those musical improvisations lie dormant until lockdown loosened. “They were such a strong thing,” he says. “It’s like a potion—I kept taking the cork top off to sip for a minute, maybe just smell it. At one point, I was like, ‘I’m just going to drink this now and use it to do something.’ So, I did like Asterix, and I made <i>The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows</i>.”<br />\nAssisted by longtime collaborators Mike Smith and Simon Tong, Albarn transformed the music into his second solo album—11 unhurried reflections on loss and fragility. “The fragility is the humans’ place within nature,” he says. “And the loss is the transferal of everything. Nothing’s lost. The thing changes, it doesn’t actually disappear—it just has a different state or form.” With its vivid sense of place and transformation, the record recalls two of Albarn’s recent projects: Gorillaz’s <i>Meanwhile</i> EP and The Good, the Bad & the Queen’s <i>Merrie Land</i>. “The older you get, depending on your circumstance, the more acutely you feel these things,” he says. “I’m making music for young people at a rather advanced age for someone making music for young people. People of my own age, it’s kind of, ‘Yeah, well, that’s how I feel as well.’ Whereas for younger people, it’s like, ‘Well, that’s a strong flavor,’ but it’s not a bad thing.” Here, he takes us through the album, track by track.<br />\n<b>“The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows”</b>\n“I’d had that phrase for a while and thought that was a good working title for the Icelandic project. It was only in Devon at the end of [2020] that I realized where it had come from fully—I’d obviously read the poem [John Clare’s ‘Love and Memory,’ adapted here] at some point. And that poem just felt like it worked weirdly with the nature. John Clare was a very natural poet, working-class. [What I was getting from the poem] was ‘the dark journey,’ and you can’t just wipe out the memory of somebody. It’s a very emotional negotiation you go on when someone’s left your life: You’ve lost something, but you retain what you choose to retain, and that can be a beautiful thing as well.”<br />\n<b>“The Cormorant”</b>\n“For years, I was scared of swimming out into the bay [in Devon]. I sort of conquered that fear at the beginning of lockdown and started to do it as a daily meditation. Sometimes I got myself in quite a lot of trouble because it was too rough. I did have one point where I thought, ‘I’m going to drown.’ But I love doing it, because although the fear of being devoured by a shark or whatever has diminished, it’s still there a little bit, so it’s quite an edgy thing to do every day. That’s just the first two lines of that song. It’s a deep song, a whole novel in itself really. I was sitting on the beach, and I had my phone. I recorded the whole of the vocal line, music and words, without really anything in my head. It was more of a sung conversation with myself and the cormorant and the water and everything that’s taken place on that beach over 25 years. I love that about the beaches—I’m there on my own, I can just bring everyone who’s ever been there with me and all the thoughts I’ve got. It's important for all of us to have somewhere where you can somehow gather your thoughts.”<br />\n<b>“Royal Morning Blue”</b>\n“[When rain turns to snow], suddenly everything goes in slow motion and beautiful geometric patterns start to appear and the world feels reborn in a way. Even the most desolate of landscapes after a big snowfall are perfect. It’s such an ephemeral thing though. It’s the same water but transformed for a moment.”<br />\n<b>“Combustion”</b>\n“This is part of a much bigger thing. I think it’ll be developed more when I do it with the orchestra in February [2022] and I’m reunited with my musicians from Iceland. The record will transform again, the space in between the singing will be much greater, to return it more to its meditation on this perspective that musicians and myself were allowed by being there and playing in real time.”<br />\n<b>“Daft Wader”</b>\n“[It’s inspired by] Zoroastrian sky burials. And the public mourning of martyrs. It’s a very big part of Shia religion, martyrdom. Problematic. And same with Sunni. It’s problematic, but it just struck me how it was very beautiful seeing communities all sitting together, drinking fruit juice and coffee, and being really peaceful publicly. Because it’s always kind of invested with such drama and violence, their religious festivals—we’re taught to fear them, and not understand it and not be sympathetic. I’m very lucky: I’ve been to Iran, and it has its issues, but it’s a very civilized place.”<br />\n<b>“Darkness to Light”</b>\n“Dawn is so much later in the winter [in Iceland]. It’s like half-10, maybe even 11 o’clock. Dawn is in the working day. So, it’s a lot of time making this record in that state, which is something I grew to understand more about when I was doing <i>Dr Dee</i> [a 2011 opera about Elizabethan polymath John Dee] because the time between dusk and night, and night and dawn, was the favored time of the day to commit to magical practice. That’s where all the good spells are cast.”<br />\n<b>“Esja”</b>\n“This is the outline of the mountain, and it moves with the contours around a certain harmonic destination. You’ve got to give [the musicians] some sort of harmonic destination. Once you start saying, ‘Play in a certain way,’ you’re missing the point. It’s how they feel once they start to tune in to just staring, and not thinking about what you’re playing. So, listening, being sensitive to each other. It’s like everyone’s got a paintbrush—and how do we keep moving but somehow inhabit our points of view? When I was writing over the top, it made it easier having this harmonic reasoning behind all of this abstract stuff.”<br />\n<b>“The Tower of Montevideo”</b>\n“I’ve made it. I’ve swum past the buoy to the uncharted cruise ship [first mentioned in ‘The Cormorant’], and I’ve met fellow musicians, or stowaways or refugees, emotional refugees, and we’ve formed a band and we’re playing these songs to nobody. I’ve had a bit of an obsession about music in empty clubs for a long time. To make music for an audience is a true joy, but be careful, because modern consumption of music is killing us musicians slowly. It’s a long, protracted death, but it’s happening.”<br />\n<b>“Giraffe Trumpet Sea”</b>\n“This is a song about flying back to London and looking down—there were a few clouds, a night city—and feeling like I was at the bottom of some ocean, that it was gold treasure. Giraffe trumpets are the cranes. When they’re resting, they look like they’re sort of giraffes. Half-giraffe, half-trumpet, sending out beautiful sounds to the universe. But I left out all the words. I think it was too distracting at that point in the record to go off on another tangent and another story, but I liked the music and I liked the title.”<br />\n<b>“Polaris”</b>\n“‘Polaris’ reminds me of that anxiety I felt in the ’80s around Greenham Common [RAF air base housing cruise missiles under Britain’s Polaris nuclear weapons program]. That understanding that we had as kids of that age, that nuclear war was a very real thing, and we were quite scared. ‘Polaris/Watching the embers fall.’ That’s after a nuclear attack. And then the next bit—‘Joining the saline to start the inspection’—is me zoning in on the oystercatchers in Devon when the tide goes out. Seeing them in an <i>Animal Farm</i> kind of way: They’ve become the rulers. They’re black and white, and their red eyes—kind of this uniform. And waiting for the saline to clear so they can eat. And the other birds have to wait in their line before they’re allowed to go and do anything. So, ‘Polaris’ is an ominous word. But it’s the Polar Star as well, which is something that’s been used by anyone who’s gone to sea. It’s saved many people.”<br />\n<b>“Particles”</b>\n“[A rabbi Albarn met on a flight] was fleeing certain particles. But she said the particles are looking for you in the universe. They are attracted to you. You cannot stop anything. We moved on to the conversation of Trump, and she said he’s a perfect example of a particle in that you can’t escape it, but it’s benign in a sense because it’s just going to come and cause great disruption and then disappear, and other things will come out of it. And that is true of the universe. Firstly, nothing disappears; it just changes. And secondly, there is no sadness because everything is evolving. And it’s only us who want to find some meaning to it. And that’s why we become sad—because when we can't find meaning to things, we’re sad. And that’s just being a good old-fashioned Homo sapien.”","short":"“There is no sadness because everything is evolving.

But Jade’s right: There are just so many. We sat back and thought, ‘How have we done this? Ten years’ worth of fucking tunes.’”<br />\nLittle Mix, of course, is part of reality TV lore. Thirlwall, Pinnock, Perrie Edwards, and former member Jesy Nelson were carefully pieced together on the UK <i>X Factor</i> in 2011, and would become the first group to win the show. Much like One Direction, though, the band’s origin story fast became a footnote once the tidal wave of shape-shifting hits began rolling in. A decade on, <i>Between Us</i> allows the band an opportunity to celebrate their success. “It’s been overwhelming, actually,” says Thirlwall. “I’m proud of what we’ve achieved together and the evolution you can hear going through the records. [2012’s] <i>DNA</i> was just an experimental pop album, <i>Salute</i> [2013] was very much more to our specific tastes and a bit ahead of its time in terms of what the UK was after, and <i>Get Weird</i> [2015] was an absolutely glorious shitshow of out-there pop music. Then <i>Glory Days</i> [2016] literally did capture the glory days where we felt we did capture our place in the industry, [2018’s] <i>LM5</i> was our coming-of-age record where we evolved into these ballsy women, and <i>Confetti</i> [2020] brings everything together. Every era has its own moment and stands for something different.” Read on as Pinnock, Edwards, and Thirlwall each choose their three favorite Little Mix songs from their band’s glorious first decade.<br />\n<b>Leigh-Anne</b><br />\n<b>“Touch”</b>\n“I feel like this was the moment people's ears pricked up and were like, ‘Oh, is this Little Mix?’ and we gained a new fanbase from it. It was our cool moment, I think. And no matter if you didn't even like Little Mix or if you weren't a fan, you loved ‘Touch.’ Just a really great moment for us. We did the video with Parris Goebel and the choreography was just epic. It’s also probably the most mature song that we've done.”<br />\n<b>“Black Magic”</b>\n“I don’t want to say ‘Black Magic’ saved our career, because that sounds a little bit dramatic. But it definitely came out around a time we genuinely thought we were getting dropped by our label, put it that way. We'd scrapped a whole album and we were freaking out. And then [songwriter and artist] KAMILLE—our savior, our angel—came and gave us ‘Black Magic.’ Although it wasn’t completely instant in terms of us all loving it, if I’m honest. But I think we all knew deep down this was the song that was going to save everything.”<br />\n<b>“Break Up Song”</b>\n“Perrie knows this is one of my absolute favorites. It reminds me of ‘Black Magic,’ but I think it’s a bit cooler. I feel the fans really responded to this song as we were going into the first lockdown in the UK [in March 2020] when it came out and people needed a bit of a pick-me-up—a bit of a boost.”<br />\n<b>Perrie</b><br />\n<b>“Shout Out to My Ex”</b>\n“It’s iconic. It’s epic. It still goes down really well when we do it live. Everyone seems to love it, I think because everyone can relate to it—and it definitely makes me just feel really good. Even when it comes on now, I just love it.”<br />\n<b>“Power”</b>\n“This was unreal. It’s so empowering and just such a <i>big</i> song. I remember being in America at the time and our manager telling us that Stormzy really wanted to jump on a track, which we were obviously buzzing around. I adore his verse: a male artist talking about female empowerment. It’s a sick rap and such a good feature.”<br />\n<b>“Sweet Melody”</b>\n“I’m surprised Leigh-Anne didn’t choose this one, actually. It got to No. 1 after staying around in the charts for months—it really grew organically. The music video is so cool, and it was lovely to do a really choreographed video again after such a long time. And we haven’t even had a chance to perform it live yet!”<br />\n<b>Jade</b>\n<b> “Wings”</b>\n“I’ll be honest, here. I am fuming because the girls took two of my faves. I was going to do ‘Touch’ and I was going to do ‘Sweet Melody’ but I will rejig. So ‘Wings’ is my first one. It was our first big single as a group, and we’d written it, so it meant a lot to us. And I feel that at the time, no one was writing pop music like that, so it was a bit of a statement as our first single to really establish who we were going to be. The melodies are great, and it’s one of those songs where we literally threw the kitchen sink in, but it works.”<br />\n<b>“Secret Love Song” (feat. Jason Derulo)</b>\n“More so the album version, really, but it was a big single, too. It’s just one of those songs we loved and knew would do well, but it really did take a life of its own. I love that it was claimed by a lot of the LGBTQ+ fans as an anthem. And I love that that happened organically, because we certainly didn’t plan for that. It really hones in for us how diverse and inclusive our fanbase is, and how the community that we’ve built with our fanbase is so eclectic.”<br />\n<b>“No More Sad Songs” (feat. Machine Gun Kelly)</b>\n“This is quite underrated as a single, and deserving of a bit more love. We were so busy at the time so didn’t have time to do a lot of promo for it. But I love the song. The video shoot in this old-school Nashville saloon was great fun and I got very drunk, Machine Gun Kelly’s verse is great, and it just reminds me of a really happy, fun time in our lives.”","short":"“There are too many bops to choose from, truth be told.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6XNrM2YkzSXyQ9hekFOgLN"}},{"id":"1573663472","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573663472?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/7f/86/5c/7f865cb8-0ddc-93ac-317b-f3bde48de409/3616556892425.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"36394c","textColor2":"002143","textColor4":"314c67","textColor1":"070a20","bgColor":"f4f5f9","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Courtney Barnett","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/things-take-time-take-time/1573663472","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Things Take Time, Take Time","recordLabel":"Mom+Pop","upc":"3616556892425","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Mom+Pop","playParams":{"id":"1573663472","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Here’s what a typical day of lockdown looked like for Courtney Barnett in 2020: “Wake up, watch the sunrise, do some meditating, drink some coffee, do some work and then some songwriting,” she tells Apple Music. “Go for a walk, call a friend, then some more work.” Living alone in a friend’s empty Melbourne apartment, Barnett found herself in a reflective mood, often watching the world and seasons change from her window, a guitar in her lap. “A lot of the time there wasn't much else to do,” she says. “But I think it's good sometimes to just sit and watch or listen, to take a minute.”<br />\nWritten in the quiet of hotel rooms or that very apartment, Barnett’s intimate third LP is a set of meditative rock that feels uniquely present, the Aussie singer-songwriter playing like she’s got nowhere to go and nowhere else she’d rather be. It’s music that feels akin—spiritually and sonically—to that of one-time collaborator Kurt Vile, a placid coming together of jangly guitars, purring drum machines, and zen turn of phrase. “I feel that quietness is often a reflection of the writing, but also I think that I was just craving a quieter sound,” she says of the album. “I've gotten used to just taking things as they come over the years. Nothing is ever how you think it's going to be, so it's just trying to live in those moments and make the most of them.” Here, Barnett guides us through a few of the album’s songs.<br />\n<b>“Rae Street”</b>\n“The chorus [‘Time is money and money is no man’s friend’] is something that I remember from my childhood, something my dad would say as a bit of a joke, as a hurry-up if we were late for school or whatever. It's just always stuck in my head, and when I reflected on it as an adult, it took on a whole new meaning, especially in the context of last year when the world slowed down or stopped in some places, and people lost jobs.”<br />\n<b>“Sunfair Sundown”</b>\n“That was inspired by a party with friends—one of those nights you feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for friendship and connection. I started writing it the next day, just because of that overwhelming, beautiful, big feeling—it was that simple. It was just celebrating very special small moments and the fact that small moments can mean so much. Sometimes, to one person, it's just another day, but it could totally change or affect someone else's life.”<br />\n<b>“Here’s the Thing”</b>\n“I just remember when I wrote that song, it felt special straight away. The guitar chords and the melody—it all came quite naturally and quickly. It started as a letter and then it turned into a song, and over time it’s morphed, as songs do. It’s constantly evolving. I just think it's such a simple, beautiful song—I feel a lot when I play it.”<br />\n<b>“Turning Green”</b>\n“Starting out, we did this whole version that sounded like a jangly guitar-pop song. But it didn't grab me, so we pulled it apart and [Warpaint drummer] Stella [Mozgawa] reprogrammed some drums. I put the guitar down because it just didn't seem like it fit, and we kind of flipped it on its head to see if it would inspire a better feeling. And it did, straight away—just singing along to it made the words come to life in a different way. Sometimes, in the studio, you just want to throw so much stuff onto songs and it just gets crowded and busy, and then you kind of lose track of what's happening. The change gave the words space and that space was really important for a lot of this album, but this song especially.”<br />\n<b>“Write a List of Things to Look Forward To”</b> \n“The song’s title came from someone saying, ‘You should write a list of things that you're looking forward to.’ And that just inspired the thought behind it—what that means and what it represents. It’s a song about gratitude, but it is also about connections in life, this idea of life and death and being afraid of it and just being at peace with that progression.”","short":"“I think I was just craving a quieter sound.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3InSvUCYvJ5XWg6PegGNCv"}},{"id":"1594457510","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594457510?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/93/23/83/93238399-92a7-5d39-b776-bbc9da28bb13/3000x3000-MS-WW-Dillon_Francis_2021_DJ_Mix.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"31302f","textColor2":"2f2113","textColor4":"574b3e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f7f3ed","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dillon Francis","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/todays-hits-october-2021-dj-mix/1594457510","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":22,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Today’s Hits: October 2021 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381819101","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1594457510","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The Today’s Hits DJ mix captures the world’s biggest songs in one continuous set.

I made ‘Unconditional’ with 220 KID, MNEK, and KOLIDESCOPES, and it features Bryn Christopher on vocals. We collabed on this song together over quarantine, with the main goal of making something happy and fun. 'Real Love,' which features Aleyna Tilki, was a really special record to make because I was able to connect and collaborate with my friends across the globe.” But obviously, there’s plenty more here to keep that energy up, whether it's dance jams from RÜFÜS DU SOL and Loud Luxury, remixes of Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran, or hip-hop from Young Thug and Don Toliver.

Apple Music that it was focused on being present and, he said, “accepting who you are in that moment.” On the Bristol band’s fourth record, which arrived 14 months later, that perspective turns sharply back to the past as Talbot examines his struggles with addiction. “I started therapy and it was the first time I really started to compartmentalize the last 20 years, starting with my mum’s alcoholism and then learning to take accountability for what I’d done, all the bad decisions I’d made,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But also where these bad decisions came from—as a forgiveness thing but way more as a responsibility thing. Two years sober, all that stuff, and I came out and it was just fluid, we [Talbot and guitarist Mark Bowen] both just wrote it and it was beautiful.”<br />\nTalbot is unshrinkingly honest in his self-examination. Opener “MTT 420 RR” considers mortality via visceral reflections on a driving incident that the singer was fortunate to escape alive, before his experiences with the consuming cycle of addiction cut through the pneumatic riffs of “The Wheel.” There’s hope here, too. During soul-powered centerpiece “The Beachland Ballroom,” Talbot is as impassioned as ever and newly melodic (“It was a conversation we had, I wanted to start singing”). It’s a song where he’s on his knees but he can discern some light. “The plurality of it is that perspective of <i>CRAWLER</i>, the title,” he says. “Recovery isn’t just a beautiful thing, you have to go through a lot of processes that are ugly and you’ve got to look at yourself and go, ‘Yeah, you were not a good person to these people, you did this.’ That’s where the beauty comes from—afterwards you have a wider perspective of where you are. And also from other people’s perspectives, you see these things, you see people recovering or completely enthralled in addiction, and it’s all different angles. We wanted to create a picture of recovery and hope but from ugly and beautiful angles. You’re on your knees, some people are begging, some people are working, praying, whatever it is—you’ve got to get through it.”<br />\n<i>CRAWLER</i> may be IDLES’ most introspective work to date, but their social and political focus remains sharp enough on the tightly coiled “The New Sensation” to skewer Conservative MP Rishi Sunak’s suggestion that some people, including artists and musicians, should abandon their careers and retrain in a post-pandemic world. With its rage and wit, its bleakness and hope, and its diversions from the band’s post-punk foundations into ominous electronica (“MTT 420 RR”), glitchy psych textures (“Progress”), and motorik rhythms butting up against free jazz (“Meds”), <i>CRAWLER</i> upholds Talbot’s earliest aims for the band. In 2009, he resolved to create something with substance and impact—an antidote to the bands he’d watched in Bristol and London. “They looked beautiful but bored,” he says. “They were clothes hangers, models. I was so sick of paying money to see bored people. Like, ‘What are you doing? Where’s the love?’ I was at a place where I needed an outlet, and luckily I found four brothers who saved my life. And the rest is IDLES.”","short":"“We wanted to create a picture of hope and recovery from different angles.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1WXcTQXt1jeF5VGUNAeySv"}},{"id":"1589217718","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589217718?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3500,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/4b/92/34/4b923426-c40a-f0fd-c577-178b3b6bd715/21UM1IM18610.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3500,"textColor3":"b7b0b1","textColor2":"ebd9c0","textColor4":"c0ae9e","textColor1":"e0dbd8","bgColor":"150319","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jonny Greenwood","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/spencer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1589217718","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Spencer (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Mercury Classics","upc":"00602438956814","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"A Mercury KX Release; ℗ 2021 Spencer Productions Ltd., under exclusive licence to Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1589217718","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6AGN0V4QobqBIVCWr6ZZPz"}},{"id":"1591955394","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591955394?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/36/f4/ea/36f4eae2-f74d-6583-b3a6-353f9c104853/196292714647.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"e9d7de","textColor2":"f1aba7","textColor4":"de9498","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"94385c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Miky Woodz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/living-life/1591955394","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Living Life","recordLabel":"Rimas Entertainment LLC.","upc":"196292714647","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Rimas Entertainment LLC.","playParams":{"id":"1591955394","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Etox5CVRSGc6G7BkwFKzl"}},{"id":"1590920785","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590920785?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/8f/ae/31/8fae31dd-abc8-b86f-0a96-86cb00aabf2e/21UM1IM28292.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"abbcc1","textColor2":"a1c3d8","textColor4":"85a1b1","textColor1":"d1e4ed","bgColor":"121c13","hasP3":false},"artistName":"JPEGMAFIA","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lp/1590920785","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-10-22","name":"LP!","recordLabel":"Universal Records","upc":"00602438980161","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 EQT Recordings.

The intrigue is deeper than ever on his third album, <i>Closer</i>, which follows 2018’s <i>Fantast</i> after a three-year pause. Certain trademarks of his sound have remained constant, like pistoning piano chords, whispered vocals, and whip-cracking drum programming. But Claptone’s songwriting has never been sharper, and co-production from Stuart Price (who has made records for Madonna, The Killers, and Pet Shop Boys) helps tip his melodic club anthems firmly into pop territory. A crack team of collaborators is on hand to realize Claptone’s radio-ready fantasies: Dizzy turns “Queen of Ice” into sweeping gothic pop; longtime peers Peter Bjorn and John bring an almost punky ’70s vibe to the guitar-flecked disco of “Satellite”; and Seal, of all people, lends his inimitably smoky croon to “Just a Ghost,” evoking memories of dance-pop’s ’90s heyday.

Putting one of pop music’s most recognizable voices over a song about anonymity is precisely the kind of gambit that only Claptone could pull off so effortlessly.","short":"The masked DJ opens up a melodic world of mystery."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/68eQP6I0MqHUfQk9H3eyu5"}},{"id":"1584078829","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584078829?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/b5/36/22/b5362289-034a-afa9-86cf-13f56ef57fe1/859750104915_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2c2b2a","textColor2":"3e2916","textColor4":"5e4d3b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"dedad3","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sam Outlaw","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/popular-mechanics/1584078829","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Popular Mechanics","recordLabel":"Black Hills Recordings","upc":"859750104915","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Black Hills Recordings","playParams":{"id":"1584078829","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ox6b3DSAuV4E4A3025lq6"}},{"id":"1593079585","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593079585?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ad/c4/7f/adc47f46-4486-bcff-a135-ababf344ecb3/196292726770.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"422100","textColor2":"391402","textColor4":"612f01","textColor1":"120100","bgColor":"ff9e00","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Zyah Belle","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whos-listening-anyway/1593079585","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-11","name":"Who's Listening Anyway","recordLabel":"Guin Records x Zyah Belle","upc":"196292726770","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Babyhair Slick Publishing (ASCAP)","playParams":{"id":"1593079585","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52AEsPS0IsOHaVpoxN1EQn"}},{"id":"1582011456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582011456?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/25/3c/d5/253cd52e-252b-6b4a-a2ec-b1dd4114c5f6/886449409921.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9cac5","textColor2":"d2d4d3","textColor4":"a9abaa","textColor1":"fafbf5","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bonded","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/into-blackness-bonus-tracks-edition/1582011456","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Into Blackness (Bonus Tracks Edition)","recordLabel":"Century Media","upc":"886449409921","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Century Media Records Ltd.","playParams":{"id":"1582011456","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6JUb8s6qZV45jOnNBCTmnC"}},{"id":"1593106756","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593106756?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/82/10/f5/8210f544-48e1-f551-bbcf-daf7d2df388c/PEACE_Vol.II_FINAL_COVER.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"31343b","textColor2":"0a0c0f","textColor4":"30343c","textColor1":"0b0b0d","bgColor":"c7d7f1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bethel Music","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/peace-vol-ii/1593106756","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Christian","Music","Praise & Worship"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Peace, Vol. II","recordLabel":"Bethel Music","upc":"611851680213","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Bethel Music","playParams":{"id":"1593106756","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6rlmahX20G4EGu7ClCHe4p"}},{"id":"1591466934","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591466934?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/eb/23/9a/eb239a80-150c-d94d-d0a8-894df7023bfd/28037.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cad7e4","textColor2":"d4e9fa","textColor4":"aacfe9","textColor1":"fdf4f5","bgColor":"0166a1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"NNAMDÏ & Lynyn","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/are-you-happy-ep/1591466934","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Are You Happy -

It’s his first LP in more than a decade, and his first for Anjunadeep. In fact, Fitzpatrick tells Apple Music, “<i>Machine Therapy</i> feels like my first proper album,” period. Where 2010’s <i>Shadows in the Dark</i> collected the kinds of club tracks he was DJing back then, \"This one really feels like a complete, fully rounded album,” wrapping up a wide range of electronic styles into a single, cohesive experience. The album’s ideas began to take shape in 2019, just prior to COVID lockdown. But that time away from clubbing, ironically, gave Fitzgerald the freedom to pursue the sorts of songs that he wouldn’t normally play in his DJ sets, like the drum ’n’ bass of “Bourgeois Imagery” or the ambient of “Berlin Morning Calm.” And with musicians around the world looking for ways to fill their days, collaboration became unexpectedly seamless. “The pandemic allowed me to work with people that I wouldn’t normally have worked with,” he says. “A lot of the time, you’re ships passing in the night.” Fitzgerald and drum ’n’ bass icon High Contrast finally got around to whipping up a song that finds common ground between their styles. Kele Okereke from Bloc Party, one of Fitzpatrick’s idols, turned up in his DMs. And the search for new sounds beyond his house and techno wheelhouse led him to rising talents like Lawrence Hart, Lowes, and Another Sky’s Catrin Vincent, all of whom inspired Fitzpatrick to explore unexpectedly songful territory, closing the gap between his habitual sound and Anjunadeep’s soulful, melodic signature. Here, he walks Apple Music through each of the album’s songs.<br />\n<b>“Berlin Morning Calm”</b>\n“This reminds me of walking through Berlin in the cold morning after leaving a gig. It’s that feeling of stillness after coming out of a crazy nightclub when your ears are ringing, and your eyes are flashing from the lights. You’ve been in there for what feels like an eternity, and you’re coming back to the real world, feeling a mix of emotions—euphoria and happiness but also calm. It’s just a reset.”<br />\n<b>“Something Wonderful”</b>\n“This was a tip to the old rave days. When I was a kid, I’d go down to Bournemouth, to the opera house—that was one of my first clubbing experiences. I was around 15. They used to have a second room in the club that was more breakbeat and drum ’n’ bass, rave-y stuff. I’d always end up wandering into that room, just to hear something different. We used to get a coach back from the nightclub, and on the radio, around 4 or 5 am, you’d have the Fabio & Grooverider show. This track reminds me of those times—just staring out the coach windows, listening to drum ’n’ bass, reminiscing about the night you’ve just had.”<br />\n<b>“Warning Signs” (feat. Lawrence Hart)</b>\n“This is one of my favorites that I’ve ever written—it still gives me goose bumps. Lawrence’s vocal is amazing. I heard one of his tracks with George FitzGerald, “Call It Love (If You Want To),” and immediately wanted to work with Lawrence. He wrote a story about two people who can’t be together but also can’t be apart. Making this track really drove home for me that this album was going to be something special.”<br />\n<b>“W.A.I.S.T.D.” (feat. Kele)</b>\n“The title is an abbreviation of the lyric, ‘What am I supposed to do?’ I’ve been a Bloc Party fan for years. It was a dream to work with Kele. I’d been badgering him via DM, asking if he’d be interested in doing something together. Then randomly, in the pandemic, he came back to me and was like, ‘I’m a big fan of the music—let’s do something.’ Which was pretty incredible. The track had a festival vibe and a big, banger-type hook like I did on ‘We Do What We Want.’ But I thought it needed a topline. So, I sent it to Kele, and he ran with it.”<br />\n<b>“Bourgeois Imagery” (feat. High Contrast)</b>\n“I’ve known Lincoln Barrett, High Contrast, for many years. We’re from different worlds—he’s drum ’n’ bass and I’m more techno and house—but we’d always end up in the same shuttles at festivals, or we’d bump into each other at the hotel reception. It was in London when we last saw each other, and I was like, ‘Right, let’s finally get some ideas over to each other.’ The pandemic hit, and we were like, ‘Well, let’s do it.’ It was a completely remote session, bouncing stems back and forth. We haven’t ever actually been in the studio together at all.”<br />\n<b>“A Call Out for Love” (feat. Lowes)</b>\n“I had the core of the track, but I really wanted a vocal on it. Then I heard Lowes on the radio—they did that track with CamelPhat, “Easier”—and I thought they could work really well. Evie, the lead singer, sent me a big folder of ideas back, and ‘A Call Out for Love’ just seemed to fit perfectly. It’s one of those moments where I’d been working on something for so long, hearing so many different vocals on it, and I dropped Lowes’ in, pressed <i>play</i>, and was like, ‘Finally.’”<br />\n<b>“The Sweeper”</b>\n“This is probably the closest track on the album to my DJ sets: high energy, techno beats, rave vibes. Very heady, clubby stuff. I put this track on the album three quarters of the way into the process, actually, because I had a moment where I was like, ‘I know clubs aren’t open and I’m trying to explore my musical abilities and push boundaries, but this album should also represent something from my bread-and-butter sound.’ It kicks quite hard, coming out of the other ones. But I think the record needs that in the middle—sort of a shake-up.”<br />\n<b>“Acid Changes Everything”</b>\n“I was spending quite a bit of time cooking in the kitchen or painting with the kids—domestic lockdown activities. That’s all you could do, just to take your mind off stuff. I had a weekend of listening to Bicep and Aphex Twin, just having that on in the background while I was making bread, and I wanted to get back in the studio and do something a bit nostalgic with the vocal pads and 303—that sort of ’90s, Bicep-y, Moby, 808 State sound.”<br />\n<b>“Cosmic Waves”</b>\n“For this track, I need to shout out my Roland SH-101—a nice, bright red, limited-edition one. I’ve got a lot of synths in the studio that I’ve built up over the years, and everything is MIDI’d together, so you just turn it on, fire it into your DAW, and start making music. But the SH-101 isn’t MIDI, so I don’t use it a lot. But I had recently watched Mathew Jonson talking about his favorite synths, and the way he was playing the SH-101 was really how you’d imagine a guitarist or drummer playing their instrument, so I fired it up and spent some time with it. ‘Cosmic Rays’ is sort of a tip to the Mathew Jonsons of the world—my interpretation of performing with the SH-101, just mucking around with the arpeggiators and the decay and creating a journey through the whole track.”<br />\n<b>“Came Home” (feat. Catrin Vincent)</b>\n“I very rarely listen to upbeat dance music unless I’m going through promos or getting ready to play a show. My personal time is spent listening to different stuff. Radiohead is one of those key groups I’m always listening to. I had made the basis of this track, the bones and the beats, and it sounded like Thom Yorke, his Atoms for Peace stuff or solo records—those mad, sporadic drum patterns. I knew that Catrin was a big fan of Thom Yorke and Radiohead, and her voice is incredible. She’s got a very distinct sound. I sent it over, and she absolutely smashed it. With some of these collaborations throughout the lockdown period, I was quite lucky to work with some of these people. I just don’t think it would have happened in normal circumstances.”<br />\n<b>“Closing In” (feat. Lawrence Hart)</b>\n“We had so much fun working together on ‘Warning Signs,’ I wanted to do something else with Lawrence. Getting two vocal tracks from Lawrence on the album, it sort of brings it all together. Once you hear ‘Warning Signs,’ if you’re into it, it’s a nice surprise to have him come back again towards the end. Both tracks were mastered at Abbey Road, which is incredible, too—that’s a little cherry on top.”<br />\n<b>“Unite”</b>\n“I originally wanted to have this track performed by a full orchestra, but the logistics of getting 60-odd people in a room together in the middle of the pandemic was impossible. So, I basically shelved the track, but then I came across the Charlie Chaplin vocal, and it stopped me in my tracks. The meaning of the vocal, it just hit home for the times we’re in. It seemed like the perfect way to bring the album to a close.”","short":"“This one really feels like a complete, fully rounded album.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21Twm2qUPVJBVyjJInnNbY"}},{"id":"1592185969","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592185969?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/ff/fa/a1/fffaa116-76d3-7a49-ab94-a64b6d883fae/093624876755.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"cd674d","textColor2":"f3613f","textColor4":"c65034","textColor1":"fb7e5f","bgColor":"150a06","hasP3":false},"artistName":"brother sundance","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rat-race-ep/1592185969","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Rat Race - EP","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624876755","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1592185969","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1581664339","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1581664339?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/bb/4e/41/bb4e417d-5152-d8cd-d93a-7937015409e8/dj.hquehclf.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":6000,"textColor3":"c9d8d9","textColor2":"fadcd4","textColor4":"d2c4bf","textColor1":"eef5f4","bgColor":"31656e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Weval","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/changed-for-the-better-ep/1581664339","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Changed for the Better - EP","recordLabel":"Technicolour","upc":"5054429152630","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Technicolour","playParams":{"id":"1581664339","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1587666517","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1587666517?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/58/e5/1f/58e51f8b-3f0e-92e2-831f-03531cf8af75/191404119754.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"2d2d2d","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor4":"404040","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"cccccc","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Blawan","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/woke-up-right-handed-ep/1587666517","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Woke Up Right Handed - EP","recordLabel":"XL Recordings","upc":"191404119754","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Ternesc under exclusive license to XL Recordings Ltd.","playParams":{"id":"1587666517","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1589212543","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589212543?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/23/68/46/236846b8-a6f3-6b00-5f7d-696b995ec526/859750811301_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccced4","textColor2":"8dc5df","textColor4":"78a3bc","textColor1":"f7fcfd","bgColor":"231932","hasP3":true},"artistName":"Blondes","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/out-the-neighbourhood-ep/1589212543","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Out the Neighbourhood - EP","recordLabel":"C3 Records","upc":"859750811301","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 C3 Records","playParams":{"id":"1589212543","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1591236076","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591236076?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3200,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/a8/10/2e/a8102e25-5f94-60e8-8a41-549e3e4a1b50/747313428373.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3174,"textColor3":"c9c9c9","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor4":"a7a7a7","textColor1":"f9f9f9","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ausrine Stundyte, Renée Morloc, ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra & Marin Alsop","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hindemith-nusch-nuschi-t%C3%A4nze-sancta-susanna-op-21-symphony/1591236076","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Modern Era","Orchestral"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Hindemith: Nusch-Nuschi Tänze, Sancta Susanna, Op. 21 & Symphony \"Mathis der Maler\"","recordLabel":"Naxos","upc":"747313428373","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Naxos","playParams":{"id":"1591236076","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Shortly before the pandemic struck, Marin Alsop opened a new chapter in her career, as chief conductor of the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. Following tenures at the Bournemouth, São Paulo, and Baltimore symphony orchestras, the US conductor quickly realized her new ensemble had a rather different approach. “Surprisingly, the standard repertoire is not really the meat and potatoes of this orchestra,” she tells Apple Music. “It’s much more eclectic, much more far-reaching. I think this is the only place in the world where I could say, ‘I’d love to do Hindemith for my opening concert,’ and they could come back with, ‘Do you want to pair that with something edgy?’ I thought, ‘Ah, OK, I have died and arrived. This is no longer Kansas.”<br />\nThe Hindemith works from that opening concert are heard on this album, recorded in Vienna’s beautiful and acoustically resplendent Konzerthaus. Paul Hindemith is a composer who rarely evokes great passion. But when he does, it’s with huge enthusiasm. And either way, his role in 20th-century music is very important, whether as composer, viola player, or teacher, and he was a key figure in establishing musical education in Turkey and also taught in the States. “People might know him for his pedagogical work, say, at Yale,” Alsop suggests, “but not for his commitment to youth and young people and underserved communities.” It’s something that clearly strikes a chord with this most socially conscious of conductors. “I think the more information you can have about a creator, what he or she was experiencing in that moment in time, and what was the root of the inspiration for the piece, the more convincing one can become, I believe,” Alsop adds. “Our job is to be the messengers of the composer.” Read on as Alsop walks us through this album, work by work.<br />\n<b>“Nusch-Nuschi Tänze”</b>\n“I was looking for something to fill up the album and my colleague, the orchestra director Christoph Becher, suggested these three dances. I thought they were perfect because they’re also from another short opera. And opera binds this whole program together. So, it all seemed to fit in terms of its context, and they’re really just delightful dances filled with character.”<br /> \n<b>“Sancta Susanna, Op. 21”</b>\n“This is one of Hindemith’s early short operas, not quite half an hour long, and while the story raised a few eyebrows at its premiere, and is still quite controversial, I tend to approach it, perhaps, from a more feminist direction. When we did it in concert in Vienna, the audience responded really well and thought it was pretty cool. It ends with the nun Susanna tearing the loincloth from a statue of Christ. Rather than accept forgiveness from the convent, she asks to be walled-up just as another young girl had been years before for blasphemy. But by her very act, she achieves a strength she never knew she had. It’s powerful stuff.”<br />\n<b>“Symphony ‘Mathis der Maler’”</b>\n“I used to do this piece frequently—it was sort of one of my party pieces for many years because my teacher Leonard Bernstein introduced me to it at Tanglewood and taught it to me. So, on the front page of my score, I have an inscription from Lenny talking to me about <i>Mathis der Maler</i>. It was really nice. He loved the piece and was a huge fan of both the symphony and Hindemith as a composer. The <i>Mathis der Maler</i> symphony is interesting because Hindemith composed it as he was writing the opera of the same name. Of course, every piece a composer writes is autobiographical in some way—it just has to be. So, I always think that Hindemith is working through his own personal justification for being an artist. Mathis—Matthias Grünewald—was a painter who created the Isenheim Altarpiece in the 16th century, and the three panels of the altarpiece form the three movements of the symphony. Hindemith lived through both world wars and was in the eye of the storm when it came to the Nazis’ response to his music. So, it was a time of great trauma, and how he came to terms with it manifests itself in so many of his pieces.”","short":"“Our job is to be the messengers of the composer.”\n"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/33HTKwv3BwHPCc23onjH55"}},{"id":"1591897857","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1591897857?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3544,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/cc/c4/46/ccc44631-0388-e4bb-fc41-5bbd5f76330d/8717953151797.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3544,"textColor3":"cfd1d1","textColor2":"8ec2c8","textColor4":"75a1a6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121b1e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Colin Benders","isSingle":true,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-cant-feel-my-legs-ep/1591897857","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":1,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"I Can’t Feel My Legs - EP","recordLabel":"Hiss & Hertz Records","upc":"8717953151797","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Hiss & Hertz Records","playParams":{"id":"1591897857","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1592491204","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1592491204?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/38/89/fc/3889fcf6-2cce-e374-4a53-a251331cc3f9/641990998849_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"132123","textColor2":"050e19","textColor4":"162a32","textColor1":"010306","bgColor":"5b9998","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tim Reaper","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stand-up-the-tranquility-track-single/1592491204","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Stand Up / The Tranquility Track - Single","recordLabel":"Blu Mar Ten Music","upc":"641990998849","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Blu Mar Ten Music","playParams":{"id":"1592491204","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1582831802","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582831802?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/e8/8e/71/e88e7104-ef0c-e1dc-c291-e6b3ae2e8068/190296519925.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"8cd3dd","textColor2":"d6d5ce","textColor4":"b6bbb7","textColor1":"a2f4ff","bgColor":"37545a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Renaud Capuçon & Guillaume Bellom","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/un-violon-%C3%A0-paris/1582831802","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Violin"],"trackCount":22,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Un violon à Paris","recordLabel":"Warner Classics","upc":"190296519925","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Renaud Capuçon on exclusive licence to Parlophone Records Limited","playParams":{"id":"1582831802","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"During the pandemic lockdowns of 2020, Renaud Capuçon was one of the many artists who were determined to bring live music to audiences across the world by performing online.

Eighteen months later, they compiled this heartwarming program from 22 of the pieces performed in their online concerts. <i>Un violon à Paris</i> is a reminder of the power of music to comfort and heal in even the most testing of times. Much of the album conveys a sense of calm: Bach’s <i>Suite No. 3 in D Major</i> (“Air”), Debussy’s “Clair de lune,” and Elgar’s “Chanson du matin,” for instance, but there are thrills along the way in the form of Brahms’ “Hungarian Dances, WoO 1” and Kreisler’s proto-Baroque “Prelude and allegro in the style of Pugnani.”","short":"Twenty-two heartwarming pieces the duo performed online during lockdown."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1lZyDr7mP2qj6jTl8kj9US"}},{"id":"1590022209","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590022209?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/df/24/3c/df243c4a-50b8-20f5-4ea5-f6b3ad9d56a1/194690650932_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdb1af","textColor2":"d5beb5","textColor4":"af9e95","textColor1":"e7d7d5","bgColor":"181b14","hasP3":false},"artistName":"DaBoii","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/house-arrest/1590022209","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"House Arrest","recordLabel":"YWN / EMPIRE","upc":"194690650932","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 YWN / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1590022209","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Tt1758OmmpDAAITs2oSvK"}},{"id":"1590599833","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590599833?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/dc/22/fc/dc22fc84-3928-7f09-a8c8-bf50990d35dc/0617465036729.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"bf6e49","textColor2":"e37244","textColor4":"b65b36","textColor1":"ef8a5b","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Parisalexa","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/finishline-ep/1590599833","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-12","name":"Finishline - EP","recordLabel":"Payday Records","upc":"0617465036729","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Payday Records, Inc., a division of Ultra Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1590599833","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}}]}
