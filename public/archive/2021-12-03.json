The first songs, “Present” and “Backseat,” are solo outings, with the singer displaying a savvy proficiency in both the nostalgic past and the fluid present. But it's when he calls on some heavy-hitter peers for the remaining tracks that we're really reminded of his bona fides.<br />\n“Retrograde” is a wounded fame-is-hard-but-love-is-harder jam that features Lucky Daye and 6LACK—with whom he's had a magnetic artistic chemistry since 2018's “OTW”—and duets with QUIN (“Brand New”) and Kiana Ledé (“Voicemail”) are tender in their intertwined melodies. On “Open,” he's joined by Majid Jordan for a sensual slow-burner, while “All I Feel Is Rain,” with JID, and “Scenic Drive,” with Smino and Ari Lennox, provide still soulful injections of hip-hop. Khalid's collaborators all have starpower on their own, but he's never outshined here; instead, he uses the unique qualities of his voice to highlight those of his guests to striking effect. For an artist who introduced himself as an “American teen,” <i>Scenic Drive</i> is silky smooth maturation.","short":"The singer gets in his R&B bag, and it’s an absolute triumph."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1593949629","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1593949629?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/55/c9/f0/55c9f0eb-2ef8-8738-743f-effa1d6d6ff4/886449384075.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cba8c4","textColor2":"f8b7ed","textColor4":"cf9bc5","textColor1":"f3c7eb","bgColor":"2c2b26","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Polo G","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hall-of-fame-2-0/1593949629","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":34,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-08","name":"Hall of Fame 2.0","recordLabel":"Columbia","upc":"886449384075","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1593949629","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In the official album trailer for Polo G’s <i>Hall of Fame 2.0</i>, where the Michael Jackson-sampling “Bad Man (Smooth Criminal)” plays in the background, Polo explains that the first <i>Hall of Fame</i> “was me beating my chest, really coming into my own as an artist and showing I’m here to stay.” He goes on to contextualize <i>2.0</i> as the closing of this same chapter while encouraging fans to “turn up this one more time.” It goes without saying that at this point in his young career, the self-proclaimed GOAT truly does have a catalog worth celebrating, but in the case of <i>Hall of Fame 2.0</i>, turning up is hardly the full story.<br />\nAcross <i>2.0</i>, Polo G is as lucid, thoughtful, and reflective as he’s ever been.

If I’m feeling happy, then I’m out with my friends and actually living life—so I gravitate towards songwriting when I need it.” But while the Toronto singer/producer’s first full-length effort, <i>ALPHA</i>, reverberates with all the heartache and intense introspection that made her earlier EPs (2016’s <i>CDW</i> and 2018’s <i>Stone Woman</i>) so compelling, she’s using the album format to provide a more “all-encompassing” portrait of herself. That means not only expanding her style of nocturnal, slow-motion R&B to absorb cinematic soul grooves, group gospel sing-alongs, pitch-shifted harmonies, indie-disco jams, and even Neil Young nods, but also opening herself up lyrically in ways she never has before. As a songwriter, Wilson admits she “always comes back to love—it’s corny, but I do think love and relationships really are the meaning of life.” However, unlike her previous forays into the topic, the songs on <i>ALPHA</i> are clearly written through a queer lens, providing the sort of intimate snapshots of relationships between women that still feel all too rare even in a diversified 2020s pop landscape. “I got more comfortable in my ability to just really spell out who I’m singing about,” Wilson says. “I didn’t really feel like I needed to be mysterious anymore. Not that I’m trying to do anything revolutionary by being a woman singing about women—that’s a narrative that should be normalized. I just want to make the music that I want to hear.” Wilson explains how she did it with this track-by-track guide.<br />\n<b>“Strangers”</b>\n“I feel like the first few lyrics on this song set up the record in a way that felt just intriguing. There’s a lot of unrequited love and longing on this record, and I wanted to start with a feeling of almost desperation. Everything on this song is me—I just pitched down my voice for the harmonies.”<br />\n<b>“I Can Only Whisper” (feat. BADBADNOTGOOD)</b>\n“I actually wrote this song partly in my sleep. I woke up and just had that line in my head—‘I can only whisper’—and then I wrote all of the lyrics in my head lying in bed. And then I came up with the melodies, and my brain was also pretty much composing the chords around all the melodies. It all just kind of made sense in this really insane way. I recorded the song a few different times with a few different approaches, and I wasn’t really liking how it was feeling. I knew I wanted it to feel like an old soul song, so eventually, I was just like, ‘OK, BADBAD just needs to play the drums and the bassline and get that kind of groove that they’re so good at.’ So, basically, the drums and bass are BADBAD and then all the other sounds are just me building around that.\"<br />\n<b>“If I Could”</b>\n“[Toronto R&B singer] Merna Bishouty wrote the lyrics to this song. We met through a mutual friend and had a fun night out, and then we were like, ‘Oh, we should go to the studio together.’ And I don’t really tend to do that very often with other people’s music—I’ve never sung someone else’s song. But we really connected on a lot of different levels. She’s a queer woman, we were both going through similar things in our relationships at the time, and she played me a version of this song, and I was just completely blown away. Growing up, I didn’t have any gay people in my surroundings. My parents are super supportive and proud, and they have a Pride flag on their porch, but it was never like, ‘Oh, you could be gay and that would be OK!’ That was never a conversation we had. I didn’t have anyone to look to in that way. So, I was deeply closeted for my whole life, until I left for university. I think I had an idea of what Merna’s meaning was for the song, but for me, when I sing it, I very much feel like I’m singing it to a younger version of myself.”<br />\n<b>“Lovesick Utopia”</b>\n“Before I started putting music out as Charlotte Day Wilson, I was writing a lot of folk music, and that was the main thing I was comfortable doing. And I think the reason why I haven’t done it quite as much is just because I had already done it in my own private life, and I wanted to grow and evolve. But when I sing these more folky acoustic songs, that feels like the most true version of how I started playing music and how I started writing songs. So, in some sense, I guess this song is a departure for me—or for the perception of how I write—but for me, it’s quite familiar. I was at my cottage with the person I was seeing at the time, and she was listening to Neil Young’s ‘Harvest Moon’ a lot. And then, I had a morning where I was just alone in the woods, and I wrote this song on acoustic guitar.”<br />\n<b>“Mountains”</b>\n“I wrote this with a group of people in LA: Brandon Banks, Kyla Moscovich, Teo Halm, Daniel Caesar, Babyface, Mk.Gee—there’s so many people on this song, I don’t even know if I would be able to remember them all. The interesting thing about songwriting is that, sometimes, even after you’ve written a song, you don’t really know where it was coming from, or what it was about. With this one, a few of us wrote that chorus together, and then I went in and wrote the verse by myself. At the time, I don’t think I was fully conscious of the fact that the relationship I was in was not working for me. But I think, subconsciously, I knew. And that’s what ended up coming out in the music—the honesty that you can’t quite speak out loud to yourself.”<br />\n<b>“Danny’s Interlude”</b>\n“Danny [Caesar] wrote this and sent it to me, and I just thought it was a beautiful ending to ‘Mountains.’ It takes us out of that song in a nice way and leads us to ‘Changes.’”<br />\n<b>“Changes”</b>\n“I’m hesitant to talk about it sometimes, because it’s so personal, but this is about the journey of going from being an aspiring singer who works as a janitor at a church to someone that has a public career off of their art. That’s been an intense change for me. There’s always going to be ups and downs, and pros and cons to that kind of life adjustment.”<br />\n<b>“Take Care of You” (feat. Syd)</b>\n“I wrote this at my cottage and, when I came back to Toronto, I played what I had for Merna, who cowrote ‘If I Could.’ I was like, ‘I want to write a no-nuance, lesbian R&B love song!’ We jokingly wrote the verses of this song—it was all supposed to be about converting religious imagery and making it gay. And I never thought I would put it out. But then I showed it to my managers and they were like, ‘No, this is actually really good!’ And I was like, ‘OK, well, maybe I should get another singer to feature on it.’ In my head, I always thought Syd would be the perfect one. And then I was with a friend in LA who works with her, and he sent it to her. She loved it and recorded her verse that same day and sent it back. Everything about this song was quite easy and fun. You can feel that in the record.”<br />\n<b>“Keep Moving”</b>\n“I was driving back from the cottage—everything on this record is about the cottage, for some reason!—with my partner at the time. It was right after Pride, and she thought it would be a cool music-video idea to film the Dykes on Bikes. Every Pride parade begins with these iconic, older lesbians on their bikes. And my partner was like, ‘Imagine documenting the Dykes on Bikes in a really cinematic and beautiful way. I don’t feel like anyone’s really done that.’ And I loved that idea. I was like, ‘That would be amazing...but I just don’t know what song I would do that to.’ So, then I wrote ‘Keep Moving’ with that video concept in mind.”<br />\n<b>“Wish It Was Easy”</b>\n“I was working with this amazing producer in LA named Dylan Wiggins. We were at Raphael Saadiq’s studio, and there was a really beautiful sounding piano there. Dylan was playing around on some chords and wrote this really nice progression. And I was really, really going through stuff in my relationship, so everything just flowed out of me in 10 minutes. It was one of those songs that was very stream-of-consciousness.”<br />\n<b>“Adam Complex”</b>\n“This song is probably the most vulnerable song I’ve ever written. It’s cryptic because my brain is also cryptic and kind of nonsensical sometimes, so that’s probably reflected a little bit in the stream-of-consciousness approach of this song. It’s about a feeling of inferiority and a deep fear of being left by a woman for a man.”","short":"“It’s corny, but I do think love and relationships are the meaning of life.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1588766591","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1588766591?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/bf/87/3d/bf873da9-5126-5476-48c8-18b686c9103a/886449561025.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"c6573e","textColor2":"e86361","textColor4":"be5352","textColor1":"f16748","bgColor":"171516","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Pete Tong","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pete-tong-friends-ibiza-classics/1588766591","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-03","name":"Pete Tong + Friends: Ibiza Classics","recordLabel":"Ministry of Sound Recordings","upc":"886449561025","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Under Exclusive Licence to Ministry of Sound Recordings Limited","playParams":{"id":"1588766591","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The name Pete Tong has been synonymous with the dancefloor hedonism of Ibiza ever since he became the first BBC Radio 1 DJ to host his show live from the White Isle in 1995. Since 2015, Tong has celebrated this special relationship, alongside conductor Jules Buckley and his Heritage Orchestra, with a series of live shows and albums reimagining house classics made famous in Ibiza super-clubs. The resulting three albums, sold out shows and a BBC Prom have revitalized everything from Inner City’s “Good Life”, to Moloko’s “Sing It Back”. Spurred on by a pandemic-induced global club shutdown, here Tong presents a self-described “maxi EP/mini album”, centering on the theme of Ibiza Classics in collaboration. “I wanted these projects to be more than just cover versions–they’re adaptations,” Tong tells Apple Music. “We’re being creative with the production and each track on this record has a collaborator with a personal connection to the original.”<br />\nThe resulting eight tracks span everything from the majestic orchestrations of Hans Zimmer’s “Time”, taken from his score for <i>Inception</i>, to the raucous trance energy of System F’s “Out Of The Blue”, and an original composition with Danish producer Kölsch , “When We Move”. Read on for Tong’s thoughts on the record, track by track.<br />  \n<b>“Hideaway” (with Eats Everything & Vula, feat. Jules Buckley)</b> \n“This is a track from our live show that we never got around to recording, but it’s really taken on a life of its own over the few years we’ve been playing it. The De’Lacy original was never a commercial hit and we’ve made the chorus more of a singalong moment now. Eats Everything has been to many of our shows and he’s always texting me that he wants to do a track with us. He’s well versed in house music history and this was one that he really wanted to get involved in. Vula is also the lead singer of the Heritage Orchestra and has organized all our vocalists since day one. It felt only right to make her the lead vocalist for this.”<br />\n<b>“Ghosts” (with Kölsch, feat. Jules Buckley)</b> \n“I’ve worked many times with Kölsch while DJing and we’re good friends. He suggested that we work on a Thomas Newman string movement called ‘Ghosts’, which was used in an old trance classic by Reflekt called ‘Need to Feel Loved’, as well as a Joe T Vannelli tune called ‘The End’. The Reflekt version has been on my list of tracks to do from 2015 and we started playing around with it and came up with our own adaptation—we called it ‘Ghosts’ because it’s a lot closer to the original.”<br />\n<b>“Time” (with Tale Of Us, feat. Jules Buckley)</b> \n“I’m a massive Christopher Nolan fan and <i>Inception</i> is a cult movie amongst the DJ community. Tale of Us had made their own DJ version of the song “Time” from its soundtrack a couple of years ago but they couldn’t clear the sample. I loved it and asked them if they wanted to record it properly with the orchestra, as I could get to Hans Zimmer, who wrote it. He gave us his blessing, as well as all the score for <i>Inception</i>, and then we had a lockdown session where Jules was in Berlin, conducting an orchestra virtually in Prague with me engineering in London. I then gave it back to Tale Of Us who were back in Milan and they finished it off. I finally got to play it with them in Ibiza this year which was fantastic.”<br />\n<b>“Out of the Blue” (with Franky Wah, feat. Jules Buckley)</b>\n“I have a strong history with this track. The original record is by System F, aka the trance DJ Ferry Corsten, which I signed in the ’90s to my label FFRR and it was a massive hit. We hadn’t added any new trance bangers to the show and this was the perfect track to do. I had to find a collaborator who is a fan of System F and it turns out Franky Wah was. I didn’t even have to give him a sketch, he started it and came up with the whole arrangement from the beginning. It has this disguised intro which is very much Franky’s sound and then suddenly it drops into the mad, recognizably trance bit from the original. It’s going to be a lot of fun to play this in the show.”<br /> \n<b>“Love Can’t Turn Around” (with Riton & Vula, feat. Jules Buckley & The Heritage Orchestra)</b> \n“This is one of the first house records I ever signed, back in 1986. I went over to the US and put together a compilation of house music called <i>The House Sound of Chicago Volume One</i>. The album has become an iconic piece of house history and this Farley Jackmaster Funk track features on it in its original form. When Farley went to The Warehouse in Chicago, he heard Frankie Knuckles play a Ron Hardy bootleg of an Isaac Hayes track called ‘I Can’t Turn Around’, and that is what he adapted for this tune. Riton is an aficionado of house history and when I played him that Ron Hardy version, he was really into it. He took it from there.”<br /> \n<b>“When We Move” (with Kölsch& Elderbrook, feat. Jules Buckley)</b> \n“I’d been playing around with a very famous house and techno monster for a couple of years, which I wrote some new chords over and then sent to Jules and Vula, who added words and melody. I then sent it to Kölsch and he took the top line off, but really elaborated on what I did musically. He also took the sample away and convinced me to make it an original composition. We kept working on it and got Elderbrook in to come up with a few more ideas and ultimately it became entirely its own track.”<br /> \n<b>“Age Of Love” (with ARTBAT, feat. Jules Buckley)</b> \n“This track has been remixed a lot—Solomun released a version a couple of years ago and Charlotte de Witte did it this year too. I reached out to ARTBAT, who are two DJs and producers from Kiev, and they were in love with the original part, so I got hold of the label that owns the rights and then they sketched out an idea really quickly, within 48 hours. They immediately started playing it themselves but I told them to hold on for the orchestra. Little did we know that it would take 18 months to record them. Eventually, this summer, we had one big session where we recorded the orchestra in Prague. We then gave it back to ARTBAT and they did their thing to take it to the master level. It was a long journey but it was worth it.”<br />\n<b>“You Got The Love [Live]” (with Becky Hill, feat. The Heritage Orchestra & Jules Buckley)</b> \n“When we first started performing this live, it was on our 2017 tour where we managed to get the original singer Candi Staton out. She was quite frail though, so we knew she wouldn’t always be singing it with us. On ensuing shows, we began performing it with Becky Hill and she then made the song her own. If you were in a real band in the old days, you’d play your songs 100 times before you ever went in and recorded them. With this song, I feel like we’re a proper band since we’ve played it so many times live. This recording is from The O2 in 2019 and is 100 percent live. It crucially gets the audience on the record, since they’re our heroes and the reason we’re still here.”\n","short":"“These aren’t cover versions—they’re adaptations.”\n"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1589008580","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589008580?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/1b/30/45/1b304541-1b33-ee1a-0b4d-17943683a3e4/21CRGIM29371.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a4866c","textColor2":"da997b","textColor4":"af7a62","textColor1":"cda887","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Kenny G","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-standards/1589008580","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-03","name":"New Standards","recordLabel":"Concord Records","upc":"00888072408371","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Concord Jazz, Distributed by Concord.","playParams":{"id":"1589008580","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1596130025","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1596130025?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/67/7e/1b/677e1be1-bc96-5732-c388-b193fab00ebd/KAI_M02_Peaches_4000_4000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"432f37","textColor2":"451826","textColor4":"673f4b","textColor1":"17040e","bgColor":"f0dcdd","hasP3":false},"artistName":"KAI","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/peaches-the-2nd-mini-album-ep/1596130025","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-11-30","name":"Peaches - The 2nd Mini Album - EP","recordLabel":"SM Entertainment","upc":"888735939624","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 SM Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1596130025","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The EXO dynamo reclaims the spotlight with a spirited K-pop EP.","short":"The EXO dynamo reclaims the spotlight with a spirited K-pop EP."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1586999225","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1586999225?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/95/af/2d/95af2d3f-a8d2-25ca-6771-18554b634746/192641830969_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"2d2e2e","textColor2":"1d1f1d","textColor4":"3f4140","textColor1":"060706","bgColor":"c9cacc","hasP3":false},"artistName":"No Rome","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-all-smiles/1586999225","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-03","name":"It's All Smiles","recordLabel":"Dirty Hit","upc":"192641830969","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Dirty Hit","playParams":{"id":"1586999225","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"No Rome hadn’t planned to make his debut album back in his home country. He was supposed to be in the Philippines only for a festival appearance, but the artist born Guendoline Rome Viray Gomez found himself stranded there after the pandemic kicked in. He opted to use the creative restrictions imposed by the fact that most of his gear was back at home in London as a creative challenge, though. <i>It’s All Smiles</i> is the exhilarating result. “I only had what I had brought over, which was a couple of samplers, a drum machine, a guitar, and an interface,” he tells Apple Music. “I only had X amount of possibilities, but I wanted to stretch that out.”<br />\nWorking with coproducers BJ Burton and The 1975’s George Daniel, he has crafted a debut album that melds layers of guitar with synth-pop and smooth hooks—not for nothing did No Rome once describe his original sound as “shoegaze R&B.” He says there’s a recurrent theme of “belongingness” throughout <i>It’s All Smiles</i>, a feeling that is lonely, aggressive, and hopeful all at the same time. “I wanted to express whatever I was going through at the time. Being in the Philippines was very therapeutic for me; things started feeling nostalgic.” Here, No Rome takes us through <i>It’s All Smiles</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Space-Cowboy”</b>\n“I knew this was going to be the intro because it set up the whole idea of the album with the production, the whole nocturnal setting because I was writing everything at night. The title is a reference to one of my favorite animes, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>. It’s this line ‘See you, space cowboy,’ which I’ve always resonated with for some reason.”<br />\n<b>“How Are You Feeling?”</b>\n“I wanted to make a record that had drum ’n’ bass and rock being mashed up together. This was at the right tempo to bring in some kind of jungle drums, along with the guitar that was a little bit bright and melodic. For me, it sounded a bit like being around the alleys of New York, hearing street musicians and how everything is so busy.”<br />\n<b>“I Want U”</b>\n“I feel like this is the song that started the record. It’s the oldest song; I wrote it in 2019. It was the first song I worked on with BJ, and it’s where we got all the ideas I wanted to do with the record. It’s about a long night out. It’s saying, ‘It’s up to you. I got my decisions, but it’s up to you.” The chorus kind of explains what it is and what the feelings are.”<br />\n<b>“ITS *N0T* LOV33 (Winter in London)”</b>\n“I wrote this in winter in London in 2019. I recorded the guitars on the Apple microphone, and I wanted to keep it that way. I wanted to be able to keep that kind of voice-note sound, almost like found sounds, which is what the whole record is. Everything feels like a collage of found sounds. It’s about how you’re not in love with a person, but you need them around for some reason. It’s that confusion. I’ve always loved interludes on albums, short pieces that are mainly instrumental. It’s that moment that you’re trying to paint an expression with production.”<br />\n<b>When She Comes Around”</b>\n“I feel like this is such a positive song. You’re having closure with somebody, but the love is still there at the end of the day. It was a song I wrote immediately after I was watching Björk’s <i>Vespertine</i> live performance, where she had a whole orchestra. I wanted to make a string song, something super dramatic and kind of theatrical. I started this with strings, but then ended up playing around the guitars and I heard some chords that I liked that fit, and I was just like, ‘OK, I’m turning this into a shoegaze song.’”<br />\n<b>“Secret Beach”</b>\n“I started this album in Subic in the Philippines, and this is one of the songs that I first started there with a CR-78 drum machine and Fender Strat I had lying around. I wanted to make something that was a little bit Deftones, but my take on it, and my love for Kid Cudi and all this other music. I’m paying homage to this place called Secret Beach in Subic. Most of the time, there’s nobody there; you’ve got to be a local to know it. It was a place where I would come to find some kind of solace and peace and just to hang out. It’s a very introspective song about the things that I was going through at the time—I lost some friends—and just trying to find myself.”<br />\n<b>“Issues (After Dark)”</b>\n“It was just me playing the guitar on a chorus pedal, and a lot of flanger and reverb, and I was singing this whole R&B melody over some really shoegaze-y flanger guitars, and then we time-stretched it. BJ plugged it in the tape machine and just stretched it out, and it became this.”<br />\n<b>“Remember November / Bitcrush*Yr*Life”</b>\n“This is two songs. If you listen to the track, there’s two parts, then it brings it back to what the original song was. I wanted to play with this whole idea of having a major seventh, almost diminished, making it bright and then going to this dark place for a breakdown, and it goes to this ravey double-time, faster part of the song. It’s my take on wanting to make some sort of political pop piece, because I sing about the powers that be. It was inspired by a friend of mine who works in an office, and she has a bad boss and a very abusive boss. Hearing stories like that from friends, it boils me up and it gets me all tense and shit.”<br />\n<b>“A Place Where Nobody Knows”</b>\n“I think this is the sweetest song on the record. It’s about being there for somebody and talking about when you have that spot, where you and your significant other can just be there at ease and at peace, having that place where you feel safe. It’s a very D’Angelo beat, half-time.”<br />\n<b>“Everything”</b>\n““Everything’ <i>is</i> everything. I tried to put everything this album is about into it: hyperactive energy, sonically, and it goes to this rock part at the end. It felt like a curtain-closer song. And also, it’s a song I’d written about psychedelics, which, not to be political about it, but I’m for it. I feel like people should do it at least once. It’s that moment where you get to a pure bliss and, at the same time, you just feel everything all at once. In that first line where I go, ‘Sun hits when the mood’s right/We can do everything if we try, my friend,’ it’s like you’re happy that the sun is there, you’re just so positive and you feel like you could do anything you want.”","short":"“I wanted to express whatever I was going through.”
