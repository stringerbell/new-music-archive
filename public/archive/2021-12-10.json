For an artist with over two decades’ worth of work under her belt, that means considerations of both time and style. In one breath, she wanted to pay homage, as she explains to Apple Music's Ebro: “The goal was to own my greatness, to own the shoulders that I stand on, to recognize the classic, iconic artists that I couldn't even breathe without.” And in another, she wanted to honor the love and lineage she shares with hip-hop by sampling herself to reveal those songs anew. Thus, she divides <i>KEYS</i> between a first half she calls “Originals” and a second half titled “Unlocked.” <br />\n“Originals” is largely a showcase of the singer-songwriter's essence that leans heavily towards jazz. In her own words, it was “born off the simplicity of a piano, of a pen, and of a voice,” and songs like “Love When You Call My Name,” “Daffodils,” and “Like Water” reflect this spirit with artful elegance. The first half functions as a throwback to her classic sounds—all raw emotion, grit, and soul. The “Unlocked” section takes bits and pieces of the first and reconfigures them, often into slightly bigger sounds with the help of producer Mike WiLL Made-It. Analog melodies and understated arrangements are met with programmed bass or lines of synth; the magnificent speakeasy texture of “Old Memories” morphs into an '80s dance club, while the gorgeous and solemn blues of “Is It Insane” (a song written during Keys' <i>Diary</i> era) becomes something more sultry. Through it all, the qualities that made Keys a showstopper remain. Whether acoustic and raw or highly produced and polished, she performs in service of a vision that is now, as it was then, transcendent and uniquely her own—two sides of the same invaluable coin.","short":"The singer both returns to form and evolves on her double album."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1599321200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599321200?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c4/64/56/c4645672-9c46-6dc5-fa3d-73a79fa6286c/075679761453.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"342e2f","textColor2":"361d2a","textColor4":"544049","textColor1":"0d070a","bgColor":"cecec6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"A Boogie wit da Hoodie","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/b4-ava/1599321200","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"B4 AVA","recordLabel":"Highbridge the Label / Atlantic Records","upc":"075679761453","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation and Highbridge The Label, LLC.","playParams":{"id":"1599321200","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A Boogie wit da Hoodie fans have come to distinguish between his A Boogie and Artist musical personalities as equally essential sides of the Bronx-hailing MC: A Boogie is the worry-free rock star, while Artist (Boogie’s government name) is the eternally heartbroken R&B singer.

As the title suggests, the songs here hinge on the rapper's inner battles, and it's a brutal listen. He goes round after round with his addictions, mental health, and self-destructive behaviors, seemingly fighting back and giving up in turns. Metro Boomin's gorgeous string-propelled production on opening track “Burn” brims with melancholy to set the mood for what's to come—as Juice declares midway through, “The truth hurts, let it bleed out.”<br />\nAnd there are many painful truths to reckon with on <i>Fighting Demons</i>. “Rockstar in His Prime” dispels the notion that money and fame are any match for inner turmoil and the quest to numb or escape it. His dance with death, whether as a lifeline or a foregone conclusion, exposes the depth of darkness that can poison a mind; what is a platitude to someone who, as he admits on the harrowing “Already Dead,” hasn't felt alive in years? It's uncomfortable but worthwhile to understand what a person is up against and to consider that the act of saying it aloud, without fear of judgment, may not be glorification but a potential path to healing.<br />\nWhen the possibility of better days seems tenuous at best, Juice still finds a way to summon something akin to optimism. “Understand, none of these drugs make the person I am/Sober up, I can, sorry but I can't,” he raps on “Feel Alone,” before falling into his signature melodies: “Hope to see tomorrow, the potency of sorrow/I was thinking hopefully, maybe hopefully, there's some dopamine I could borrow.” The candor in his lyrics, spilling out in detail like private journal entries, is relentless, but his courage to share anyway is inspiring. <i>Fighting Demons</i> is as much a cautionary tale as a heroic one—may we never forget that Juice fought for his life until the very end, as the tenacity of his artistry continues to shine beyond the grave.","short":"The rapper’s second posthumous album is a cautionary tale—and a heroic one."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1589489498","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589489498?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/25/1b/9f/251b9f2b-2f3b-ef56-d0a6-ae8860d43f05/093624878414.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2d252a","textColor2":"1e120c","textColor4":"352f34","textColor1":"140500","bgColor":"90a5d2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Neil Young & Crazy Horse","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/barn/1589489498","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"Barn","recordLabel":"Reprise","upc":"093624878414","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2020 The Other Shoe Productions, Inc. under exclusive license to Reprise Records.","playParams":{"id":"1589489498","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Neil Young recorded his 41st album—and 12th with longtime backing band Crazy Horse—at a restored barn high in the Colorado Rockies. “Made it just like it was in the old drawings and photographs,” he tells Apple Music. “It used to be a stage stop, so you’d see these pictures with the carriages and the horses and the ladies with their big dresses with the metal ring and everything.”<br />\nThe songs here are succinct, the sound folksy and (relatively) subdued: <i>Harvest</i> without the strings, or <i>Homegrown</i> without the drugs. The band is as powerful and primal as they were in the ’70s (“Heading West”), but their politics are sharper (“Change Ain’t Never Gonna”), and their tenderness more tender (“Don’t Forget Love”). And if the hushed volatility of the eight-and-a-half-minute “Welcome Back” doesn’t convince you that they think of their music as being just as nuanced and transitory as jazz, nothing will. As drummer Ralph Molina put it when the take was done, “Neil just did some heavy shit.” So they kept it.<br />\nBut it is amazing that it took them more than 50 years to record an album called <i>Barn</i>, if only because the music they’ve made feels so true to its title: simple, stoic, durable, timeless. Describing the recording process here, Young says he scheduled sessions so that he and the band—Molina, Billy Talbot, and longtime accomplice Nils Lofgren replacing the retired Frank Sampedro—could work in moonlight, after walking a couple of miles to the studio, “across the meadow, through the valley,” just him and his dogs. “The Rockies are everywhere,” he says of the scene. “And it’s just beautiful. I like that.”","short":"Bringing it all back home, 50 years on."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1598156685","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598156685?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/34/c2/1d/34c21d03-b6ba-9b2e-d7a6-1d4f1bfdea08/21UM1IM46625.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d56652","textColor2":"e5813f","textColor4":"c46934","textColor1":"fa7d65","bgColor":"420807","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Hotboii","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-of-a-hotboii/1598156685","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"Life Of A Hotboii","recordLabel":"Hotboii","upc":"00602445274239","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Rebel/Geffen Records","playParams":{"id":"1598156685","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1596868386","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1596868386?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/58/13/c3/5813c326-a7fa-f792-77e1-8310d9c80742/886449738724.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5cbe1","textColor2":"03a2fe","textColor4":"0b81e1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e006c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Rauw Alejandro","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vice-versa/1596868386","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-06-25","name":"VICE VERSA","recordLabel":"Sony Music Latin/Duars Entertainment","upc":"886449738724","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC/Duars Entertainment, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1596868386","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1594480097","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1594480097?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/e3/fc/69/e3fc69f5-7038-195f-c857-7a7d87ab67e3/193436275651_01_img001.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"172b34","textColor2":"232325","textColor4":"33454f","textColor1":"000204","bgColor":"74cff5","hasP3":false},"artistName":"HIXTAPE","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hixtape-vol-2/1594480097","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"HIXTAPE: Vol. 2","recordLabel":"Big Loud Records","upc":"193436275651","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Big Loud Records","playParams":{"id":"1594480097","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1599656830","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599656830?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1600,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/83/b2/2c/83b22c5a-e2ad-3ce6-66ae-4cc77fa041ca/190296329036.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1600,"textColor3":"bcc2bb","textColor2":"b0c79b","textColor4":"91a380","textColor1":"e6eee5","bgColor":"121413","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Birdman & YoungBoy Never Broke Again","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-the-bayou/1599656830","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"From The Bayou","recordLabel":"Never Broke Again","upc":"190296329036","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Big38 Enterprise / Cash Money","playParams":{"id":"1599656830","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1597337256","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1597337256?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b8/f8/dd/b8f8dde8-72c0-4a78-0477-a29ff2419689/21UM1IM40177.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2bc46","textColor2":"dbb05b","textColor4":"b48d4a","textColor1":"edeb57","bgColor":"160203","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tierra Whack","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pop-single/1597337256","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":3,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-09","name":"Pop?

The album’s 12 tracks stand in stark opposition to the contemporary trend of bloated and overlong rap releases, Ross coming across particularly forthright in his bars here. “I wanna stack my money, be a better father,” he raps on “Little Havana.” Elsewhere he’s drawing parallels between Emmett Till and George Floyd (“Marathon”), delivering one of the darkest strip club anthems in recent memory (“Wiggle”), and celebrating how far he’s come as a hustler (“Made It Out Alive”). He’s called on a shortlist of collaborators that span the eras of his career, including old favorites like The-Dream, Wale, and Wiz Khalifa and newer voices like Benny the Butcher, Blxst, and Yungeen Ace, and then, because the brand must remain intact at all times, he includes a voice note from Miami kingpin Willy Falcon (“Little Havana”), who, of course, thanks Ross for “keeping my name in your music for the past two decades.”","short":"The biggest boss that we’ve seen thus far is both richer and

multiple award-winning Alejandro Sanz returns with a semi-eponymous album produced, once more, with Alfonso Pérez. A mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation that feels altogether organic, <i>Sanz</i> plays to his strengths as a performer, which have gained deeper resonance with age. The mature balladry of “Yo No Quiero Suerte” and the soft-rock sincerity of “Si Yo Quisiera Y Si Tú Pudieras” show just how well he can execute expressive pop. He lives up to his deserved reputation for flamenco flair through songs like “La Rosa,” featuring the late guitarist Paco de Lucía.","short":"The multiple award-winning artist returns with a modern yet mature album."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1598949233","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598949233?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1401,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/86/80/ef/8680ef1e-3d6f-dbf4-e4ea-c27a7a855779/Sol_Rising_-_11.01.21_Apple_DJ_Mix_1hr_15_Min_Vol_1_v2.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1401,"textColor3":"3f3e3e","textColor2":"242d36","textColor4":"50575e","textColor1":"0f0d0e","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sol Rising","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/75-min-yoga-vol-1-dj-mix/1598949233","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Downtempo"],"trackCount":21,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"75 Min Yoga, Vol. 1 (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381820367","audioTraits":["lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1598949233","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“A vibey 75-minute yoga mix featuring my latest material as well as my favorite lo-fi electronic and chill house jams.” —Sol Rising","short":"Dial in your practice to downtempo beats and laidback instrumentals."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1597745674","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1597745674?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c9/19/94/c9199434-d3a4-7f4f-4cbe-26633a95714e/190296321078.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"75a0b8","textColor2":"4f9adf","textColor4":"407fbf","textColor1":"91c3d6","bgColor":"05123e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Micro Tdh","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nueve/1597745674","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-09","name":"NUEVE","recordLabel":"WEA Latina","upc":"190296321078","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Under Exclusive License to Warner Music Latina, ℗ 2021 KING TDH LLC","playParams":{"id":"1597745674","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1598175608","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598175608?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/da/13/98/da1398cd-c9b4-10d4-3932-63395eec34bf/21UM1IM29726.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"343835","textColor2":"372826","textColor4":"5c514e","textColor1":"040907","bgColor":"f2f4ef","hasP3":false},"artistName":"TM88 & Pi'erre Bourne","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yo-88/1598175608","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"Yo!88","recordLabel":"Capitol Records","upc":"00602445082537","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Capitol Records/Interscope Records; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1598175608","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1598216758","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598216758?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/b6/05/81/b60581e0-5145-785c-d6d3-8624929aeb9e/075679762634.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"cfcfd0","textColor2":"c2f7fd","textColor4":"9fc9cf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121317","hasP3":false},"artistName":"PnB Rock","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/2-get-you-thru-the-rain-ep/1598216758","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"2 Get You Thru The Rain - EP","recordLabel":"Atlantic Records","upc":"075679762634","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1598216758","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"PnB Rock kept something of a low profile after 2019’s <i>TrapStar Turnt PopStar</i>, but it’s not like his musical relationships suffered for it. The opening song on the Philly crooner’s <i>2 Get You Thru the Rain</i> EP—PnB Rock’s first release since <i>TrapStar</i>—features none other than two of Atlanta’s most in-demand MCs, Young Thug and Lil Baby. They are, to be clear, the only credited features on the EP, but that's a heck of a way to reintroduce yourself to the listening public. The remainder of the EP is an extension of that reintroduction, Rock delivering his signature brand of street-tinged R&B across odes to the women in his life (“You Got Me,” “That’s My Bad”), a song exalting the romantic powers of weed (“HIGH”), and a meditation on the friends and family he’s had to say goodbye to (“Lost U 2 Da Game”). It’s unclear what Rock means when he alludes to getting us <i>Thru the Rain</i>, but if inclement weather is what it takes to get more PnB Rock music, let’s get this guy on a plane to Seattle.","short":"The preeminent voice of Philadelphia-bred street-tinged R&B

Composed and premiered in 2021 amid so much global upheaval, the intimate <i>Symphony No. 14</i> for string orchestra begins on a note of reflective calm underpinned by rolling arpeggios and bracing harmonies. “Movement II” suspends eerie, fragile themes above rocking accompaniment, while the final movement moves dramatically from chamber introspection to full-orchestra intensity. <i>Piano Concerto No. 1 “Tirol”</i>, composed in 2000, turns the traditional notion of a concerto on its head, with its tranquil outer movements surrounding a rhythmic, driving heart. British concert pianist Martin James Bartlett and the LGT Young Soloists are alive to every subtlety of this beautiful work.","short":"A rare chance to hear a new work by the great minimalist composer."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1589992331","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589992331?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/ad/62/e0/ad62e0bf-7411-659c-de46-fb9407100ee2/635212068328.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"393938","textColor2":"2b0f28","textColor4":"553f53","textColor1":"070706","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The King's Singers","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-carols-with-the-kings-singers/1589992331","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Vocal","Sacred","Holiday","Christmas: Classical"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-10-22","name":"Christmas Carols with The King's Singers","recordLabel":"Signum Records","upc":"635212068328","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Signum Records","playParams":{"id":"1589992331","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Honeyed singing and many favorites courtesy of a great vocal ensemble."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1595554857","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1595554857?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/c5/44/bd/c544bd3e-08e4-d89d-1b18-d21fe50051a1/886449717040.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"282a2e","textColor2":"261e1f","textColor4":"3f3b3d","textColor1":"09080d","bgColor":"a3b3b2","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dickon Hinchliffe","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-lost-daughter-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film/1595554857","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"The Lost Daughter (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)","recordLabel":"Milan","upc":"886449717040","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Maisie Music Publishing, LLC, under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1595554857","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}}]}
