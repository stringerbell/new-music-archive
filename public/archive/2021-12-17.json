The MC knows that quality takes time. <br />\nAs does securing contributions from some of hip-hop’s most in-demand feature artists, including Kodak Black, 21 Savage, Future, Takeoff, Gunna, and Lil Baby. But even those names only appear in service of Ricch’s vision. His goal across songs like “all good,” “rollercoastin,” “paid my dues,” “crash the party,” and “man made”—to name but a few—is to detail how good he’s already living, and then to express gratitude for the talent that got him there.<br />\nIt’s almost as if the way the music would be received wasn’t even a concern. “I feel like people think, why he don't put out a lot of music, or why he don't deal with a lot of artists?” he says. “But it's like when I do that song with NLE Choppa, and they go three times [platinum]…or when I do that song with 42 Dugg, and it goes platinum—I could really pop the shit that n***as can't pop. 'Cause it's like, some n***as is just doing songs, getting lucky.

The majority of the tracks are credited to the evolving NCT U: The single “Universe (Let’s Play Ball)” is stacked with layered vocal harmonies—a classic NCT move, no doubt bolstered by Doyoung, Jungwoo, Mark, Xiaojun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, YangYang, and Shotaro’s performance style. That’s also evidenced on the trap-forward “OK!”, the soulful R&B of “Know Now,” and the sultry piano-lounge music of “Sweet Dream.” The hard-hitting hip-hop and Y2K vocal coos of NCT 127 break through (“Earthquake”), as do the retro synth-pop and romantic vocal melodies of NCT DREAM (“Dreaming”); Chinese boy band sub-unit WayV delivers the English-language “Miracle.” On the closing track, all members of NCT (save for Winwin and Lucas, who’ve been absent this album cycle) team up for the life-affirming anthem “Beautiful.” It’s a lovely way to end their 2021 chapter: “You’re the most important person in your life,” Johnny opens the track. “So be yourself/Be beautiful.”","short":"The K-pop boy-band collective returns with their first full-length in a year."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1600512125","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600512125?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/4d/1c/f1/4d1cf159-43a9-2fbf-4643-9105fa539437/075679761682.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"b1afac","textColor2":"c3c1be","textColor4":"a3a19d","textColor1":"d4d3d0","bgColor":"241f1b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Gucci Mane","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/so-icy-christmas/1600512125","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"So Icy Christmas","recordLabel":"1017/Atlantic","upc":"075679761682","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 1017 Global Music, LLC and Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1600512125","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1599051999","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599051999?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0e/ce/b0/0eceb0eb-2722-f313-7941-b5ff94641b75/780163615425.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"342c2f","textColor2":"241e29","textColor4":"474046","textColor1":"0c040d","bgColor":"d5ccbb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jay Wadley","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/swan-song-soundtrack-from-the-apple-original-film/1599051999","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"Swan Song (Soundtrack from the Apple Original Film)","recordLabel":"Lakeshore Records","upc":"780163615425","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 SWAN SONG PRODUCTIONS, LLC, under exclusive license to Soundtrack Records Inc d/b/a Lakeshore Records.

As the title suggests, the songs here hinge on the rapper's inner battles, and it's a brutal listen. He goes round after round with his addictions, mental health, and self-destructive behaviors, seemingly fighting back and giving up in turns. Metro Boomin's gorgeous string-propelled production on opening track “Burn” brims with melancholy to set the mood for what's to come—as Juice declares midway through, “The truth hurts, let it bleed out.”<br />\nAnd there are many painful truths to reckon with on <i>Fighting Demons</i>. “Rockstar in His Prime” dispels the notion that money and fame are any match for inner turmoil and the quest to numb or escape it. His dance with death, whether as a lifeline or a foregone conclusion, exposes the depth of darkness that can poison a mind; what is a platitude to someone who, as he admits on the harrowing “Already Dead,” hasn't felt alive in years? It's uncomfortable but worthwhile to understand what a person is up against and to consider that the act of saying it aloud, without fear of judgment, may not be glorification but a potential path to healing.<br />\nWhen the possibility of better days seems tenuous at best, Juice still finds a way to summon something akin to optimism. “Understand, none of these drugs make the person I am/Sober up, I can, sorry but I can't,” he raps on “Feel Alone,” before falling into his signature melodies: “Hope to see tomorrow, the potency of sorrow/I was thinking hopefully, maybe hopefully, there's some dopamine I could borrow.” The candor in his lyrics, spilling out in detail like private journal entries, is relentless, but his courage to share anyway is inspiring. <i>Fighting Demons</i> is as much a cautionary tale as a heroic one—may we never forget that Juice fought for his life until the very end, as the tenacity of his artistry continues to shine beyond the grave.","short":"The rapper’s second posthumous album is a cautionary tale—and a heroic one."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1600170358","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600170358?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/94/50/7b/94507bef-46eb-17fd-7b71-3fd7a58cbab6/194690716775_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2000,"textColor3":"dddcd8","textColor2":"f2d898","textColor4":"d6c18e","textColor1":"faf9f5","bgColor":"656565","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Boldy James & The Alchemist","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/super-tecmo-bo/1600170358","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"Super Tecmo Bo","recordLabel":"ALC / Boldy James","upc":"194690716775","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 ALC / Boldy James","playParams":{"id":"1600170358","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1599582198","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599582198?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/2b/06/e3/2b06e3ea-e370-aaf9-4a0e-36a578d54e08/886449725465.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"262626","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor4":"393939","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"a7a7a7","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Eli Fross","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-book-of-eli/1599582198","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-15","name":"The Book of Eli","recordLabel":"Winners Circle/RCA Records","upc":"886449725465","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Winners Circle Entertainment, Inc. & RCA Records","playParams":{"id":"1599582198","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1599303001","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599303001?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/bd/ad/fd/bdadfd38-7cd2-73e7-f0ad-76438b8850db/22184.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"11cc0c","textColor2":"f97c64","textColor4":"ca6552","textColor1":"13fc0c","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Saucy Santana","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/keep-it-playa/1599303001","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-16","name":"Keep It Playa","recordLabel":"Under Exclusive License to Arena Music Productions, LLC","upc":"808391135611","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Under Exclusive License to Arena Music Productions, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1599303001","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1598209500","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598209500?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/66/00/ea/6600ead4-9c6d-bf69-60f4-f14c36448813/794043209833.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"afcac7","textColor2":"9ce0e4","textColor4":"7ebabd","textColor1":"daf4f0","bgColor":"042222","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Johnny Klimek & Tom Tykwer","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-matrix-resurrections-original-motion-picture/1598209500","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":35,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"The Matrix Resurrections (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"WaterTower Music","upc":"794043209833","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 This compilation\u202FWaterTower\u202FMusic as licensee for Warner Bros.

But with <i>Richer Than I Ever Been</i>, the Miami-hailing MC is not only crowning himself, but reveling in one of wealth’s most under-heralded privileges: creative freedom. The album’s 12 tracks stand in stark opposition to the contemporary trend of bloated and overlong rap releases, Ross coming across particularly forthright in his bars here. “I wanna stack my money, be a better father,” he raps on “Little Havana.” Elsewhere he’s drawing parallels between Emmett Till and George Floyd (“Marathon”), delivering one of the darkest strip club anthems in recent memory (“Wiggle”), and celebrating how far he’s come as a hustler (“Made It Out Alive”). He’s called on a shortlist of collaborators that span the eras of his career, including old favorites like The-Dream, Wale, and Wiz Khalifa and newer voices like Benny the Butcher, Blxst, and Yungeen Ace, and then, because the brand must remain intact at all times, he includes a voice note from Miami kingpin Willy Falcon (“Little Havana”), who, of course, thanks Ross for “keeping my name in your music for the past two decades.”","short":"The biggest boss that we’ve seen thus far is both richer and freer."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1590838815","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590838815?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/69/b4/a1/69b4a1dc-16ca-aef9-70c9-f26359c12383/4050538696592.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"343434","textColor2":"23091b","textColor4":"4f3a47","textColor1":"010204","bgColor":"fefef6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Johnny Marr","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fever-dreams-pt-2-ep/1590838815","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"Fever Dreams Pt. 2 - EP","recordLabel":"BMG Rights Management (UK) Ltd","upc":"4050538696592","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 New Voodoo Limited under exclusive licence to BMG Rights Management (UK) Limited","playParams":{"id":"1590838815","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1598036255","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1598036255?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/71/70/6e/71706ec8-64bc-a348-5135-5f4bfba5cf65/196292983289.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"413943","textColor2":"242437","textColor4":"504f5f","textColor1":"110714","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jewel","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/queen-of-hearts/1598036255","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-16","name":"Queen of Hearts","recordLabel":"Words Matter Media","upc":"196292983289","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Words Matter Media","playParams":{"id":"1598036255","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Masked Singer champ covers Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Sia, and more."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1599321200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599321200?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c4/64/56/c4645672-9c46-6dc5-fa3d-73a79fa6286c/075679761453.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"342e2f","textColor2":"361d2a","textColor4":"544049","textColor1":"0d070a","bgColor":"cecec6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"A Boogie wit da Hoodie","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/b4-ava/1599321200","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":7,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-10","name":"B4 AVA","recordLabel":"Highbridge the Label / Atlantic Records","upc":"075679761453","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Atlantic Recording Corporation and Highbridge The Label, LLC.","playParams":{"id":"1599321200","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A Boogie wit da Hoodie fans have come to distinguish between his A Boogie and Artist musical personalities as equally essential sides of the Bronx-hailing MC: A Boogie is the worry-free rock star, while Artist (Boogie’s government name) is the eternally heartbroken R&B singer.

The band is as powerful and primal as they were in the ’70s (“Heading West”), but their politics are sharper (“Change Ain’t Never Gonna”), and their tenderness more tender (“Don’t Forget Love”). And if the hushed volatility of the eight-and-a-half-minute “Welcome Back” doesn’t convince you that they think of their music as being just as nuanced and transitory as jazz, nothing will. As drummer Ralph Molina put it when the take was done, “Neil just did some heavy shit.” So they kept it.<br />\nBut it is amazing that it took them more than 50 years to record an album called <i>Barn</i>, if only because the music they’ve made feels so true to its title: simple, stoic, durable, timeless. Describing the recording process here, Young says he scheduled sessions so that he and the band—Molina, Billy Talbot, and longtime accomplice Nils Lofgren replacing the retired Frank Sampedro—could work in moonlight, after walking a couple of miles to the studio, “across the meadow, through the valley,” just him and his dogs. “The Rockies are everywhere,” he says of the scene. “And it’s just beautiful. I like that.”","short":"Bringing it all back home, 50 years on."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1599009709","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599009709?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/67/ad/c4/67adc419-e2af-d4fd-0cf5-ff9804b599c0/21UM1IM51732.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0c2c1","textColor2":"c8cbc3","textColor4":"a0a29c","textColor1":"f1f3f2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"John Paesano","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-original-soundtrack/1599009709","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"Diary of a Wimpy Kid (Original Soundtrack)","recordLabel":"Hollywood Records","upc":"00050087498658","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 20th Century Studios","playParams":{"id":"1599009709","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1600797285","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600797285?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/71/d8/b5/71d8b540-ea40-7628-1191-f28c74e022a9/21UM1IM47037.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"353933","textColor2":"03291c","textColor4":"345243","textColor1":"040908","bgColor":"f8f8e0","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Feid","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inter-shibuya-ferxxo-edition/1600797285","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":24,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-12-17","name":"INTER SHIBUYA (FERXXO EDITION)","recordLabel":"Universal Music Latino","upc":"00602445278756","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Universal Music Latino; ℗ 2021 UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1600797285","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1585030290","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1585030290?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/dd/bd/46/ddbd4679-1e9c-ce5f-94f9-4adf01f48ebf/0822231706069_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0c0c1","textColor2":"ef6f3d","textColor4":"c15931","textColor1":"eeeff1","bgColor":"070300","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Choir of King's College, Cambridge & Daniel Hyde","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-the-bleak-midwinter-christmas-carols-from-kings/1585030290","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Holiday","Christmas: Classical","Choral"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","name":"In the Bleak Midwinter: Christmas Carols from King's","recordLabel":"Kings College Cambridge","upc":"0822231706069","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 King's College, Cambridge","playParams":{"id":"1585030290","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"In 2020, for the first time in 90 years, the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols was given without a congregation, though it was still watched by millions around the world.

For the most part, Behemoth frontman Adam “Nergal” Darski wasn’t impressed with what he saw. “I wasn’t really attracted by any of the streams that were out there,” the distinguished extreme-metal musician tells Apple Music. “We knew that if Behemoth was going to pull something like that out, it must be absolutely mind-blowing and unmatched. It may sound arrogant of me, but it’s like, ‘Go big or go home.’ That’s my life’s maxim, and I stick to it.”<br />\nCut to the abandoned church in the band’s native Poland where Behemoth shot their video for the song “Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel” almost a decade ago. “It’s an ex-evangelical church that was built over a hundred years ago on lands that are now Poland but used to be Germany,” Nergal explains. “It was no longer in use after World War II.” It was in this gothic setting that Behemoth performed their double live set <i>In Absentia Dei</i> with a vivid horror-movie atmosphere of fog, fire, and blasphemy captured on video by the crack production team at Grupa 13. “<i>In Absentia Dei</i> was unprecedented,” Nergal offers. “It was a shitload of work, but we raised the bar for livestreams real high.”<br /> \n<b>“Evoe”</b>\n“We opened the set with this because we wanted to challenge ourselves. We wanted to bring something fresh and new. It came off the EP [<i>A Forest</i>], released shortly before we did the live set, so I think it came out as a big surprise, like, ‘Shit. They’re opening with a song that they’ve never played live!’ Maybe this is the only time we’ll ever play that, so that also makes it quite special.”<br /> \n<b>“Prometherion”</b>\n“This is off <i>The Apostasy</i>, maybe the most technically challenging record we’ve ever created. I don’t think I could pull off all that shredding and fast guitars anymore. I don’t want to go there, but especially if you talk to our drummer—he’s like, ‘Please, slow down.’ When you listen to ‘Prometherion’ live and then you go back to the record, on the record it’s just played way faster. But faster doesn’t mean it’s better. Sometimes it’s better to slow down and find the groove.”<br /> \n<b>“Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel”</b>\n“This is a modern classic. I’m very happy with this song, and it works so well live. We started playing it live during festivals before <i>The Satanist</i> album was even out, and I remember people’s reaction to that song. There was a lot of confusion in the beginning, because it starts out very slowly and then speeds up the pace before it just goes absolutely into a frenzy. It was like, ‘What the fuck did they just play?’ So, I was kind of disappointed back then because I was hoping people would get it right away. But now they do.”<br /> \n<b>“Conquer All”</b>\n“That’s one of our most-played songs. It’s a banger. Great groove. Thank you, Anthrax. That’s another story—I didn’t rip off Anthrax. But because I was an Anthrax fan when I was a kiddo, probably that was just somewhere in my musical DNA. When I recorded it, someone told me it sounds almost identical. When I revisited the back catalog of Anthrax, I’m like, ‘Fuck. Well, it does. Sorry for that.’ Overall, it’s a different song, but that sequence is quite identical, I must admit. But it was a coincidence. And now, instead of one good song, we have two.”<br /> \n<b>“Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer”</b>\n“I wrote the whole song from start to finish at home, without the band. I brought it to the rehearsal room when [bassist] Orion was on tour with Vesania, his band. It was just three of us—me, [guitarist] Seth, and [drummer] Inferno—and we wrapped it up within 40 minutes, tops. Because of that, I questioned the quality of the song. I said we would not put it on the record. Then I wrote the lyrics, and when I heard the final thing that we did in the studio, I knew it was going on the record because it’s a fucking monster of a song. It became one of people’s most favorite tracks, and I love playing this one live.”<br /> \n<b>“Ov Fire and the Void”</b>\n“This one is off <i>Evangelion</i>, and it’s another one of people’s favorites. It has a lot of hooks. There’s a great lead part played by Seth, our guitarist, and it has an awesome groove. It’s a great live track, too. When we deliver the full-on production with pyros and stuff—man, it gets hot on stage. It gets super sweaty. Just by saying those words now, I realize how much I miss touring.”<br /> \n<b>“Bartzabel”</b>\n“‘Bartzabel’ is not a ballad, but some people say this is the only ballad we ever wrote without wimping out. It’s still pretty dark and sinister. I really like this part where I step up on this booth onstage that we set on fire. There’s a big-ass figure of Jesus Christ, and then it just all ends up in flames. I’m standing there with a fucking Pope hat on my head, and it just gets so ritualistic. It gets so majestic. So, yeah, I’m a big fan of that one. Because it’s kind of slow and moody, it doesn’t drain you out. It has nice dynamics throughout.”<br /> \n<b>“O Father O Satan O Sun!”</b>\n“This song is strongly inspired by Aleister Crowley. It’s a natural-born closer, so it just became that song in the set. If you’re familiar with our discography, you see that every now and then we wrap up certain records with these big, majestic songs. They are kind of tailored for being the closing ones. ‘O Father’ is maybe the most epic of them all, but then again, wait and hear the new record sometime next year.
