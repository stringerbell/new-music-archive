The Memphis MC comes out swinging, battering the CashMoneyAp production with bars about the kinds of guns he loves, what kind of sex he enjoys, and his ability to identify insincere well-wishers within his circle. It’s a chest-beating declaration of Choppa’s increasingly sharp rhyme prowess, and it sets the tone for the rest of the project. <br />\nA title like <i>Me vs. Me</i> implies conflict, but there is little if any here. This is very much the NLE Choppa of the <i>Cottonwood</i> and <i>Top Shotta</i> albums, as opposed to the holistic living enthusiast the internet once jokingly referred to as “NLE Chakra.” Songs like “Push It” featuring Young Thug, “Trap Phone,” “Final Warning,” and “Still Hood” (among others) all feature heavy gunplay and the robust street-lord posturing that made his name. He’s commissioned production from industry big dogs like Quay Global and OG Parker—in addition to the aforementioned CashMoneyAp—across <i>Me vs. Me</i>, but the real takeaway, as foretold in the title of the first track, is that the flows here are at least six times as sharp as they’ve ever been.","short":"The Memphis spitter is his only competition."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4KrQSZfzmxp0aftaBZj7m3"}},{"id":"1603736495","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1603736495?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/46/ec/0a/46ec0a7a-37db-7c99-f7ff-06be3447788c/21UM1IM51300.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d4c2c5","textColor2":"ff3038","textColor4":"de2630","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"5c0013","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Nija","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-say-i-didnt-warn-you/1603736495","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-01-28","name":"Don't Say I Didn't Warn You","recordLabel":"Capitol Records","upc":"00602438756926","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"Capitol Records;

All rights reserved.","playParams":{"id":"1600976482","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Morgan Wade’s road to her debut album was a winding one. The Virginia-born artist was only 26 when it was released in 2021, but the songs that make up the album reveal a depth of life experience—including heartbreak, addiction, and sobriety—typically only heard from older, more seasoned songwriters. After devoting herself in earnest to songwriting in her freshman year of college, Wade began playing shows and festivals locally and regionally, eventually landing on the radar of Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit guitarist Sadler Vaden, who co-produced <i>Reckless</i> with Paul Ebersold (Drivin’ N’ Cryin’, The Weeks). The resulting 10 tracks are fringe country at its finest, recalling the spitfire sass of Miranda Lambert and the hard-earned wisdom of Ashley McBryde.<br />\nOn the deluxe edition of the album, which features six new tunes, Wade offers a broader glimpse of her artistry, finding her softer side on the festival-ready “Run” and doing her best take on Elvis with a spirited cover of “Suspicious Minds.” Read Wade's stories behind each track on the original album below.<br />\n<b>“Wilder Days”</b>\n“Sadler and I co-wrote that together. And it was just the concept of meeting an older guy who has cleaned up his act a little bit. He still has that side to him, but you know that if time would have allowed it, you guys would have gotten into some trouble and been more of a Bonnie-and-Clyde-type thing. So it’s not a depressing song but more of a ‘This isn’t going to work, but it could have worked.’”<br />\n<b>“Matches and Metaphors”</b>\n“I had drank way too much coffee that day and I remember I stayed up all night. And I was actually putting a puzzle together at two in the morning, and I don't know why I remember that. So, just a ‘late night, miss you, where are you at’ kind of song.”<br />\n<b>“Other Side”</b>\n“We were actually recording the record and I was at my hotel. And I woke up one morning and I had that thought in my head of my boyfriend knowing me before all of this. It was like, he's the one that's been there the whole time, before I had the tattoos. He remembers me before I was sober. He's seen all of that.”<br />\n<b>“Don’t Cry”</b>\n“I was in the studio and Paul had this track and I was like, ‘You know what? Just keep playing it on a loop.’ And I just sat down with a notebook and listened to it for an hour straight and wrote ‘Don't Cry.’ I'm thinking it was December or January, something around there, which is always a pretty difficult time for me mentally. Just the weather, the time change, everything. And then, of course, it was a good time that we put it out the following year, 2020, and that December was when it came out. For me, it was a big deal to put it out then, because it was like, ‘You know, it's been about a year since I've experienced that and I've grown from that.’ And it was just nice to reconnect with that song myself.”<br />\n<b>“Mend”</b>\n“That's the only song on the record that I wrote before I was sober, and I've been sober for almost four years, and that was the first song Sadler had heard of mine. And Paul and Sadler were very adamant about me putting that one on the record.”<br />\n<b>“Last Cigarette”</b>\n“It’s just that idea of, like, ‘Just one more time. I know it's bad for me. I know this is not helping me, but just one more time.’ And I feel like we do that a lot with anything in life. And then your last time's really not your last time.”<br />\n<b>“Take Me Away”</b>\n“I picked up my guitar one day, and it was early morning. And, with the idea of being this person that can be cut off and short and keep things to myself, it's just about being vulnerable and letting somebody in.”<br />\n<b>“Reckless”</b>\n“Sadler had the idea for ‘Reckless.’ And when we were writing it together, he was like, ‘Man, <i>Reckless</i> would sound like a cool album title.’ And that was about it, that's all we'd said about it. And I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah.’ And then we never brought that up again. And then, when it came time to be like, ‘All right, what are we going to call this thing?’ I was like, ‘Well, that fits it.’ And I felt like it summed up these songs, whether it was referencing me being reckless or someone else being reckless or just life in general feeling reckless sometimes. So I think that was the perfect title for that chapter of my life.”<br />\n<b>“Northern Air”</b>\n“We wrote that one about somebody moving away, and the character being in the same place, like, ‘What's it like where you're at and what can I do to get you to come home?’”<br />\n<b>“Met You”</b>\n“I'm a big Ernest Hemingway fan. There's a book written about him [<i>Hemingway in Love</i> by A.E. Hotchner] and it was just talking about how he never got over his first wife, Hadley. And he started getting fame and his books were picking up and everything good was going on for him when he was living in Paris. He ended up falling in love with another woman and leaving Hadley and breaking her heart. And there was a part where he was in Paris and he saw her years later and told her, ‘Any true thing I write, any true woman I write about, is you.’ And he just never did let go. In this book, he was older and his health wasn't great and he was still sitting there and just saying, ‘I regret that.’ And for him, it was just never over.”","short":"Her 2021 debut, now with six new tracks and in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ptlvk4iUKk88X0DfEzBm7"}},{"id":"1606897206","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1606897206?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/8f/63/a4/8f63a487-e0ad-968f-9750-5f762e6b462b/21UM1IM56121.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2a2c30","textColor2":"5d0c10","textColor4":"74363d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"d3e0f1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"The Beatles","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/get-back-rooftop-performance/1606897206","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-01-28","name":"Get Back (Rooftop Performance)","recordLabel":"UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)","upc":"00602445496488","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)","playParams":{"id":"1606897206","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6emgUTDksZyhhWmtjM9FCs"}},{"id":"1605881384","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1605881384?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/bd/54/07/bd54077a-9620-5b5a-3750-ca2cea8db782/194690736216_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"d3d3d3","textColor2":"cacaca","textColor4":"ababab","textColor1":"fbfbfb","bgColor":"303030","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Babyface Ray","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/face/1605881384","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-28","name":"FACE","recordLabel":"Wavy Gang / EMPIRE","upc":"194690736216","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Wavy Gang / EMPIRE","playParams":{"id":"1605881384","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4cy5H3elTd4senApZFBA1g"}},{"id":"1605778792","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1605778792?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/da/7c/11/da7c1137-4a6e-0798-64cd-11de54edb126/190296264849.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"6794b9","textColor2":"68b1dd","textColor4":"548fb2","textColor1":"80b8e6","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"artistName":"PinkPantheress","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/to-hell-with-it-remixes/1605778792","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-28","name":"to hell with it (Remixes)","recordLabel":"Parlophone UK","upc":"190296264849","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"Under exclusive licence to Parlophone Records Limited, ℗ 2022 PinkPantheress","playParams":{"id":"1605778792","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3KP55PNM7vdlrIm1LavDzb"}},{"id":"1606462451","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1606462451?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0c/d6/ce/0cd6ce1c-9382-d72d-9191-3101c1071992/886449859443.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5c4c9","textColor2":"d0e3f0","textColor4":"adb9c3","textColor1":"edf1f8","bgColor":"24100f","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Doe Boy","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/oh-really/1606462451","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":19,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-01-26","name":"OH REALLY","recordLabel":"Epic/Freebandz","upc":"886449859443","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Epic Records.

There’d be gun talk, of course; more than a few pledges to street code, maybe a mention or two of some wayward female companionship—but ever present and no less important than any of that, there’d be a barrage of smirk-inducing wordplay rooted in his intention to be taken seriously as an MC. All of that is present on <i>OH REALLY</i>, the Cleveland MC’s first release since 2020’s <i>Demons R Us</i>, but so are songs about being in love (“CRY FOR ME”), songs unfurling major parts of his life’s story (“GENUINE”), and even one featuring out-and-out R&B-style singing (“SNATCH YO SOUL”).<br />\n“It's more than just the street Doe Boy, what everybody used to,” he says. “It's a lot of storytelling on here, it's a lot of different type of music that people not used to hearing me do, and it shows who I want to be as an artist.” Doe Boy’s been experimenting, both topically and with his voice, since as far back as 2017’s <i>Codeine Confessions</i>, but on <i>OH REALLY</i>, he feels like the time might be right to take some of the armor off. “I got so many more fans and so many more people just paying attention to me now since the last project I dropped, it's like I get to come out as a whole new artist,” he says. “[<i>OH REALLY</i>] has so much range on it because this the project for me where everybody is going to pay attention.” Below, Doe Boy walks us through a few standout tracks from his reintroduction to the world.<br />\n<b>“BIG OH REALLY”</b>\n“‘BIG OH REALLY’ was the very last song I did. ‘RESPECTFULLY’ was originally the intro, but I made that number three now because I previewed that song damn near a year ago. I was in the studio with Southside and Atl Jacob and they made the beat right in my face. I wanted it to have that intro feeling, and that shit came out so hard. It wasn't even supposed to be on the album or nothing. That shit's my favorite song though.”<br />\n<b>“AIN’T MY FAULT” (feat. Rowdy Rebel & 42 Dugg)</b>\n“I was in New York and I was just kicking it with Rowdy Rebel the whole day. We went to Pop Smoke candlelight [vigil], went to his hood, then they had a house party—ghetto-ass shit. After that, we went to the studio and that's what we came up with. When I played the beat, Rowdy started saying, 'That ain't my fault.' We just made it our own shit, for real, and then we added 42 Dugg.”<br />\n<b>“GENUINE”</b>\n“I don't write or nothing like that; I just rap whatever I'm feeling at the time. So the day that I made 'GENUINE,' that's just the space where that beat put me at: just telling my life. That beat requires lyrics; you can't just get on there and do anything. I like showing people that I can go over here and do this, go over there and do that. I don't care what it is—a pop beat, a rock ’n’ roll beat—I go crazy on anything for real.”<br />\n<b>“CRY FOR ME” (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)</b>\n“I feel more comfortable with putting this type of stuff out now. Sometimes a n***a be thinking like, ‘Man, damn, I don't know if I should do this because, you know, they like me so much for the shit that sound like <i>Demons R Us</i>.’ So I'm just at the point of, I don't care no more: I know that it's hard, so I know they gon' fuck with it. I’m just trying to reach out to new people and show people that I'm going to be one of them ones.”<br />\n<b>“ONNA HOOD” (feat.

Me and Face got this one type of chemistry, we be in that bitch boxing. Because he could rap, too.

However, the attendant media hype also served to forever cement his image as a ukulele-toting troubadour singing lullabies whilst traipsing down narrow, cobble-stoned streets backed by a Balkan marching band—an image that he has spent much of his career since trying to undo. “I got so pigeonholed as this sepia-toned, penny-farthing-riding, pocket watch-wearing indie-twee kind of guy, which I just ended up dreading so immensely,” Condon tells Apple Music. With the rarities compilation <i>Artifacts</i>, he delivers a 26-song bulldozer to that stereotype, repositioning <i>Gulag Orkestar</i>’s era-defining aesthetic in its proper context, as just another manifestation of a mercurial muse that Condon has been following since he was a 14-year-old home-recording hermit toying around with Fruity Loops software in his bedroom in Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br />\nWhile planning a reissue of <i>Gulag</i>’s companion release, the <i>Lon Gisland</i> EP, Condon decided to dig deeper into his archives, unearthing not just a trove of B-sides and outtakes from throughout Beirut’s career, but also some of his earliest teenage adventures in lo-fi. And hearing them, you can’t help but think, ‘If things had gone differently, he could very well have turned out a synth-pop scientist instead of an indie-folk hero.’ “When I heard chillwave coming out [in the late 2000s],” he says, “I remember thinking, ‘These bastards are doing what I was trying to do 10 years ago, but they have better equipment and more access to good computer programs than I did!’” Here, Condon ponders what could’ve been as he talks us through each of <i>Artifacts</i>’ four chapters: the <i>Lon Gisland</i> EP (included with related outtakes), “The Misfits” (his first synth experiments), “New Directions and Early Works” (a showcase of key transitional, pre-Beirut tracks), and “The B-Sides” (a collection of mostly unreleased Beirut castaways).<br />\n<b>The <i>Lon Gisland</i> EP (Tracks 1-7)</b>\n“While I was digging through all my hard drives, I noticed that, right off the bat, my tracks all had city names. And then I realized why: My family would do these brutal road trips around the country because my dad and mom refused to spend the money on flying. We drove to Key West to visit some family; we drove up to Nova Scotia; we drove to California. And the whole time, my parents would be playing country music on the radio—these sad, lonesome songs about places like Amarillo, Oklahoma. These city names began to tell these huge stories on these endless journeys. When I started making music, I was on a constant search for outside influence and trying to get away from the American and the UK rock bubble that bored me as a teenager. So, of course, I was trying to throw these more exotic locales in my name and songs. I would play with these old styles in ways that I thought were not overly tacky or ostentatious. I’m always flirting with these instruments and sounds that I find are used so abusively, and I always want to bring them back from the brink. Like, the ukulele is not a cutesy toy. It actually has some kind of distant melancholy to it. Brass sections are not this circus music—they’re filled with depth and pack a lot of emotion.”<br />\n<b>“The Misfits” (Tracks 8-13)</b>\n“Where I grew up, it was all emo, punk, math-rock, hardcore—nothing but fucking rock music. It sucked, because I would go to the plaza during siestas and hear these mariachi bands, and I’d be like, ‘This sounds fucking incredible!’ And then, I would go to my friends’ [punk] shows, and I’d just be sitting there stuffing as much tissue into my ears as possible, because I could barely sit through these shows. The last thing in the world my friends would have allowed anywhere near was a four-on-the-floor dance beat. But to me, the synthesizers have this whole wide-open world of sound and so much variation and so much power compared to that very typical—and often very dreary—guitar/bass/drums thing. At this point, my brother had brought some records from New York, when the electroclash thing was starting [in the early 2000s]. I was also listening to a lot of IDM, like Boards of Canada and Aphex Twin. And I would’ve been listening to a ton of Magnetic Fields obsessively. On ‘Poisoning Claude,’ you can really hear it. ‘Fyodor Dormant’ came a year or two later—I had gone to New York and started to hear the dance-music influence that was creeping into electroclash.”<br />\n<b>“New Directions and Early Works” (Tracks 14-19)</b>\n“These would have been made from the age of 17 until I left for Europe at 18. I used to write a song a week and these are from that batch. I was still feeling surrounded and repressed by American rock music. This is the point where I had isolated myself from my friend circle quite a bit. I just started going into my own world. I had gotten so obsessed with music at that point that I was dropping out of school, because I would stay up till 5 in the morning, making songs. I would be in the parking lot of my high school, passed out in my car. School just wasn’t working anymore. I pretty much lived in the movie theater that I worked at, and then I brought home a projector from there, and I would just project movies on the ceiling of my bedroom. I had a mattress that I would lay on the floor; when I was recording, I would put it against the wall so I could have the microphones out. There wasn’t even room for a bed. So, at this point, I was just gone from reality. But the truth was, I felt like I had found something. Something had cohered and it was really clear that I now had something that would cut through. So, at 17, I was like, ‘Oh, I think I get it now—I can make it myself.’”<br />\n<b>“The B-Sides” (Tracks 20-26)</b>\n“I have a lot of leftover Beirut material, but a lot of it is maybe less finished than this stuff. That’s why I chose what I chose here—these are far enough along. With some of them, it’s obvious—like, I wasn’t sure how a three-minute instrumental would fit on certain albums, whereas here, it made more sense. But then, some of them are less obvious: I’m sure some people are probably wondering why I didn’t include ‘Fisher Island Sound’ on a record if it was done. It was written not long after [2007’s] <i>The Flying Club Cup</i>, and then I ended up recording sometime around [2011’s] <i>The Rip Tide</i>. There’s a point in your career where you become painfully self-aware of how you’re represented in the music media. Initially, there’s just the excitement of being mentioned at all, especially coming from my own private world in my bedroom in Santa Fe. But I had gotten to that point where I was like, ‘If I get one more music video treatment where it’s like, “OK, we put you in the street in knickerbockers and an old-looking suit jacket while you’re drinking absinthe…”’ While I liked the Balkan music, being portrayed as this naive, ukulele-strumming romantic felt really quite insulting and patronizing. So, with ‘Fisher Island Sound,’ I had to say, ‘Not yet. I can’t go down that road right now. Even if the fans would love it, I can’t do it.’ But the truth is, even back then, I was like, ‘No, it’s a catchy song!’”","short":"“I got so pigeonholed, which I ended up dreading so
