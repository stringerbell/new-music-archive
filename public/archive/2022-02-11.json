And though his second solo outing (2011’s aptly titled <i>Ukulele Songs</i>) showcased his gentler side, its follow-up is more diverse: a panoramic sprint through blistering punk (“Power of Right”), classic pop (the Elton John-enriched “Picture”), road-ready anthems (“The Dark”), and the sort of tender ballads he’s penned for Pearl Jam this side of the ’90s (“The Haves”). Most of all, Vedder—long seen as self-serious by some—sounds like a kid in a garage here, calling out to ground control from the cockpit on “Invincible” or shooting himself out of a cannon on “Try.” It sounds like he’s having <i>fun</i>.","short":"Hear the Pearl Jam frontman’s third solo LP in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/47mMVL72wEPG0li4VTtHzM"}},{"id":"1599574384","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599574384?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/05/0e/7f/050e7f91-ea7b-e6c0-f534-9685eaf8353d/21UMGIM68620.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1d1d2","textColor2":"00b2e5","textColor4":"0594be","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1b1b21","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Priscilla Block","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-the-block-party/1599574384","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Welcome To The Block Party","recordLabel":"UMGN InDent Records","upc":"00602438639601","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Mercury Nashville/InDent Records Release; ℗ 2022 UMG Recordings, Inc./InDent Records","playParams":{"id":"1599574384","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0dNsg2k0JVBXDjAyASks9p"}},{"id":"1589311585","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1589311585?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/d6/39/f8/d639f854-796c-4e23-d106-dee115fe79af/4050538696004.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"1c1b1b","textColor2":"1b191a","textColor4":"313030","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"8c8a8b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Slash","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/4-feat-myles-kennedy-and-the-conspirators/1589311585","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"4 (feat.

The project takes the content and casual candor of a group chat and unpacks them across songs and narrative, laying waste to the patriarchal good girl/bad girl dichotomy in the process. It's as much about “hoes” as it is the people who both benefit from and are harmed by the notion. Pleasure takes center stage from the very beginning; “Bodies” captures the inner monologue of the moments immediately after a drunken hookup with—well, does it really matter? The who is irrelevant to the why, as Sullivan searches her mirror for accountability. “I keep on piling on bodies on bodies on bodies, yeah, you getting sloppy, girl, I gotta stop getting fucked up.”\n\nThe theme reemerges throughout, each time towards a different end, as short spoken interludes thread it all together. “Put It Down” offers praise for the men who only seem to be worthy of it in the bedroom (because who among us hasn't indulged in or even enabled the carnal delights of those who offer little else beyond?), while “On It,” a pearl-clutching duet with Ari Lennox, unfolds like a three-minute sext sung by two absolute vocal powerhouses. Later, she cleverly inverts the sentiment but maintains the artistic dynamism on a duet with H.E.R., replacing the sexual confidence with a missive about how “it ain't right how these hoes be winning.” The singing is breathtaking—textbooks could be filled on the way Sullivan brings emotionality into the tone and texture of voice, as on the devastating lead single “Lost One”—but it'd be erroneous to ignore the lyrics and what these intra- and interpersonal dialogues expose. <i>Heaux Tales</i> not only highlights the multitudes of many women, it suggests the multitudes that can exist within a single woman, how virtue and vulnerability thrive next to ravenous desire and indomitability. It stands up as a portrait of a woman, painted by the brushes of several, who is, at the end of it all, simply doing the best she can—trying to love and protect herself despite a world that would prefer she do neither.","short":"The singer adds more songs and tales on her deluxe edition."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1566166376","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1566166376?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music125/v4/bf/52/00/bf5200ae-b3b4-d95e-10c9-ceeff21be1db/190296726446.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"464646","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Zeal & Ardor","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/zeal-ardor/1566166376","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Zeal & Ardor","recordLabel":"MVKA","upc":"190296726446","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Redacted GmbH under exclusive license to MVKA","playParams":{"id":"1566166376","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4lh0rl7eI2w9Rik8JECk9l"}},{"id":"1607834845","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607834845?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/5d/59/c3/5d59c30a-18bb-7408-c45c-46dfce22f7a6/190296255854.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2048,"textColor3":"d27f42","textColor2":"fe7179","textColor4":"d25c65","textColor1":"fe9d4e","bgColor":"230916","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sofía Reyes","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mal-de-amores/1607834845","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop Latino","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-10","name":"Mal De Amores","recordLabel":"WEA Latina","upc":"190296255854","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Warner Music Latina","playParams":{"id":"1607834845","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3F5VmDv3oeerueNteT7JFc"}},{"id":"1607595067","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607595067?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/7f/13/fc/7f13fca5-e341-b416-ddd2-47eca9d15c72/886449863600.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"242424","textColor2":"2a2a2a","textColor4":"474747","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b8b8b8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Yo Gotti","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cm10-free-game-deluxe/1607595067","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":25,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-04","name":"CM10: Free Game (Deluxe)","recordLabel":"CMG / Inevitable II Records","upc":"886449863600","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 CMG / Inevitable II Records","playParams":{"id":"1607595067","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"<i>CM10: Free Game</i> isn’t your typical Yo Gotti record. Sure, there are the constants of trunk-rattling production, appearances from the rapidly ascending stars Gotti has had a hand in launching (Moneybagg Yo, 42 Dugg, EST Gee), and enough cash talk to short-circuit an ATM machine, but when the MC was putting together the body of work that became <i>Free Game</i>, his main focus was inspiring the flock. “You always want a hit record,” Gotti tells Apple Music. “I didn't try to make a hit record on this album. I didn't try to make one record that I thought would play on the radio, that I thought would be a 'Rake It Up' or a 'Down in the DM.' It was all about the message and saying the things that I want to say and just rapping.”<br /> \nMemphis (and Gotti’s hopes for its residents) is the unifying thread here, the MC impressing upon his followers not just how far he's come as one of their own, but also how far he has to go. “I may be out in the club and a guy walks up to me putting emphasis on how real he is or how street he is or what he doing in whatever city it is,” Gotti explains. “And he don't know that I'm trying to figure out how to be the next Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos. Bro, I don't care nothing ’bout that shit. I'm not trying to be the biggest street n***a in the world. My mind is on becoming a billionaire and building a legacy.” Below, Yo Gotti talks us through some of the tracks on <i>CM10: Free Game</i> that show us exactly where his mind is.<br />\n<b>“Giving Back”</b>\n“I think at a certain level of success, people confuse being busy with being out of touch, or out of reach. It’s just that my calendar is full—I got places to be, I got money to make, I got shit to do. I don't have time to be standing in no hood all day. I’m on the move. I own restaurants [in Memphis] and I touch a lot of people, so the people who need to see me, see me.”<br />\n<b>“Bad Behavior”</b>\n“I had just landed in Memphis and I went straight to the studio. My guy Dame sent me the track, and soon as he sent me the beat, I sent it to the engineer and I'm like, 'Yo, let me put this idea down.' I didn't even know it was going to turn into a whole song—I just had [the opening line]. Once that part came, the rest of the shit just flowed out. We ended up finishing the whole song in 20 minutes.”<br />\n<b>“Rap Check”</b>\n“You know sometimes when you living in real time and you doing so much stuff, you don't live in the moment. You don't soak it all in because you’re on to the next. In the pandemic, with everything slowing down, it made you think about certain things. In this song, I mentioned Nate Dogg took me to the studio with Dr. Dre. I almost forgot that! Because I'm doing so much stuff since then. But that moment is a very special part of my life. So with the world slowing down, I was able to remember it and was like, yo, I should tell people this shit.”<br />\n<b>“Shoot Off Pt. 4”</b>\n“I feel like we can't do a <i>CM</i> series project and not put a 'Shoot Off' on it. You have to. It's one of those records where it allowed me to have fun and just say random shit.”<br />\n<b>“Strapped in Calabasas”</b>\n“This is one of those narratives that represents a North Memphis kid—with a certain mentality—that is now super successful. [Whether] it’s Beverly Hills or it's the nicest part of Miami, or if it's Tribeca in New York or something, it’s saying that your success puts you in certain areas, but your mentality still have you moving a certain way.”<br />\n<b>“Palm Trees in Memphis”</b>\n“I went back to Memphis on a lot of this music, meaning the subject matter was about Memphis. Because with all my success—I’ve been traveling the world, I got homes in different cities—I think my music been speaking from a general place of ‘the world.’ The title represents who I am, where I come from, and the ‘palm trees’ part comes from all the success that I'm living today. It's no palm trees in Memphis, only the ones we imported there.”<br />\n<b>“Forever Ballin” (feat. Shenseea)</b>\n“[Shenseea] is part of the Interscope family, but I had already knew about her. I met her years before on a promo run, but I always thought she was dope. I was doing a CMG recording camp during BET weekend and I had the whole studio locked down, five different rooms. I had producers everywhere, and all the artists from the label was in and out the studio, in every room recording. She came into the room, and I really respect her energy as a hustler, because she just heard the beat and she just started singing her shit like, ‘This is what I hear on it.’ And I'm like, ‘Oh yeah, go drop that.’”<br />\n<b>“Last Run”</b>\n“When you think about the title <i>Free Game</i>, I'm trying to talk to people. I'm trying to give people information. I'm hoping that when I tell some of these stories, some people wake up or some people think like, 'I ain't going to wait till the last run to have my best run.' Don't wait till it's too late to make your move. Sometimes you never get that last run. I know people in real life that never got it. People that lost their life or their freedom trying to get that last run.”<br />\n<b>“Free Game”</b>\n“I started recording some of these records during the pandemic and it was going to be one thing and then the world opened back up a little bit and then it went back on shutdown.

MacKenzie Porter guests on smash single “Thinking ’Bout You,” which notched an impressive six weeks at number one on country radio. Lynch teams up with Chris Lane for the playful “Tequila on a Boat.” And Riley Green joins him for “Huntin’ Land,” an ode to “a couple thousand acres up in Kentucky” prime for hunting. Below, Lynch walks Apple Music through a few key tracks on <i>Blue in the Sky</i>.<br />\n<b>“Party Mode”</b>\n“I’d just gone through a breakup, and I remember you have that kind of heart-wrenching inside, and you can’t sleep for weeks on end. You’re looking like hell. Me and my buddies decided, ‘Let’s go into downtown Nashville and jump around some honky-tonks.’ We were in the Uber, heading downtown. I just remember this sense of this weight coming off of me and this new feeling of going, ‘Let’s embrace the unknown. That’s the past, and we got the whole rest of life in front of us.’ That excites me. I think that’s why ‘Party Mode’ really jumped out at me, because it is a breakup song but it’s fun.”<br />\n<b>“Thinking ’Bout You” (feat. MacKenzie Porter)</b>\n“What was fun about this whole process was that MacKenzie’s never had a single on the charts in the States. So, she’s texting me like, ‘Hey, my team’s telling me this is kind of cool and this is a good sign.’ I’m like, ‘MacKenzie, this is not normal. This is about to be mega.’ So, we got to see the signs early on and then just enjoy the ride. As the song started climbing, we were able to go out and play some shows, both she and I, and get to feel the familiarity come across the crowd each night and enjoy that. But you can’t plan six weeks at number one. You can’t plan for a song to have success like that. It set a record for my career. It set a record for my record label.”<br />\n<b>“Somethin’ That Makes You Smile”</b>\n“I literally had shampoo in my hair whenever I heard this song. I was in California, and we were a week before, I think, in the last recording session. So, my inboxes get flooded, because people know that it’s the last round of recording before this album’s wrapped up. I started playing songs when I was in the shower, and that’s one that came on and it just floored me. It’s definitely my mom’s favorite song on this album. I just love the message behind it: Every day we’ve got a choice, and whether it’s with your career or with what you choose to do for fun, your hobbies, make sure it makes you smile. Life’s too short not to.”<br />\n<b>“Tennessee Trouble”</b>\n“I moved [to Nashville] on a golf scholarship to go to college and just started chasing songwriting. I realized that cover bands were something that kind of fired me up. So, I started working on that set list and that grew into playing on the street here to picking up gigs at UT Knoxville and a lot of other SEC schools. But UT Knoxville is within striking distance, and there’s a club out there called Cotton Eyed Joe. A lot of the times, we would play a frat party, and then, instead of driving home, we’d get a hotel room and then go catch a show at the Cotton Eyed Joe the next night. Just being 21, 22 and experiencing traveling with a band in Knoxville, playing a frat party, and then going to watch young, up-and-coming artists at this club, all of those memories. Getting to step on a tour bus for the first time in that parking lot. It kind of takes me back there.”<br />\n<b>“Not Every Cowboy”</b>\n“I’ve realized the world’s obsessed with the cowboy culture in America. I’ve gotten to travel to a lot of cool places, and everybody’s obsessed with the Westerns for whatever reason. They have Western dress-up nights in Japan, for God’s sake. Yeah, I think it’ll never go out of style. That type of song is tough to write where it doesn’t feel dated. ‘Not Every Cowboy’ was something that came across, and it didn’t feel like it was from 1997.”","short":"“I’ve realized the world’s

“And it’s a record that sounds to me like good times, for the most part.” That description holds true, from the canyon-like groove of “Held” (a cover of fellow Austinite Bill Callahan’s 1998 original) to the lightheaded romance of “My Babe,” a song Daniel calls “a declaration of genuine love.” The idea was to make an album like they would have when they first started in the ’90s, when every song had to feel finished before they stepped into a studio. “We were more of a bar band then,” he says. “That’s all we were doing, rehearsing to play gigs at little bars or clubs in Austin. Playing as a band first and working the songs up together was a guiding principle for how the record turned out, with the spirit that it did.”","short":"“It’s just a rock ’n’ roll record.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1szMY4QqnQZgNuyLBC4jUQ"}},{"id":"1607220556","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1607220556?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9f/4b/b8/9f4bb815-303a-f9e8-0d54-8918dc74ff7d/aa624bf4-8624-40fd-8825-4d0cc2b08882.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"dddddd","textColor2":"f6f6f6","textColor4":"d7d7d7","textColor1":"fdfdfd","bgColor":"5c5c5c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cousin Stizz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/just-for-you/1607220556","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Just For You","recordLabel":"Stizz Music Inc.","upc":"7316470365703","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Stizz Music Inc. under exclusive license to Independent","playParams":{"id":"1607220556","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5gl8AaOhNL60AcYk2JLEE3"}},{"id":"1582683090","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582683090?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":2500,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/9e/bc/67/9ebc671c-c4ed-ccfc-6c82-85af5e67a410/Dreamland-Blue-Front.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2500,"textColor3":"404149","textColor2":"1d1f28","textColor4":"47484d","textColor1":"131622","bgColor":"f1eae4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Amos Lee","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dreamland/1582683090","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Dreamland","recordLabel":"Dualtone Music Group, Inc.","upc":"803020199767","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Dualtone Music Group, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1582683090","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Mik9EmHCENXPMjHOgOwRB"}},{"id":"1590918934","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1590918934?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/ac/a3/dd/aca3dde0-1a3d-563e-3f6b-c1987e732a5a/886449523450.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfbdbc","textColor2":"f89484","textColor4":"d2796f","textColor1":"f5e9e5","bgColor":"390e1b","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Joe Nichols","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-day-for-living/1590918934","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":13,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Good Day for Living","recordLabel":"Quartz Hill Records","upc":"886449523450","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 Quartz Hill Records","playParams":{"id":"1590918934","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After a five-year hiatus, Arkansas-born Joe Nichols follows his 2017 album <i>Never Gets Old</i> with <i>Good Day for Living</i>.

With Status/Non-Status (formerly Whoop-Szo), Sturgeon has waged war against Canada’s colonialist foundations—and the genocidal legacy of its residential school system—with a visceral, volatile mix of grunge, psychedelia, and post-hardcore. As Zoon, Monkman has channeled past traumas into soothing shoegaze hymns that have aided his recovery. But as OMBIIGIZI (Ojibwe for “this is noisy”), these two artists of Anishinaabe descent don’t so much forge a common language as develop a whole new dialect. Recorded with Broken Social Scene’s Kevin Drew and his frequent studio partner Nyles Spencer at The Tragically Hip’s Bathouse studio, <i>Sewn Back Together</i> filters the DIY spirit of classic ’90s indie rock through the textural density of early-2000s post-rock and folktronica, yielding an album that teeters on the edge between clarity and chaos, while exploring Indigenous identity and injustices through the lens of personal family histories. “Kevin and Nyles were able to encourage us to step outside of ourselves and made us realize that maybe our musical crutches are also vulnerabilities at times,” Sturgeon says. “So, we just stripped all that back and were encouraged to tell our stories more openly.” Here, Sturgeon and Monkman share those stories, one track at a time.<br />\n<b>“Cherry Coke”</b>\nDaniel Monkman: “This was actually a Zoon demo, and it was just a mumble of words. I wasn’t necessarily singing, ‘Cherry Coke.’ Nyles thought I was singing, ‘Jericho,’ and Kevin thought I was saying, ‘Cherry cold.’ But the song is about my relationship with my dad when I was living on the rez with him. Whenever he had spare change, he’d give me, like, a dollar and I’d keep it inside this little margarine container and go to the convenience store. There was just one on the rez at the time, and I would always get a bag of barbecue chips and a Cherry Coke, or a Vanilla Coke—those were, like, two hot ones on the rez. So, when we were finishing up the song, it just made sense to call it that.”<br />\n<b>“Residential Military”</b>\nAdam Sturgeon: “I wrote the lyrics while we were at the Bathouse. I was thinking of the times, I suppose: It was very close to Canada Day, and we were starting to learn more about the residential school where some of our ancestors had been. I try to do my part to raise a bit of awareness and release those heavy feelings in a creative way. I liked the image of a birch-bark canoe merging onto a freeway—it’s comic for us, but it allows you to begin to see what our history has done to us.”<br />\n<b>“The Once Child”</b>\nAS: “We walked in the studio one day and ‘The Once Child’ was written on the chalkboard. Kevin had been out there the night before us and there had been a big lightning storm, and that’s what came to his head. He helped me pick apart a big, long ramble. I like to just write everything that’s going through my head and filter it a little bit, and Kevin actually helped me filter this one a lot.”<br />\n<b>“Niiyo Biboonagizi”</b>\nAS: “It was neat to let Daniel and Drew [McLeod of Zoon] and Eric [Lourenço of Status/Non-Status] do their thing on this. We ended up throwing it together so quickly, and even when we jam it now, we almost hit it right off the bat—we just play it. It really feels like a natural kind of band song where everyone is doing their own thing. ‘Niiyo’ is ‘four’ [in Ojibwe], as in ‘niiyo-biboonagizi,’ which means ‘four years old.’ It’s for my son. I like to sneak the language into some of our song titles.”<br />\n<b>“Ogiin”</b>\nDM: “I wrote this from my dad’s point of view, trying to imagine when he was taken from my home reservation, Brokenhead Ojibway Nation. As the lyrics progressed, I made it about me and my dad—like, me as a young person having to go to a lot of these rural-area schools with a lot of racist farmers’ kids. Even the teachers were super racist. The school that I went to was called Happy Thought in East Selkirk, Manitoba, which is definitely a psyop, because who names a school Happy Thought where there’s all these racist farm boys who I had to fight all the time? I would get taken out of school because of bad behavior, and I would tell my dad all the time about this school, and whenever I wanted to stay home, he wouldn’t even argue with me. He was like, ‘OK, you can just chill here.’ We would hang out in this old silver Grand Marquis from the ’80s and we would just sit in it. It’s such a typical rez thing: a broken-down car that doesn’t run anymore, in the middle of a field. That’s what this song’s all about.”<br />\n<b>“Spirit in Me”</b>\nAS: “This became the most meaningful song for me: It’s about my family history; it’s about Daniel and his family, and how meaningful his story is to me. When we first started doing the project, I was writing songs for Daniel—it’s the first time I’ve really done something like that. And so, this really embodies a lot of the good things that we’re trying to say. I know that a lot of my work at times has been really gritty, and I put a lot of my anger and healing work into my music, but this was a way to really uplift and uphold that idea of what we’re doing.”<br />\n<b>“Yaweh”</b>\nDM: “The melody that we do is the first melody that I ever learned on drumming. As a young Native person in Selkirk, Manitoba, we had a Friendship Centre that was on Main Street, and I remember going there and learning this song that Cherokee sang, and it was a song that my mom sang too.”\nAS: “It’s super meaningful for me to get to play along with this song and make up some of my own parts and sing and use AutoTune and reverse the lyrics. For me, it’s my first time doing something this traditionally on the nose. Even though it’s still a shoegaze/dream-pop song, it’s still a cultural song as well. A lot of our work tends to exist outside of that, but it’s nice to touch base and honor the ancestors.” <br />\n<b>“Birch Bark Paper Trails”</b>\nAS: “Before we recorded this, Kevin asked us, ‘Have you ever heard of [the post-rock band] Trans Am?’ And I was like, ‘Kevin, I have white hair—I know Trans Am!’ I had written it in that style, sonically, and what Kevin and Nyles did with the atmospherics and stuff took it to a whole other planet. The spoken-word part was really hard to do; I’ll just let the words speak for themselves. But I think it represents so many people’s story of connection to their community: that feeling of isolation, and apprehension of how to move forward collectively.”\nDM: “I think that’s one of the most powerful parts of the record. As a First Nations person, the stuff that Adam’s talking about in the song is wild. Because a lot of the research that we have to do about our ancestors is tough, and it’s not always accessible. There’s parts in that spoken-word section where Adam says, ‘I found you in the registry’—you never think learning about where you come from is gonna be so hard until you actually do it.

The results are spacious indeed, wrapping the band’s leisurely dream pop in a warm shroud of reverb while giving each individual element plenty of room to shine. But this record wasn’t without its challenges: Frontman/producer Josh Mehrtens battled pneumonia and pleurisy midway through, informing his lyrical themes in the process. “You gotta carry on, my dear/Don’t be afraid of things not working out,” he sings on “F.E.A.R.,” a song about breaking out of your own comfort zone. Mehrtens exudes similar reassurance on the distortion-crowned “This Kinda Day,” the first song he wrote during his recovery. Elsewhere, the band settles into satisfying extended jams and even evokes <i>Bankrupt!</i>-era Phoenix on “The Time of Our Lives,” flirting with 1980s motifs and name-dropping geographic highlights of their time in Japan while confirming their unfussed charisma.","short":"Personal illness informed the Dunedin band’s jammy dream pop."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Wb3fstgeT9KervahNq46b"}},{"id":"1608487955","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1608487955?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1842,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/1a/f3/5c/1af35c49-c02e-d46c-59f3-21c260e3ba6c/4062548041347.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1840,"textColor3":"cdb7a8","textColor2":"e5b4bc","textColor4":"bc9197","textColor1":"fae3d1","bgColor":"160606","hasP3":false},"artistName":"C.ORP","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paranoid-visions-ep/1608487955","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Paranoid Visions -

Twenty-five years later, they celebrate their silver anniversary with this program of music written entirely by living women composers, alongside one track by 12th-century musical visionary Hildegard von Bingen. It’s a beautiful recital, ranging from the quirky “Eliza Aria,” by Soviet-born Australian composer/pianist Elena Kats-Chernin, to British composer Rebecca Dale’s icy portrait of “Winter.” There’s also the restless “Arise” by <i>Fleabag</i> composer Isobel Waller-Bridge and the cinematic sweep of British film composer Rachel Portman’s wistful “Flight.” Many of the pieces have been arranged by Dubeau herself, transforming them into thrilling showcases for a dream partnership. ","short":"Dubeau and her all-women ensemble celebrate music by women composers."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3t6UAakDDy0OPceF3AaqGk"}},{"id":"1596372872","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1596372872?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/25/d0/70/25d070dd-b34b-4b13-2a74-29d7d2884d3e/886449674725.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"a8a8a8","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Voivod","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/synchro-anarchy/1596372872","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":9,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Synchro Anarchy","recordLabel":"Century Media","upc":"886449674725","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 We Are Connected Music, under exclusive license to Century Media Records Ltd.","playParams":{"id":"1596372872","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JZN65DjGzT65ondXiQDHI"}},{"id":"1603702925","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1603702925?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f0/f0/a7/f0f0a739-bff3-6b90-7829-577e0f691aac/8718723192828.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"e0cae0","textColor2":"fa5259","textColor4":"de435e","textColor1":"fdfbfc","bgColor":"700572","hasP3":false},"artistName":"DJ T-1000","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-complain-dont-explain-ep/1603702925","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-02-11","name":"Don't Complain, Don't Explain -
