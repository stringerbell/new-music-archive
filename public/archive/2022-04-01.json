His pop-leaning, often soulful brand of radio country not only spawned hits like “Die a Happy Man” and “Crash and Burn,” but inspired a younger generation of singer-songwriters who aren’t afraid to play with genres outside the confines of country. <i>Where We Started</i>, his sixth studio album, is something of a capstone on the first decade of his career, bringing together the mix of heartfelt love songs and laidback party anthems for which he’s come to be loved. “Church Boots” draws on Thomas Rhett’s own roots to connect with the everyman country fan. “Half of Me,” featuring Riley Green, is a playful ode to cracking open a cold one. “Death Row,” a collaboration with Tyler Hubbard and Russell Dickerson, is the album’s most powerful moment, inspired by a real-life performance the trio gave for death row inmates at a men’s prison. And the title track is an endlessly catchy duet with Katy Perry, further strengthening his connection to the pop world.\n\n“I think it's really important to look back at where you began, because you can't really be happy about your future until you look back and understand, like, 'Dang, we started with zero,'” he tells Apple Music. “And the blessings that we've achieved at this point are so incredible. I'm at a very reflective point in my life and really just grateful for the things that have happened for me, not only professionally but with my family.” Below, Thomas Rhett breaks down several key tracks on <i>Where We Started</i>.\n\n<b>“The Hill”</b>\n“If you look back at some of the credits of my last few records, you're not going to see very many songs without my name on them. After I wrote ‘Die a Happy Man,’ I felt like if I wasn't involved with the song, then it would always be a great song, but not have that sense of personalness that I bring to a session. I think people can write a song about love, but it's never going to fully represent how I feel about my wife, without at least me throwing my two cents into the song. And I'm a fixer in our relationship, so anytime [my wife] Lauren is upset, I'm just wondering what I can do. ‘How do I fix what I just said?’ ‘Oh, Lord, could I please take that comment back?’ And they sent me this song the next day and I was in tears in the kitchen listening to it, because I was like, ‘I feel like I wrote this song.’”\n\n<b>“Church Boots”</b>\n“I think the whole idea of that song is that I'm the same dude regardless of the situation that I'm in. I hold on to things that mean something to me. I wear the same jeans Friday that I wear on Sunday. I wear the same boots on Sunday that I wear to work in the field on a Monday or Tuesday. And I just felt like that song was so relatable to so many people of just being like, ‘Hey, are you going to wear <i>that</i>? Are you going to dress like that for church?’ And you're like, ‘Well, I am. I wipe the dust off my boots and we're ready to go.’ That's how my dad is. That's how my granddaddy is. That's how I am, and obviously how a lot of people are in the world, too. So it just felt like a unique way to say that I'm always the same dude through and through.”\n\n<b>“Angels”</b>\n“I wrote that song with Teddy Swims, Josh Thompson, and Julian Bunetta. I wrote it from a personal perspective, just like, ‘Dang, the things that I have done with you by my side, I don't understand how you're still here. You've traveled with me for 800,000 shows, you sat with me during radio interviews, you went everywhere with me and were always my rock and did it with such grace.’ Because this is just not an easy career to be married in. I just looked at my wife and I was like, ‘I think that you might not be a real human sometimes. I think that you might be a living, walking angel.’”\n\n<b>“Half of Me” (feat. Riley Green)</b>\n“The story of that song is one of my favorites, I think, on the record. We were on the road, just me and my dad, Josh Thompson and Will Bundy, and we had just got done writing a song that no one really liked, which is always a bummer on the road. Stepping off the bus, I looked at Josh and I said, ‘Hey, man, let's get after another song later tonight, I'm tapped for now. Do you want to go work out? Do you want to go eat some food?’ And he was like, ‘Nah. Half of me wants to drink a cold beer, and so does the other half.’ And we both looked at each other and we were like, ‘Okay, let's go write that,’ and literally went on the bus and wrote that song in 45 minutes.”\n\n<b>“Death Row” (feat. Tyler Hubbard and Russell Dickerson)</b>\n“Me, Tyler, and Russell got asked to go sing some songs for some inmates that were currently serving time on death row. Before you know it, we played for an hour. And at the very last song that we sang, one of the guys was like, ‘Y'all have to get this guy to sing you his version of “Amazing Grace.”’ And so this guy up top, whose foot was chained to the ground, he came down into where we were sitting, and God, he sang the most beautiful version of ‘Amazing Grace’ you ever heard. I don't know what I felt, but I do know that after getting done playing the songs and just talking with some of them, I just felt this empathy, like, ‘We've all made terrible mistakes in our lives and some end up being way worse than others,’ but also realizing there's always room for redemption.”\n\n<b>“Slow Down Summer”</b>\n“Looking back at my catalog, I think people loved songs like ‘Marry Me’ just because that was a weird concept coming from a guy that writes so many love songs. So I felt like putting this song out brought back a little bit of what people loved from ‘Marry Me’ and turned it into a different, unique idea called ‘Slow Down Summer.’ And it's been a really cool way to start this record off, because I feel like, if that's the introduction, there's a lot of different directions we can go now that I think will completely catch people off guard, in a good way.”\n\n<b>“Us Someday”</b>\n“During the time of that recording process, I'd been listening to a lot of Beatles songs. One of my favorite Beatles songs is ‘Eleanor Rigby,’ and that song starts out with a string section and it continues the entire way through. In country music, strings are not a super popular instrument, because, I think, it makes you feel like Sinatra or big-band stuff. But it was interesting once the strings came in with drums and acoustic guitar and a steel guitar; it just all made sense. And I think it makes that song really stand out on the record, just from a production standpoint. And lyrically, it’s something that I think a lot of people enjoy hearing from me.”\n\n<b>“Where We Started” (feat. Katy Perry)</b>\n“I really didn't have any intention of having a feature on this track, but my label was saying, like, ‘Hey, this would be cool with maybe a female feature.’ And I was like, ‘Well, who are y'all thinking that you want to ask?’ And they said, ‘Katy Perry.’ And I literally laughed. I was like, ‘There's no way that she is going to, first of all, like this song, or, second of all, have any interest in doing a song with me.’ And she literally got back with our management the next day and said yes. And that's just a God thing. You can't make that stuff up. I've been a fan of Katy since I was like 14 years old. In my opinion she’s a pop icon of my generation.”","short":"“I think it's really important to look back at where you began.” Listen in Spatial."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/794M3R461sLnY042CsB3xW"}},{"id":"1608013512","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1608013512?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/6a/f5/6b/6af56b1d-1cc8-68e8-a428-5caccf20e69a/093624880639.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"4db024","textColor2":"ff472f","textColor4":"d23e29","textColor1":"58d628","bgColor":"221b15","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/unlimited-love/1608013512","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-01","name":"Unlimited Love","recordLabel":"Warner Records","upc":"093624880639","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Warner Records Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1608013512","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“One more time, for whatever reason, the universe saw fit to inject this band with another giant shot of plasma,” Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis tells Apple Music. “Left to our own devices, we probably would've withered on the vine somewhere along the line, as we all do at some point. But it wasn't quite time for us to do that yet.” \n\nThe shot of “plasma” that Kiedis is referring to is, in large part, the (second) return of guitarist John Frusciante, after roughly a decade away. You can immediately hear the difference—in the aqueous funk of “Poster Child,” the stadium-ready swings of “These Are the Ways,” or the acoustic phrasing of “Tangelo,” the album’s delicate closer. “It's so clear when he writes and when he plays,” Kiedis says of his bandmate, whose guitar work proved galvanizing on career highlights like 1991’s <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> and 1999’s <i>Californication</i>. “It's really fun to listen to because it’s sound and emotion and color. He's not trying to play the right notes—he's just trying to play the notes that are truly him.”\n\nAlso back in the fold: producer and honorary fifth Chili Pepper Rick Rubin, who—absent on 2016’s <i>The Getaway</i>—accompanied Kiedis to Kauai for a songwriting retreat that was unexpectedly extended by lockdown. “Nobody could come, nobody could leave,” Kiedis says. “It was six months of being in the land that time forgot.” For the five of them, the aim was simple: Be together, play together, and, in Kiedis’ words, “write and write and write and write. Maybe we'll keep all of it, maybe we'll keep some of it. The process that it had to go through to become this record was very democratic in the sense that we all voted, including Rick.”\n\nThe result is 17 songs that pay tribute to the veteran outfit’s chemistry and affection for one another, a magnetic coming-together that’s apparent anytime they play. “We're older and different, and enter <i>Unlimited Love</i>, a really fun and wild experience,” Kiedis says. “We accept each other and we love each other and there is an endless friendship going on there—which is not to say that we want to hang out every day. It's nice to go away from it and come back to it, go away from it and come back. But it never dies.” Here, Kiedis takes us inside a few highlights from the album. \n\n<b>“Not the One”</b>\n“This idea came out from ‘I think I know who you are, but maybe I don't. You think you know who I am, but maybe you don't.’ Especially in intimate relationships, we all present something and people always have an idea, but what would happen if we just showed each other our very worst from the very start? Like, not trying to impress each other, or just ‘I’m kind of a fuck-up and here's my weak suit and my flaws.’ And then we would never have to discover that down the line and go, ‘What?’”\n\n<b>“Poster Child”</b>\n“I didn't think that the music from ‘Poster Child’ was going to survive, because Flea brought in two painfully funky basslines on the same day, and they weren't similar, but the way I was hearing it was like, ‘I have to choose. My plate's too full.’ And so I chose the other one, which ended up becoming a song called ‘Peace and Love’ that didn't make the record. The one that I thought was the superior funk was not the superior funk, and then it just took me a long time of living with this music before I found my place. I can't say that any of them were really a struggle or a battle, but it’s the one that I was surprised came to life.”\n\n<b>“These Are the Ways”</b>\n“That's a song that John brought—the arrangement and a version of that melody. I’m never able to recreate his melodies perfectly—he's just on a different melodic level—so I usually put it through a simplification machine. I didn't overthink it. It was the first idea that came to my mind when I heard that arrangement, which is very bombastic and almost like a huge classical orchestra, exploding and then going way back. It was a reflection on life in America, but not a good or a bad reflection—just, this is it. We might be bloated, we might be overloaded with more than we can handle, and let's just take a step back and rethink it just a little bit. But it’s not ‘this is wrong and that's right.’ It's just ‘this is who we've become.’”","short":"“The universe saw fit to inject this band with another giant shot of plasma.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ITVvrNiINKRiW7wA3w6w6"}},{"id":"1616737518","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616737518?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/35/14/ba/3514badc-9226-5994-d1c5-3c37e2cb963c/22UMGIM33359.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1cfcc","textColor2":"f0c4a6","textColor4":"c6a186","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"1e1408","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Yeat","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/2-aliv%C3%AB-ge%C3%ABk-pack/1616737518","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":29,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-01","name":"2 Alivë (Geëk Pack)","recordLabel":"Field Trip Recordings/Geffen Records","upc":"00602445749331","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A Field Trip Recordings/Geffen Records Release; ℗ 2022 Geffen Records","playParams":{"id":"1616737518","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"LA-based MC Yeat might only be getting his feet wet in the rap game, but he’s already long on confidence. “Everything I’m doing is just better than you,” he sings to doubters on <i>2 Alivë</i>’s “Jus bëtter.” <i>2 Alivë</i> is the MC’s first project of 2022, after having released three in 2021 alone (<i>Up 2 Më</i>, <i>4L</i>, <i>Alivë</i>). Fans of viral selections like <i>4L</i>’s “Sorry Bout That” will recognize Yeat’s penchant for slipping in and out of vintage Young Thug flows, but if the YSL general himself takes no issue with it (Thugger appears on the album’s “Outsidë”), how could we? As a young star on the rise, Yeat chooses mostly to rap about a life full of drugs, money, and mayhem, but what he says is less important than how he says it. The rapping (and singing) here is rarely hurried and mostly delivered over what sounds like 1990s video-game-inspired production. And still, full verses can be difficult to understand, a clear reminder that even as the flagship MC of burgeoning label Field Trip Recordings and maybe the most buzzed-about MC of the post-SoundCloud generation, Yeat is but a medium for the vibes.","short":"Hear the MC get even more alive in Spatial Audio, plus nine new songs."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0345WPzPBSeISh2IpIQWxT"}},{"id":"1616999231","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616999231?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/7c/14/f3/7c14f314-3281-909f-d7e7-1aa44ecec926/22UMGIM35344.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d16628","textColor2":"ea531e","textColor4":"c3451a","textColor1":"fc7c2f","bgColor":"270c0c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dreamville & J.

The title also references the band itself—we’re doing the same thing we set out to do many years ago.” Below, he comments on each track. \n \n<b>“Broken Cog”</b>\n“This one is ‘third time’s the charm.’ We actually started recording this for <i>Koloss</i> back in 2012, but it just didn’t feel right. We tried it again for <i>The Violent Sleep of Reason</i>, but it didn’t happen again. This time, we finally got it to work. It was a deliberate choice to put this first, a song that builds and builds, and once the vocals kick in, it’s not even [vocalist] Jens [Kidman]—it’s just warped whispers and stuff. It’s definitely an esoteric choice of first track, but I think it’s cool because you have no idea what to expect of the next one.” \n \n<b>“The Abysmal Eye”</b>\n“This is a track that me and [bassist] Dick [Lövgren] worked on for a long time. We had two or three hours’ worth of different riffs that we honed down to this. Lyrics-wise, it’s the big AI scare. To a certain degree, it was inspired by an interview with Elon Musk, where he talks about AI. It’s daunting and scary if you allow yourself to get into that mode of thinking.” \n \n<b>“Light the Shortening Fuse”</b>\n“This is one of [guitarist] Mårten [Hagström]’s tracks, and he wrote the lyrics for it as well. It’s a commentary on how social media has changed everything and become such a tool for idiocy and disinformation. It’s become a political tool that people look to as some form of verified news outlet, [whereas in] reality it’s quite the opposite. No one should ever listen to it. And also, for kids, as far as body dysmorphia and all these filters that make you look a certain way—social media fucks with everything.” \n \n<b>“Phantoms”</b>\n“We’re one of those bands that can sometimes write music and rhythms completely based around drums. This was a song that I’d been messing around with for a while, and I put some weird, downtuned guitars on it, but then Dick came in and wrote real riffs for it. Lyrically, this is one of the few that’s a bit more personal. It’s about memories and regrets over things you’ve done or said in life that you really wish undone. As you get older and step out of your younger self, you get a better sense of how hurtful some of those things were.” \n \n<b>“Ligature Marks”</b>\n“This is another one of Mårten’s tracks, and to me it’s one of the strongest on the album. I heard him playing this thing about a week before we went into the studio and was like, ‘Dude, what is that?’ Apparently, he’d had it laying around for years, but it made it to the album with a week’s notice. The song is using S&M vocabulary as metaphors for how we act in life as masochists or sadists on a spiritual level—as a species, but also as individuals being the threat to our own existence.” \n \n<b>“God He Sees in Mirrors”</b>\n“Dick Lövgren wrote everything for this. It’s a very short, rhythmical phrase that never starts the same way, which makes it weird to listen to. Lyrically, this is about how the well-being of the individual and the collective is subdued under the policies of tyrants and dictators. Instead, the gaining of power and personality cult becomes way more important than policy-directing. See Trump, for example. Or Bolsonaro in Brazil. There’s plenty of them around the world. They see God in mirrors.” \n \n<b>“They Move Below”</b>\n“This is an instrumental, and it’s one of Mårten’s tracks. This is his go-to place. For each album, he always writes something in the style of this, where it’s a little sludgier, with almost one foot in stoner rock and one foot in metal. It also has a two- or three-minute intro that’s only clean guitar. It’s beautiful-sounding. We’re using this track as a tool on the album to take things down several notches and start over.” \n \n<b>“Kaleidoscope”</b>\n“To me, this one is a little bit like the <i>Koloss</i> track ‘Do Not Look Down,’ which was a little bit more rock and not quite as metal. This is another one me and Dick worked on together. We weren’t really sure about this one until we heard Jens’ vocals and started mixing it. Then we realized, ‘Oh, this thing is hopping.’ Lyrically, it’s imagining a drug you could take that lets you see things for what they truly are, whether that’s injustices or lies or even good things.” \n \n<b>“Black Cathedral”</b>\n“This is an intro for ‘I Am That Thirst,’ but it is its own track. The weird thing is, on the album there’s a long gap between them. I felt like they should have been more put together. But it really ties into ‘I Am That Thirst’ in the sense that you have the same tremolo-picking going on with something like 20 or 30 guitars stacked on top of each other. Sometimes you’re feeling like you just want to put something on there that’s not what people expect at all, and this is one of those things.” \n \n<b>“I Am That Thirst”</b>\n“That’s a track by Mårten, but I wrote the lyrics for it. He usually goes into sludge mode or thrash mode, and this is definitely his thrash mode. People might recognize this style from some of the earlier works we’ve done. Lyrically, it’s about man’s desire for wealth and immortality—and the thirst for more, regardless of the status or wealth that you already possess. A ‘grass is greener on the other side’ type of thing.”\n \n<b>“The Faultless”</b>\n“Another Mårten track with my lyrics. This is a first for us because it has Jens, Mårten, and me doing vocals for it. There’s a part that goes from left to right, where Mårten does a vocal and Jens does the answer. And then there’s a spoken vocal part that comes in—that’s my voice, and we just pitched it down a half a note or something. Lyrically, it’s about mental and psychological abuse through words and actions, and how some people go through life inflicting injury on others while being completely unable to see their own faults and flaws.” \n \n<b>“Armies of the Preposterous”</b>\n“This is one of me and Dick’s tracks. It’s a waltz, which is unusual. We’ve only done that once before, which was ‘The Demon’s Name is Surveillance’ off the <i>Koloss</i> album. It’s also one of the few songs on the album that has faster double bass for longer periods of time. Lyrically, it’s about the preposterous rise of neo-Nazism and far-right policies around the world. It’s scary to me how supposedly functioning individuals can stand there and say that the genocide of the Jews during World War II did not happen.”\n \n<b>“Past Tense”</b>\n“It’s been a few albums since we ended on something really calm like this, but it’s a tool we used to implement in the ’90s, especially on <i>Chaosphere</i> and <i>Destroy Erase Improve</i>. We just wanted to strengthen the sad note that ‘Armies of the Preposterous’ ends on by adding a final track that’s sad and melancholy.”","short":"“We’re doing the same thing we set out to do many years ago.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6EgEo5csYA7HqasanrvwWk"}},{"id":"1601210257","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1601210257?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/3a/5a/2a/3a5a2a7f-1651-8bfd-ceba-f66e6d540f32/21UM1IM58206.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0aa93","textColor2":"cdc7bb","textColor4":"a49f95","textColor1":"f1d5b8","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Carpenter Brut","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/leather-terror/1601210257","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-01","name":"Leather Terror","recordLabel":"Universal Music Division Virgin Records Distribution Deal","upc":"00602445408511","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 No Quarter Prod, exclusively distributed by Virgin Records France","playParams":{"id":"1601210257","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/37PW0ipoWcjx3APS1MN0ql"}},{"id":"1601542904","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1601542904?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/eb/d9/c6/ebd9c6e9-b8d9-b88b-97a3-7dbf9a27a927/4050538774443.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"66dcec","textColor2":"fdca32","textColor4":"cfb350","textColor1":"7afdf5","bgColor":"1757cb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"PUP","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-unraveling-of-puptheband/1601542904","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-01","name":"THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND","recordLabel":"Rise Records","upc":"4050538774443","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2021 PUP under exclusive license to Rise Records / BMG Rights Management (US) LLC","playParams":{"id":"1601542904","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After the release of PUP’s 2019 album, <i>Morbid Stuff</i>, vocalist and guitarist Stefan Babcock began to consider whether they should push and open up their sound without fundamentally altering it. “The line we’re always trying to straddle is, ‘How can we do something a bit weird without totally alienating our fans?’” Babcock tells Apple Music. “The goal with the guy who made the first three records, Dave Schiffman, was always like, ‘Here are the songs. Let’s try to make it sound like we’re literally playing the best live show we’ve ever played.’ We love what he brought to the table, but with this one, we wanted to push it and see what would happen if we had more time in the studio.”\n \nThe Toronto punks stationed themselves for five weeks at producer/engineer Peter Katis’ residential Tarquin Studios in Connecticut to record their fourth full-length, <i>THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND</i>. Katis—whose credits include working with The National, Japandroids, and Interpol—distills the band’s essence with a little more kick. “It was a natural and unnatural fit at the same time,” Babcock says. “I think he was put in a position that he’s not used to—it was just a new challenge for him and that was an unnatural part, and the natural part was that we all think about music in the same way and appreciate the same types of qualities in music.” Here, Babcock guides us through songs from the album.\n \n<b>“Four Chords”</b>\n“It’s funny because there’s never been any piano on any PUP record, or keys or synthesizers of any kind, and we started this record with the stupidest piano ballad of all time. In one sense, it’s so un-PUP to have a piano ballad, but in another sense, it’s incredibly PUP to do something that dumb to start a record. I wrote the song as a joke after I bought a piano during the pandemic. I sent it to my bandmates, and we never talked about it again after. The last week in the studio, Nestor [Chumak, PUP bassist/keyboardist] was like, ‘You should record it and that should start the record.’ I slept on it, and the more that I thought about it, the more I thought he was really onto something. As soon as we embraced this idea that this was going to be the first song, the whole record started to make sense to me. It became more than just a collection of songs. I could almost see the forest for the trees.”\n \n<b>“Totally Fine”</b>\n“After ‘Four Chords,’ we had to go into a song that was very quintessentially PUP. It’s the same mentality we had on the second record when we started with a song called ‘If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will,’ which is a slow, mellow song, and then it goes into the most high-energy song on the record. So, there’s a little bit of not trying to recreate that, but a little bit of taking the elements that we liked—that dynamic between quiet and really ruckus—and shoving them together to start a record.”\n \n<b>“Robot Writes a Love Song”</b>\n“It’s a weird song for me because the vast majority of PUP songs are written from my first-person perspective. ‘Robot’ is not, but I was legitimately trying to see if I could write a really heartfelt love song, and it being just earnest, without any humor in it. So, this love song that I was trying to write, it just felt so yucky. It was so contrived, and it felt very not me and not PUP. When I decided to try and change the perspective, it worked so well. Suddenly, all of these things that I was saying, that I felt were so cheesy, were a little bit humorous and had more weight and impact to them. Hiding behind humor, for me, is a little bit of a crutch that I use, but I think that song turned out better because I was willing to take it to a place that wasn’t just entirely serious and super emotionally draining.”\n \n<b>“Matilda”</b>\n“This song is me trying to figure out why there’s such a strong emotional connection to an object, or what is it that ties you to this object? And usually, for me, it’s a very specific time in my life. On the first record, I wrote a song about my car, which I was very emotionally attached to. I did so much growing up in that car. I drove it across the country and I kissed a girl for the first time—all of these memories. So, this one is about my guitar, Matilda, and it’s the same sort of thing: Why am I so attached to this guitar? And it’s because it’s so connected to a time in my life that was so emotionally turbulent and also kind of wonderful. The first time that we ever went on tour, and we were trying to be a real band, everything was really new and exciting and weird. We were broke and loving it. That time in my life was almost like what I feel falling in love the first time, when everything is more vibrant. You feel every emotion so much harder than you normally would.”\n \n<b>“Relentless”</b>\n“Sarah [Tudzin], from the band illuminati hotties, sings on the chorus and in the bridge, and she’s awesome. There’s two sides to what I’m talking about here: One is trying to get ahead, being ambitious, pushing forward and trying to fight off the dread that comes with that, and the other side is this dread that you keep trying to get ahead of in life. I just feel like there’s always a demon over my shoulder and that’s how the world feels too. It’s so overwhelming; there’s no time or emotional or mental energy to look backwards or to look forward. You’re just dealing with what’s in front of you, and that’s a tough place for our world to be in.”\n \n<b>“Waiting”</b>\n“I asked Nestor to send me this running document of guitar riffs that he has. He sent me these five pretty heavy riffs, and from that we used one on ‘Waiting’ that I really love. I thought the best way to make it feel like a PUP song, rather than a metal song or a hardcore song, was the simplest, most uplifting chorus that I could write onto the really heavy guitar riff, and it worked in a very PUP way. There’s always this contrast in our music, the lyrics versus the actual music. If the lyrics are really serious, we try to make the music sound pretty fun and vice versa. I think we found that combination of heavy and joy that we’re always kind of looking for.”\n \n<b>“Habits”</b>\n“When I originally wrote the song, it was just guitar and voice, and it felt like a good PUP song. It wasn’t going to change the game for us, but we were like, ‘Yes, this sounds like us and it’s cool and it’s fun.’ But we kind of put it aside, and then one day Zack [Mykula, PUP drummer] came in and was like, ‘Hey, I made this thing for “Habits.” It’s kind of out there, but maybe it works.’ He was the one who crafted that synthy intro, which we also sprinkled elements of that throughout. I think we all really gravitated to what he did. For me, it took a song that we all liked and thought was pretty standard, but not in a bad way, into a new territory for us that made it so much more exciting.”\n \n<b>“Cutting Off the Corners”</b>\n“With most PUP songs—even when I’m writing the real dark and serious things—I’m always trying to find that little glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, some silver lining or just some cathartic joy, and I very purposely avoided that as a crutch on this song. I don’t know how deep I want to get into it, but I wrote it three days after I lost an old friend. So, that was a song that poured out at me all at once, and it was very emotionally charged. We talked about adding some joy, some energy, some good vibes, and that felt like a disservice to what the song was about. So, it’s a strange one. That song is on the album for me and for her, and I just wanted to make something for them that didn't hide behind the humor.”\n \n<b>“Grim Reaping”</b>\n“I wouldn’t say we’re a traditionally political band, but the four of us all have very strong political convictions that we express in other ways—whether it’s through our social media or at live shows. It makes up for the fact that we don’t really talk politics too much in our songs, and the reason that we don’t is because I really struggle with making it sound genuine without it sounding super contrived. Like, ‘Fuck the man.’ I feel like every time I’ve tried to write those songs, I sound like a bad impersonation of OFF! or Bad Religion. I was trying to write about the state of the world but through a really personal lens, trying to express how myself and the band have been coping with those challenges. I’m pretty good at speaking eloquently about my emotions and less eloquently about other things, so I try to bring it into my universe.”\n \n<b>“PUPTHEBAND Inc. Is Filing for Bankruptcy”</b>\n“This is truly an example of the unraveling of PUP, the band. This song is just so true to who we are as humans in terms of the lyrics, but also the way the music is arranged. It’s our version of being truly self-indulgent. If we were a prog-rock band, this would be our 14-minute epic. Also, part of the decisions that were made—the saxophone solo and then right after where there’s a room recording of me playing through the shitty PA that we found—came about because this was the last song that we recorded for the record. If it were during week one, we would’ve said, ‘No, that’s stupid. Let’s stay focused.’ And at that point, we’d been in the studio—where we were also living and sharing the same space together—for five weeks and were starting to get a little bit crazy. We were like, ‘That’s a great idea. What other stupid shit can we do?’”","short":"“We wanted to see what would happen if we had more time in the studio.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2bRpK0BpzYUQZYIzri35n6"}},{"id":"1611059145","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611059145?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/76/73/db/7673db41-1dc5-eaf5-bdcf-d670c629c32b/5059449063874.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f3f3f","textColor2":"262626","textColor4":"515151","textColor1":"0f0f0f","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bryan Adams","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/classic/1611059145","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-04","name":"Classic","recordLabel":"Badams Music Limited","upc":"5059449063874","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Badams Music Limited","playParams":{"id":"1611059145","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/03XgnNQDve2dWqBG1ARjvR"}},{"id":"1615360921","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615360921?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/17/3a/82/173a823c-0fc9-48dd-ab7a-d847e39dfd81/NCTDREAM_02_Glitch_Mode_digital_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"ccd2d3","textColor2":"00fff9","textColor4":"00d2cf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"042328","hasP3":false},"artistName":"NCT DREAM","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/glitch-mode-the-2nd-album/1615360921","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-03-28","name":"Glitch Mode - The 2nd Album","recordLabel":"SM Entertainment","upc":"888735940781","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 SM Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1615360921","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"K-pop seven-piece NCT DREAM—an NCT subunit—started off as an all-teen group whose themes were firmly rooted in adolescence. But that all changed in 2020: Rather than graduating members when they turned 20 as a way of keeping the music teen-oriented, the seven members stuck together. The move proved a huge success, with their 2021 album <i>Hot Sauce</i> becoming one of the biggest South Korean albums in history. Arriving 10 months later, <i>Glitch Mode</i>, the second album featuring the same seven members, follows through on that success. All 11 tracks showcase different sounds and styles, and were co-produced by Benjamin 55, minGtion, and Dem Jointz, along with band members MARK, JENO, JAEMIN, and JISUNG.

After all, the Swedish rock battalion had released seven albums in 12 years, toured the globe, and even won a Swedish Grammy. “The band had run its course and I wanted to move on,” guitarist, vocalist, and co-founder Nicke Andersson tells Apple Music. “It probably took a year before people started asking about a reunion show, but I always said, ‘No, we broke up. Let us be broken up.’” \n \nAs the years passed, Andersson began seeing things differently. In 2016, The Hellacopters played a reunion show to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut album. “It felt really nice playing the old songs again,” Andersson recalls. “As we started playing more and more shows, we felt we needed a new album because we’re not old enough to be a nostalgia band.” Enter <i>Eyes of Oblivion</i>, The Hellacopters’ first album in 14 years—and their first with guitarist and co-founder Dregen since 1997’s <i>Payin’ the Dues</i>. Below, Andersson comments on each track. \n \n<b>“Reap a Hurricane”</b>\n“It was actually the last song I wrote for the album. Up until then, we didn’t feel like we had a song that would be suitable for a first song on the album. And loving the album format, the sequencing is really important to me. The first song on any rock album should always be upbeat. The lyrics are talking about how, since industrialization, things have been moving pretty fast in the world—and that doesn’t look very good. But I tried to wrap it in a little bit of humor.” \n \n<b>“Can It Wait”</b>\n“I probably wrote this song at least ten years ago, back when I had my other band Imperial State Electric. I remember we all thought that it sounded too much like The Hellacopters. So, when we started talking about recording a new Hellacopters album, this was the first one I showed to the other guys.” \n \n<b>“So Sorry I Could Die”</b>\n“This one is also around ten years old, I think. It’s just my Swedish take on American rhythm & blues. Being me, it’s not going to sound like rhythm & blues from the ’60s, but that’s what I had in the back of my head. It’s something we have never tried before, so that was really fun for us. And it got Boba, our keyboard player, to shine a little bit.” \n \n<b>“Eyes of Oblivion”</b>\n“I think this is probably the one song on the album that sounds most like The Hellacopters. It reminds me of other songs we have. The lyrics are talking about how the world can be too much sometimes. Russia is attacking Ukraine at the moment and we’re almost over the pandemic and I think a lot of people just want to disappear for an hour or two. You want to escape a little bit. That being said, I don’t want to ignore things around me, either.” \n \n<b>“A Plow and a Doctor”</b>\n“The theme for this one is a little bit of a different take on the first song. We’ve gone so far so quickly, but perhaps we should just destroy everything and start from scratch. And then we’d need a plow so we can eat, and a doctor so we don’t get too sick.” \n \n<b>“Positively Not Knowing”</b>\n“I’ve written a few songs about religion over the years, and this is one of them. I would call myself an atheist, but I’m also very fascinated how people can be so convinced. And it amazes me that I’m <i>not</i> so convinced. And then another guy can believe something completely different and also be so convinced. Maybe I’m right and they’re wrong, or it’s the other way around. I don’t know. So, I’m just having fun with that topic.”\n \n<b>“Tin Foil Soldier”</b>\n“I am a big fan of ’70s glam, so this is me trying to channel Sweet and Slade. But then, it’s through the Swedish filter, so it will come out different. But that was the idea when I sat down with the guitar. I had this riff that I thought sounded a bit like it could be from that era. Even on the demo, I put handclaps because a song like that needs handclaps. And then Dregen wrote the lyrics to this one.” \n \n<b>“Beguiled”</b>\n“I listen a lot to the Ramones, and sometimes you just want to play something that’s similar. But then, of course, you’re not the Ramones, so it won’t sound exactly like that. But the song is about internet trolls—just me having fun with them.”\n \n<b>“The Pressure’s On”</b>\n“That one's a little different because Boba, the keyboard player, wrote the music. I wrote the lyrics and the vocal melody and arranged a little bit of it, so that’s the team effort of the album. Lyrically, it’s pretty simple. It’s just about the pressure that’s on everybody these days. It’s coming from all over the place.” \n \n<b>“Try Me Tonight”</b>\n“Musically, I think that’s just me trying to channel a little bit of a Stooges/MC5 type thing, but there could also be a little bit of Kiss and Ted Nugent in there. And the lyrics are me having fun with that old phrase, ‘You can’t judge a book by its cover.’ In the narrative of the song, I may look like a geek to you, but just wait and see. Maybe I have a black belt in martial arts.
