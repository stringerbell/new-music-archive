The supergroup of producers/DJs Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso brought progressive and electro house—which had long been the provenance of clubs and dance music festivals—to a massive mainstream audience, essentially ushering in the EDM boom of the 2010s. When they announced they were calling it quits in 2012, they were at the absolute pinnacle of their game—and spun it into the genre's first-ever (and maybe only) farewell arena tour.\n\nWhile they reunited as a live act in 2018, SHM didn’t release any new music until 2021: a couple of singles which appear here on <i>Paradise Again</i>, technically their debut studio LP. But what’s most interesting isn’t that they waited so long, but rather what waiting so long sounds like: an entirely new Swedish House Mafia. Gone (mostly) are the trancey builds and drops heard on “Don’t You Worry Child” featuring John Martin and “Save the World” a decade prior in favor of something far more subtle, inward-looking, and wide-ranging. “It Gets Better,” the first new track to show up, in 2021, opens with a crunchy rock guitar and primal drumbeat before jumping into an off-kilter groove, a distorted vocal, and a clipped break that nods to ’90s big beat. Its title is a mantra-like refrain for anyone who lived through the pandemic: “We soundtracked the imagination of seeing our fans again,” Angello told Apple Music when the track was first released. “Lifetime” featuring Ty Dolla $ign and 070 Shake—which mixes bits of dance, R&B, hip-hop, and pop—followed soon after: “It's like Swedish House Mafia in a blender,” he said. “It’s 100% feel. We sat down and we were just throwing ideas at each other of what kind of music we like, and this is boiling everything down to, like, ‘What did we feel?’”\n\nThat muse led the trio in all sorts of different directions: sleek, soulful synth-pop with The Weeknd (“Moth to a Flame”); a squelchy, low-slung riff on The Police’s “Roxanne” with Sting himself reprising his vocals (“Redlight”); straight-up hip-hop with A$AP Rocky (“Frankenstein”). But probably the most important turn was back to house music itself, which anchors so much of the album. It’s in tracks like the gospel-inspired “Calling On,” “Time” featuring Mapei, “Don’t Go Mad” featuring Seinabo Sey, and the Mr. Fingers-referencing “Can U Feel It,” where the group shows its sense of reflection and a deep reverence for the music that inspired them in the first place.","short":"A decade after disbanding, SHM finally delivers a debut LP—in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Wc5TW906VV03DWbkgcfnR"}},{"id":"1617374972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617374972?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/be/3e/38/be3e3866-e64f-224c-4acb-305c56ec0c76/22UMGIM27716.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cba01b","textColor2":"fcab0c","textColor4":"cb890a","textColor1":"fcc822","bgColor":"080202","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Fredo Bang","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/two-face-bang-2/1617374972","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":18,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-14","name":"Two-Face Bang 2","recordLabel":"Se Lavi Productions, Inc./Def Jam","upc":"00602445799671","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Se Lavi Productions, Inc., under exclusive license to Def Jam Recordings, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1617374972","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Though he’s had plenty of street hits since “Oouuh,” there’s a subset of Fredo Bang fans who see the MC’s name and immediately hear him belting, “I’ma eat you like some foooood.” Some four years after the track—and the <i>2 Face Bang</i> project it appears on—“Oouuh” remains some of Bang’s most memorable work.

It’s afforded Vile a level of creative independence he’s not felt since he started recording in his bedroom years ago. “Why do I always have to go to some producer's studio?” he asks. “It's on their terms. I'm grateful for it, we got a lot of stuff done. But you could say nothing's been 100% my personality since my early, more lo-fi records. I was 100% guard down, just doing my thing, man.”\n\nHis ninth LP (and first for Verve, the legendary jazz imprint) combines the experimental purity of those early recordings with the sort of “completely high-fidelity” feel that he says his studio can provide, though he did, to be clear, collaborate again with producer Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Beck) both at home and in LA. The result, Vile says, is “kind of like some American folk version of shoegaze music”—a set of sidewinding pop (see: “Flyin [like a fast train]”, originally written for Kesha) and classic rock (“Fo Sho”) that includes contributions from Cate Le Bon and Chastity Belt, as well as drumming from Stella Mozgawa (Warpaint) and Sarah Jones (Hot Chip, Harry Styles). “It’s just lived in, really, the whole record,” he says. “There's multiple records that were left behind. But that's the way it should be. That's like somebody who's a carpenter or something, always working in their shop. I feel like you're not meant to put everything out. Just the way I live my life.” Here, Vile tells the story behind a number of songs on the album.\n\n<b>“Goin on a Plane Today”</b>\n“I got a piano at my house—it's very meditative and I can go to it every day. I remember I'd be touring [2018’s] <i>Bottle It In</i>, and I'd be thinking up these records that I was going to make from home, and then when I was home I'd go over to the piano and be like, ‘Oh, I'm so stoked, I'm going to get a lot of music done while I'm here.’ And then be rudely awakened to the fact that, no, I’ve got to leave in two weeks. I talk about opening for Neil Young in the song, because I wrote it around the time that we opened for Neil Young with Promise of the Real in Quebec, in 2018. That really happened.”\n\n<b>“Palace of OKV in Reverse”</b>\n“I love that there's more two-minute jams on this record—you could say that’s not been the case since my first album, [2008's] <i>Constant Hitmaker<i>, with ‘Freeway.’ But there's a lot of secrets about ‘OKV in Reverse.’ There's just a certain groove to it that triggered my mind, and then those lyrics came pretty quick. I didn't sing it until later when I was at Rob Schnapf's studio in LA, on the fly. He's good at capturing that thing.”\n\n<b>“Like Exploding Stones”</b>\n“‘Pain ricocheting in my brain like exploding stones.’ Some people attribute that line to migraines, and I do get migraines, so that's fine. But in the moment when I wrote it, it's more just stress, something weighing down hard on my head. I was pretty bummed out about something when I wrote that song, and then I recorded it right on my Zoom recorder—pretty much just live acoustics, drumming, and singing live. I imagined guitars feeding back, and the Moog synthesizer making noise, feedback massaging my cranium. I had all those things in the demo. Yeah, that's the beauty: You can just exorcise demons.”\n\n<b>“Hey Like a Child”</b>\n“It’s a love song. I’ve known my wife since we were pretty young, but you don't have to take it all so literally, because in the moment when I was writing it, obviously I've got children of my own. It’s got the shoegaze-y bend, but a jangle to it as well. And I knew that song had super poppy potential. We did an early version of it in my basement studio, but then I took it over to Rob Schnapf's and I replayed all the parts, and again, Sarah Jones, she just killed it on drums on that song. That song was made really quick.”\n\n<b>“Chazzy Don’t Mind”</b>\n“Courtney Barnett turned me on to Chastity Belt—they toured together on [2017’s] <i>I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone</i>. I liked their music immediately, but it creeps up on you because they sing about everyday things. Julia [Shapiro’s] lyrics are really emotional, sometimes funny but pretty real, and they have this cyclical playing that really resonates with me. I knew I wanted them on this song. Lydia [Lund] and Julia play guitar on it, and Annie [Truscott] plays violin on it, and they all sing. Annie, she's such an amazing musician, she’s got perfect pitch on the vocal. They all have an equally important role in the band, but it's her bass underneath it all that really gets that melancholy thing.”\n\n<b>“Wages of Sin”</b>\n“That's been one of my favorite songs of Springsteen’s for a long time—it’s got that melancholy, dark hypnotic thing. I knew I could sing the hell out of it and make it mine, but also stay true to his. Nobody's done that lately, but in the country music world that's what I like: There's a song that speaks to you, and often it's a deep cut or somebody hears a song written fresh off the presses, like a demo, and they're like, ‘That's my song.’ Well, this is that except it's been my song since my mid-twenties, and now here I am at 42. We got it. We nailed it. And Springsteen, I don't know—it'd be hard for him to ignore it. He'd have to make a conscious decision to ignore it. Something tells me him and Obama are going to be enjoying it soon.”\n\n<b>“Stuffed Leopard”</b>\n“It’s funny because I felt like ‘Wages of Sin’ was a centerpiece, and I wanted it to fade out. But then ‘Stuffed Leopard’ just crept up on me, and I realized I didn't fingerpick throughout the whole record. Lyrically, you're just looking at stuff around the house, and you're just clarifying it’s a toy, not a taxidermy leopard. Yeah, it's just a fingerpicker, man. What can I tell you? Can't help it.”</i></i>","short":"“I was 100% guard down, just doing my thing, man.”"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0iUKX7bSb68dbhM7sfcNwo"}},{"id":"1609467023","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1609467023?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/fb/f9/fb/fbf9fbba-01b1-e025-da77-add396e08ff3/886449877362.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbb597","textColor2":"01f1dc","textColor4":"04c3b4","textColor1":"f9deb8","bgColor":"110f14","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mitchell Tenpenny","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-low-light-sessions/1609467023","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":8,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-04-15","name":"The Low Light Sessions","recordLabel":"Riser House Entertainment/Columbia Nashville","upc":"886449877362","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Riser House Entertainment, LLC, under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment.

Having transmuted the reverb-laden sound of his vibraphone into soul- and hip-hop-referencing tracks on 2019’s <i>KingMaker</i> and 2020’s <i>Who Are You?</i>, Ross moves into newly collaborative territory on <i>The Parable of the Poet</i> with his eight-piece band, The Parables. Crafting the album’s seven tracks from pre-existing improvisations Ross made with fellow New School alumnus and saxophonist Sergio Tabanico, The Parables then spent a handful of live shows, pre-COVID, honing their emotional resonances. The result is a seamless suite of music that reflects the arc of a church service. It’s deeply moving yet full of space to allow for the listener’s interpretation, from the meditative calm of opener “PRAYER” to the frenetic melodies of “WAIL” and the polyrhythmic optimism of “DOXOLOGY (Hope).” Here, Ross walks through each of the album’s tracks.\n \n<b>“PRAYER”</b>\n“‘PRAYER’ introduces the concept of a praise team, which is a front line of singers in the Black church who help to lead the worship. I see the horns in this track as being like a praise team choir, and I wanted them to serve the music in that same way. Everybody, at one point in the song, takes the responsibility of repeating the theme, while the other players communicate around it. The track focuses on the concept of serving the music through this melodic information.“\n \n<b>“GUILT”</b>\n\"This was an improvisation with Sergio where I felt emotions coming through naturally. The music is supposed to serve as a parable—a story that can be interpreted based on people’s differing perspectives—but to me, it feels like as the song gets faster, it becomes more anxious, the way you can get more anxious if you feel guilty. All of these compositions come from a personal place, but I want to keep them open to interpretation.\"\n \n<b>“CHOICES”</b>\n“‘CHOICES’ was originally called ‘Haunting’ and was taken from another improvisation with Sergio where, for 20 minutes, we were droning and looking for this motif, which is an uneven three-bar phrase on top of a five-bar phrase. I arranged it exactly as we discovered it in the improvisation, and we ultimately decided to move away from this idea of a haunting and towards the idea of choices, since you might be equally haunted by your choices.”\n \n<b>“WAIL”</b>\n“This started from an improvisation I did by myself on a melodica, where I was trying to evoke that feeling of a wail of despair that comes from the tough emotions that somebody can feel when guilt from their choices piles up. I wanted the band to capture that passion in the first section, and Immanuel Wilkins really came through on sax. The piece starts with his very passionate playing and then moves to a single-line motif that everyone plays as we naturally improvise towards the ending. The emotion of the music truly makes it come to life.”\n \n<b>“THE IMPETUS (To Be and Do Better)”</b>\n“We recorded this straight through from ‘WAIL.’ I like to give everybody some time to develop their own sound on the tracks, so on ‘GUILT’ I had Rick Rosato open up on bass, and on ‘CHOICES’ it was Marquis Hill on trumpet, while here it transfers to Kalia Vandever on trombone. It is the expression of passion and emotion in ‘WAIL’ that leads to a decision to do better and be better. Kalia’s part brings us back to make that decision.”\n \n<b>“DOXOLOGY (Hope)”</b>\n\"A doxology is a song of praise that’s leading towards the close of our gathering. It is one of the first times in the set where I gave the band specific notes and parts. It is the praise-and-worship part of our church service—the song where we’re supposed to get up and dance in a focus on faith and following the Word. That's something to rejoice in.”\n \n<b>\"BENEDICTION”</b>\n“At this point, we’re closing our gathering with a good word, a benediction. The pianist Sean Mason is the newest addition to this band, and he has the sound that I was looking for from the Black church that was an integral part of bringing this music to fruition. He gives us a sense of authenticity. The track is influenced by Coltrane since it moves in major thirds, which is also a nod to the Holy Trinity. It doesn’t resolve harmonically because it's symbolizing that, in Heaven, we're going to be praising and worshiping for eternity.

Following the reggaetón one-two punch of “Envolver” and the Chencho Corleone-assisted “Gata,” she switches things up with the propulsive pop of “I’d Rather Have Sex” and collaborates with R&B hooksmith Ty Dolla $ign on the clever interpolation “Gimme Your Number.” She playfully recontextualizes a classic on the trap-informed “Girl From Rio” while repping her home country further on the dynamic “Que Rabão.” From the retro electro rock of “Boys Don’t Cry” to the tantalizing polyrhythmic Khalid team-up “Ur Baby,” her self-described versions won’t disappoint the fans.

Fare (Tone Ranger Remix)' is brand new and ups the intensity within the mix,” Garza says. “That for me is a nice moment where the whole thing shifts into a little more house-type groove. And I really dig the Anoushka Shankar track going into the Eric Hilton track. They both set such a great tone going into this musical journey.”","short":"The electronic duo crafts a laidback mix for your yoga

composure and breathy sighs that make even her boldest declarations feel as soothing as a whisper. But she uses that voice less as a seductive affectation than as a necessary balm for all the aching lyrics she sings on her full-length debut, <i>Whiplash</i>. GRAE is, of course, no stranger to tales of love and longing—her breakthrough 2020 single, “2725,” was a poignant bedroom-pop portrait of a long-distance romance playing out over FaceTime. But on <i>Whiplash</i>, the tension between GRAE’s breezy songcraft and heartbroken sentiments is heightened to discomfiting extremes: “Grenade” likens a precarious relationship to the namesake explosive, with a restless drumbeat cutting through its dream-pop tranquility; “No Lovey Dovey” feels like a beach-cruise celebration for a doomed union whose principals have decided “we’re better off friends.” However, not every story on <i>Whiplash</i> leads to an unhappy ending: Atop the ’80s New Wave propulsion of “Spinning,” GRAE commemorates a love pact sealed over Elton John records and matching tattoos.","short":"The Toronto alt-pop singer bounds between tales of love won and lost."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0FsaP4LD9X3oRAJR9Vs4sI"}},{"id":"1618155662","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1618155662?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/f0/20/90/f02090bd-9887-125f-deec-4d46349796ba/972ca7d4-dae7-4339-a906-f1190b8d930e.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1500,"textColor3":"c6c7c5","textColor2":"82d86c","textColor4":"71b760","textColor1":"ebedea","bgColor":"313131","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Gorgon City","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gorgon-city-at-crssd-festival-2022-the-palms-dj-mix/1618155662","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"trackCount":20,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-15","name":"Gorgon City at CRSSD Festival 2022: The Palms (DJ Mix)","upc":"5056381891183","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"playParams":{"id":"1618155662","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1615479159","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615479159?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d2/45/be/d245becb-f25e-b623-54af-13edf2f0ec1b/193436286503_BFEDeluxeCoverAlbumFinal.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"e1d6cd","textColor2":"ffe4c8","textColor4":"e6c9ae","textColor1":"f9f4ee","bgColor":"836049","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Femme It Forward","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/big-femme-energy-vol-1/1615479159","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-14","name":"Big Femme Energy, Vol. 1","recordLabel":"Femme It Forward","upc":"193436286503","audioTraits":["hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Femme It Forward","playParams":{"id":"1615479159","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0JqdIOvyZE1NnEIQSGYF"}},{"id":"1605032704","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1605032704?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/88/8d/54/888d54c1-0310-bd5e-7ca7-cea5ae409a0b/821826033344.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3aeb5","textColor2":"e39026","textColor4":"bb7925","textColor1":"d9d3da","bgColor":"1d1c21","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Cancer Bats","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/psychic-jailbreak/1605032704","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-15","name":"Psychic Jailbreak","recordLabel":"New Damage Records","upc":"821826033344","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Batskull Records, distributed and marketed by New Damage Records","playParams":{"id":"1605032704","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4FlBDsDIGd85GdznAMYoca"}},{"id":"1615076365","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1615076365?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/e2/fb/95/e2fb9532-ece2-37c1-de16-a51cf7f2ac7b/196292906585.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"a9cde7","textColor2":"93c5fd","textColor4":"85afe7","textColor1":"c0eafe","bgColor":"4b598e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Godford","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-you-she-remixes-ep/1615076365","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-04-13","name":"I YOU SHE (Remixes) -

Other outstanding soloists are Lucile Richardot, Sabine Devieilhe, and Christian Immler, who draw you in with singing of heartrending intensity.
