And so I think a lot of times we're just getting these like aftershocks of things that are about to happen.”\n\n<i>WE</i> is 10 tracks, but really more like five songs, taking into account various parts and chapters that give the album its epic scope, capturing the joy-in-the-face-of-peril spirit of their beloved 2004 debut <i><>Funeral</i>, only with the peril a bit heightened. The songs that Butler and his wife Régine Chassagne started in their backyard New Orleans studio prior to March 2020 form a narrative that opens in a state of despair and winds up in an unlikely place of hope and optimism, with all the exuberance that marks the band’s most memorable songs. Like all Arcade Fire albums, <i>WE</i> is a family affair, featuring not just Butler, Chassagne, and Butler’s younger brother Will—who has since left the group, amicably—but Butler’s mom, a harpist, as well as guest vocals from Peter Gabriel. Read on as Butler expounds on a few key moments from <i>WE</i>.\n\n<b>“End of the Empire I-III”</b>\n“It's easy to interpret everything as being about the present, and I think there's an element of that, but I think you're trying to pick up on smoke signals. To me, the end of the empire isn't about now, it's about the future. It's about what's coming. I'm still waiting to wake up and check my phone and see the stock market has finally crashed. I mean, it's just an inevitability. This stuff is so cyclical, and it's like we're just printing money and pretending everything's okay. My grandfather lived through the Depression and was a musician in World War II and lived through some pretty intense stuff, and so I think this generation is up to the task as well. We have an eight-year-old, and the tools that he has compared to the tools that I had at that age are incredible.”\n\n<b>“End of the Empire IV (Sagittarius A)”</b>\n“‘End of the Empire’ is four parts; we had the first three parts and it was already six and a half minutes. For some reason I just knew that there was a fourth part to it, and I had this index card that said, ‘Sagittarius A,’ which is a black hole in the middle of our solar system. I just had the card on my wall and I would just walk by it. As soon as I was vaccinated and was able to travel, I went with my son to go visit my parents because I hadn't seen them in a long time. I went back to their house in Maine and I brought my 4-track and I put it in the basement of their house and ran a bunch of cables up to the top floor. I felt like I was 15. It was exactly like the shit I was doing when I was 15. I was like, 'Mom, I'm working on this song.' We would play 'Sagittarius A' together. There were a couple other songs that I did these 4-track recordings of playing it with her, and it sort of helped me to work through it and to just figure out what it is.”\n\n<b>“The Lightning II”</b>\n“What was in my head when I was singing that song was all the Haitians at the border trying to get into the US who had taken a boat from Haiti to Brazil and then walked or taken a train all the way to the Mexican border. Just to find a better life for your family—imagine what it would take, the bravery. The governor of Texas can honestly...I don't hate a lot of people, but I hate that motherfucker. I don't even believe in hell, but if there's a hell, that motherfucker's going there. Just to meet people with the absolute absence of compassion, these fake fucking Christians. That's not necessarily what the song's about, but that was what was in my head: What does it mean to not quit and to reach the end and then to be turned back, and you still can't quit because you still have your family, so then you get sent back to where you started and you still can't give up because it's still your life and it's still your family and you're still fighting for survival.”\n\n<b>“Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)”</b>\n“I was really just thinking about my son and the world that he's facing and how I was a very depressed kid, particularly in high school. I was trying to imagine the way that I'm wired, just chemically, having to deal with that now, not to mention 10 years from now, whenever the fuck he's going to be dealing with it. He's going to need to have a thick skin and to just really be able to take a hit and have some fortitude. And basically just the idea of unconditional love, which is this impossible thing to achieve. But we do it naturally, somehow. And it's something that I think we naturally have with our kids, but I think it's something that we're supposed to have for people that we're not related to as well.”\n\n<b>“WE”</b>\n“I think the journey of the record, the first half is: Imagine this character's like, 'Get me the F out of here, get me off this planet, get me out of my own skin, get me away from myself. I don't want to be here.' It's anxiety and it's depression and it's heaviness, it's the weight of the world. And he looks at this black hole like, 'Well, maybe if I could get through that black hole, that would be far enough away.' And when he gets there, he finds that it's himself and it's everyone he ever loved and the lives of his ancestors. There's nothing to escape, because it's all the same thing anyway. Stories and films are always building towards this big conclusion and then the credits roll. And to me, the sentiment is, 'Let's just fucking do it again, with all of it—all the pain, all the loneliness, all the sadness, all the heartbreak. I just want to do it over and over again. Just run it back.”","short":"Their characteristically epic sixth LP sounds even bigger in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2sAePf08xIp4tnDlMUCV8B"}},{"id":"1622074671","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1622074671?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/28/5f/d1/285fd16b-e454-1a83-dfcf-7906be4c7109/816144021852_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"c3b360","textColor2":"da947b","textColor4":"b27b64","textColor1":"efda76","bgColor":"151708","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Eslabon Armado","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nostalgia/1622074671","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"NOSTALGIA","recordLabel":"DEL Records","upc":"816144021852","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 DEL Records, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1622074671","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“Each song has a memory,” Pedro Tovar of Eslabon Armado tells Apple Music about the group’s new album. “It gives that nostalgic kind of vibe.” The tremendously popular música mexicana act has come a long way since their 2020 breakout <i>Tu Veneno Mortal</i>. Its celebrated follow-ups <i>Corta Venas</i> and <i>Vibras de Noche</i> that same year added more hits and fan favorites to their growing catalog. No small part of that success has come from Tovar previewing material on social media for his listeners, a process that helped inform the group’s latest album. A diverse mix of songs covering everything from heartbroken ballads to dramatic corridos, <i>NOSTALGIA</i> presents a clear view of the multitudes contained within Tovar’s creative world, one that continues to expand. Read on to learn more about each of these songs from the man himself.\n\n<b>“VETE A LA FREGADA”</b>\n“This one is a sad song that I wrote, in a style that we’ve had for Eslabon on others’ songs. It was for sure one of the late ones I wrote, like a couple of weeks before I jumped into the studio to record all the songs. The melody on the song is just so nice. I kinda got inspiration from the Mexican—I don't know what the genre’s called, but like Ed Maverick or Kevin Kaarl—that type of style.”\n\n<b>“DOS MORRITAS” (feat. Junior H)</b>\n“I was going to do a collab with someone else on this song. I was driving and I just put it on my truck and I was just singing it. People liked it, but people weren't expecting for it to be the artist that I wanted to be on it. They were telling me, 'Oh, it sounds like Junior H.' And I was like, well, I'm going to give what the fans want. I texted Junior H and I showed him the song. He liked it a lot, because he's a very corridos-type guy. People fuck with his corridos, so it gives it that style, that presence of Junior H. It sounds fucking badass.”\n\n<b>“MODO DEPRE :(”</b>\n“This song's probably one of my favorites, to be honest, with what it says in the lyrics. I think it's going to get people nostalgic, like they remember their ex when they hear it. It probably is one of my favorite lyrics I ever wrote, and I feel it's going to give people the memory of someone they really miss.”\n\n<b>“SI SUPIERAS” (feat. DannyLux)</b>\n“I met with Danny a couple weeks after we shot the video of ‘Jugaste y Sufrí.’ I met with him in his house and we were just trying to figure out if we could write another song. And then he had this little melody and I really liked it a lot. And he kept on singing and singing it, and I was like, ‘Why don't we do a collab with that one again?’ He was like, ‘Well, I'm fucking down.’ Then I started giving him ideas, he gave me ideas for the song, and we recorded it on his laptop in his room. We recorded it again in the studio and it sounds fucking amazing.\"\n\n<b>“LUCES ROJAS”</b>\n“This is a kind of like reggaetón. I like Bad Bunny a lot, so I wanted to give it that type of beat but with guitars. I did it previously on <i>Tu Veneno Mortal Vol. 2</i>; it’s called ‘Regresa Mami.’ And people really liked it. But it's a super intimate song with your loved one that you're just trying to hear in the car, or in the room by yourself. It gives you that vibe.”\n\n<b>“MENTE EN ALTO”</b>\n“This song's a banger. When I usually write songs, the easiest songs for me are the sad songs, then the happy songs, the romantic songs next, and then the corridos come last. The corrido is probably one of the hardest to write. I just can't come up with the lyrics that all my other friends like Junior H write. They're fucking raw. It's because they're from Mexico, and the slang from Mexico and the slang from if you're born here in the US, it's completely different. So I can't use it because I don't know any words from over there. So this song, it just came out of nowhere, to be honest.”\n\n<b>“LA PERRIÉ” (feat. Fuerza Regida)</b>\n“[Jesus Ortiz and I] have been talking for a long time. We've been planning to meet in person, because he's a funny-ass guy. He's hilarious, and he sees that I'm like that too. I do my funny YouTube videos here and there. I do my funny [Instagram] Lives. Then I had this song—it’s a corrido too. I showed it to him and he liked it a lot, but we were on and off about recording or not recording it because of labels. But in the end, we got to an agreement and he recorded it. His voice is just something else, dude. I'm going to hop on one of his songs in the future, too.”\n\n<b>“HASTA LA MUERTE” (feat. Ivan Cornejo)</b>\n“When I met Ivan, he was just playing guitar. He’d never sing. He was doing TikToks, just playing guitar, and I didn't think nothing of it. But then he just started singing out of nowhere. He posted a song of him singing and I was like, 'Dude, this kid's going to fucking blow up.' And then a month later, he releases this album, and 'Está Dañada' became one of the biggest hits. I showed him the song and he really fucked with this. It fit him so perfect with his voice.”\n\n<b>“LO QUE QUIERAS”</b>\n“‘LO QUE QUIERAS’ is a song that I wrote a long time ago. It gives me the vibes of my first album, like ‘Me Prendes,’ that type of style. Usually for an album I take two, three weeks to write the songs. But this one took me a long time because I wanted the lyrics to be perfect.”\n\n<b>“LAS HISTORIAS SE ACABAN” (feat. Sarah Silva)</b>\n“When I first wrote the song, I wanted to do it with a girl with a super soft voice. And I put it on my story like, ‘Who's a female that sings? Let me know because I want to put her on my album.’ And so a bunch of girls started sending me videos. I respect everyone's voice. But me, I was chasing towards that soft, super angelic voice. So then DannyLux sent me her Instagram and I DMed her. I sent her the song. I recorded it on my phone, and then I was like, 'Just sing on top of it.' I've never done that—a boy and a girl's voice together, singing together throughout the whole song. I never heard of that in regional Mexican. So we hopped in the studio, and she sings so fucking good. It's an actual duet.”\n\n<b>“MALDITO AMOR!”</b>\n“That's one of my favorite songs. It's one of the last songs that I wrote before finishing the album. This song is a really simple song and we were going to make it difficult, because I got a new member of the group. His name is Damon, and he took over my position of playing lead guitar. And he made the album sound completely different, and in a good way. People are not going to expect the sound of Eslabon going from super freaking normal to his sound going to an extreme. So for this song, he wasn't there to record it, so I had to record it. I play super simple, and we just recorded it like that. It's a heartbroken song.”\n\n<b>“SOLO” (feat. Erre)</b>\n“I was live on TikTok and I was just telling people, ‘Hey, send me songs so I could hear and react to them.’ And then someone told me about this kid: His name is Erre from Phoenix. I was listening to his music and I heard that specific song. I thought it would fit perfect in the album, because it's a sad song. I reached out to him and, well, we recorded this last week. His lyrics are so hard.”\n\n<b>“QUÉ DIABLOS HICE” (INTERLUDE)</b>\n“The last two songs, I wanted to make different. I really love R&B a lot and I really love indie. I was on tour, and out of nowhere, I just had the urge to buy a fucking ukulele. I don't know how to fucking play a ukulele, to be honest. But just with the chords—I know how to play guitar—it was pretty simple. I wanted to keep it short because I don't know if people are going to like it or not. I just wanted to experiment on it. But if it's short and people like it, they're going to want more.”\n\n<b>“SOLO PA’ DECIR”</b>\n“I wrote it exactly when I recorded the ukulele song. The next day I stayed to hear the mastering that they were doing to finish the whole album, and there was a grand piano right there. I've always wanted to know how to play piano. I know how to play some keys, but I don't know music theory. So I just started playing keys on the piano. I started freestyling in English and recording on my phone. After that, I put it into Spanish lyrics, and it's the same thing.”","short":"“Each song has a memory.” Hear the música mexicana giants in Spatial."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/72rN7YPXX4BxMQ3nNmipAd"}},{"id":"1616728060","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1616728060?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/03/45/19/034519dc-9ff9-7f63-3d02-23a101a0cc3a/22UMGIM01299.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"cc7e66","textColor2":"ef5429","textColor4":"c14925","textColor1":"fc977a","bgColor":"0b1b18","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ella Mai","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heart-on-my-sleeve/1616728060","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"trackCount":15,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Heart On My Sleeve","recordLabel":"10 Summers/Interscope Records","upc":"00602445790951","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"A 10 Summers/Interscope Records Release; ℗ 2022 10 Summers Records, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1616728060","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The singer dazzles with her second LP, a collection of lush, heartfelt R&B."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5O4LDzrc8F0Le1viEIn2hV"}},{"id":"1611610299","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1611610299?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/67/ca/f2/67caf2ec-b7da-dc63-57e1-a707944bfe7f/22BMR0003158.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"34342f","textColor2":"211f2d","textColor4":"3b3943","textColor1":"181913","bgColor":"a3a29e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Midland","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-resort-greetings-from-video-deluxe/1611610299","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"The Last Resort: Greetings From (Video Deluxe)","recordLabel":"Big Machine Records, LLC","upc":"00843930080663","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Big Machine Label Group, LLC","playParams":{"id":"1611610299","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1618136433","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1618136433?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/e6/b8/83/e6b88344-8d5d-d353-06bc-3204d87071e6/075679759252.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"363532","textColor2":"221c16","textColor4":"49423d","textColor1":"0b0c08","bgColor":"e5dad8","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Jack Harlow","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-home-the-kids-miss-you/1618136433","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"trackCount":17,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Come Home The Kids Miss You","recordLabel":"Generation Now/Atlantic","upc":"075679759252","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Generation Now/ Atlantic Recording Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1618136433","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When Jack Harlow settled in to record “Movie Star,” something had been weighing on his heart: “I’m done faking humble, actin’ like I ain’t conceited/’Cause, bitch, I am conceited, you know you can’t defeat it,” he rapped. It’s a wonder he held out as long as he did. By the time of <i>Come Home the Kids Miss You</i>’s release, he’d been a performing guest on <i>SNL</i>, been called “Top 5 out right now” by one Kanye West, and released his Fergie-sampling, TikTok-conquering “First Class.” But as he remarks on that very song, life has been moving maybe quicker than he can comprehend. “They say you a superstar now, damn, I guess I am,” he raps. “You might be the man, well, that's unless I am/Okay, I'll confess I am.”\n\n<i>Come Home the Kids Miss You</i> is Harlow coming to terms with his still-ascending star, reflections on his position sandwiched between meticulous wordplay and appeals for affection (“I’d Do Anything to Make You Smile,” “Side Piece,” “Lil Secret,” “Like a Blade of Grass”). It’s a series of diary entries authored by the coolest kid in school, and, as such, is not without moments of self-doubt. “Am I fancy enough?/Am I dancing enough?/Am I handsome enough?/Tell me right now so I can be enough,” he raps on “Young Harleezy.” But don’t think for a minute that Harlow isn’t also having heaps of fun. He’s called on people he likely once considered musical heroes for guest slots (Pharrell, Drake, Justin Timberlake, Lil Wayne), and if album closer “State Fair” is to be believed, Harlow’s been working so hard for so long that he’s finally ready to celebrate.","short":"The Louisville MC comes to terms with life as a superstar."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7mN3UTHLfQh3ui4Opuiu3g"}},{"id":"1620898180","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1620898180?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/68/c3/0b/68c30b2b-7b28-bd5f-39cf-44a5d9e6ac4f/21UMGIM65173.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ebcdbb","textColor2":"efe7d2","textColor4":"e6bea8","textColor1":"f5f9ea","bgColor":"c31b01","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Sigrid","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-to-let-go-apple-music-edition/1620898180","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"trackCount":16,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"How To Let Go (Apple Music Edition)","recordLabel":"Universal-Island Records Ltd.","upc":"00602445910748","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"An Island Records release; ℗ 2022 Universal Music Operations Limited","playParams":{"id":"1620898180","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I was able to make the album in peace and quiet, really,” Sigrid tells Apple Music of crafting <i>How to Let Go</i>. That was thanks, in part, to the pandemic, during which the Norwegian pop queen could “sort of disappear,” writing the majority of her second album’s songs in Copenhagen with Norwegian songwriter Caroline Ailin (Dua Lipa, Charli XCX). “We were swimming in between sessions, talking a lot, and Caroline was making amazing cinnamon buns,” remembers Sigrid (born Sigrid Raabe). It was an approach she valued, having “definitely felt the pressure” to ensure <i>How to Let Go</i> lived up to her 2019 debut, <i>Sucker Punch</i>, home to hit singles such as “Don’t Kill My Vibe,” “Strangers,” and “Don’t Feel Like Crying.”\n \nThat debut showcased Sigrid’s ability to craft shimmering electro-pop songs that sound both anthemic and intimate. These elements are all present on <i>How to Let Go</i>, but this time around, it feels even more cathartic. “There are songs about breakups and breaking someone’s heart,” she says. “Songs about letting go of your childhood, and songs about letting go of fears and doubts because sometimes you just have to go for it.” Musically, the album sees Sigrid embrace a more organic sound featuring plenty of live drums, soaring strings, and vocal harmonies; she says everyone from The Beatles to The Killers influenced guitar-centric tracks destined for festival season. This extended edition also features her Apple Music Home Session, on which she strips back “Mirror” and “It Gets Dark” and covers Ed Sheeran's “Bad Habits” and Frank Ocean's “Lost.” Read on for Sigrid’s track-by-track guide to <i>How to Let Go</i>.\n \n<b>“It Gets Dark”</b>\n“Whenever I’ve been unsure of my musical direction, I’ve always come back to this song. It shaped the whole sound of the album with the strings coming in and the chorus being pretty simple in terms of production: literally just bass, vocals, and drums. It’s a song about letting go and opening your mind. For about four or five years before the pandemic, I was traveling so much with work and always came back to Norway when I had time off. And then, suddenly, I started to feel more comfortable outside of Norway. I started to feel like I also had a home in London, New York, and Los Angeles. That was exciting but also scary for me because I’m such a homebody.” \n \n<b>“Burning Bridges”</b>\n“It’s not necessarily about a romantic breakup because, sometimes, breakups that aren’t romantic can be even harder. Musically, it’s very inspired by Muse. I listened to them a lot when I was growing up, and I love it when rock bands go electronic the way Muse did. But at the same time, ‘Burning Bridges’ is still a pop song because you have the big, soaring strings on there. The overall vibe is cinematic but at a British music festival. It’s my proper angry, stomping-across-the-stage anthem.” \n \n<b>“Risk of Getting Hurt”</b>\n“When I sing, ‘I’ve crashed with no warning because I’m brave when I’m falling/But so far, I always land on my feet,’ it’s really about my outlook on life. I do get really tired and burned out because work can be really overwhelming; it takes a lot out of me. I’m a person who likes just being by myself in my apartment, cooking, but in 2019 I think I had 290 travel days or something. That’s a lot for me, but the reward of going on tour and traveling is just too good to turn down. I feel like I always land on my feet and that gives me the confidence to keep going.” \n \n<b>“Thank Me Later”</b>\n“Musically, it’s inspired by The Killers, who were a very important band for me growing up. Lyrically, I guess it’s really a very straight-up song about breaking someone’s heart. It sucks and it’s really difficult, but sometimes it’s for the best. I had a lot of heartbreak songs on <i>Sucker Punch</i>, but they were about me getting my heart broken. So, I thought it was time to talk about the other side of heartbreak too.” \n \n<b>“Mirror”</b> \n“I’m always scared of saying the wrong thing, and I’m very self-critical. I’ve been doing this job since I was 16, and when I look back at old interviews, sometimes I’m like, ‘Why did I say that?’ Often, when I write songs, I feel a bit like my older sister writing songs to me. I definitely tried to channel her in these lyrics, which are basically saying, ‘It’s OK to fuck up and move on.’ I’ve loved seeing the reaction to this song from my fans because it seems like they were thinking the same thing as me.” \n \n<b>“Last to Know”</b> \n“Every time we tried to put more production on it, it just didn’t work. One of my favorite songs ever is ‘I Can’t Make You Love Me’ by Bonnie Raitt. This song doesn’t sound remotely like it, but I’m sure I was thinking a little bit of that song when I wrote these lyrics. It’s about when you’ve been through a breakup and you’ve moved on, but there’s a bittersweet element because it’s hard for your ex to see you with someone new.”\n \n<b>“Dancer”</b> \n“This is one of my favorites on the album. It’s a full-on lovey-dovey song about falling the hardest in love I’ve ever been. I love the instrumentation on this song with the piano and then the drums and bass coming in. We listened to The Beatles a bit in the studio, and I think you can hear their influence here. It’s just a warm hug of a song that reminds me of summer nights and road trips and getting drunk.” \n \n<b>“A Driver Saved My Night”</b> \n“This is a fun song. It’s about being stuck in traffic somewhere, usually in London on the M25 [highway], and feeling a bit tired and homesick and ‘ugh’ about things. But then, a song you really like comes on the radio and you ask the driver to turn it up, please. And even though you don’t know each other, you’re both listening and nodding along and thinking, ‘Great song!’ I just love how music can instantly lift your spirits, so this song is really an homage to those moments.” \n \n<b>“Mistake Like You”</b> \n“Another ballad, but you’ve got to have a few ballads in there. It’s a sad song but also a positive one. It’s about unrequited love: having really strong feelings for someone who doesn’t feel the same way but coming through that situation and knowing you learned from it. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote the chorus: ‘I decided I think that anyone would be lucky to make just one mistake like you.’”\n \n<b>“Bad Life” (feat. Bring Me the Horizon)/b> \n“I’m a big Bring Me the Horizon fan. When I was at Reading Festival in 2021, [the band’s keyboardist] Jordan Fish came up to me and said, ‘Hey, I love your music.’ And I was freaking out—like, how do they know my music? We chatted a bit, and he said we should go into the studio some time. Then I got in my tour bus to go to Leeds Festival, and he sent me the demo of ‘Bad Life.’ I played it to my band, and we were all like, ‘This is really good.’ So, I went into the studio with Jordan and Ollie [Sykes, the band’s singer] a few weeks later, and we changed some bits and bobs, and I wrote some new lyrics for my verse. But the first time I realized Bring Me the Horizon was an unlikely match [for me] was when I walked into that studio and the technician said, ‘Woah, you were the last person I was expecting to see in this session!’” \n \n<b>“Grow”</b>\n“Nick Drake was an inspiration for me when I was writing this one, especially his songs ‘Pink Moon’ and ‘Place to Be.’ There are references to my childhood in the lyrics and also to my first apartment in Oslo. It was a big achievement for me to buy my own place at 22, and I remember trying to hang pictures on the bare white walls to make it feel like a proper home. But somehow, I never really settled there; it always felt like just another hotel room. I was living my dream out on the road, but it felt bittersweet because I had lost a part of myself at the same time. I think that’s just growing up, though.” \n \n<b>“High Note”</b>\n“I want to look back on my life and know I’ve not taken things for granted. But I have a bad habit of letting stress get to me, and then amazing things pass me by. I remember when I won the BBC’s Sound of 2018 poll, which is one of my biggest achievements, I actually cried because I was scared of what life was going to be like after that. It was almost like my innocence was going in a way: ‘I’m a serious artist now, fuck!’ It was only months afterwards that I looked back and thought, ‘Oh, that was actually amazing.’ So, this is a song about enjoying those highs when they happen. It’s partly inspired by the Corpus Clock at Cambridge University, which was built to remind the students to live their lives to the fullest.”</b>","short":"Sigrid’s cathartic second album has arrived in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1622045624","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1622045624?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/aa/d8/ae/aad8ae48-c1e6-5ed6-db7b-a4f32955ac00/196626945068.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c2828","textColor2":"231f1d","textColor4":"4d403e","textColor1":"0d0202","bgColor":"f9c3c1","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Bad Bunny","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/un-verano-sin-ti/1622045624","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"trackCount":23,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Un Verano Sin Ti","recordLabel":"Rimas Entertainment LLC","upc":"196626945068","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Rimas Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1622045624","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I like to prepare myself and prepare the surroundings to work my music,” Bad Bunny tells Apple Music about his process. “But when I get a good idea that I want to work on in the future, I hold it until that moment.” After he blessed his fans with three projects in 2020, including the forward-thinking fusion effort <i>EL ÚLTIMO TOUR DEL MUNDO</i>, one could forgive the Latin superstar for taking some time to plan his next moves, musically or otherwise. Somewhere between living out his kayfabe dreams in the WWE and launching his acting career opposite the likes of Brad Pitt, El Conejo Malo found himself on the beach, sipping Moscow Mules and working on his most diverse full-length yet. And though its title and the cover’s emoting heart mascot might suggest a shift into sad-boy mode, <i>Un Verano Sin Ti</i> instead reveals a different conceptual aim as his ultimate summer playlist. “It's a good vibe,” he says. “I think it's the happiest album of my career.”\n\nRecorded in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, the album features several cuts in the same elevated reggaetón mode that largely defined <i>YHLQMDLG</i>. “Efecto” and “Un Ratito” present ideal perreo opportunities, as does the soon-to-be-ubiquitous Rauw Alejandro team-up “Party.” Yet, true to its sunny origins, <i>Un Verano Sin Ti</i> departs from this style for unexpected diversions into other Latin sounds, including the bossa nova blend “Yo No Soy Celoso” and the dembow hybrid “Tití Me Preguntó.” He embraces his Santo Domingo surroundings with “Después De La Playa,” an energizing mambo surprise. “We had a whole band of amazing musicians,” he says about making the track with performers who'd typically play on the streets. “It's part of my culture. It's part of the Caribbean culture.” With further collaborations from familiars Chencho Corleone and Jhayco, as well as unanticipated picks Bomba Estéreo and The Marías, <i>Un Verano Sin Ti</i> embodies a wide range of Latin American talent, with Bad Bunny as its charismatic center.","short":"“I think it's the happiest album of my career.” Hear it in Spatial Audio."},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3RQQmkQEvNCY4prGKE6oc5"}},{"id":"1621353341","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1621353341?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/df/27/41/df274151-e6d7-b779-0eb9-62c2d2022f4a/22UMGIM43279.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2e2f","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor4":"434243","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e7e6eb","hasP3":false},"artistName":"BENEE","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-home-session-benee/1621353341","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":4,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Apple Music Home Session: BENEE","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602445871353","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1621353341","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“These are my favorites of my songs to perform in acoustic format,” BENEE says of her Apple Music Home Session.

It’s a declaration of self-assuredness, something that perhaps hasn’t been easy to reach. \n\n“I’ve lost quite a lot of confidence over the last year,” admits BENEE. “There was a period where I felt like people were starting to give up on me. I’ve had a lot of reflecting time and have really figured out why I love this job so much. I want to be there for people who are really going through it.

The home she stands before is her own in LA, where she witnessed blazing fires up close in 2020 and sheltered with her family during the global pandemic. It is also where <i>We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong</i> was crafted, the album becoming Van Etten’s attempt to make sense of the pandemic years, our unequal world, and the shaky future she’s raising her son into. “Up the whole night/Undefined/Can’t stop thinking ’bout peace and war,” she sings on “Anything,” a soaring ballad on which she also explores the numbness induced by the monotony of the pandemic. \n\nBut <i>We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong</i> isn’t just about the collective experience of recent events. Here, Van Etten is also a mother assuaging guilt that her career keeps her away from home (“I need my job/Please don’t hold that against me,” she sings to her son on “Home to Me”), a partner trying to keep intimacy alive (“Come Back,” a track reminiscent of Van Etten’s “Like I Used To” collaborator and indie peer Angel Olsen), and a citizen of the world who’ll do what she can to make it a better place: “Let’s go march/I’ll go downtown,” she sings on the shimmering, anthemic “I’ll Try.”\n\nThere’s much of what you might expect from a Van Etten record: acoustic guitars, lonesome minor-chord vocals, driving drums, and the jagged electro-pop of 2019’s <i>Remind Me Tomorrow</i> (see the hooky “Headspace” or the self-forgiveness anthem “Mistakes”). But despite it being constructed in a shrunken world, this is also an album on which one of America’s foremost singer-songwriters pushes her sound—and voice—to astonishing new heights. That perhaps reaches a peak on “Born,” which begins as a slow-marching piano moment before exploding into a stop-you-in-your-tracks album centerpiece on which Van Etten’s vocals sound not unlike a celestial choir amid swirling synths and cascading, cathartic drums. Like many of this record’s tracks, “Born” is gargantuan and rich, but elsewhere things are more simple. On the raw, delicate “Darkish,” for example, Van Etten includes the birdsong she (and so many of us) heard during lockdown, a poignant reminder of the quietest days of the pandemic.\n\n<i>We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong</i> might have been shaped by moments of crisis, but it isn’t colored with despair. Just as something like a smile hovers across her expression on <i>We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong</i>’s cover, optimism breaks through across this record. “Better stay light/I’m looking for a way,” she sings on opener “Darkness Fades,” before offering her ultimate worldview on “Darkish”: “It’s not dark/It’s only darkish.” We’ve been going about this all wrong, Van Etten seems to be saying, but there’s still time for that to change.","short":"Van Etten processes our uncertain times on an epic, expansive sixth LP."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3PqowBonjatEu0P7g5AIHr"}},{"id":"1612388887","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1612388887?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b4/c9/13/b4c913b5-dbb8-d8b1-b4ce-9daaffa1f002/22UMGIM10890.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"ce8287","textColor2":"e998a8","textColor4":"be7994","textColor1":"fda397","bgColor":"120048","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Alison Wonderland","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loner/1612388887","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":12,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Loner","recordLabel":"EMI Recorded Music Australia Pty Ltd","upc":"00602445155729","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"An EMI Music Australia production; ℗ 2022 Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd.","playParams":{"id":"1612388887","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Alison Wonderland tells Apple Music she wrote her third album “after having the rug pulled from under me in a lot of different aspects of my life. I was at complete rock-bottom, and I had no one except myself to deal with what was going on.” Rather than revert to old habits, however, the DJ, producer, and singer found strength within. “When I was writing, I listened back to my other albums and thought, ‘OK, you’re victimizing yourself in all these albums,’ and I don’t want to be the victim anymore. I thought, ‘I’m going to change the narrative—I’m going to bring power back into anything that’s negative in my life.’ And so, I thought that I would use the term ‘loner’ as an empowering word and not make it a negative thing.”\n \nThe concept of polarity became a driver, thematically and musically, Alison channeling moments of extreme light and darkness while contrasting her trademark electronic approach with more organic instrumentation. Here, the Sydney-born, LA-based artist walks through <i>Loner</i>, track by track.\n \n<b>“Forever”</b>\n“I can pinpoint exactly where I was when this song happened. I was in a Starbucks drive-through with my friend, and I was crying. I was trying everything to get my life back together, and I had no answers. I was so frustrated, and I felt so alone. I was crying to my friend and said, ‘It’s going to feel like this forever—nothing’s going right no matter how hard I try.’ And he looked at me and said, ‘It will feel like forever until it doesn’t.’ That’s the truth. It felt like forever. And then, one day, it didn’t.”\n \n<b>“Safe Life”</b>\n“I’m saying I’m not about the safe life. I’m sick of doubting myself. I’m not gonna play it safe, and I’m just going to live my life to the fullest. There’s a lot of freedom in taking risks and putting yourself out there, and it does feel like a weight off your shoulders because fear holds us back. It's my favorite drop I’ve ever made.”\n \n<b>“Fuck U Love U”</b>\n“This song is basically about my relationship with music. It’s kind of like, fuck you, but I love you so much, and I hate you, but I want it so badly. Again, that polarity, when you love something so much that you’re working so hard for it—there’s this extreme frustration and anger that can come with that if you’re not getting it.”\n \n<b>“New Day”</b>\n“This is a very hopeful song. It’s reminding myself that even if today doesn’t work out the way I want, tomorrow will be a new day and you’ll have another chance. My feet will touch the ground, and I have a chance to try again, and I’m grateful for that.”\n \n<b>“I’m Doing Great Now Thanks (Interlude)”</b>\n“It’s a message that I’m doing great now, thanks. At the end, I wrote a poem for the listener. I believe words are very powerful, and I’m putting out something really good into the air for them. You’ll only really know what I’m saying if you play it backwards.”\n \n<b>“Something Real”</b>\n“It’s the only love song I’ve ever written. I don’t ever feel that inspired by positive things when I’m making art, but this is the happiest song I could make. When I listen to it now, I am smiling because I know that when I wrote it, I was purely happy and grateful and in disbelief that I had changed my reality so much. I’m so happy I was able to channel that energy into sound.”\n \n<b>“Eyes Closed”</b>\n“I was in a hotel room in Berlin, and I was about to play a warehouse party, and I recorded those vocals in my hotel room. I wanted to make something musically with the polarity in it, so it’s very industrial and then it goes into a really long breakdown that is minimal, and then it goes back into this industrial kind of drum ’n’ bass influence.”\n \n<b>“Bad Things”</b>\n“I wrote this at the start of a rebirth, and it was about not letting negativity invade my space anymore. I wanted to remind myself I’m still here and I’m still breathing and I’m lucky to be doing so and to be grateful for that. I wanted it to be very euphoric. I’m acknowledging the darkness, but I’m inviting in the light.”\n \n<b>“Thirst”</b>\n“It’s about how no one can really be me as much as they try. I wrote it about how I’m one step ahead always, because I’m just being myself.”\n \n<b>“Cocaine”</b>\n“This song is funny. I was sitting on a couch in an Airbnb in Auckland, and my voice memo that I wrote for the demo, which was only one take, I kept as the final vocal. I was so inspired and so annoyed. I was picturing these people in the industry who think they know you, but they do not: the guy at the club with the bad leather shoes and the pants that are too tight and the sports jacket, with the used-car-salesman personality. Something had triggered me during my time of healing, and I was so pissed off.”\n \n<b>“Fear of Dying”</b>\n“I wrote this about my manager. He’s also my best friend. We’ve done this together, DIY, from the start. He’s the only person who ever believed in me when no one else did. I do not know what I would do without [him]. It’s a huge fear, and I felt like I needed to write it out and acknowledge it. I’m just scared of losing him.”\n \n<b>“Loner”</b>\n“‘Loner’ is an open letter to the things I wanted but never got. It’s an open letter to my trauma, it’s an open letter to my loss. I find it very difficult to listen to. It’s the one song I’ve played to friends, some very unemotional males, and I’ve made them cry because they knew what I went through. This is a really intimate song for me. It’s the scariest one to put out.”","short":"“I’m going to change the narrative.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3oreus7GaQU4e1Hzv6CgE0"}},{"id":"1614745679","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1614745679?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0d/5d/2c/0d5d2caa-72b2-88c5-8685-2412e59aa9bd/22UMGIM22752.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9cbce","textColor2":"c8cecf","textColor4":"a1a6a8","textColor1":"fbfcfe","bgColor":"02050e","hasP3":false},"artistName":"BoyWithUke","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/serotonin-dreams/1614745679","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Serotonin Dreams","recordLabel":"Republic Records","upc":"00602445742301","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Boywithuke, LLC, under exclusive license to Mercury Records/Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","playParams":{"id":"1614745679","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/67FALVYrI6nDYJXVok1vG9"}},{"id":"1599859099","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1599859099?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/e4/f2/e7/e4f2e7b9-9374-16be-49b2-8fea25498a3f/191404124659.png/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"c5a97e","textColor2":"d5a365","textColor4":"ad8554","textColor1":"f3d09a","bgColor":"101012","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ibeyi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/spell-31/1599859099","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"trackCount":10,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Spell 31","recordLabel":"XL Recordings","upc":"191404124659","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 XL Recordings Ltd","playParams":{"id":"1599859099","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6STKW3SGtdk3Gy2QrDuO5m"}},{"id":"1600033162","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600033162?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/f0/93/4f/f0934fd5-684b-a577-3e17-52346beac80b/196626062369.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"27332e","textColor2":"28160b","textColor4":"30362d","textColor1":"1d120c","bgColor":"50b7b6","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Silverstein","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/misery-made-me/1600033162","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"trackCount":11,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Misery Made Me","recordLabel":"UNFD","upc":"196626062369","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 UNFD","playParams":{"id":"1600033162","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Dc0NWGnXDqRsf4sjV8JpX"}},{"id":"1621034209","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1621034209?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/ff/55/33/ff553317-5c99-6714-a74c-4353197613b7/iKON_FLASH_BACK_ALBUM_COVER_F.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":4000,"textColor3":"cecbcb","textColor2":"ff1d01","textColor4":"ce1701","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"iKON","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/flashback-ep/1621034209","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-03","name":"FLASHBACK -

The beautiful “Guiding Light” already sounds like a modern classic, as does “Broken Sunsets,” performed and recorded remotely with a 70-piece orchestra. Leona Lewis guests on the power ballad “One Look,” which proves Ffrench’s effortless ability to cross musical boundaries. Everything is so vividly and atmospherically recorded, too, which adds another layer of richness to this exquisite music.","short":"Exquisite music born of the pianist’s devastation after George Floyd’s death."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3vkgKLIXijInCpJGgeRsaY"}},{"id":"1600474685","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1600474685?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/3d/e5/74/3de5749e-89d8-e295-ce0b-19c1cf1c3b90/21UM1IM21361.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"363207","textColor2":"212120","textColor4":"4d491e","textColor1":"040403","bgColor":"fee918","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Andris Nelsons, Gewandhausorchester & Boston Symphony Orchestra","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/strauss/1600474685","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Romantic Era","Orchestral"],"trackCount":93,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Strauss","recordLabel":"Deutsche Grammophon (DG)","upc":"00028948620432","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH, Berlin","playParams":{"id":"1600474685","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Here, conductor Andris Nelsons harnesses the talents of his two orchestras, the Boston Symphony and Leipzig Gewandhaus, in spectacular recordings of Richard Strauss’ major orchestral works. Duties are shared equally throughout this ambitious collection. The Boston Symphony scales the dramatic heights of the epic <i>Alpine Symphony</i> (<i>Eine Alpensinfonie</i>) and brings Cervantes’ <i>Don Quixote</i> to spectacular life (alongside solo cellist Yo-Yo Ma at his lyrical best). The Leipzig Gewandhaus, meanwhile, brings both grandeur and tenderness to the evergreen <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i>, a silvery sheen to the concert suite from <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>, and, with virtuoso pianist Yuja Wang, a superlative performance of Strauss’ only major work for piano and orchestra, the sparkling <i>Burleske</i>. It’s wonderful to hear rarer gems given such lavish treatment—and also peeking out from the more familiar fare is Strauss’ intimate portrait of family life, <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>, lovingly performed by the Boston players, and the early symphonic fantasy <i>Aus Italien</i>, given a luscious Elgarian sweep. A treat to finish, too: The mighty <i>Festliches Präludium</i> for organ and orchestra was recorded in Boston by both orchestras combined, with Olivier Latry providing suitably festive organ fireworks.","short":"A spectacular collection of Richard Strauss’ major orchestral works."},"isCompilation":false}},{"id":"1604182836","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1604182836?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/4b/32/7b/4b327bf8-653c-c20e-f52d-f2db9a184ae6/886449756667.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"d9dad9","textColor2":"c1d8df","textColor4":"abbfc5","textColor1":"fbfaf8","bgColor":"525b60","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Dirk Maassen & Dirk Mallwitz","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/time/1604182836","isComplete":false,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-27","name":"Time","recordLabel":"Sony Classical","upc":"886449756667","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Dirk Maassen, under exclusive license to Sony Classical, a label of Sony Music Entertainment","playParams":{"id":"1604182836","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2KdxyDmwo7F0u8Jaf6fjch"}},{"id":"1620608949","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1620608949?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/88/66/8e/88668ee7-a908-b4b6-288f-c08b5cd4f4d4/075679756923.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1425,"textColor3":"412b1d","textColor2":"211f1e","textColor4":"4c3425","textColor1":"141414","bgColor":"f78642","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Ogi","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/monologues-ep/1620608949","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Soul"],"trackCount":6,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-05","name":"Monologues - EP","recordLabel":"Atlantic/Atrium","upc":"075679756923","audioTraits":["atmos","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Artium Entertainment LLC under exclusive license to Atlantic Recording Corporation.","playParams":{"id":"1620608949","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit"}},{"id":"1617724992","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617724992?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/5e/92/e4/5e92e4cc-9620-a53d-7bea-50e434c7d224/822252245523.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"363634","textColor2":"303132","textColor4":"595959","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"fcfcf4","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Anne Akiko Meyers, Jason Vieaux & Fabio Bidini","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anne-akiko-meyers-shining-night/1617724992","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical"],"trackCount":14,"isMasteredForItunes":true,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Anne Akiko Meyers – Shining Night","recordLabel":"AVIE Records","upc":"822252245523","audioTraits":["atmos","hi-res-lossless","lossless","lossy-stereo","spatial"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Anne Akiko Meyers","playParams":{"id":"1617724992","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Music through the ages, beautifully and intimately performed."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/04GehVvEGNDrTI6mYmefOh"}},{"id":"1621795202","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1621795202?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/66/15/c2/6615c273-2b17-ae40-491e-ed503c7349e9/075679747136.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"dcc2ae","textColor2":"dcbca7","textColor4":"c1a490","textColor1":"ffe1cd","bgColor":"544736","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Mary J.

But on their sixth album, Simple Plan reassumes the stage-diving position. <i>Harder Than It Looks</i> was completed just before the pandemic shut everything down in early 2020, but its two-year delay now frames the record as the perfect 20th-anniversary sequel to the group’s multiplatinum breakthrough, <i>No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls</i>. Over its 10 tracks, the band reasserts their innate flair for adrenalized, guitar-charged gallops and festival-sized sing-alongs, even as the cheeky teen angst of old gives way to more sobering reflections on mental health, cyberbullying, and divorce.\n\n“For us, this is a full-circle, back-to-basics record,” frontman Pierre Bouvier tells Apple Music. “We came out in the early 2000s and had massive success, and then you start questioning, ‘How can we prove to the world that we're not just this?’ But I think with some maturity and hindsight, we've all come to the conclusion: ‘Let's just do what Simple Plan does best, and not worry about showcasing that we can do other things. Let's give the people what they want.’” Here, Bouvier gives us the track-by-track lowdown on how Simple Plan made <i>Harder Than It Looks</i> sound so easy.\n\n<b>“Wake Me Up (When This Nightmare's Over)”</b>\n“Through meeting fans and reading people's messages, we've come to realize that there's a lot of people in our fanbase who literally rely on this music when they're struggling. It's more than just entertainment to them. Because of that, we always try to write songs that are going to help people through their struggles. And we wanted to make a song that was sort of vague enough to fit with whatever you're going through. So the 'nightmare' is whatever that struggle is for you.”\n\n<b>“Ruin My Life” (feat. Deryck Whibley)</b>\n“We've had parallel careers with Sum 41 for 20-plus years. I've been a fan of theirs for a long time, and I think Deryck sang a great part on our song. We all see it: People in the comments section can get really nasty, and that's hard—even for me. But then at some point, I'm like, 'You know what—I don't care about that person. They mean nothing to me. And you may have thought that what you said hurt me, but guess what: You didn't ruin my life.' That's what the song is about to me.”\n\n<b>“The Antidote”</b>\n“A lot of these concepts were brought in by our drummer, Chuck [Comeau]—he had this word, 'antidote,' on this little whiteboard that he brings in when we do writing sessions. It reminded me of when I was having trouble with anxiety like 10, 12 years ago, and I started having these pretty intense panic attacks. I didn't know what they were, and I thought, ‘Am I gonna die?’ So I would call my wife and she would calm me down—we'd talk for an hour at four in the morning. That's what this song represents to me: that lifeline that you reach for when you're having those moments of terrible anxiety or depression.”\n\n<b>“A Million Pictures of You”</b>\n“This is about the infatuation moment in a relationship, where you just can't get enough of each other. You look at this person, and you're like, 'I want to take so many pictures of you and spend every moment with you,' and you're just obsessed with each other and want to document it all. I love the riff that we came up with—it just feels like a classic, feel-good song.”\n\n<b>“Anxiety”</b>\n“This song was written with Chuck and I, and we also invited Travis Clark from We the Kings. We were inspired by twenty one pilots' stuff and ended up going with more of a modern take on reggae. The song is talking about anxiety—mental health is no longer taboo, and I think that's awesome, because when you're going through that stuff, it feels embarrassing. We want to help make that conversation more accepted. It should be treated like an injury—when you break your arm, you go to the hospital, you put a cast on, you listen to the doctor. But when your head's broken, people don't always do that, and I think it's important to treat it that way.”\n\n<b>“Congratulations”</b>\n“This song is a little reminiscent of 'Ruin My Life.' It could be seen as being about a relationship where someone wronged you, whatever way that may have been. It's about feeling betrayed. I don't know if karma is a real thing, but in my experience, it sure seems like it is. So 'Congratulations' is really a song about karma. It's like: Okay, you have this small victory because you wronged me. Well, congratulations on that one, but just remember: What goes up must come down.”\n\n<b>“Iconic”</b>\n“Almost every album of ours has a song where it's like, ‘What the hell's that doing there?’ And for this one, we tried to get ourselves in a frame of mind of writing a song for when a team comes out on the field. Imagine sports highlights, where you see all the tackles and all the rough parts. It's almost like we wrote a song for a documentary about a team of underdogs that made it to the top. And that team could be Simple Plan: I feel like our band has always had a chip on our shoulder. We’ve had great success; however, we've always had a healthy bit of headroom to aim for that Green Day level of being the biggest band in the world.”\n\n<b>“Best Day of My Life”</b>\n“A lot of people think that we came out and instantly had success. But Chuck and I were in a skate-punk band [Reset] since we were 13 years old—we opened up for Face to Face and NOFX. That was the world that we came from: We were playing fast punk beats and didn't give a crap about success. I'm a huge fan of NOFX and Lagwagon and Pennywise—that's what I used to play when I was a kid. So Chuck and I love putting stuff like that on our records. For some people that only know us for 'I'm Just a Kid,' they might be like, 'Whoa, what the hell is this?' But this is the sort of song we end up playing live a lot, because they're fun. If you're playing a festival and you want to get the mosh pit going, just crank out this song.”\n\n<b>“Slow Motion”</b>\n“Once again, this was one of those whiteboard ideas Chuck had. He was describing this idea of love at first sight. You see it in movies all the time, where you see the girl walking into the room in slow motion. We were trying to get music to match that sort of emotion and be very cinematic. Production-wise, we just wanted to make it as grandiose as possible. This is gonna sound silly, but when I hear this chorus, it just makes me want to cry. I was driving to LA for a session and I was sitting in my car with tears coming down my face, and I'm like, 'What is wrong with me? I'm listening to my own music and I'm crying in my car!'”\n\n<b>“Two”</b>\n“Now that all of us have kids, the idea of splitting up with your spouse and having to make decisions in your life that will affect your kids has sort of taken a whole new meaning. Luckily for me, and Chuck as well, we came from families that are still together, but we wanted to write about divorce and get as real and raw as possible. When a couple is going through divorce, and they're worried about the impact on their children, what do they do? They start saying, ‘Well, from now on, you'll have two Christmases and you get to have two birthday parties!’ And the kid is probably thinking, ‘I don't want that! I don't want two bedrooms or two holidays, I just want one!’ So for anyone who's the product of divorce, or is going through that themselves, I think this song is really going to hit home. It was a hard one to sing.”","short":"“For us, this is a full-circle, back-to-basics

Corporation","playParams":{"id":"1607348380","kind":"album"},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Lzzy Hale started writing Halestorm’s fifth album in the period she calls “B.C.”—Before Covid. When the pandemic hit and the world shut down, the guitarist and vocalist found herself having an identity crisis. “I went from being Lzzy Hale, the rock star onstage, to Elizabeth Hale in my pajamas for three days, sitting on the couch, not knowing what the future holds,” she tells Apple Music. “What I don’t think I realized before is that all of the things I do with the band—traveling, live shows, writing songs—are the forward movement of having a mission. When all that is stolen, you look in the mirror and ask, ‘Who am I without all of this?’”\n \nDespite the deep anxiety and unease that question presented, Hale persevered and wrote her most revealing album yet. “I had to kick myself in the butt and write my way out of it,” she says. “There’s something that happens when you write a song that helps you work through those issues. It’s truly a form of therapy. And now when I hear it, I realize I wasn’t alone in those feelings. My most personal album also became our most universal.” Below, she discusses each song on <i>Back From the Dead</i>.\n \n<b>“Back From the Dead”</b>\n“This is the song that blew the doors open for this album. We'd written some others, and we liked a lot of them, but this one became a keystone. It became the road map for the other songs. But it’s really a song of survival. It’s a war cry. It’s about that bravery you have to have in order to get yourself out of that dark place, to pull yourself out of that grave you’ve been digging for yourself. I’m singing the craziest I’ve probably ever sang. My little brother is going nuts on the drums. Everyone is on 11.” \n \n<b>“Wicked Ways”</b>\n“This is probably one of the heaviest songs on the record. It’s about acceptance, but not just acceptance of the things you like about yourself. It’s also about acceptance of your dark side. Something that I realized over the past couple years is that I can be really mean when I want to be, and I make huge mistakes. And I say things I don't mean. Does that make me evil? Probably not. But in seeing both sides of myself, I can form a truth. I can accept those two sides of myself and not pretend I have everything figured out.” \n \n<b>“Strange Girl”</b>\n“This song was directly inspired by a conversation that I had during lockdown with a young fan, about 15. She ended up coming out to her parents shortly before lockdown and they were not having any of it, so it was really hard for her to be stuck there with people that weren’t supportive of her being her truest self. I took this conversation into one of my writing sessions and wrote her an anthem. Not a ballad, but an anthem saying that she could wake up every morning and just be proud of her most authentic self.” \n \n<b>“Brightside”</b>\n“Ironically, this is probably the darkest, most sarcastic song on the album. It was kind of a boiling point for me. It was written during the pandemic that we’re still going through, and it’s just me looking at the world and seeing that there’s so much hate for hate’s sake. There’s so many people arguing over petty bullshit that doesn’t matter. And then there’s personal questions like, ‘Are we ever going to go out again?’ It all boiled down to, ‘I’ve got to keep looking on the bright side because it only gets darker.’” \n \n<b>“The Steeple”</b>\n“With this song, I’m trying to recreate that fellowship and that community that I love so much about the live show and just being surrounded by people. We all get to put our fists in the air and celebrate together, and what’s going on in the outside world doesn’t matter for that moment. I just really wanted to create this celebratory song that we could all sing together—that’s why there’s so many voices on it. I wanted it to be like we’re all part of the same choir. Basically, I’m creating the church for the Devil’s music.” \n \n<b>“Terrible Things”</b>\n“The first version of this was ‘I Am Terrible Things,’ and I was talking about all these things that I find disparaging about myself. Then I had this moment when I decided it wasn’t about me. And also, I don’t want to have a song reminding me of all my past mistakes. So, it became about me looking at the world we live in and asking how you maintain hope in humanity when you see so much destruction and war and people starving. I feel like we’re taking these huge steps backward in evolution. So, it’s hard to maintain that faith in humanity, but I have to. Or else what am I doing this for?” \n \n<b>“My Redemption”</b>\n“When I wrote this song, I had made some mistakes. I had done some things I said I’d never do, and I was having a hard time forgiving myself. This song needed to happen in order for me to get over that. One thing I learned through writing this song is that I am still the only person in this world that will truly ever be in my way, and I’m also the only person that can save me. I can’t just sit around and wait for someone to tap me on the shoulder and tell me, ‘Everything’s going to be OK’—I have to do that myself. So, this was, indeed, my redemption song.” \n \n<b>“Bombshell”</b>\n“This was one of the earliest demos we put together for the album. When we were making the <i>Reimagined</i> EP a couple of years ago, one of the guitar techs broke the Les Paul my guitar player, Joe [Hottinger], was playing. The high-E tuning mechanism failed, but Joe was still plugged in and started playing the limp string as a joke. It sounded gnarly, and he recorded it on his phone. That’s what the intro is based on. We used the double meaning of ‘bombshell,’ as far as it’s a girl but it’s also an explosive. It’s one of my favorites.” \n \n<b>“I Come First”</b>\n“OK, this started out as a sex song, but then I decided that some of the lines were really cheesy. I had whips and chains in there at one point, and I was like, ‘Man, I can’t do that.’ So, I decided to take all the sex lines out, and all of a sudden, it revealed itself as a self-love song. It’s saying you can’t give to anybody else until you fill your own cup first. I still kind of think of it as the sex song because that’s where it started, but it doesn’t have to be that. Unless you feel so inclined…” \n \n<b>“Psycho Crazy”</b>\n“Apparently, this is my dad’s favorite song on the album, which surprises me. I’m like, ‘Dad, are you all right?’ But I’ve been told many times over the course of my life that I’m crazy for doing this, or crazy for being gung-ho about the band and the music or myself—that I’m too passionate about certain things. And in those moments, I’m like, ‘Well, this isn’t even my crazy. If you really want me to go there, I can.’ It’s about taking the negativity that people offer you and using it as your superpower.” \n \n<b>“Raise Your Horns”</b>\n“A few years ago, my friend Jill Janus from the band Huntress committed suicide. I felt very helpless about it. When you know someone who does that, you think, ‘Could I have done something? Maybe I should have reached out.’ On a whim, I put together this hashtag, #RaiseYourHorns, and I basically said, ‘If you’ve been touched by mental illness or know someone who is, take a picture of yourself and raise your horns.’ It was this grand effort in real time to show everyone that they’re not alone. And it took off like gangbusters. So, I wrote this song as a way to say the same thing—that we’re not alone in our struggles.”","short":"“My most personal album also became our most universal.”"},"isCompilation":false,"contentRating":"explicit","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27Bw4tTQWjEv3jpp6ynGfu"}},{"id":"1621089349","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1621089349?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/90/dc/9f/90dc9fdb-c0f3-f506-0942-0e33c94d26f4/196922016622_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":1400,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dedede","textColor4":"b1b1b1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"artistName":"LE SSERAFIM","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fearless-ep/1621089349","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-02","name":"FEARLESS -

Weaving elements of blues, folk, pop, and rock into traditional Wassoulou rhythms, the Grammy Award-winning Malian musician bridges borders both sonic and geographic. Recorded across Baltimore, Paris, and Bamako, this 13th album sees Sangaré meditating on the fate of women as well as social, existential, and political issues. Her lithe vocals and poignant lyrics are accompanied by longtime collaborator Mamadou Sidibé’s kamele n’goni (traditional lute), Balla Kouyaté’s balafon (xylophone), and Danaë’s dobro and slide guitar, alongside the reeds and keys of Quéré. With her signature feminist impulse running through these 11 tracks, Sangaré looks both inward and outward, offering empowerment on “Sira,” bemoaning betrayal on the deceptively sprightly “Sarama,” and referencing a lifelong commitment to the upliftment of women on “Gniani Sara.” While aggravation and loneliness characterize “Kêlê Magni” and “Degui N’Kelena,” respectively, Sangaré bookends her lamentations between the cultural pride of opener “Wassulu Don” and the celebration of Wassoulou ancestry on “Sabou Dogoné.” In much the same way that <i>Timbuktu</i> symbolizes Mali’s rich history, the album represents hope and optimism for its future. “Timbuktu, crossroad of knowledge,” Sangaré sings on the title track, “legendary city known all over the world.”","short":"A deft fusion of Wassoulou rhythms and contemporary sounds."},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Q2o3yV4ExWvbQyaLvU4Q9"}},{"id":"1617988896","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1617988896?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/4b/58/d5/4b58d507-5dae-16f5-8ebc-0989ad07c2f7/4251804134521_3000.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c77434","textColor2":"ec764a","textColor4":"c06544","textColor1":"f58936","bgColor":"111e2c","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Arthur Robert","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/metamorphosis-pt-2/1617988896","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":5,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Metamorphosis Pt. 2","recordLabel":"Figure","upc":"4251804134521","audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"copyright":"℗ 2022 Figure","playParams":{"id":"1617988896","kind":"album"},"isCompilation":false,"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5lZGJfV4OV3SvgAMGgpERj"}},{"id":"1618090966","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1618090966?l=en-US","attributes":{"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/cf/8a/e8/cf8ae8ef-af63-d516-64fd-37f97a824ac9/840200511155_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":3000,"textColor3":"c17e47","textColor2":"e09350","textColor4":"b97a45","textColor1":"ea9752","bgColor":"1d191a","hasP3":false},"artistName":"Tomu DJ","isSingle":false,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sunsets-single/1618090966","isComplete":true,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"trackCount":2,"isMasteredForItunes":false,"releaseDate":"2022-05-06","name":"Sunsets -
