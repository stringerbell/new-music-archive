warmth and yuletide grace exude from the enchanting improvisations and reflections on seasonal favorites that form <i>Christmas Piano with Alexis Ffrench</i>. The album’s generous tracklist embraces 24 songs and carols that invite listeners to take a break from merrymaking and contemplate the essential Christmas message of peace and goodwill. Beyond delivering countless touches of fine pianism and subtle artistry, Alexis Ffrench distills that message into music touched by the intoxicating spirit of nostalgia for childhood Christmases, and by genuine feelings of comfort and joy.\n\n“When I think of great Christmas albums, I think of Nat King Cole,” Ffrench tells Apple Music Classical. “The tone of his <i>The Magic of Christmas</i> is absolutely right. You get a sense of a man who has a deep, soulful connection with the music that he’s singing. \n\n“He was my dad’s favorite artist, too. It gives me a fuzzy feeling when I think about it. Christmas is a time of innocence on record as much as everything else. No one has anything to prove. You just put your heart out there and hope people will connect with it through the music. That’s what I've tried to do with this Christmas album.”\n\nFfrench draws deep from his heartfelt style of “classical soul” to reimagine such seasonal evergreens as “Silent Night,” “In the Bleak Mid-winter,” and “The First Noel.” His choice of songs includes Christmas chart-toppers—“It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” and “Fairytale of New York” punchy among them—and an exquisite sequence of new compositions, introduced by the sublime “A Time for Giving.” \n\n“They all mean very different things to me,” he observes, “and there’s a kaleidoscope of colors, feelings, and moods in this album. I truly hope there’s something for everybody, that there are tracks that can touch people in a profound way, to remind them of the time they’re in now, to remember times past and think of other people.”","short":"“There’s a kaleidoscope of colors, feelings, and moods in this album.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-piano-with-alexis/1686902774","playParams":{"id":"1686902774","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2YymiUCe4WEr0GBJ0aSLFx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1686902774/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"342515428","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/342515428?l=en-US"}]}}},"1693478781":{"id":"1693478781","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1693478781?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/children-of-bodom/13550318","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/4b/7e/b1/4b7eb199-fe77-2a29-a0b2-4465f833e3ba/9769e6d5-76ad-4fd4-82b2-e43922a0cf6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"5db7cc","textColor2":"7fc7ce","textColor4":"67a5ad","textColor1":"72def5","bgColor":"081c27","hasP3":false}},"name":"A Chapter Called Children of Bodom (Final Show in Helsinki Ice Hall, 2019)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Children of Bodom","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f0/4f/b9/f04fb97a-162a-0428-7fe7-14afc928422a/5401148003093_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca7957","textColor2":"f86e2b","textColor4":"ce5d28","textColor1":"f39266","bgColor":"27181b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-chapter-called-children-of-bodom-final-show/1693478781","playParams":{"id":"1693478781","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nfjI93DAK3YWEJZTjzOv1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1693478781/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"13550318","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/13550318?l=en-US"}]}}},"1698676298":{"id":"1698676298","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1698676298?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"releaseDate":"2023-11-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-liu/1493505546","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/9a/3d/97/9a3d9736-d66c-16ce-107d-f11c641b2ae8/639e5a4a-87a0-40dc-a04a-e24fc903c395.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ced3d8","textColor2":"eaecef","textColor4":"c6ccd2","textColor1":"f4f5f7","bgColor":"364960","hasP3":false}},"name":"WAVES: Music by Rameau, Ravel, Alkan","artistName":"Bruce Liu","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0a/65/49/0a65491a-e6da-3211-49ff-c996cec7b473/22UM1IM39933.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdc507","textColor2":"92a2d6","textColor4":"7786b2","textColor1":"fef100","bgColor":"0b1723","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"This first full-length studio album from Canadian pianist Bruce Liu, winner of the 2021 International Chopin Piano Competition, offers music by three distinctive French masters. It begins and ends with works by Rameau, written originally for harpsichord. Liu provides the required clarity through dexterous fingerwork, even as he reinvents some textures, bringing a shimmering quality to the rapidly repeating notes of Variation 3 of <i>Gavotte et six doubles</i>.\n\nLiu has further scope to delineate character and atmosphere in virtuosic works by Alkan—bringing out their harmonic strangeness and acerbic wit—and in the varied musical depictions of Ravel’s <i>Miroirs</i>, most impressively in “Une barque sur l’océan” which prompts Liu to deliver liquid streams of notes while evoking the surge and power of the sea.","short":"Three great French

there anything to be done with carols like “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and “Joy to the World” that hasn’t been done in the past 300 years? If there is, Grammy-winning pianist, composer, and producer Robert Glasper is the kind of artist to do it. “I like covering songs that people know well,” Glasper tells Apple Music. “That’s what I’ve done throughout my whole career.” It’s true: As a jazz pianist, he’s obviously learned his way around making classics his own, whether they were written by Mongo Santamaría or Kurt Cobain. But, he says, “The biggest challenge in making a holiday album was trying to do it in a way that feels festive but at the same time feels real and not corny.” \n\nHe succeeds on both fronts on <i>In December</i>, his Apple Music exclusive that mixes classic carols with a set of originals, and which was recorded in Spatial Audio. Part of what keeps it credible is the fact that Glasper’s hip-hop/R&B/jazz fusion is done on a compositional level instead of just a cosmetic one (no collages of sampled sax solos and drum loops here). The covers reveal a lot about his musical worldview: Sung by Tony winner Cynthia Erivo (<i>The Color Purple</i>), “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” is turned into dark, airy neo-soul, while “Joy to the World”—sung by Alex Isley—feels like a Stevie Wonder ballad. But the originals reveal even more. “The intention for this album was less about Christmas songs and more about songs that feel good during the holidays,” Glasper says. “I stayed away from thinking too much about Christmas and its traditional lingo, and concentrated on real things people go through during the holiday season.” Here, Glasper walks us through <i>In December</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Fireside (Intro)”</b>\n“‘Fireside’ is an intro to the album that sets the tone and the vibe. I wanted people to get the feeling they were sitting by the fire while I played the piano.”\n\n<b>“God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen / Carol of the Bells” (feat. Cynthia Erivo)</b>\n“We did two songs in one. When Cynthia got to the studio, we landed on two different Christmas carols and figured out a way to mix them and make them into one. It was really fun and Cynthia is amazing.”\n\n<b>“Make It Home” (feat. PJ Morton & Sevyn Streeter)</b>\n“‘Make It Home’ is about what couples go through during the holidays. We tried to make this about real-life situations instead of the glossy, happy stories that are painted during Christmastime. We tried to have a fine balance on the album for the real stuff.”\n\n<b>“Memories With Mama” (feat. Tarriona “Tank” Ball)</b>\n“Tank from Tank and the Bangas wrote this song. I wanted to have spoken word on here to mix it up and bring a different vibe. I lost my mother in 2004, and I always think of her during the holidays. I’m glad Tank was able to create this to remind people what it felt like growing up and remind you what your mother would do and say that set the tone for the holidays in your own house.”\n\n<b>“Joy to the World” (feat. Alex Isley)</b>\n“‘Joy to the World’ was fun because it's one of the most well-known Christmas songs and I had a blast remaking this with Alex Isley. She is incredible. I tried to keep the integrity of the song while making it modern.”\n\n<b>“December” (feat. Andra Day)</b>\n“Andra and I co-wrote the song ‘December.’ It concentrates on real life and real feelings during the holidays. Some things aren't always happy and people feel alone, they feel anxiety and all kinds of things during the holidays. So we wanted to touch on those feelings and let people know you're not alone.”\n\n<b>“Little Drummer Boy” (feat. The Baylor Project)</b>\n“'Little Drummer Boy' was fun because Marcus Baylor is a drummer, so it fit them perfectly. It’s such an open tune that gives you room to do whatever you want. I wanted to keep the integrity of the tune while at the same time give it more of a gospel feel.”","short":"The jazz giant details his exclusive LP reimagining holiday classics.","tagline":"Exclusive Album and Interview"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-december/1711701119","playParams":{"id":"1711701119","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711701119/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4643652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4643652?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713053365":{"id":"1713053365","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713053365?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2023-12-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/adam-x/56388372","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/85/33/f7/8533f78e-6e1c-9311-c00a-588be9dba8b4/3370c322-071c-4ed4-8252-023bfe236cf5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bc5aa1","textColor2":"ed578f","textColor4":"bd4c76","textColor1":"ec6bc8","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false}},"name":"My Acidic Being -

The Venetian composer’s famously tricky concerto surges to life in the hands of Julien Chauvin and Le Concert de la Loge, launched by spooky chords and an initial solo entry that launches straight out of the starting blocks. \n\nThey’re no less committed (or theatrical) when the scene cuts to a warming fireside in the central “Largo,” or takes to the ice for a finale filled with incomparable snowy joys. Despite using just one period instrument per part, the Paris-based band conjures up a dazzling display of string sounds. Above all, their “Winter” counters monochrome meteorological realities with vivid colors, high-wire virtuosity, and daring musical gestures.\n\nThe interpretation, Chauvin tells Apple Music Classical, evolved naturally over the course of many performances. “Because <i>The Four Seasons</i> has been recorded hundreds of times before, everyone wants to make it faster, or slower, or more extreme, or more violent, or more singing than the rest,” he notes. “We didn’t want to do that—we didn’t want to draw attention to something ‘special’ just for the sake of it. But at some point, we’d played it so many times that we thought, ‘Yes, I think we play it quite OK. We have good ideas. So let’s record it.’ And we did it with all our heart and with every musician playing their full part in the interpretation. \n\n“I hope the first movement of ‘Winter,’ which is always an impressive piece, gives an idea of what we were about with this recording.”","short":"Vivaldi’s icy season comes to glistening life in this dramatic performance.","tagline":"New EP and

Dreamville fixture, Bas boasts a hip-hop vision without regional limits. His first proper album since 2018’s <i>Milky Way</i>, the pointedly titled <i>We Only Talk About Real Shit When We're Fucked Up</i> reflects the international expansion of his creative gaze. Songs like “Black Jedi” and “Diamonds” maintain his twin senses of melody and lyricism, two elements crucial to his catalog. Two J. Cole team-ups here, “Paper Cuts” and the Afrobeats-leaning “Passport Bros,” only affirm that further.\n\nNot surprising given his Sudanese roots, Parisian birthplace, and Queens upbringing, his curatorial choice of collaborators here spans the globe. Several of these guests represent the African diaspora, including Zimbabwean-born Sha Sha, whose “Testify” appearance leaves a lasting impression. A New York native, Ghanaian American singer Amaarae raises more than just a few octaves on “Decent,” while British rapper AJ Tracey helps bridge two respective drill worlds on the feverish “179 Deli.” Elsewhere, French multi-instrumentalist FKJ adds an organic feel with his textured loops and grooves on “Risk” and “Wait on Me.”\n","short":"The Dreamville fixture goes global while staying local at heart.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-only-talk-about-real-shit-when-were-f-d-up/1720257027","playParams":{"id":"1720257027","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720257027/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"252299862","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/252299862?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720440239":{"id":"1720440239","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live From Drew's Rental House - Single","artistName":"The Chainsmokers","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0a/a9/92/0aa99210-b107-67f0-a3f9-e6cda2f6800c/196871702126.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4a4b49","textColor2":"211d1c","textColor4":"4d4a49","textColor1":"1d1e1c","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-drews-rental-house-single/1720440239","playParams":{"id":"1720440239","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720440239/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"580391756","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/580391756?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720469093":{"id":"1720469093","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720469093?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"releaseDate":"2023-12-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/icona-pop/398345158","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/67/9f/74/679f7442-77ad-11c9-edad-eb81fedc7920/7fc09d0c-e49a-4f7e-a96d-9b93dbd01257.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"303231","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3c3e3d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e6f2ed","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/92/75/f2/9275f249-b239-09d3-db9f-bdf4754f874c/ea358ef8-035c-4261-b139-07afcd4ce43b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"252f2a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"26302c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebf3f2","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/42/56/49/42564977-40a8-4c62-c7f3-a3fd28e279b9/d936f95c-48b4-41bc-a3c9-f9d3e26783d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"101010","textColor4":"373938","textColor1":"020001","bgColor":"d4dcd9","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/c8/42/11/c8421172-bc15-8f5c-72f8-8e2001d7b892/283710f3-152d-4f63-942c-dabaedf5511f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"262425","textColor4":"4d4e4e","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"e8f4f0","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/9c/62/12/9c621249-0ec0-0d0c-7f49-6eaf08129458/dab0ac91-6323-4eb7-85cb-6875bfae06ad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"393b3b","textColor2":"030f09","textColor4":"323d38","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"eff5f5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/dc/99/cb/dc99cbbb-b33b-e7b7-8b0b-49b7c6a6e38a/5eaea06f-8e90-4a10-9b0a-1ec056fc38e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2e2d","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"3e4040","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"c9d0ce","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fitness: Run, Dec 2023 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Icona Pop","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/8f/69/b4/8f69b4f7-bb11-ff82-ecba-1d89cd58cce7/43d07c09-8992-4541-960c-34e8d9236ec3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f3030","textColor2":"2b2c2c","textColor4":"515453","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ebf4f1","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—the mix brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This month’s iteration was assembled by the Swedish electro-pop duo Icona Pop, which released its first album in 10 years, <i>Club Romantech</i>, in September. The project is a bit of a departure from the sunny, maximalist hyperpop they became known for with their 2012 breakthrough “I Love It.” Instead, it’s a journey into darker, stranger, clubbier spaces. This running mix follows that creative direction, but is peppered with moments of playfulness and surprise: Billen Ted and Kah-Lo’s “People Ain’t Dancing” breaks up all that adrenaline-pumping with a moment of bouncy deep house flow, and “We Kept Dancing”—a gospel-inflected collaboration between Jonk & Spook, Samuele Sartini, and DJ Roland Clark—is the sort of inspirational piano house anthem that will keep you moving forward when you want to give up.

on in this guest-packed collection recorded at LA’s Hollywood Bowl over two nights in April 2023, Willie Nelson’s son Micah takes the stage to sing “Die When I’m High (Halfway to Heaven),” a song he wrote when he was playing a lot of dominoes with his dad during the pandemic. The song imagines Willie looking back on his improbable life, from young musician raised in poverty by his grandparents in Abbott, Texas, to hard-working legend who’s still eager to get on the bus at 90: “They say people my age are expected to fade,” Micah sings, “Well, I’m afraid I’ve let them down.” The moment proves that <i>Long Story Short</i> is not just another tribute album: It’s a thoughtful testament to one of America’s greatest artists, and it proves Nelson can outsing just about anybody into his 10th decade. Fifty-three tracks distilled from four hours of performances each night by Nelson’s greatest living contemporaries and acolytes, it’s also a souvenir from an extremely well-attended birthday party.\n\nBilly Strings kicks off the celebration with “Whiskey River,” channeling Nelson and Family’s late-’70s performance with fiery picking and harmonica. Charley Crockett steps into 1971’s “Yesterday’s Wine” like a pair of old boots, crooning over gorgeous pedal steel and fiddle. Allison Russell and Norah Jones team up for “Seven Spanish Angels,” a gospel classic Nelson recorded with Ray Charles.\n\nBut it’s Nelson’s appearance midway through that kicks things to another gear. He reunites with Booker T. Jones for “Stardust,” the Hoagy Carmichael standard the two included on Nelson’s album of the same name. He teams up with Buddy Cannon, another longtime collaborator who has produced more than a dozen of his recent albums, for “Something You Get Through,” an overlooked gem from 2018’s <i>Last Man Standing</i>. Nelson and Sheryl Crow deliver a gorgeous take on “Far Away Places,” the 1948 standard written by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer. \n\nNelson admits before the performance that he doesn’t know the key; by the end he’s improvising lines with Crow, adding new dimensions to the well-known classic. After more friends and luminaries, including Neil Young, Keith Richards, and Bob Weir, everyone takes the stage for “Happy Birthday.” Even though the group is singing for him, Nelson doesn’t step away from the mic. He sings it along with everyone else.

say that everybody's best album is the first album,” Cosculluela tells Apple Music. Whether or not you accept that statement as true, at least in his case, there’s a strong argument to be made for the Puerto Rican rapper/reggaetonero’s <i>El Príncipe</i>. Originally released in 2009, that full-length debut’s legacy has endured and expanded over the years, particularly as Latin hip-hop’s global footprint grew beyond regional popularity into international ubiquity. Though he recalls being somewhat shocked by the success of its single “Prrrum” (“When I saw it on the tracklist I was like, ‘Yo, what is going on? This was a joke that I did!’”), he nonetheless maintains an affinity and affection for the album and what it did for his career. \n\nThat said, it took a lot for Cosculluela to decide some 14 years later to release a sequel. Born out of a criminal case that left him restless and confined to what he describes as a farm in the Puerto Rican countryside, <i>El Príncipe 2</i> finds him not merely returning to the well of his beloved earlier work, but reflecting upon himself and his craft with a newfound creative energy. Recording largely by himself in this tranquil setting was a stark contrast with his years of having an entire posse of friends and associates in the studio. “The vibe was perfect,” he says. “Sometimes you got to say, I want to work, get everybody out the studio. I want to see how I'm singing now.” \n\nWith a guest list including Chencho Corleone, Ozuna, and Luar La L, the resulting 20 tracks here include some of the strongest and most honest work of his discography. What fans might find most surprising is the lack of tiraeras, something he acknowledges he was very much known for. “Everybody wants me to beef, and I'm tired of it, bro,” he says. “You don't know what this comes with. I'm not dissing nobody; I’m just giving you music.” Read on to learn the details behind some of the album’s highlights—in Cosculluela’s own words.\n\n<b>“TLD”</b>\n“I consider myself humble, but if you mess with me—everybody got a limit. These are the perfect verses for people when they start listening to the album and say, ‘Damn, the punchlines.’ I was listening to [Meek Mill’s ‘Dreams and Nightmares’] on repeat and I was like, ‘My Lord, I wish I could make something like that.’ I wasn't thinking about that when I made it, but I always listened to that and I always used to think, 'I wish I could make something like that.'”\n\n<b>“Ese Kbrn” (feat. Ozuna)</b>\n“When you got an ankle bracelet, everybody picks up the phone because they're like, ‘Yo, I know you in a situation, bro.’ Ozuna, he's a star and he always wanted to collaborate with me. Me too! And we did it!”\n\n<b>“Mi Pistola” (feat. Luar La L)</b>\n“I made 30-something tracks. Everybody wanted to jump on <i>El Príncipe 2</i> from the new generation. I said I'm going to put the Luar one out and I kept the other ones for whatever comes after this.”\n\n<b>“Les Ninnos”</b>\n“I did this song for my kids, when my dad passed away. I was really close to my dad, but when my dad was passing away, I had a son being born at the same time. That sounds really crazy, because you're thanking God for your son, but at the same time it was like, your dad's sick, boom—couple of days. I started it for that son of mine especially. This kid, he’s the same as my dad. He got the same eyes, he got the same looks, he got everything like my dad. That emptiness that I felt when my dad passed away, that kid, he filled it up. It was like my dad's in him.”\n","short":"A sequel 14 years in the making from a reggaetón giant."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-pr%C3%ADncipe-2/1721435035","playParams":{"id":"1721435035","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5U3A4CCnKzp3vtWbIqAzNO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721435035/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"76538401","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/76538401?l=en-US"}]}}},"1721441202":{"id":"1721441202","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721441202?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"releaseDate":"2023-12-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nicki-minaj/278464538","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/5e/39/f9/5e39f902-3487-cc5d-4f79-3850309cd165/f1acd886-5e5b-4c81-ba2e-cb8e806875f8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"40393c","textColor2":"0e0909","textColor4":"3e3a3a","textColor1":"10080b","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/a1/5c/b4/a15cb476-1f75-74c8-d0f6-c218aa1a343c/ee94e6cc-8579-419f-9ae0-6f15b81ed29c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c76591","textColor2":"f565a5","textColor4":"c45485","textColor1":"f779b3","bgColor":"041205","hasP3":false}},"name":"Pink Friday 2 (Gag City Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Nicki Minaj","artwork":{"width":4800,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/ce/84/6e/ce846efa-372b-eba4-959c-dd43bb760924/23UM1IM66574.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4800,"textColor3":"cc7a95","textColor2":"e763bb","textColor4":"bc5199","textColor1":"fb97b6","bgColor":"110612","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"After delays, teases, rumors, and more, Nicki Minaj’s epic and much-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s <i>Queen</i> arrives to close out 2023 in style. At 22 tracks and over 70 minutes, the epic project features Minaj tag-teaming with fellow global stars like J. Cole, Drake, Future, Lil Wayne, and Lil Uzi Vert—that is, when she’s not aiming for the throne on solo cuts. \n\nLike 2010’s <i>Pink Friday</i> (Minaj’s debut album), <i>Pink Friday 2</i> features Minaj showcasing the various ways she can carry a track. On some songs, she brings out her best bars, unloading clever one-liners and technically flashy verses. On the album’s second track, “Barbie Dangerous,” Minaj spits over a hypnotizing piano melody and drums that hit like a punch in the gut. Switching between a smooth, controlled flow and a vicious double-time delivery, Minaj is in full control of the song’s dynamics from beginning to end. She makes her claim as one of rap’s great innovators, spitting, “Name a rapper that can channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear/Ho, I’m mother of the year/Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make ’em disappear/But to me, it's just another year.”\n\nOn “Nicki Hendrix,” she teams up with Future and taps into his toxic vulnerability, writing a song of love and love lost that would fit nicely into her collaborator’s catalog. At her best, Nicki is uninhibited by style, substance, or delivery. She raps, “Baby, did you think there were a million mes?/I guess I underestimated you too.” Whether engaging in a street cypher with J. Cole, chirping at exes with Drake, or lamenting what once was with Future, Nicki Minaj shows off every weapon in her arsenal on <i>Pink Friday 2</i>.","short":"50 Cent, Monica, and Keyshia Cole make a stopover in Gag City."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pink-friday-2-gag-city-deluxe/1721441202","playParams":{"id":"1721441202","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5eA2VJ0yeiU4kXz1zvuMro"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721441202/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"278464538","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/278464538?l=en-US"}]}}},"1721449878":{"id":"1721449878","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721449878?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2023-12-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/t-pain/256673237","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/26/96/6926967e-551e-fa5e-5c02-0f3d78ccbf84/0f38efb3-eaf5-4ff5-84a1-3a7d54406b9d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"40424c","textColor2":"2b201f","textColor4":"4d4547","textColor1":"1a1d25","bgColor":"d8d9e8","hasP3":false}},"name":"On Top of The Covers (Live from The Sun Rose)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"T-Pain","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/83/75/1d/83751d1c-6fe1-2b75-e933-9814c2fc971a/197342452328_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"d9cacd","textColor2":"e0cecb","textColor4":"cab4bb","textColor1":"f4eae1","bgColor":"70497d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/on-top-of-the-covers-live-from-the-sun-rose/1721449878","playParams":{"id":"1721449878","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/77TJJ9z1EXYIau0RDjT3Ta"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721449878/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"256673237","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/256673237?l=en-US"}]}}},"1721640878":{"id":"1721640878","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721640878?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2023-12-22","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wizkid/309335750","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/0b/2a/78/0b2a7809-8aa0-07a3-4bd6-63cf5bdf25bd/0cd4bb8d-5d36-4dd7-b114-44f623038a5c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/96/3e/dd/963eddae-48d7-2181-c05b-4a4d419a992c/7790f1b4-3977-4c64-952a-39da471c6d39.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c5c7ea","textColor2":"e6e7f6","textColor4":"bbbee6","textColor1":"f3f3fb","bgColor":"2a2daa","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/99/12/389912c0-b79a-c91b-57ba-a948a4d4309d/a6fc8251-725b-4a09-af74-999208ccd39d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"dcdcdc","textColor4":"b0b0b0","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false}},"name":"S2 - EP","artistName":"Wizkid","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/6f/e8/33/6fe83312-989e-c6ef-2cf0-e79f1c573f64/196871664691.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbef","textColor2":"e68820","textColor4":"ba6f3f","textColor1":"fbfbfb","bgColor":"0a0cbc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Lagos superstar Wizkid turned in this celebratory EP right on cue for the city’s famed party season in December 2023—just as he did in 2019 with <i>SoundMan, Vol. 1</i>. This four-track sequel bears all the hallmarks of Wizkid’s global explosion since 2020, with traces of previous sun-dappled hits “Essence” and “Ginger” in midtempo production that’s infused with his native Yoruba and backed by handpicked features. The slick shakers and basslines of amapiano carry opener “Ololufe,” featuring former mentor Wande Coal, but it’s the fierce back and forth with Zanku Records wildchild Zlatan (on “IDK”) that delivers the best pairing for Wizzy. The track calls to gospel and Afro-jazz with the same energy that has seen the Afrobeats star drive a sound that has dominated party scenes around the world.","short":"StarBoy Entertainment’s boss
