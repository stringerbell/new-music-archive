Rope","artistName":"Sleater-Kinney","editorialNotes":{"standard":"In the video for Sleater-Kinney’s “Untidy Creature,” freediver Amber Bourke spends two and a half minutes on her back, eyes closed, holding her breath under the water of a full bathtub. That peaceful-seeming setup, juxtaposed with Bourke's re-oxygenating gasps, is an apt metaphor for the tension, anxiety, vulnerability, and catharsis that characterize the Portland, Oregon, band’s 11th LP (and second as a duo following the departure of longtime drummer Janet Weiss), <i>Little Rope</i>. “The album is playing with ideas and feelings and sentiments that could be either or both,” guitarist/vocalist Carrie Brownstein, one half of the duo alongside vocalist/guitarist Corin Tucker, tells Apple Music. “So a little rope could signify the darkest moment for someone, a desire to end it all, but it could also conversely be the thing that someone throws to you to rescue you, to pull you from the muck and the mud.”\n\nOver the last couple of years, Sleater-Kinney has experienced a lot more than just muck and mud. In late 2022, just as the band had started writing the album, Brownstein's mother and stepfather died in a car accident while traveling overseas. “There was a sense of fragility and also disorientation,” Brownstein says of that time. “So the act of playing guitar, I understood that ritual. I knew what to do with my hands. So Corin brought me songs instead of baking cakes or bringing me food. Part of it was just tending to this world that we have spent nearly three decades building—and songs were something that were still very much alive. And because the stakes felt higher, I just wanted every song to be perfect.” Here Brownstein and Tucker explain how they made that happen.\n\n<b>“Hell”</b>\nCorin Tucker: “This song really came about organically when I was in a record store listening to music in LA. It was one of those moments where the lyrics just started coming to me and the emotion of feeling like I was having this revelation about what we normalize in our society, the way that we normalize violence, the way that we have accommodated it. It's supposed to be a moment of shock of waking up to that and realizing it in that moment.”\n\n<b>“Needlessly Wild”</b>\nCarrie Brownstein: “I've always been a scrappy, irascible person, and I think this song reckons with outsize emotions that no longer feel sanctioned and that feeling of continual clumsiness, or confusion, or almost being feral. I kept wanting to change the lyrics from the demo version, which said 'needlessly wild' over and over again. But Corin and John Congleton, our producer, liked it better when it was more lyrically austere. And I finally realized that the repetition was the song—that the whole point was that there wasn't an escape route, and that we're not going to find a different end to this repetitive line, just like we can't write alternative endings for things that we don't want or like the outcomes to.”\n\n<b>“Say It Like You Mean It”</b>\nCT: “This song is about when you realize that your time with the people you care about the most, it will come to an end, and you may not know exactly when that's going to be or how it's going to take shape, but you definitely will be saying goodbye. And it's about the wide range of emotions that come with that: acceptance, the tender feelings, and also a feeling of frustration and even anger in the imperfection of the intimacy that we have together during the time that we have.”\n\n<b>“Hunt You Down”</b>\nCB: “I was listening to a podcast that featured an interview with a poet, an undertaker named Thomas Lynch. And he was talking about a meeting he had with a father as they were planning the burial of this man's child, and the father said to Thomas Lynch, 'The thing you fear the most will hunt you down.' It was such a striking and devastating line, and it had such an axiomatic quality to it. It is just the truth. This sounds very depressing, but the music of the song—the rhythm, the vocal melody—it's catchy. The more you sing something—even if there's pain or sadness in the lyrics—when you put that over something that actually buoys you, it can change the meaning of what that is until there's freedom in letting go of that great fear.”\n\n<b>“Small Finds”</b>\nCT: “When we started playing this song, it was just kind of like a jam on guitar. It’s a weird song. It definitely comes from our love of discordant guitar—bands like Television and Sonic Youth—and music that has some real grit to it. And then the fun of it is making a puzzle that works as a song. With the lyrics and the vocals, I wanted to do something that gave it a bit of swing into a catchier song, so that it had a story to it that wasn't just bits and pieces. So the character in it is a dog, and it's about taking away all of that cerebral angst that we live with every day, and we worry about things and getting into our bodies and thinking about, ‘Well, what is meaningful in the everyday life? What is some joy I can seek out?’”\n\n<b>“Don't Feel Right”</b>\nCB: “This is that duality between dark and light. To me, when I was writing it, we needed a fast song. I like songs that feel like songs you drive around to. It's such a classic way of listening to music. And I wanted a song that you could sit inside and go on a journey with, musically. It has that repeating riff and this just constant drive to it. When we sing the chorus, it really conjures Tom Petty to me, who I think is very good at taking heartbreak and heartache and turning it into something melodious.”\n\n<b>“Six Mistakes”</b>\nCT: “I think it was something that we were messing around with sonically to have it be like a New Wave or Devo song. But as we got into the studio with the rest of the songs and the emotion and the rawness of everything, it took it to this very heightened level, where it's a song about feeling outside of being loved, and outside of being seen. So it's almost a character of a woman who can't understand why people can't see her. That's something that I think comes up on this record a lot: aging and feeling like a woman—your identity really changes over time, and taking back your power with that and playing with it.”\n\n<b>“Crusader”</b>\nCB: “There's a handful of methodologies with which we work, and one is just Corin and I still sitting in a room together playing guitar, and you can hear that on this song or 'Small Finds,' just that very fundamental, central Sleater-Kinney quality of intertwining, angular guitar lines. Thematically this song zooms out a little bit, surveys the landscape, grappling with this harsh reality that's sometimes unimaginable and that's grown dire. And just the idea that someone's very existence is a threat to someone else, and the trespasses on bodily autonomy. I think the song imagines that instead of shrinking, you grow to possess something grander and brighter. It's a little bit of a hype song in the middle of a broader narrative—of this album that is about resistance and grappling with smallness and self-effacement.”\n\n<b>“Dress Yourself”</b>\nCB: “This song speaks to the modern-day predicament of somehow getting out of bed and getting ourselves prepared for the day, despite all of the existential threats. It's almost shocking what great pretenders we all are, and the normalcy and steadiness that we can project out into the world. It's a rallying cry for those of us who can't believe we're upright every day.”\n\n<b>“Untidy Creature”</b>\nCT: “This one’s meant to be a very personal story about feeling trapped in a relationship, but it's also meant to look out as a window on what women are going through in this country in the past couple of years, losing our bodily autonomy, losing our sense of being able to control our own destiny. And so it's meant to mirror the personal and the broader world at the same time.”","short":"The duo’s 11th album is an exercise in catharsis: “The stakes felt higher.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/5c/c7/e7/5cc7e770-5ddd-a75c-4cd8-8cde63ce7d48/23CRGIM37153.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6b931","textColor2":"fc8b1c","textColor4":"dc7117","textColor1":"e1e63d","bgColor":"5c0803","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/little-rope/1706544250","playParams":{"id":"1706544250","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7hf2cM8SdK5vdb6SeH2qyM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1706544250/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2819264","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2819264?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709291257":{"id":"1709291257","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709291257?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/e3/98/d9/e398d9e1-fd34-4f4e-5ce1-70e6647dd4c1/Job4b3659f4-7cc8-4593-a547-ca70f59c9374-158422291-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_304874096_1605830199-Time1699571850792.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"d6cfca","textColor2":"f5c2a8","textColor4":"d7ae9b","textColor1":"f2ece2","bgColor":"625b67","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/41/f5/49/41f54952-39ff-f79e-4064-825db82ab66c/f8146725-adf6-4d89-942b-79b760657d96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"343132","textColor2":"181616","textColor4":"3f3b3b","textColor1":"0a080a","bgColor":"ddd1cf","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/2c/7d/5b/2c7d5b4f-4d90-014f-153b-a7b963e0e72b/Job5332dd9d-361d-4c1c-965e-dd14bb50b5ab-156717635-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_300800213_1574725005-Time1696536420855.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"baa59b","textColor2":"d4bcba","textColor4":"b09d9b","textColor1":"e1c7b9","bgColor":"1e1e22","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/fd/95/e3/fd95e340-04b5-7c63-a59f-04d729dbc964/3fa401ff-3a50-4152-9461-55aa09e511f3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"362f31","textColor2":"281d19","textColor4":"4a3d38","textColor1":"0e0d10","bgColor":"d3bbb5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brittney-spencer/1358700949","name":"My Stupid Life","artistName":"Brittney Spencer","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Brittney Spencer first came to prominence in 2020, releasing an EP, <i>Compassion</i>, that caught the ears and hearts of country fans and fellow artists, supergroup The Highwomen among them. It was both her powerful and versatile voice and nuanced, warmhearted songwriting that drew listeners to Spencer, who grew up performing and honing her craft in Baltimore before moving to Nashville in 2013. Given the acclaim she’s netted since releasing <i>Compassion</i>, Spencer could have rattled off a debut album in short order. Instead, she took her time crafting her first full-length project, an endeavor that clearly pays off on first listen. \n\nOpening track “New to This Town” is gentle and melodic, with fingerpicked acoustic guitar and understated but emotive vocals from Spencer. “I Got Time” gets feisty and playful, recalling the sass and swagger of early Miranda Lambert. Other highlights include “Bigger Than the Song,” a soulful tribute to the country genre, and the LP’s title track, a vulnerable account of Spencer’s commitment to her dreams. Guests on the album, produced by Grammy winner Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves, Tenille Townes), include Maren Morris, Grace Potter, Abbey Cone, and Sarah Buxton on backing vocals, as well as Jason Isbell on guitar.","short":"The long-awaited debut LP from the beloved Nashville-via-Baltimore star.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/db/30/c0/db30c0d7-36b3-dd76-601e-1d60f44c188a/075679670717.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"b09797","textColor2":"cdbbc8","textColor4":"a898a4","textColor1":"d8bab7","bgColor":"110e15","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-stupid-life/1709291257","playParams":{"id":"1709291257","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3pWiHbMUEcxA0TjNW1Ipb3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709291257/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1358700949","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1358700949?l=en-US"}]}}},"1709572991":{"id":"1709572991","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709572991?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/32/4b/ed/324bed2c-6fca-df7e-7d33-4ba9c8786de8/b202298c-d315-4415-9298-102660060263.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afa27c","textColor2":"c6b2a2","textColor4":"a29285","textColor1":"d6c797","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/neck-deep/554682150","name":"Neck Deep","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Neck Deep","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Neck Deep have never been afraid to explore, regularly seeding sounds and ideas from other genres into their pop-punk foundations. The Wrexham, Wales, band were at their most adventurous on their fourth album, 2020’s <i>All Distortions Are Intentional</i>: Setting the songs in a conceptual world called Sonderland, they nosed around in indie rock and Britpop while reflecting on identity, mental health, and disenfranchisement. However, this intrepid spirit stalled under lockdown, and when restrictions lifted, the five-piece struggled to find that momentum again. “We had to rediscover ourselves a little bit, post-COVID,” singer Ben Barlow told Mark Hoppus on Apple Music 1’s After School Radio. “It took us a little bit to build back up and figure out where we were gonna go.”\n\nEven by the time Neck Deep stationed themselves in LA to record this self-titled fifth album in 2023, there was still uncertainty. After just a few weeks’ work, all they’d forged was a nagging feeling of dissatisfaction. The music didn’t sound right, so they decided to strip away outside influences and start again by returning to their own studio in Wrexham, where the other Barlow brother, bassist Seb, took on production duties. It’s little surprise then that <i>Neck Deep</i> marks a return to the exhilarating and simple blend of melody and adrenalin that characterized their earliest records. “It’s straight-up pop-punk, just short, sharp, to the point, in your face,” said Ben. “We just simplified, took a step back, looked at where we came from and what we loved about the music that we write. It’s always been about hard-hitting, fast, pacy anthems that are catchy, can help you through a bad time and be the soundtrack to your good times. We’re really at peace with ourselves—let’s just be a straight-up pop-punk band and do what we do.”\n\nWhat’s different now is their music carries the wisdom of age and experience, and Ben’s lyrics present more shades and nuance as he explores his relationship with his parents (“They May Not Mean to [But They Do]”), urges self-belief in times of frustration and vulnerability (“Moody Weirdo”), and raises an insurrectionary call to make a difference in a turbulent world (“We Need More Bricks”). “It’s just life, love, relationships, myself, lots of looking inward,” he says. “I’m looking at how I was as a kid and who I am now. All I know is I know nothing, and I’m just a fool in a crazy world—dealing with normal things. While we’re a successful band, I’m a pretty normal dude: My life revolves around my band, my future wife, and my dogs. So, hopefully, I’m relatable—and that’s always been something I look for in music.”","short":"A return to their roots: “Let’s just be a straight-up pop-punk band.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/64/2d/91/642d919e-e8f1-9bf0-8260-24df6d1f5412/1830.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cac24d","textColor2":"f9afcc","textColor4":"c78ca3","textColor1":"fdf260","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/neck-deep/1709572991","playParams":{"id":"1709572991","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5dJ7QsXRqsX5oErJatoERd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709572991/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"554682150","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/554682150?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711049681":{"id":"1711049681","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711049681?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/a1/b5/d4/a1b5d444-47b4-6da8-ee97-56477b647bc2/Job827b23e5-8f98-44ac-8519-aa1eb70a6abb-157606587-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_302789182_1589982735-Time1698106196468.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"b6b6b6","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"100f10","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/7f/a1/a7/7fa1a7a4-3832-6f7e-86b9-ba5732256ede/6f610f58-44a9-400c-bd85-1f897caf7739.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c58070","textColor2":"d7826b","textColor4":"bc6b59","textColor1":"e29b88","bgColor":"521010","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/49/fc/d4/49fcd495-2761-9061-477f-6a8aa8a8b629/Jobf8f8e819-ae2b-4d5a-90f0-372e972815ce-157427826-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_302399402_1586816813-Time1697742133611.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c9c9c9","textColor2":"d8d8d8","textColor4":"aeaeae","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/01/94/ab/0194abf3-7985-2e58-c659-00b599863f36/9c1f1e72-fee4-4a5c-849d-2ee135117f97.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6c6c6","textColor2":"d3d3d3","textColor4":"acacac","textColor1":"f3f4f4","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/green-day/954266","name":"Saviors","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Green Day","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Arriving 20 years after the open political ire of <i>American Idiot</i>, Green Day’s 14th album sees the veteran California punk trio energized by a new wave of worrying trends. Now in his early fifties, singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong retains the snotty defiance that has always been his calling card, whether the stakes are high or low. He doesn’t mince words on opener and lead single “The American Dream Is Killing Me,” calling out the nation’s boom in conspiracy theories and reimagining the classic patriotic lyric “my country, ’tis of thee” as “my country under siege.” \n\nWhile less of a concept album than the rock opera turned stage musical <i>American Idiot</i>, <i>Saviors</i> still latches on to some recurring themes in the name of getting a point across, such as updating 1950s-era rock ’n’ roll tropes: “Bobby Sox” swaps the aw-shucks question “Do you wanna be my girlfriend?” with “Do you wanna be my boyfriend?” while the timeless-sounding romantic ballad “Suzie Chapstick” is timestamped with a reference to absently scrolling Instagram. And “Living in the ’20s” may flash a guitar solo ripped straight from rock’s earliest days, but it also cites the more modern markers of mass shootings and pleasure robots.\n\nArmstrong’s urgent venting is delivered within some of Green Day’s catchiest songs since the 1990s, and longtime producer Rob Cavallo proves just as crucial to the album’s punchy, uncrowded sound as bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer Tré Cool. After all, Cavallo helmed the band’s 1994 smash <i>Dookie</i>, and <i>Saviors</i> sneaks in a few nods to that ripe era too. The sheer simplicity of the chugging chords opening “Strange Days Are Here to Stay” evokes the former album’s hit single “Basket Case,” while the mortality-minded closer “Fancy Sauce” borrows Nirvana’s coupling of “stupid and contagious.” The bubblegum anthem “Look Ma, No Brains!” harks back even further to Green Day’s DIY roots (and before that, pop-punk godfathers the Ramones), further cementing the idea that righteous anger goes down easier smuggled inside a pop song.","short":"Two decades after American Idiot, more venting wrapped in tuneful pop punk.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/af/90/27/af9027e7-8a46-21b5-32ff-686733d37c57/093624866053.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcecd","textColor2":"d9d9d9","textColor4":"b1b1b1","textColor1":"fcfefd","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/saviors/1711049681","playParams":{"id":"1711049681","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4AIeqAMDyIT884A9uA2A0i"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711049681/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"954266","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/954266?l=en-US"}]}}},"1712337284":{"id":"1712337284","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712337284?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/glass-beach/1464320521","name":"plastic death","artistName":"glass beach","editorialNotes":{"short":"The LA indie rock outfit returns with a proggy, unpredictable second album.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/27/6f/cf/276fcff3-738d-8bf0-4f8e-27341c9b5b37/42449.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"06c1a9","textColor2":"23d2c2","textColor4":"1ca99d","textColor1":"07f1d1","bgColor":"04050a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/plastic-death/1712337284","playParams":{"id":"1712337284","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4LKhRqqNlRlWwt4d9GG3QW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712337284/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1464320521","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1464320521?l=en-US"}]}}},"1712815744":{"id":"1712815744","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712815744?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/3a/6b/92/3a6b92d1-b112-8b75-4e5e-af53f489d2f1/2681ac87-7e36-48ed-9446-b518ea914c5c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"88b097","textColor2":"e3b49a","textColor4":"ba9784","textColor1":"a5d3b2","bgColor":"17222b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kevin-quinn/6785818","name":"Real Me","artistName":"Kevin Quinn","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/17/b7/9f/17b79f90-e8d4-b8e4-1507-1be78089d559/23UM1IM30603.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"252424","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"373636","textColor1":"020202","bgColor":"b0aeaf","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/real-me/1712815744","playParams":{"id":"1712815744","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/78GU0GtHUsMuU140MvN1wu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712815744/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"6785818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/6785818?l=en-US"}]}}},"1712928139":{"id":"1712928139","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712928139?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/billow-observatory/575903169","name":"Soliton -

As concerts and recordings were canceled, musicians’ homes became stages and studios. It was a time of reinvention, hastened by necessity. Philip Glass, then 83, was in the middle of a tour when the pandemic struck, and was forced to retreat to his New York apartment. “I had been on the road essentially for half a century,” the American minimalist tells Apple Music Classical, “but suddenly, for the first time in years, I had time to play the piano.” \n\n<i>Philip Glass Solo</i> is the result of many hours spent at his beloved Baldwin grand piano revisiting and rerecording a selection of his early piano works, some of which he first played on his 1989 album <i>Solo Piano</i> (also recorded on a Baldwin). “When I think about my earlier music, I don’t write music like that anymore, so I’m curious about the person who wrote them,” he says. “I am no longer that person. We all change—it’s inevitable. I am no longer that person as a composer, as a performer, or even as a listener.” \n\nAnd indeed, Glass’ performances are noticeably different—they possess a more improvisatory character compared to those 1989 takes, as if he were composing each piece in front of us. <i>Mad Rush</i>, by far the longest piece here, is almost three minutes longer—it’s freer, looser. That’s partly explained by the complex relationship that exists between composer and interpreter. “When I was in music school, they almost uniformly told composers not to perform,” remembers Glass, “but interpretation can make you think of the music in a way you wouldn’t have if you were just the composer. When you are an interpreter yourself, you understand the possibilities of the music in a different way. And they sometimes appear to you in real time.”\n\nThere’s little doubt that the timbre and feel of the piano also play their part in shaping Glass’ interpretations. This particular Baldwin has been shaped by 35 years of constant use—in “Metamorphosis 1” or in the final “Truman Sleeps” you can hear the fragile treble notes battle the instrument’s resounding midrange. “I have done most of my composing on it or next to it,” he explains, “and it’s inevitable that the sound of the instrument you play every day, and the room that you are in, must in some way influence how you hear.”\n\nPerhaps this album was influenced, too, by Glass’ sense of a shared lockdown experience. “One thing I will say is that I wasn’t alone,” he says. “During the pandemic, we were all in our homes. So, we did what people have always done: we played music…for ourselves, for others.”","short":"“Suddenly, for the first time in years, I had time to play the piano.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/dd/60/92/dd609246-8765-70c6-cbc2-6ea336879928/20231102-pg-solo-cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"363538","textColor2":"452d1c","textColor4":"635044","textColor1":"0e0b0d","bgColor":"d9dde6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/philip-glass-solo/1715518800","playParams":{"id":"1715518800","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715518800/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"791154","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/791154?l=en-US"}]}}},"1717614313":{"id":"1717614313","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1717614313?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/43/af/88/43af8832-ade9-9d10-12a2-8d921dd8d0e4/2e134810-6c1e-40c8-ba48-26df486fcee3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ccd1f7","textColor2":"e9ecfb","textColor4":"c3caf6","textColor1":"f4f5fd","bgColor":"2c41e0","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=117668410-279527761-1717614478-1142412958-1696505390-6200007-1717614479","name":"Rhapsody in Blue Reimagined","artistName":"Lara Downes, Edwin Outwater, SFCM Orchestra, Edmar Colón, Jeriel Sanjurjo, John Santos & Great Wall Chinese Orchestra","editorialNotes":{"standard":"February 12, 1924 was a landmark day for classical music. Bandleader Paul Whiteman had organized a concert at New York’s Aeolian Hall called “An Experiment in Modern Music” to prove that jazz could at least be taken as a serious artform by classical audiences. The program of 23 items was packed with bland arrangements of popular tunes, and might well have flopped had it not been for the penultimate number: George Gershwin’s <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> for piano and jazz band. As soon as the famous clarinet glissando began to soar aloft (improvised in rehearsal and given the green light by the composer), audience members, who had started to leave, returned to their seats to watch the full drama unfold. Led by Gershwin at the piano, the performance was dizzying, exuberant, and energetic, and changed classical music forever.\n\nAlmost exactly a century on, <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> still captivates with its grand showtunes, colorful orchestration, and virtuosic piano writing. Inevitably, following the publication of Ferde Grofé’s full-orchestra arrangement alongside a through-written piano part, performances have tended to adhere closely to the score. But for American pianist Lara Downes, <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>’s improvisatory, free-wheeling nature opened the doors for a new version—one that respected the original score, but which also updated some of its soundscapes to resonate with the here and now. After all, Gershwin referred to his piece as a “kaleidoscope of America,” as Downes explains to Apple Music Classical. “What I always think about is what Gershwin intended, and what he was trying to capture,” she says. “For me, it’s interesting to see the ways in which that is very different 100 years later, but also the ways in which this country is not that different at all. So, it was a question of trying to illustrate his time and our time rolled into one.”\n\nTo bring this sense of nowness to Gershwin’s music, Downes approached Puerto Rican composer Edmar Colón for a new arrangement that reverberated with the sounds of today—yet one that was still firmly Gershwin. <i>Rhapsody in Blue Reimagined</i> features musicians from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Orchestra, and celebrates the global cultures that are now such a major part of America, from the Jamaican rhythms of Downes’ heritage to the dances of Colón’s South America. Colón retains the spirit of the 1924 performance with an orchestral scoring that’s distinctly “big band” while he intersperses Gershwin’s music with passages of entirely new music that symbolizes 21st-century America. \n\nThere are flashes of Middle Eastern music and nods to Jewish klezmer. And halfway through, a Chinese ensemble starts to play, blending traditional music with the themes from <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>. “Because the premiere of this version took place in San Francisco,” says Downes, “that’s also the place where we harnessed this traditional Chinese instrument ensemble, because that immigration story is so important in San Francisco.” When Downes tours the work, she explains, the Chinese sounds will be replaced with music from wherever she’s performing. “The idea is that if we’re in Austin, Texas, there’ll be a bluegrass ensemble in that moment.”\n\nSo, has <i>Rhapsody in Blue Reimagined</i> altered Downes’ view of Gershwin’s 1924 work? “I think that I just have a different relationship with the piece now,” she admits. “When I’m playing it, I never feel like I’m dusting off a warhorse, but I’m also very aware that the audience might be sitting down with the expectation of hearing something that they already know. But I think, yes, just bringing this deeper level of understanding, the piece will change for me.”\n\nThis EP features a bonus track, Edmar Colón’s blend of Gershwin and Chopin, <i>Study in Blue</i>, for soprano sax and piano. “When Edmar and I got together to really start working on the <i>Rhapsody</i> project,” says Downes, “we were just starting to go through the score, and we got to that section with that big, slow theme. And Edmar said, “Oh, that’s like that Chopin, it’s like the ‘Tristesse’ Etude [Op. 10 No. 3]. We were laughing that Gershwin had stolen it, and then we realized how beautifully those two melodies interlink.” For Downes, <i>Study in Blue</i> is yet another way of connecting eras, of showing just how much we all have in common, despite the centuries that separate us.","short":"“We’re trying to illustrate Gershwin’s time and our time rolled into one.”","tagline":"New Album and

Jenkins has given earlier releases titles like <i>The Anxious</i> and <i>The Frustration</i>, and he devotes his fourth studio album to a virtue he finds similarly vexing. Patience, he suggests, is the part of your journey where you are no longer in control. Over beats that are jazzy, unhurried, and slightly unsettled, Jenkins plays tricky word games as he ruminates on outgrowing old friends (“Show & Tell”) and cracks wry half-jokes about peers who only talk about money (“Guapanese”). He’s joined by a few thoughtfully selected guests (Freddie Gibbs, Benny the Butcher, JID), but on album highlight “007” he holds it down alone, flipping a catchphrase to his advantage: “We fucked around and found a way out.”","short":"The Chicago MC goes deep on a virtue he’s learning more about.","tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio"},"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/1d/d6/8b/1dd68ba8-1346-e652-6140-18c580fde939/4099964028201.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"3d3d30","textColor2":"28231a","textColor4":"49442f","textColor1":"1a191b","bgColor":"cbcb85","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-patience-deluxe-edition/1724240563","playParams":{"id":"1724240563","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724240563/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"885270234","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/885270234?l=en-US"}]}}},"1724292191":{"id":"1724292191","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724292191?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/86/cb/47/86cb47d1-1d38-7ec8-ade9-ab47f6302008/Job032d4c9c-5702-48c4-b7bf-d9b38c406878-161141705-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_311438793_1654981713-Time1704802138931.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cac7ca"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3c2c3","textColor2":"cac7ca","textColor4":"a29fa2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/ea/c0/6c/eac06c80-c50b-1acf-213f-0c6e90ee1c2b/Jobce9cacc7-3dd8-4ac5-8eac-40bfafbf7c65-161141706-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_311438792_1654981705-Time1704803845032.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c3c2c3","textColor2":"d6d4d6","textColor4":"aca9ac","textColor1":"f3f2f3","bgColor":"010001","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sheedts/1540274029","name":"C My Side (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"SheedTs","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/bd/66/6c/bd666c4e-ac64-9b17-f677-f970b63166b4/35854.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3b3b3","textColor2":"c2c2c2","textColor4":"9b9b9b","textColor1":"e0e0e0","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/c-my-side-deluxe/1724292191","playParams":{"id":"1724292191","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3wiyzYrkSD18QHTkI4PEDl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724292191/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1540274029","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1540274029?l=en-US"}]}}},"1724445296":{"id":"1724445296","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724445296?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/12/98/81/129881a9-8ab5-d99f-7cc2-047d07aa13fa/ccdfe0bf-045b-46f5-8dc4-e274fcbbc0c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1b1a19","textColor2":"040302","textColor4":"1c1b1a","textColor1":"010100","bgColor":"807c7d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2e/bc/f3/2ebcf3bb-d1af-c4eb-4a97-f7df9bd6a7c8/84f42c18-f1c6-4287-9d0b-8be9f00b80fe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1c1a1a","textColor2":"040302","textColor4":"1c1b1a","textColor1":"030202","bgColor":"807b7c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eladio-carri%C3%B3n/1024801206","name":"Sol María","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Eladio Carrión","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I manifested this moment in my career,” Eladio Carrión tells Apple Music. “I'm the kind of person who finds it hard to hit pause and celebrate milestones because I'm always on to the next big thing.” Following the success of 2023’s <i>3MEN2 KBRN</i> and the corresponding Sauce USA headlining tour, there was plenty for the rapper to be happy about. Dedicated to his mother, his follow-up album <i>Sol María</i> diverges considerably from the familiar trap-heavy sound of what came earlier. It showcases more of him, both artistically and personally, and plays with decidedly poppier styles. \n\n“This album is the most intimate piece I've shared with my fans,” Carrión says. Touching on topics close to him, its contents include some revelatory material that provides insights into who he is as a person. He tackles the tricky subject of mental health on “Luchas Mentales” and pays deep homage to his parents on “Mamá’s Boy.” Even the guest list—which includes Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Rauw Alejandro—is scaled back compared with prior efforts, a reflection of the intimacy and immediacy of the material. “It was important for me that they not only brought their own talents, but also resonated with the essence of the album,” he explains. Below, read an interview with Carrión, in which he discusses <i>Sol María</i> and what it means to him.\n\n<b><i>Sol María</i> represents a very different sound for you. For those who know you as a trapero, can you explain why you moved away from that style here?</b>\nThis album is a heartfelt tribute to my mom, Sol María. While she can still vibe with the trap scene, this project is like a musical bouquet of appreciation and diving into those genres that she resonates with more. It’s my way of expressing gratitude and giving her the recognition she deserves for everything. We kept the trap energy alive, but my main focus was to take this album and use it as a special thank-you to my biggest supporter. \n\n<b>There’s a lot of very personal material here, not the least of which being “Mamá’s Boy.” What was it like for you to put these experiences and emotional honesty into your music?</b>\nPouring my heart into \"Mamá’s Boy\" was hard. It's not easy to be so vulnerable, laying bare personal experiences like that. But at the same time, it's a testament to the authenticity I strive for in my music. \"Mamá’s Boy\" goes into that deep connection I have with my mom, and the process was like opening up a diary. I'm incredibly fortunate to have both of my parents alive and by my side as I navigate these new chapters in life. Knowing that they’ll always be there for me adds this layer of strength and support while I pursue my dream, and I hope it resonates with others who feel the same way.\n\n<b>You’ve kept the guest list here to a relatively small circle. Is there a reason why you limited the number of features?</b>\nChoosing the guest list for <i>Sol María</i> was a meticulous process, because this is what I consider my best album to date. It's a deeply personal project, and I wanted every artist involved to be a careful representation of the music that shaped me during my upbringing and those I'm vibing with currently.\n\n<b>Are there any tracks here that were especially rewarding or particularly gratifying to record?</b>\n\"Luchas Mentales\" holds a special place because it allowed me to open up about my own struggles with mental health, so it was a deeply cathartic experience. It goes beyond just music; it's a way for me to connect with fans who may be facing similar challenges. I hope that when they listen to this track, they feel a sense of comfort and understand that they're not alone in their struggles. It’s my way of reaching out to those who may need a reminder that they’ll overcome any obstacles and come out even stronger on the other side.\n","short":"Eladio scales back for a more intimate project: “It was like opening up a diary.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0e/66/ac/0e66ac43-9bc4-3282-964a-0d4d89df39f4/197190620054.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bba393","textColor2":"d4a995","textColor4":"b48c7a","textColor1":"ddc5b4","bgColor":"34180c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sol-mar%C3%ADa/1724445296","playParams":{"id":"1724445296","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2zE9RJSh5sMV0NJ8Oc8k5s"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724445296/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1024801206","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1024801206?l=en-US"}]}}},"1724772018":{"id":"1724772018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724772018?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2a/3d/84/2a3d849d-933c-bbfd-3db7-82cfcf2e9f0a/3671a10d-41cc-4830-8949-0316465c79ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0acb7","textColor2":"e5b49f","textColor4":"bf9ba0","textColor1":"e7c9bd","bgColor":"2635a2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/destin-conrad/852999989","name":"SUBMISSIVE2","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"DESTIN CONRAD","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/90/9b/09/909b0966-aa34-7691-4932-4a1340b86422/193436368070_DCSUBMISSIVECOVERHIRES.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"adc2b8","textColor2":"dfe5e8","textColor4":"b3beba","textColor1":"d8e9e6","bgColor":"002401","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/submissive2/1724772018","playParams":{"id":"1724772018","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0qxSlnuP5AvTEeQJwPWYlo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724772018/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"852999989","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/852999989?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725030899":{"id":"1725030899","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725030899?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ericdoa/1469089802","name":"DOA","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"ericdoa","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/73/71/e4/7371e4f1-1623-639f-b73d-abaa7fa15dff/23UM1IM61389.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d3d3","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"b5b5b5","textColor1":"f7f7f7","bgColor":"424242","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/doa/1725030899","playParams":{"id":"1725030899","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/75ScphmWaaBgNOTUh4fatP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725030899/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1469089802","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1469089802?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725353309":{"id":"1725353309","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725353309?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/3e/12/1a/3e121a1b-1cf9-57d5-5989-54d6dd2e57d1/52c83967-1151-4568-b6e4-2ee54c98f70e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c3937","textColor2":"26201e","textColor4":"504946","textColor1":"0d0b0b","bgColor":"faefe8","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fredo-bang/1080703688","name":"Yes, I'm Sad","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fredo Bang","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Baton Rouge rapper Fredo Bang has rarely shied away from honesty in his music. On the boldly titled <i>Yes, I’m Sad</i>, he takes that to a new level. Mixing defensive aggression with honest vulnerability, songs like “Come Thru” and the title track deliver bars about the pain that lingers even after achieving success. Demonstrating a willingness to let his guard down that’s rare in hip-hop today, he raps about lost friends and loved ones, taking care of those left behind. Hardship only seems to compel him further forward, evident on the purpose-driven hustle and grind of “Tina Turner.” Topically, the project moves from heavy moments to relative lighter ones, the latter encapsulated in the explicit smooth talk of “Drop It Low” and “Love & Relations.” To further his points, he links with the seasoned likes of Kevin Gates and Rick Ross while reuniting with “Trust Issues” cohort NLE Choppa, the latter’s “Sideways” soundtracked by a Jersey club swing.","short":"The Baton Rouge rapper lets his guard down and lets listeners in.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/0b/83/1b/0b831b4c-a11b-7634-f38b-e9c661c261b3/24UMGIM02876.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0b8ab","textColor2":"eee4c1","textColor4":"bfb79b","textColor1":"efe5d5","bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yes-im-sad/1725353309","playParams":{"id":"1725353309","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3CCydtww9TVPuD4Ud35TOE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725353309/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1080703688","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1080703688?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725363052":{"id":"1725363052","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725363052?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=275557-31304425-137760419","name":"Beethoven for Three: Symphony No. 4 and Op. 97 \"Archduke\"","artistName":"Yo-Yo Ma, Leonidas Kavakos & Emanuel Ax","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/21/13/0d/21130dbf-08a4-1bc4-a279-aa03a23ca6c7/196871660464.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"d5d5d5","textColor4":"ababab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-for-three-symphony-no-4-and-op-97-archduke/1725363052","playParams":{"id":"1725363052","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725363052/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"275557","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/275557?l=en-US"},{"id":"31304425","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31304425?l=en-US"},{"id":"137760419","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137760419?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725513450":{"id":"1725513450","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725513450?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":39,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/ec/c2/66ecc255-b1ed-34b7-4aa4-b4a421b83892/4b8c3731-716e-4004-b588-faebb89cd64a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c49d7d","textColor2":"e2b195","textColor4":"b8917a","textColor1":"f0c098","bgColor":"141111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/21/34/a4/2134a481-367f-d325-25d6-ed03887c156a/fe3f600a-1b78-452a-bb2c-4923e3c46e5e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d4abb8","textColor2":"f9ab8a","textColor4":"d68e75","textColor1":"f6cfdd","bgColor":"4b1823","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dolly-parton/535066","name":"Rockstar (Deluxe)","artistName":"Dolly Parton","editorialNotes":{"standard":"When the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame extended an invitation to Dolly Parton in early 2022, the preternaturally unshy megastar demurred. While Parton knows she’s forever changed the country music genre with her historic career, she admitted that she didn’t feel it was appropriate for her to accept one of the biggest honors in rock music, as she’d never made rock music of her own. With a little convincing, Parton eventually accepted the honor—but she wanted to put out an actual rock ’n’ roll album to prove her bona fides and make her enshrinement feel more legit. With <i>Rockstar</i> she does just that, enlisting the help of some of the genre’s biggest artists for creative reimaginings of classics. Guests include Elton John, Ann Wilson, Stevie Nicks, Lizzo, Paul McCartney, and many more—proof that Parton’s Rolodex alone justified her Hall induction.\n\nJohn, a true rock star if there ever was one, tells Apple Music he had a remarkable time joining Parton on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” an updated version of the song John originally made famous on his 1974 album <i>Caribou</i> and which later grew more popular as a duet with the late George Michael. “She's always led by example,” John tells Apple Music of Parton. “I duet with her, and it's the first time I've really ever sang with her. It was just the most incredible experience. So I think she's quite a remarkable woman. She's in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, thank god.”\n\nParton tackles a number of eras and styles of rock music—and hosts a number of legendary guests—across <i>Rockstar</i>’s ambitious 30 tracks. Among the other luminaries are none other than Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr (“Let It Be”), Stevie Nicks (“What Has Rock and Roll Ever Done for You,” a previously unreleased cut from Nicks’ 1985 solo album <i>Rock a Little</i>), Heart’s Ann Wilson (“Magic Man”), and former Journey singer Steve Perry (“Open Arms”). Miley Cyrus and Chris Stapleton are also on hand to represent the current class of stars with Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” and a version of Bob Seger’s “Night Moves,” respectively.\n\nThough the Rock Hall induction is certainly a prominent new feather in Parton’s cap, she tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen that she hopes her legacy extends beyond her musical accomplishments to include the philanthropic efforts she’s spent so much of her life pursuing. “I do hope, more than anything, that I've been an inspiration, that I can be an inspiration for all the days that I'm living and even long after I'm gone, that I can leave something behind, maybe something I've said or something I've done that might make some difference, maybe sometimes big difference,” she says. “And just to say, ‘Well, if she did it, I can do it. She was just a poor girl from the mountains.’” ","short":"The legend turns an honor into a dare and puts her stamp on 30 rock classics.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/82/d3/2e/82d32e45-cead-a112-76a2-3a21e1b06e76/24BMR0004968.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8aa8a","textColor2":"efc38c","textColor4":"c29e75","textColor1":"f6d2a6","bgColor":"0e0b1c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rockstar-deluxe/1725513450","playParams":{"id":"1725513450","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/337iOvlhWakFamgb6x2vKN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725513450/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"535066","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/535066?l=en-US"}]}}},"1725771115":{"id":"1725771115","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725771115?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-01-19","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1b/42/14/1b4214e6-d425-b52f-ce0c-bf98932849f8/4ab1b08a-f643-439c-b8c4-7b5f60cc46a9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c19446","textColor2":"de9a37","textColor4":"b37c2d","textColor1":"f0b856","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kris-bowers/396377227","name":"Origin (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Kris Bowers","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0d/97/d1/0d97d146-13ec-8187-10af-fa6208a66b1f/780163651928.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363325","textColor2":"432512","textColor4":"66492f","textColor1":"070905","bgColor":"f0dba4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/origin-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1725771115","playParams":{"id":"1725771115","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5VcBe5UEekI8KV1o5UOT5F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725771115/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"396377227","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/396377227?l=en-US"}]}}}},"playlists":{"pl.7afad8de04334fb68793e50f23ac2fa0":{"id":"pl.7afad8de04334fb68793e50f23ac2fa0","type":"playlists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/playlists/pl.7afad8de04334fb68793e50f23ac2fa0?l=en-US","attributes":{"lastModifiedDate":"2024-01-05T05:02:12Z","supportsSing":false,"description":{"standard":"Listen to a good country ballad and you get the feeling that there's nothing people haven't been through—and nothing they can't get over.
