Sweet Love","artistName":"James Arthur","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“With this album, I really feel like I’ve returned to myself as a singer-songwriter,” James Arthur tells Apple Music. “There’s a few songs that are pretty raw. I think that I’ve felt the demand for that in my fanbase.” The Middlesbrough-born artist’s fifth album <i>Bitter Sweet Love</i> isn’t all fan service, though. With work beginning before he headed out on tour in early 2022, he had a creative mission in mind. “I didn’t want to work with more than one producer, really,” he says. “Whereas historically, it might be a producer and then a cowriter, or I might just write by myself, or do the odd thing with a producer. This was very much just about finding somebody that could harness the vision that I had or understand it and help bring it to life.” \n\nDuring a month-long blitz—the musical equivalent of speed dating—Arthur wound up reconnecting with Steven Solomon, who he worked with on his second record <i>Back from the Edge</i>. “The fact that he had been a session guitarist for a long time was really helpful—me and him were just getting a couple of guitars out and jamming a bit,” Arthur says. Within a week after the tour wrapped they had written the core of the record. “It just felt very inspired. I wanted to capture where I was at in a live sense,” he says. “I wanted to go back to more rock instrumentation.” Working almost entirely with Solomon not only facilitated a cohesive artistic vision, but allowed for experimentation and emotional vulnerability in the music. Album opener “Bitter Sweet Love,” for example, sees Arthur straddle heartache, strutting late ’80s funk guitars, a driving Kings of Leon-sized pre-chorus, and layered gospel backing vocals, while “Just Us” is a gorgeous ballad about how parenthood affects life’s priorities. “This time, I feel like the floodgates were opened. It just felt like the possibilities were endless.” Read on to find out more about each track on <i>Bitter Sweet Love</i> in Arthur’s own words.\n\n<b>“Bitter Sweet Love”</b>\n“I kept singing it, ‘Bitter sweet love,’ in that cadence that you hear. It obviously has a bit of a The 1975 feel, but I wanted it to depart from that groove and that’s where the Kings of Leon pre-chorus came from. It was clear that I wanted to talk about love and heartbreak. Of course, if it’s really love, it ain’t going to be plain sailing. I thought it was a cute thing to do to ask if we just have that sweet love all the time.” \n\n<b>“Free Falling”</b>\n“I was sat at the piano and just started singing, ‘Jenny down the road’s got a new love.’ The lads were like, ‘Why do you keep singing people’s names?’ I just love that thing when [the lyrics] are very visceral. You can imagine what is going on and bring characters into the song. I guess where I was coming from was I imagined this story of a guy who is watching the world go by and is very jealous of people’s happiness. He wants validation. That fed a lot into my story, where I feel like I’m on the outside looking in and I’m not being recognized.” \n\n<b>“Sleepwalking”</b>\n“I thought the word ‘sleepwalking’ was a cool umbrella to write a song around. I actually started the song with the pre-chorus. It made absolutely no sense at all but sounded good to me. Steven was like, ‘That’s really sick, but should we try and find some lyrics that make more sense?’ But I thought why don’t we try and build the song around that pre-chorus instead? Luckily, that sleepwalking concept really married up. I wanted to prove I still had that singer-songwriter thing that I think a lot of my fans from a long time ago like, where it was very raw.” \n\n<b>“Blindside”</b>\n“I wanted to do a Springsteen type of vibe. The melody had a lot of movement and ‘blindside’ was a phrase that fit within that framework. It’s about falling in love at the wrong time. I was in a place where I felt like that’s what I wanted to talk about. I was unpacking some past trauma.” \n\n<b>“Just Us”</b>\n“I’ve been on a journey of looking for things outside of myself and not addressing what’s going on, not appreciating what’s going on around me, being desensitized. Having a child really changed my perspective on life. I never really had an anchor, and having [my daughter] was inspiring. It made me think about how really none of the things I’ve been doing up until this point matter.”\n\n<b>“Comeback Kid”</b>\n“[‘Comeback Kid’] was just something that the media put on me when I had the fall from grace, if you like, publicly. But this is a love song. It’s giving the credit to that other person and saying that, if anyone should take credit for the fact that I managed to bounce back, it’s you. And that just felt like a very lovely and sincere thing to say.” \n\n<b>“From the Jump”</b>\n“I love this song by Ryan Adams called ‘Come Pick Me Up.’ I really wanted to have a song that made me feel like that song does. We were jamming on the guitars and I arrived at the punchline in a very Nashville-type way: ‘I just want to spend forever with you.’ It felt very much like a walking-down-the-aisle-type thing. It felt like vows, essentially.” \n\n<b>“A Year Ago”</b>\n“I really felt this one deep down. There’s nothing more heart-wrenching than that feeling of ‘I thought you couldn’t love anybody more than me, and here I am having to look at you moving on.’ I’m singing about some really authentic stuff that I’d actually felt before.”\n\n<b>“Ruthless”</b>\n“I don’t know if you’ve ever been ghosted by anyone before, but it feels like someone’s pulled the rug. I didn’t think there was anything more real to respond to that feeling than, ‘Fucking hell. You are ruthless.’ I also wanted to have something that you could really rock out to and it was fun playing the character of a guy who’s disgruntled and bitter about what’s happened to him.” \n\n<b>“New Generation”</b>\n“I’m not adept at politics. I don’t really touch on those subjects very much. But obviously there’s a lot of things going on in the world that are just really hard to understand, like the division in the world. So I have a very simplistic view of all that. Why don’t we all just get along? I just wanted to have a song that expressed my honest feelings about everything and how it’s kind of on the new generation to undo a lot of this outdated way of thinking.”\n\n<b>“My Favourite Pill”</b>\n“I loved the idea of doing a sort of Talking Heads, grungy thing. I’ve also never really explored making the vocal gimmicky in a way. The song is about falling in love with the wrong people who I know aren’t going to fulfill me. Like with ‘Ruthless,’ I was playing a character where I’m a bit pathetic because I keep falling for the same traps all the time.”\n\n<b>“Is It Alright?”</b>\n“This song is about the last dance, I suppose. It’s about meeting up with someone who maybe you haven’t seen for a while and you know it’s over, but you want to pretend that it’s not for one night. We really pushed my vocal, because I felt like I hadn’t really [done that] on this record yet. I felt it was important to have a moment like that, where I was really on the edge.”\n\n<b>“Homecoming”</b>\n“Over the last couple of years, I’ve spent a lot of time up in my hometown. I tried to move back there and I wanted to try and reintegrate into my community and see my family again and stuff. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out, but it taught me a lot and did actually realign me with the universe or something. That place was very much the making of me, and I think my morals and values have come from growing up in that environment. This song was my opportunity to write a love letter to my home.”","short":"“The floodgates were opened.

The gauzy textures of those two releases also fastened the “shoegaze” and “dream pop” tags to the Galway-formed band composed of Julie Dawson (vocals/guitar), Cara Joshi (bass), Fiachra Parslow (drums), and Sean O’Dowd (guitar). However, their own vision was always for something more divergent, something more muscular and dynamic—something they’ve forged on a debut album that adds cleaner, steelier edges to their sound while exploring their love of grunge, alt-rock, and electronic music. “It was really rock music that got us all into wanting to play in a band,” Dawson tells Apple Music. “We never really imagined that we’d make a rock record, but that’s what this ended up being. I guess deep down it was always what we wanted to do but we didn’t really have the tools to do it. When we started off, we were still figuring out our sound and then, when we started playing songs live, it was way heavier and we wanted to translate that into the recordings. When we got that guitar sound on ‘Sickly Sweet,’ we were like, ‘Nothing we’ve ever recorded sounded like that. Holy shit, that is what we want!’” \n\nThe album was recorded with trusted band producer Chris Ryan at Rockfield Studios in Wales. Here, NewDad felt galvanized by the fresh air and the studio’s history—which includes incubating records by Queen, The Stone Roses, Oasis, Manic Street Preachers, Pixies, and Iggy Pop—while a downtime diet of zombie movies might, says Dawson, have added to the album’s sense of menace. As much as the sound of <i>MADRA</i>— Irish for “dog”—represents an evolution for NewDad, the lyrics are more concerned with stasis and repetition, particularly in our everyday relationships and behaviors. “It’s those things you can’t escape, or repeating unhealthy patterns,” says Dawson. “It was initially just a working title. It was probably because when we were like, ‘Oh, what will we name it?’ we saw a dog walk past the window or something. But the image of a dog following you does line up nicely with the music. It’s definitely a lot about the relationship between you and whoever—family, friends, partners.” Let Dawson explain further with her track-by-track guide.\n\n<b>“Angel”</b>\n“It was during lockdown and it was definitely like I was having a dry spell when it came to writing. [TV series <i>Euphoria</i>] is so lovely to look at and the plot lines are so crazy that it got my brain going. That whole dynamic between [show characters] Rue and Jules—feeling like a burden in a relationship—is something that so many people go through if you have bad mental health. It was one of those moments where I was like, ‘Oh yeah, OK. I have an idea of something I want to write about now.’ That bassline is just such a good hook. It’s just a really strong opening. We’ve always been very bass-led, and it’s a familiar sound, so it’s a nice way to open.”\n\n<b>“Sickly Sweet”</b>\n“‘Sickly Sweet’ is that whole thing of repeating unhealthy patterns, maybe going back to something or someone, even though you know that it’s bad news. The line that sums it up the best is: ‘But I’m reliant on the nonsense.’ It’s like when you do things out of pure boredom and it’s completely stupid, but it’s just something you do. I love this one because it feels like a lot of ’90s records that I would’ve listened to. [We were aiming for] a Breeders-y kind of thing. That raw vocal is something that we don’t do that often, but was definitely necessary.”\n\n<b>“Where I Go”</b>\n“This was a really old one. I had never imagined it being on the album, to be honest. But a lot of other people and the rest the band were like, ‘It really does sound great,’ after we recorded it in Rockfield. I was very against it for a while but when the mix started sounding really cool, I was like, ‘OK, I’m comfortable with this.’ It’s an important song on the album because so much of it is like, ‘Meh, I hate myself,’ and this is like, ‘No, actually, fuck you to anyone who actually made me feel like shit.’ It’s a good moment, a good release of anger.”\n\n<b>“Change My Mind”</b>\n“‘Change My Mind,’ again, it’s that unhealthy pattern where you’re not really trying to be better and then that repeats [something] bad, whatever it is. The initial inspiration, sonically, was [2020 single] ‘Blue.’ We were like, ‘We need to do something that’s kind of like “Blue” because everyone loves “Blue” so much.’ And funnily enough, it is a similar theme, that kind of, ‘I’m bringing my partner down.’ I think it’s a nice, poppy moment on there.”\n\n<b>“In My Head”</b>\n“[May 2023’s single version] was recorded in Church Studios [in London] and we loved how it sounded, so we wanted to put it out, but then we actually ended up doing the album in Rockfield, so we did an album version of it. I love both.”\n\n<b>“Nosebleed”</b>\n“This was one that I wrote with Justin Parker [cowriter of Lana Del Rey’s ‘Video Games’]. It’s someone having a hold on you, a toxic relationship. It could be between friends, family, whatever. It’s that wanting to stay with that comfort even though it’s not necessarily good. But ‘Nosebleed’ was initially really high and really fast, and it was a really poppy song. I didn’t see it being on the album, but then we were doing preproduction with Chris Ryan and he was like, ‘I love this song so much. I really want to give it a go in Rockfield.’ And we were like, ‘OK, whatever. Let’s try slowing it down and making it lower,’ and then it clicked instantly. It was just like honey, just like a mushy, warm sound. I absolutely love it now.”\n\n<b>“Let Go”</b>\n“‘Let Go’ is way more about the instrumental and I guess I didn’t think that the vocal needed to be overly complicated, so there’s not a whole lot going on lyrically. I like that kind of swirling. It feels like you’re really stuck in something in that song. This and ‘White Ribbons’ are my two favorites on the album. I just love the chorus and the bridge and the guitars are so snarly. It’s sick.”\n\n<b>“Dream of Me”</b>\n“We wrote this in a session with a guy called Rob Brinkmann. I think we just had the chords. We brought it to Rob and he’s really excellent at structuring songs. The reference was actually ‘Waking Up in Vegas,’ the Katy Perry song. I guess it’s a lighter moment in the album because lyrically, as well, I’m not really saying anything profound. It’s just like, ‘Oh, when you like someone and they don’t really care about you,’ that’s it.”\n\n<b>“Nightmares”</b> \n“‘Nightmares’ was another song that I did with Justin and it was such a fun one to do because I went in with chords initially and we were layering it up. Then, when we had those little guitar harmonics, we were actually, ‘Just them by themselves sounds so sick.’ It was reminding me of Massive Attack and I thought that was a cool way to roll with it. So I love the electronic sounds in that song. ‘Nightmares,’ again, is that feeling of not wanting to like someone because you know it won’t work.”\n\n<b>“White Ribbons”</b>\n“It was very therapeutic to write and it feels like a more hopeful track on the album. We put our bodies through so much shit and they always fix us, and this is basically just a thank you [for that]. I actually don’t even know where it came from—one day I had that guitar line and vocals, and it’s a pretty line. I love the stripped-back moment and all the weird vocoder stuff.”\n\n<b>“Madra”</b>\n“‘Madra’ is really old now. It was a chord progression I was playing when we were in the studio in Belfast during <i>Banshee</i>. Once we got back from recording, we made the demo pretty quickly. We were sitting on that one for a while and we all loved it so much. The outro just felt so strong. It felt like such a cool ending, like a final scene. And all the bass licks and stuff, they’re just so sick. I feel like it sums up everything that is said in the album—about the highs and the lows and the repeating patterns.”","short":"“We never really imagined we’d make a rock record, but that’s how it ended up.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/97/1e/b3/971eb3fe-3c17-bd03-33bb-7fb108cc3f9d/5054197797248.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"a8b7c7","textColor2":"d5e5e8","textColor4":"aab7bb","textColor1":"d1e5f7","bgColor":"020106","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/madra/1705427545","playParams":{"id":"1705427545","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Z04cqirpWoJhEi9iovmqw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1705427545/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1504144626","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1504144626?l=en-US"}]}}},"1706440439":{"id":"1706440439","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1706440439?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/9a/29/63/9a29635d-dc6d-f314-9bcc-7da7be113201/57f080c3-0180-429f-9f8e-1de75ae4fe45.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bcc3c0","textColor2":"b1b9d0","textColor4":"9199ae","textColor1":"e7ede6","bgColor":"101b26","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/df/aa/53/dfaa531d-6e2e-e87e-a53f-2c53937a6e6c/ddaf6aa3-1e28-4df4-9ee3-ea5117015c7d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"8cbbce","textColor2":"7ed0f3","textColor4":"6db0cd","textColor1":"a5def4","bgColor":"273135","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/quarters-of-change/1310816782","name":"Portraits","artistName":"Quarters of Change","editorialNotes":{"short":"On their second album, the New York rockers leave it all on the field.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f3/6f/e9/f36fe9df-063a-2f0c-0707-82e7c807ff47/075679669520.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"93a6b3","textColor2":"87bfcf","textColor4":"6f9daa","textColor1":"b4cada","bgColor":"111717","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/portraits/1706440439","playParams":{"id":"1706440439","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5WdbJ8w1G6rY8SFkIW64DD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1706440439/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1310816782","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1310816782?l=en-US"}]}}},"1707184855":{"id":"1707184855","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1707184855?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c3/e4/72/c3e472d6-2617-af18-03e5-eabb5f367a04/7673fab5-bf08-4d2d-aae7-d5017003c706.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7947a","textColor2":"cbb4a9","textColor4":"a9978d","textColor1":"dcb091","bgColor":"23231c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/frank-carter-the-rattlesnakes/984599411","name":"Dark Rainbow","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/7b/a4/8b/7ba48b25-e1d1-4cc0-8d11-36b5fcc0be50/197189954115.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8bf9d","textColor2":"abd262","textColor4":"8bab50","textColor1":"e4edc2","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dark-rainbow/1707184855","playParams":{"id":"1707184855","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4pU6rQzlCfTrSxous1m7CK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1707184855/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"984599411","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/984599411?l=en-US"}]}}},"1707210808":{"id":"1707210808","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1707210808?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/01/74/67/017467bf-c4a1-42a6-7324-f6182c84d394/46ece65c-a57a-48f8-a7c5-f1cbb6310a6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d3c665","textColor2":"fbd769","textColor4":"d6bc60","textColor1":"f8e46f","bgColor":"40523e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ty-segall/435800519","name":"Three Bells","artistName":"Ty Segall","editorialNotes":{"short":"More like Psy-ch Segall, right?

Who Aren’t There Anymore","artistName":"Future Islands","editorialNotes":{"standard":"For Sam Herring, the lead singer of Baltimore’s indie mainstays Future Islands, the band’s seventh album <i>People Who Aren’t There Anymore</i> doesn’t fall neatly into the pre- or post-pandemic boxes. “The first half of the album was written within the pandemic,” he told Apple Music’s Hanuman Welch. “The second half was written after we did our first tour back. So this really elongated space with plenty of time to forget what we're going through, but still being in it. I think, collectively, the world is finally coming to terms with what happened between 2020 and 2022, and the sense of how much the world has changed.”\n\nGrappling with those profound changes partially made it into the band’s previous album, 2020’s <i>As Long As You Are</i>, but they come into sharper focus here. Herring mines the end of romantic relationships and the loss of friendships, and even parts ways with past iterations of himself that no longer serve a purpose, all while trying to balance the heft of grief with hard-won optimism. \n\nFirst single “The Tower” serves as a lynchpin between the two albums, bridging that era of what came before and what lies ahead. In true Future Islands fashion, the track fits into a familiar mythology for the band. “Within the Future Islands canon, it works perfectly, because so many songs of ours are at the sea, standing at the sea, having those thoughts,” Herring said. “I was separated from my partner, who was in Sweden, I was in the States, couldn't get back there, and I was just constantly fighting myself over that part of you that wants to give up. So it is a reflection of the past, and how we continue to still have those existential breakdowns, and these pivotal moments of our lives at the sea staring into the great gulf and hoping that someone's there.”","short":"The indie mainstays explore alienation and loss on their seventh LP.","tagline":"New Album and

Friday","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tom Odell","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I’ve always been slightly obsessive with songwriting,” Tom Odell tells Apple Music. “I hate the phrase, but I’ve always been a perfectionist. I will just keep working on it until I think it’s the best possible thing. But I think it can destroy work—it can suffocate it.” So for his sixth album, <i>Black Friday</i>, the British singer-songwriter went the opposite way, writing and recording raw, unvarnished tracks that often feel more like demos (there’s even one unfinished song here, “Getaway (voice note),” which cuts off abruptly after just 45 seconds). “The whole record was made with that kind of trust in the initial expression—just letting the album be a stroke of expression in this period of time,” says Odell. “Then, afterwards, not questioning or doubting what was said in that moment.” \n\nThese songs—mostly written and recorded in Odell’s “primitive” studio in East London between January and May 2023—are strikingly intimate and immediate, built with acoustic guitars, roomy pianos, haunting strings, and soft, delicate vocals. Listening to <i>Black Friday</i> feels almost like sitting next to Odell as he made it: You’ll catch, for example, him cracking up at the end of a song, listening in as his orchestra tunes up, or letting in the sound of birdsong. It takes confidence to create something so undone, but for Odell it’s about more than that. “There’s more truth sometimes in leaving things unfinished and imperfect, because it’s more of a reflection of what real life is,” he says. “I think the best art is that which reveals the tension in our lives between what’s right and wrong and what did happen and what should have happened. As artists, we just try as much as possible to reflect what is real. That’s the pursuit.” Read on as Odell takes us through his sixth album, track by track. \n\n<b>“Answer Phone”</b>\n“This was a song I started writing when I was 27 or 28. More and more, I find my ideas and the seeds of songs transcend time—quite often, I’ll draw upon an idea which wasn’t right for that time, but might feel right for this time, and then feels brand new. This is sort of a similar lyric to Arctic Monkeys’ ‘Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?’—calling the person you shouldn’t at 3am. I had a lot of fun writing the words. They’re quite humorous, quite tongue-in-cheek, and kind of tragic as well. It was one take, sat on the guitar, and then we built the track up around it very quickly.”\n\n<b>“Black Friday”</b>\n“I wrote this on my birthday in 2022, November 24, which is Black Friday most years, or sometime around that date. I chipped away at the words for a long time—it was a real labor of love and it was clear to me that the song was important. It felt like more than a song—occasionally you get [one of] those songs that comes along and there’s a richness to it, which inspires you to get it right. I think it’s more exposed, in a way, than the others. That note [at the end of track] is the top note I can sing—it takes a lot. It’s a morning note. You can’t do it in the afternoon, your voice has done too much by then.”\n\n<b>“Loving You Will Be the Death of Me”</b>\n“Again, the lyrics took a very long time. I wanted to be careful with them and say what I wanted to say. ‘Loving you will be the death of me’ is a phrase that had been in my notebook for a while. I found it quite compelling. I’d been reading this strange book, a Jungian take on William Blake’s <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>. A lot of it was about the death of the ego and I think that’s where the lyrics stem from. When you really love someone, you have this desire to destroy your ego. I liked the duality of that: It’s beautiful, but it’s also the toxicity of really loving someone. I was also thinking of Joy Division’s ‘Love Will Tear Us Apart.’ I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of love being tyrannical. I’m really, really proud of this song.”\n\n<b>“The Orchestra Tunes Up”</b>\n“Something that you always get when you record or work with an orchestra is them tuning up. It’s kind of amazingly tense and it’s an amazing sound. The orchestra take quite a lead role in the next song, ‘Spinning,’ so this intuitively felt right.”\n\n<b>“Spinning”</b>\n“It’s kind of a waltz. The lyric for me that stands out the most is, ‘You love me at my worst.’ That was very inspiring quite early on—it set a tone. So much of the album is about relationships, and relationships with one another, not necessarily romantic. I’m interested in the nuance of relationships and trying to explore that. At the time, I was very interested in how it can actually be the brokenness in one another that is what you are attracted to and what binds you together. I’m always searching for those lines that make me feel a slight sense of danger with them. That one gave me that.”\n\n<b>“The End of the Summer”</b>\n“I was inspired by the film <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>. I watched it over and over again and was just so struck by how nostalgic I found it and how it tapped into something so many of us have felt—when that first love cuts you so much and breaks you in a way that you think you are never going to recover from. And maybe you never do. This song has that beautiful orchestra—it was lovely to hear and record that.”\n\n<b>“The Orchestra Takes Flight”</b>\n“I liked the idea of the orchestra being this living, breathing entity. It feels to me that, in a way, it’s the devil on your shoulder and I really enjoyed using the orchestra in that way. We were trying to prep people’s ears for a melody they will hear later. It’s also the idea of this character sort of freeing themselves—or maybe trying to entice.”\n\n<b>“Somebody Else”</b>\n“The last song written for the album. We tried to do it once with the band and then it ended up me doing it just with the guitar and with the band coming in later. It’s quite a simple song, but it has a lot of tension in it. I really like it. I’ve been playing it over the summer [of 2023] and it felt so good to play—it feels a bit like a hymn or something.”\n\n<b>“Parties”</b>\n“This is strangely quite a trivial song, but also quite dark. The inspiration lyrically was ‘Sitting by the pool/With tears in our eyes/I don’t know why/I come to these parties anyway.’ The chorus is one that’d been knocking around for quite a long time—I think I even used to try it out at the occasional gig. The song became interesting to me when there was a sense of there being things not being said. There’s this immense amount of tension in the air of it. The lines, ‘Jump in the swimming pool/With all my clothes on/You ask me what is wrong/And I ignore you’—it’s kind of a weirdly anecdotal experience, but I spent quite a long time writing versions of that, which felt the most real to me. You jump in the swimming pool with your clothes on—and then there’s a sort of strange muted reaction both from someone else and then you. You don’t really acknowledge it and then it just sort of carries on. Again, there’s a slightly comical element to the song, but I was also attracted to the darkness of it.”\n\n<b>“The Orchestra is Feeling Tense”</b>\n“It feels like making the record to me. We live recorded the album and Laurie [Blundell, Odell’s producer] and I went through and collated all of the times we’d been rude to each other. It starts out quite polite and then there’s that, ‘Your phone’s on.’ It’s full of anguish, kind of like a hangover after a party with anxiety and regret and a sense of dread.”\n\n<b>“Nothing Hurts Like Love”</b>\n“This kind of song is a bit of catnip for me: I love a slightly overly dramatic love story. It’s also inspired by my love of ’70s films—it feels like a sort of Hal Ashby film or something, where two lovers meet up at a café somewhere outdoors. Again, there’s so much unsaid, there’s this feeling of a lump-in-your-throat kind of pain. This one broke my heart slightly—I just felt very close to it.” \n\n<b>“Getaway (voice note)”</b>\n“We enjoy being playful and it’s fun cutting tracks off because it catches your attention—maybe you listen to it again and you wonder why. This is just one of those songs that we did try to finish and couldn’t—we could never quite work it out. In a way, it was inspired by <i>The Godfather</i>. There was something kind of fun about it and I liked the tension it created. It’s funny, whenever I sent the album to anyone [before it was released], they always brought up this one and said the song was corrupted or something. It really fucks with people’s heads!”\n\n<b>“The End”</b>\n“It was interesting that this song isn’t trying to tie up loose ends—even though it’s called ‘The End.’ I guess it asked the question: What does the end even mean? As one gets older, you have so many relationships and friendships with friends and family and lovers and colleagues, and as times passes by, there are more and more people that will naturally get left behind in your wake. They go one way, you go the other. But I’m fascinated by that in the sense that it doesn’t necessarily mean your feelings change. Life, I increasingly find, is full of fragments of impressions you’ve made on people that then come back to you—and you get this amazing time capsule back to another time or another version of yourself. It’s a very sentimental song.”","short":"“There’s truth in leaving things imperfect—it’s a reflection of real life.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/48/93/85/48938501-ee2b-477a-1f64-45feb9e938dd/00196922645136_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"2d2d2b","textColor2":"2a2b27","textColor4":"4a4a46","textColor1":"070706","bgColor":"c7c8c2","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-friday/1710654900","playParams":{"id":"1710654900","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0g5N9f6FpdYuON9ahdmu5n"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1710654900/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"524929515","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/524929515?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711048439":{"id":"1711048439","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711048439?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b9/af/be/b9afbe8d-adaf-6f9a-dc53-918bcc33bb5c/f1b0175b-fa49-40fc-804c-503ea319d029.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0a7a8","textColor2":"e5987b","textColor4":"ba7d6a","textColor1":"d9cdc9","bgColor":"0d0f24","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/46/3e/3f/463e3fb9-3b6f-8099-0bef-772bab2817be/959fa874-c6c5-47ab-a32a-7e4782e5afb2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d9d8d6","textColor2":"efefee","textColor4":"d3d2cf","textColor1":"f7f7f6","bgColor":"625f56","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/randall-king/411955702","name":"Into The Neon","artistName":"Randall King","artwork":{"width":3900,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/78/b9/ed/78b9ed8b-f43d-9ed9-97c5-a19759b956ab/093624850335.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3900,"textColor3":"a59f89","textColor2":"cdac9d","textColor4":"a4897e","textColor1":"cec7ab","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/into-the-neon/1711048439","playParams":{"id":"1711048439","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4x2LrG46EWrM6jkCie0YuU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711048439/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"411955702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/411955702?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711359135":{"id":"1711359135","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711359135?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/ae/31/27/ae3127b7-fb2b-e455-f744-d78b823ea894/Job31058f32-78b7-45d8-b711-d1dfe9733ca1-159524636-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_307646778_1627119315-Time1701695454215.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d5e3f4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"161001"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"dcc9cb","textColor2":"d5e3f4","textColor4":"cac5c6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"161001","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/a6/c3/47/a6c34788-20ff-89ce-9ea9-a472e3d32a9b/f1bc0d59-d49d-495b-94f7-a89dcfc7586f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b19a98","textColor2":"d8aea1","textColor4":"b08e84","textColor1":"dabdba","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/5e/e7/79/5ee7797f-e193-6791-4f30-0cd9a468ce9e/Job814b58c3-e6bc-4f54-90a1-90295dd9e638-159524635-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_307646779_1627119314-Time1701693936295.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"e5daca","textColor2":"fde8e2","textColor4":"ebc9b5","textColor1":"f6fcfc","bgColor":"a14f04","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/a0/84/dd/a084ddf8-0842-d528-cbae-6a66e3532cdd/66a45067-9eb4-42ce-bbd5-a641cfeba2c1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"29190b","textColor2":"060405","textColor4":"29190e","textColor1":"060302","bgColor":"b86f30","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/19/67/65/196765b9-f966-38e8-091c-6491b5bda27d/5e8eb88f-dfe7-43d8-a96f-9a02fdb5d279.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8491ae","textColor2":"8aa1d1","textColor4":"7184aa","textColor1":"a1b1d6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-smile/1603491177","name":"Wall of Eyes","artistName":"The Smile","editorialNotes":{"standard":"The Smile, a trio featuring Radiohead prime movers Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood along with ex-Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner, sounds more like a proper band than a side project on their second album. Sure, they’re a proper band that unavoidably sounds a <i>lot</i> like Radiohead, but with some notable distinctions—much leaner arrangements, bass parts by Greenwood and Yorke with a very different character from what Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood might have laid down, and a formal fixation on conveying tension in their melodies and rhythms. \n\nTheir debut, <i>A Light for Attracting Attention</i>, was full of tight, wrenching grooves and guitar parts that sounded as though the strings were coiling into knots. This time around they head in the opposite direction, loosening up to the point that the music often feels extremely light and airy. The guitar in the first half of “Bending Hectic” is so delicate and minimal that it sounds like it could get blown away with a slight breeze, while the warm and lightly jazzy “Friend of a Friend” feels like it’s helplessly pushed and pulled along by strong, unpredictable winds. The loping rhythm and twitchy riffs in “Read the Room” are surrounded by so much negative space that it sounds eerily hollow, like Yorke is singing through the skeletal remains of a ’70s metal song.\n \nThere are some surprises along the way, too. A few songs veer into floaty lullaby sections, and more than half include orchestral tangents that recall Greenwood’s film score work for Paul Thomas Anderson and Jane Campion. The most unexpected moment comes at the climax of “Bending Hectic,” which bursts into heavy grunge guitar, stomping percussion, and soaring vocals. Most anyone would have assumed Yorke and Greenwood had abandoned this type of catharsis sometime during the Clinton administration, but as it turns out they were just waiting for the right time to deploy it.

The opening track of his debut full-length record is a lively encapsulation of this ethos, with bluegrass-tinged harmonies and quick-fire picking. Smith still leaves plenty of room for pop and rock influences, though, as on the brooding “Take It Slow” and the viral hit “I Hate Alabama,” a clever and catchy song that turns the cult of SEC football into a fresh take on heartbreak. Another highlight is the tender Hailey Whitters duet “Roulette on the Heart,” a coming-together with another of the genre’s more creative young stylists.","short":"The singer-songwriter helps revive

attire. No, it’s not the latest David Lynch joint, but the extended cinematic universe of <i>All Is Yellow</i>: the first compilation album curated by Cole Bennett, the 27-year-old director and founder of Lyrical Lemonade, the company behind a decent chunk of the last decade’s viral rap videos. (Naturally, a music video accompanies each of the 14 tracks; not the easiest feat for a project with 34 featured guests.) The album functions as a handy primer for anyone who’s slept through the last 10 years of hip-hop zeitgeist, from angsty drill to “mumble rap” to the gloriously incoherent fractal that is rap in 2024. \n\nHere, absurdist Detroit scam-rappers trade bars with solemn Chicago drill vets (BabyTron and G Herbo on “Equilibrium”) and two generations of melancholy balladeers find common ground (Kid Cudi and Lil Durk on “Guitar in My Room”). True to Lyrical Lemonade form, Easter eggs abound: After the late Juice WRLD and Cordae join forces on “Doomsday” for a shockingly great impression of Eminem circa ’99, the real Slim Shady shows up for round two. And on “First Night,” verses from Juicy J and Teezo Touchdown are capped off by a blissed-out “birds and bees” monologue from Lil B the Based God.","short":"An audiovisual primer for the past decade of hip-hop.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/0a/5b/33/0a5b33f7-d1a2-cdc6-9972-6455005572a5/23UM1IM60882.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"302000","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor4":"483818","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f1a101","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-is-yellow/1719359340","playParams":{"id":"1719359340","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4NGIX0BP6xxRaGh64hhJhe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1719359340/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1693493027","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1693493027?l=en-US"}]}}},"1720038043":{"id":"1720038043","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720038043?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/31/3a/6f/313a6f43-4233-806d-c5fa-d767799de76a/Job01267be0-c483-4e81-98ba-27afbb407831-161996842-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_313312480_1668996174-Time1706233480621.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"62523d","textColor2":"3a2b18","textColor4":"625241","textColor1":"3b2a13","bgColor":"fff2e3","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/f3/98/66f39810-565d-7efa-f016-9e4b3e55c80a/a8bb9cbe-c33a-4361-a4b2-69d4495d9863.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d4bc89","textColor2":"dad3b3","textColor4":"bdb597","textColor1":"f6dba1","bgColor":"493e28","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/79/99/1b/79991bdb-9fcf-df69-d793-399b48edb828/Job46dcfe43-5aa2-431c-b0a6-f27b5567fd4f-161952869-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_313200589_1668203333-Time1706173084832.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"55473b","textColor2":"342311","textColor4":"5c4d3b","textColor1":"2b1c11","bgColor":"fff4e3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/60/f0/43/60f04312-adf7-e9e2-5e67-88b81e9a5b51/839555f8-2aa7-4e56-8b08-e5f9717adb23.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"352b26","textColor2":"2d1809","textColor4":"483526","textColor1":"150c09","bgColor":"b5a99a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/89/f5/73/89f5733e-b8b9-510b-26e5-35b4798f9889/c008b4e9-9f2d-44b7-9bfe-c5c4939d4a10.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"332e2c","textColor2":"372d26","textColor4":"5c5147","textColor1":"040204","bgColor":"f1e0cd","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/benny-the-butcher/1281676587","name":"Everybody Can't Go","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Benny the Butcher","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Anyone thinking Benny the Butcher signing to Def Jam would inspire him to be more “mainstream” or “pop” is underestimating his intelligence. Steady, talented, 39 years old and relatively unknown until he was in his early thirties, he’s already a voice of reason and maturity for his fans in a world of hype. He doesn’t have to crack the mainstream; signing to Def Jam is proof that all this gritty, soul-sampling, old-school stuff might still have a place in the mainstream after all. \n\nHighlights on this Alchemist- and Hit-Boy-produced album include “TMVTL” (threatening), “Pillow Talk & Slander” (celebratory), and a title track where he admittedly does open a little space for something like a “commercial” hook, courtesy of Kyle Banks. He’s safer and more up-the-middle than his Griselda affiliate Westside Gunn (note the passing reference to watching MSNBC), but in that quiet confidence lie the fruits of his fabled grind.

The ethereal, almost otherworldly sound that dominated those early projects of hers seeps subtly into this, her second major-label venture. Yet as 2021’s <i>Warm Up</i> and her recent features with KAROL G and NICKI NICOLE made clear, her artistic evolution remains very much underway. Indeed, after the soothing drift of <i>La Joia</i>’s intro, the progression from the Myke Towers team-up “Mi Lova” through “Give Me” and “Bota Niña” with Anitta offers a more expansive application of her augmented approach, one now fused with commercial reggaetón and polyrhythmic pop forms. With a voice as digitally dreamlike as ever, her shimmer now comes with more swag, evident on “Perdió Este Culo” and the femme-forward “Chulo Pt. 2” with Tokischa and Young Miko.","short":"Spain’s

Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 54 & Bruckner: Symphony No. 4 in E-Flat Major","artistName":"Vienna Philharmonic, Martha Argerich & Zubin Mehta","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Full-blooded Romanticism takes center stage in this exclusive Vienna Philharmonic album, recorded live at the city’s Musikverein in September 2022. Martha Argerich brings sensitivity and passion to Robert Schumann’s A minor Piano Concerto, while the Vienna Philharmonic, under Zubin Mehta’s thrilling direction, performs Austrian composer Anton Bruckner’s homage to nature, the “Romantic” Symphony No. 4. \n\nSchumann’s Piano Concerto, completed in 1845, may not be the most virtuosic of the great warhorses, but it is certainly one of the most lyrical and melodically rich, with a beautifully crafted dialogue between piano and orchestra sustained throughout the work. This is a concerto that looks back to Beethoven, but also forward to Brahms whose Second Piano Concerto also has equal weight on soloist and orchestra. In the opening bars, Argerich thunders forth, leading to the tender opening theme, which she plays with scintillating control while eliciting a bell-like tone from the piano. \n\nThis is a typically thrilling and engaging performance from the Argentine pianist, leading the orchestra from the front, while conscious of the work’s chamber qualities as she blends and weaves her sound in and out of the orchestral textures. “Martha Argerich is one of my favorite artists because she’s not so much playing the piano—she is just pure music,” Christoph Wimmer, one of the Vienna Philharmonic’s principal double-bass players, tells Apple Music Classical. “Music flows out of all of her body, and it’s just magic. Her playing is what I would call completely effortless.”\n\nWhen Bruckner named his Symphony No. 4 the “Romantic,” he was referring to the Romanticism of the Austrian countryside rather than anything overtly heroic. As Wimmer says, the opening movement “doesn’t start with a big bang, but rather a really soft tremolo in the strings. Then a single principal horn starts with a melody, and then a very long increase in tension, in color and in volume. And only after two minutes do we have the first climax.” Bruckner’s countryside is one of Alpine heights and lush foothills, punctuated by the call of the hunting horn and the triplet rhythms of the Ländler, a traditional Austrian dance. \n\nAs if to highlight the mountainous terrain, Bruckner takes us to awesome heights in the slow movement, delaying the summit until two thirds of the way in. In the final movement, he creates one of the most breathtaking conclusions to any symphony he wrote. Conductor Zubin Mehta realizes Bruckner’s vision, conjuring awesome sonic contrasts between prayerlike calm and incredible forces of crackling energy.\n\nListen to the final two tracks of this album to enjoy Christoph Wimmer’s commentary on this wonderful concert.","short":"Dazzling and daring performances of two major Romantic works.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/60/67/e5/6067e579-b8c5-df1a-dff2-38d2f3cee4f3/5059449157795.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3400,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"27225e","textColor4":"524e7e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/schumann-piano-concerto-in-a-minor-op-54-bruckner/1722636734","playParams":{"id":"1722636734","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0CjRmvLs8eDLbAQ89nlwtl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1722636734/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2355964","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2355964?l=en-US"},{"id":"319607","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/319607?l=en-US"},{"id":"77857","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/77857?l=en-US"}]}}},"1723918706":{"id":"1723918706","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1723918706?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/50/dc/b850dca5-349c-06a9-d2c2-75f5025ccae6/1e4c9ac5-0285-48e7-acf4-c9c6973b5c51.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbb2ad","textColor2":"d3b797","textColor4":"ad977d","textColor1":"e4dad3","bgColor":"161414","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/militarie-gun/1529039426","name":"Life Under The Sun - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Militarie Gun","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/98/17/4b/98174b99-72d7-c7df-9725-dc05594d2cc0/23CRGIM41049.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3d3a0e","textColor2":"121012","textColor4":"3e3910","textColor1":"10100f","bgColor":"f1e00c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/life-under-the-sun-ep/1723918706","playParams":{"id":"1723918706","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1723918706/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1529039426","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1529039426?l=en-US"}]}}},"1723932647":{"id":"1723932647","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1723932647?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-01-22","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/79/fa/5c/79fa5c89-8ba7-6982-8b58-e04a8eb76517/c5056c21-0ee6-4ad2-9474-efe26d90974f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8b3cf","textColor2":"9fbfd8","textColor4":"8ca6ba","textColor1":"c2d0f2","bgColor":"3f4342","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/9c/16/43/9c16435f-dc85-a6ac-7b33-309c90ba4ecb/85d70ae0-4493-492d-bb10-e8f89adbcb56.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"2d3034","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"393939","textColor1":"070c11","bgColor":"c2c2c2","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/ac/ed/12/aced12f1-2ed5-500d-e955-30fd0126db30/6deebfda-a3af-4a24-b97b-9468b477fbfc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c0c4","textColor2":"9cb2ea","textColor4":"889bc7","textColor1":"e3e1e7","bgColor":"3a3d3c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tws/1721226191","name":"TWS 1st Mini Album 'Sparkling Blue' - EP","artistName":"TWS","editorialNotes":{"standard":"HYBE’s first debut project of 2024, Pledis Entertainment rookies TWS break onto the K-pop scene with <i>Sparkling Blue</i>, a mini album declaring the sextet’s youthful, melodic intentions. The group refers to their musical genre as “boyhood pop,” and it’s explored in <i>Sparkling Blue</i> across five bubbly pop tracks that chronicle typical teenage experiences through an upbeat lens.\n\nIn lead single “plot twist” (titled “첫 만남은 계획대로 되지 않아,” or “the first meeting didn’t go as planned,” for Korean listeners), young members Shinyu, Dohoon, Youngjae, Hanjin, Jihoon, and Kyungmin psych themselves up to meet a crush: “Feeling so good, the D-day I’ve been waiting for/Gotta wave my hand just like I practiced/Check my hairstyle and turn around.” The brief, bright-eyed bop’s pre-chorus countdown hook—“Three, two, one”—works particularly well for a group’s debut song.\n\nEnglish-language track “unplugged boy” best exemplifies the meaning behind TWS’s name, which stands for “Twenty Four Seven With Us” (“Let’s play it loud tonight, yeah/I’m with you, when I’m not/We face it all together”), while groovy “first hooky” uses hooky harmonies to confess “Maybe I really wanna kick it with ya.” \n\nWhile “BFF” focuses on the friendship between the members (“If we synchronize, it’s so special/Our own victory”), playful pre-release single “Oh Mymy : 7s” offers up a first chapter to TWS’s story as a group: “The two of us become three, then four/Our name keeps getting bigger/Yeah, we choose our own speed/We don’t like cliché.”","short":"Five bubbly tracks that introduce the group’s “boyhood pop.”","tagline":"New Mini Album"},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c4/d6/e6/c4d6e6cc-b5dc-8ddf-34cd-bf11b33cc1e1/196922759543_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"344f6e","textColor2":"0d2653","textColor4":"3e5175","textColor1":"01234a","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tws-1st-mini-album-sparkling-blue-ep/1723932647","playParams":{"id":"1723932647","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1723932647/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1721226191","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1721226191?l=en-US"}]}}},"1724178669":{"id":"1724178669","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724178669?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-01-26","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hilit-kolet/779525324","name":"Hot Mess - Single","artistName":"Hilit Kolet","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/b2/6e/dd/b26edd20-26fc-af27-fbd0-7e1cb7c2f39c/dj.hcpubxkt.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cac3a3","textColor2":"f1e8d1","textColor4":"c1baa8","textColor1":"fcf4cc","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hot-mess-single/1724178669","playParams":{"id":"1724178669","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724178669/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"779525324","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/779525324?l=en-US"}]}}},"1724208139":{"id":"1724208139","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724208139?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-01-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/29/c9/15/29c91567-3f69-2cbd-5858-78d2469005a9/79cb6183-15f1-45d6-a92f-efadbdb400df.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b39181","textColor2":"de9e88","textColor4":"b27e6c","textColor1":"dfb5a1","bgColor":"010200","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/b4/7e/60/b47e607d-f61c-7f29-7e48-ff0d4e4b20a4/d76fb9b6-d1c8-4c4b-825a-77f3ee12833c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"bfb5ad","textColor2":"9fb6dc","textColor4":"889fc4","textColor1":"e3d1c0","bgColor":"304262","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/c7/54/9d/c7549d0d-187c-1178-00df-563076ef30ff/fc8d9c79-3d4c-4096-a637-209648c8cf41.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b78a7c","textColor2":"d59f8d","textColor4":"ae8374","textColor1":"e1a896","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blessd/1481245915","name":"SI SABE","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Blessd","editorialNotes":{"standard":"On 2021’s <i>Hecho En Medellín</i>, Colombian artist Blessd left no question about where he came from and where he wanted to go. Fulfilling the promise of his early Maluma cosign, in subsequent years he grew his fanbase with strong singles such as “Tendencia Global” with Myke Towers and by working frequently with now-ubiquitous producer Ovy on the Drums. All of this makes the arrival of <i>SI SABE</i> a momentous occasion in Latin music, the IYKYK implications of its title as direct as can be. \n\nHere, he comes into his own, comfortable with his development as an artist and bolstered by guests including Ryan Castro, Bryant Myers, and Sky Rompiendo. You can hear how his wins have paid off for him, just on the strength of dynamic reggaetón moments like “MAS RARO” and “NADA QUE DECIR.” Collaborative cuts “OJOS AZULES” with Peso Pluma and “SI SABE FERXXO” opposite Feid align their star power, respectively, with his. Blessd rightfully closes things out in grand fashion with the posse cut “A2P,” a nearly seven-minute Foreign Teck production with bars from the multinational likes of NLE Choppa, Pirlo, Neutro Shorty,
