the Devil occupies a space all his own in alternative roots music. The South Florida-bred singer-songwriter, also known as Danny Kiranos, writes densely narrative and allusion-rich songs that reward repeated listens, with an uncategorizable sound that lands somewhere between Lucero and Leonard Cohen. Following 2021’s critically acclaimed <i>Born Against</i>, <i>Yours Until the War Is Over</i> is a showcase for Kiranos’ storytelling: He shows it off on the rough and rowdy “Once Upon a Time at Texaco pt. 1,” which spins a tense but humorous yarn about going out for a bottle of tequila, and the addict’s lament “Cannibal Within,” which boasts the caustic lyric, “I just don’t wanna blow my brains out to ‘Hotel California.’” Kiranos serves these stories with a careful balance of theatrical bombast and folksy plainspokenness, finding and amplifying the tension in between. For those who enjoy literature with their music, or just dig the guttural growls, Amigo the Devil is a friend to all.","short":"Danny Kiranos’ third album is a showcase for his storytelling.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yours-until-the-war-is-over/1709513785","playParams":{"id":"1709513785","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Uf2ioZXjv71usXs8NZZ7M"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1709513785/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"398046580","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/398046580?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711311733":{"id":"1711311733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711311733?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hurray-for-the-riff-raff/301631355","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/94/c2/62/94c26209-a518-aef5-380e-4150d59c79e7/Job6af7715e-37e7-44ab-a51a-e0ffefdd319c-159257288-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_307049312_1622298770-Time1701203815815.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"323233","textColor2":"1a1412","textColor4":"393838","textColor1":"100d0c","bgColor":"b8c7d1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/de/ae/43/deae43ee-8007-d907-a5fa-13ed6d0126f4/Job10b4a88d-0346-4c40-be32-a0381dcab28a-157939949-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_303678937_1596700095-Time1698711443946.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d3d1cf","textColor2":"c2dbf0","textColor4":"a4b5c4","textColor1":"fdfffe","bgColor":"2c1c17","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Past Is Still Alive","artistName":"Hurray for the Riff Raff","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/bf/6f/53/bf6f53a7-b5fb-8f1a-46d2-23508e8b9a68/075597902600.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcbc9","textColor2":"d0e3ec","textColor4":"aeb9be","textColor1":"f7f8fa","bgColor":"251406","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-past-is-still-alive/1711311733","playParams":{"id":"1711311733","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5swrwkZivdtPxSHAuQvrOE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711311733/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"301631355","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/301631355?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711646500":{"id":"1711646500","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711646500?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mgmt/251553551","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/61/3d/7d/613d7db5-c39a-1753-758c-e6ad6744d91e/d4087255-a8c8-4e5d-b79a-f068f52e380d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1399ac","textColor2":"10b7e4","textColor4":"1096ba","textColor1":"13bbd3","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/90/f8/45/90f84516-a1be-3be1-1d8b-b5e164b64e6f/cabe5b86-a247-44df-b1f2-b458c3890b48.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"0cc4b6","textColor2":"28cac6","textColor4":"27a2a4","textColor1":"07f4dc","bgColor":"21031f","hasP3":false}},"name":"Loss Of Life","artistName":"MGMT","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/93/d1/3d/93d13de2-4772-c990-77e1-a9b5009a6064/810090094113.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9f9d9e","textColor2":"f5a432","textColor4":"c48328","textColor1":"c7c4c6","bgColor":"010000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"When MGMT emerged in 2007 with “Time to Pretend”—a euphoric shooting star of a song that soundtracked every house party and HBO show for the next several years—the synth-pop duo, just out of college, became rock stars overnight. They were big in every sense: a major-label deal, a tour with Radiohead, a reputation for rock shows that felt like raves. But Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser never seemed wholly comfortable with their popularity, and their subsequent albums were far more eccentric and experimental. Then, during the pandemic, the band found themselves back in the spotlight for a reason nobody saw coming: One of their tracks blew up on TikTok.\n\nThe sudden, explosive virality of “Little Dark Age,” a foreboding, vaguely political track from their 2018 album of the same name, took both men, now in their forties, by total surprise. And yet, when they began writing their fifth album a few months later, they found themselves circling themes of reinvention and rebirth. <i>Loss of Life</i> is, despite its title, openhearted and hopeful, and sheds some of the fussy self-seriousness that weighed down their recent records. The arrangements are streamlined. The melodies can breathe. The hooks stick. It isn’t that the band has reverted back to its high-flying, imperious roots; these songs have an emotional sincerity that you just didn’t get on “Electric Feel.” Rather, it feels like a weight has been lifted. Certain moments, like the Christine and the Queens duet “Dancing in Babylon,” even sound like surrender.\n\nThe album was co-produced by longtime collaborators Patrick Wimberly and Dave Fridmann with additional support from Oneohtrix Point Never. The latter is often cited as someone who takes a curatorial approach to production, and <i>Loss of Life</i> asks a lot of big questions about what, ultimately, makes art good. Does it need to be serious to be taken seriously? Is optimism allowed? Tender lullabies like “Phradie’s Song,” the Simon & Garfunkel-esque “Nothing to Declare,” and the twinkling title track—one of those sweeping, distorted psychedelic numbers that feels designed for exploring spiritual frontiers—suggest that MGMT’s answers have softened with age. “Who knows how the painting will look in the morning/When the day is born and life is ending?” VanWyngarden sings on “Loss of Life.” The subtext, if we may: Our time here is short. What matters is that you paint.","short":"The pioneering indie band returns, wonderstruck and better than ever.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loss-of-life/1711646500","playParams":{"id":"1711646500","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4dJvBAUQOaaCpRqsECRooa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711646500/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"251553551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/251553551?l=en-US"}]}}},"1711778190":{"id":"1711778190","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1711778190?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/allie-x/833547075","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Girl With No Face","artistName":"Allie X","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/f7/55/f8/f755f8c6-d48a-682f-4f8a-d6bf2168cce0/197190189131.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ead1c6","textColor2":"fbf0f4","textColor4":"eacbcc","textColor1":"fbf7ed","bgColor":"a6382b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I live in a weird world,” Allie X declares at the start of her third album, but really, it’s a line she could’ve sung at any point in her career to date. Though her penchant for electropop earworms has put her in the writers’ room for major artists like BTS and Troye Sivan, the chameleonic LA-based singer/producer has always a harbored the soul of a misfit, an outsider identity cultivated by a lifetime battle with an autoimmune illness and her formative years in Toronto’s late-2000s indie-rock scene. Allie’s semi-autobiographical 2020 album, <i>Cape God</i>, was a testament to her alt/pop-crossover savvy, pulling in guest features from Sivan and Mitski and contributions from songwriting pros like Simon Wilcox and JP Saxe. But <i>Girl With No Face</i> is all Allie: During the pandemic, Allie was forced to go the DIY route behind the boards—a steep learning curve that accounts for the album’s nearly four-year gestation. \n\nBut within those technical limitations, she found the freedom to be her truest self—<i>Girl With No Face</i> is an in-your-face hit of futurist pop informed by the icy synthscapes of Kraftwerk and post-goth textures of New Order as much as the empowering dance-tent anthems of Madonna and Lady Gaga. “This is probably the most cohesive thing that I've done,” Allie tells Apple Music. “It just happened naturally, because it was only me, and it was only my taste. I definitely was intentional about this sound—it sort of became an antidote to a lot of the commercial pop world that I literally live inside of in Los Angeles. So this is where I've been musically, just loving that UK post-punk spirit of the early ’80s a few years now. I just can't get enough of it.” Here, Allie X peels back the layers on <i>Girl With No Face</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Weird World”</b>\n“This was written at the beginning of the pandemic, when there was this uncertainty and dystopian feeling that I think everybody had. But I was also coming to terms with the reality of my career. The <i>Cape God</i> period had been so busy and then it all just came to a halt very quickly, so I was able to look under the hood of the car and realize everything was very tangled and twisted and not sustainable. So 'Weird World' sort of coincided with this decision I made to make a lot of changes and transitions both creatively and within my business. The 'weird world' is this idea of seeing things as they actually are, and how that can actually be an empowering moment, even though it's a sad moment.”\n\n<b>“Girl With No Face”</b>\n“I've been trying to figure out who this song is about. It just flowed sort of through me when I co-wrote it with my partner, George Pimentel. I got a sense that she was like this sort of vengeful figure who's maybe kind of witty. But now I think of 'the girl with no face' as this presence that emerged as I was alone in a room for years writing this record. She’s like this layer of myself, or this ghost or this voice in the room with me that could be heard but not seen, and she gave me the strength and the aggression that I needed to get through this project. She’s my invisible muse—my cunty muse!”\n\n<b>“Off With Her Tits”</b>\n“It's hard for me to get too in detail on this one, because I just like this song to speak for itself. The best thing I can say about the song is that it’s a ridiculous satirization of torturous thoughts, where I felt like I could take some power back by just making fun of them.”\n\n<b>“John and Jonathan”</b>\n“I was at a fan meet-and-greet in New York in 2018, and two fans came up and were like, 'Hi, I'm John, and this is my boyfriend, Jonathan. We love your music!' And I was like, ‘Wait—your names are John and Jonathan? Okay, I gotta write a song called “John and Jonathan”!’ I was on a walk in [the Toronto suburb of] Oakville near my parents’ house with my boyfriend, and I remember being on a pier and it just came to me: 'John and Jonathan/Are on the town.' I got so excited and went back home and just started recording right away. I've written so many of my most successful songs in Oakville at my parents' dining room table.”\n\n<b>“Galina”</b>\n“I have really bad eczema in my inner elbows, and I found this Russian lady named Galina at this naturopathic clinic in Toronto. For years, she made me this cream in her kitchen that worked better than steroids. She would always say, 'It cost me more to make this than I'm charging you. I get this man in the Swiss Alps to gather these herbs and I make you this cream.' She was pretty old, so I always worried: 'What happens when Galina retires? It's not like this is some patented product.' So sure enough, in the summer of 2022, I returned to the clinic, and I was like, 'Could I place an order for the cream from Galina?' And the lady was like, 'Oh, Galina has retired.' And I was like, ‘What!?! Did she tell anyone the recipe?' And she was like, 'No, she won't tell. There's nothing we can do—Galina has lost her memory.' So the song is about somebody that you've come to rely on who just coldly leaves your life without something that you need.”\n\n<b>“Hardware Software”</b>\n“This was not something I thought about intentionally, I just sort of improvised it. And I imagine those words came out because I had been spending so much time in front of a computer. I just remember doing that silly rap and cracking myself up, by myself.”\n\n<b>“Black Eye”</b>\n“I've never dealt with physical domestic abuse; my abuse comes more from just the way that I treat myself and my own body. I always feel like I'm almost willing to throw myself out of a building for the sake of art or for the sake of my career. That's what this song is about: my life experience of having a body that is quite fragile. It's not supposed to do a lot of the stuff that I make it do. There's all this stress and all these physical challenges that I subjected myself to over and over. So 'Black Eye' is about how it almost starts to feel natural doing that. And it starts to feel like a high—and that's when it gets really scary, when these things that are definitely bad for you start to feel good in a way. But there's also wit in those lyrics and in the idea of, like, ‘Yeah, bring it on.’”\n\n<b>“You Slept on Me”</b>\n“This song was inspired by a tweet that I've seen over and over throughout my career: ‘Y’all are sleeping on Allie X.’ So I thought I'd just have a bit of fun with that.”\n\n<b>“Saddest Smile”</b>\n“I think I'm commenting on my tendency to be melancholic, and the idea that if there isn't some pain behind a smile, I don't believe it. Like, I don't believe it in myself, and I don't believe it in others. Unfortunately, I believe in the struggle—that's so deeply ingrained in me. I have this core belief that things aren't worth it unless there was some painful journey to get there. It's a belief that I'd like to get rid of—I've discussed it in therapy. It's very strong in me.”\n\n<b>“Staying Power”</b>\n“I wrote this after having a really rough year, health-wise. 'Staying Power' is an acknowledgment of my superpower as I see it, which is a really high pain tolerance. It's very direct and very sarcastic. This feels like me having a conversation with someone that I'm really close and comfortable with.”\n\n<b>“Truly Dreams”</b>\n“This was a co-write with my partner, and it has a funk in there that wouldn't have been there if I had written it myself. So because of the bounciness of the song, I just went to this more optimistic disco kind of place. I always had drag queens in mind when I wrote this. I really relate to drag queens, and this idea that we can put on our look and get out there and live our fantasy. Like ‘Staying Power,’ it's a perseverance song, but in a more fantastical way.”","short":"In-your-face futurist pop with an ’80s post-punk spirit.

But her hush also channels Aaliyah, whose less-is-more cool de Casier studied on MTV as a kid in Denmark, escaping into the vibey neo-soul and bleeding-edge R&B of the ’90s and 2000s. With 2019’s <i>Essentials</i> and 2021’s <i>Sensational</i>, de Casier proved herself a dazzling new voice in R&B and electronic music, forging her own lane on the over-crowded highway of Y2K revivalism with songs like “Polite”: lush, sexy, and playful, with idiosyncratic one-liners that stuck in your craw. (“I took you on a date in a restaurant/Then you’re rude to the waiter/Like, what is up?”)\n\nOn her third album, de Casier drifts towards clarity through the haze of heartbreak, slipping between sultriness and sadness, reverie and real life. “Lucky” embodies the best of early-aughts pop sweetness with its gentle 2-step shuffle, and on the elegant crush anthem “Test It,” she splits her time between fantasy and reality: “Nine to five, I’m at yours at six/Work, you, sleep and repeat, that’s it.” For the first time, de Casier welcomes outside voices into the mix, recruiting dance-floor singer Shygirl on the bratty “Ex-Girlfriend” and Tampa rap duo They Hate Change for “ice,” a pitch-perfect time capsule of late-’90s scorn. The veil of romance lifts, and drudgery creeps in: On “My Day Off,” she sighs, the laundry’s not going to do itself. But even outside the bubble of love, the world of <i>Still</i> is alive with understated magic, as dreams bleed into reality and the natural landscape crackles with sensuality: On “Home Alone,” she murmurs, “I’m coming up for air from beneath the sea/And when I reach the sky, will you come with me?” \n","short":"A unique voice in R&B pushes herself further into the void.","tagline":"New Album"},"playParams":{"id":"1712085894","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/still/1712085894","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7ArSPwsw4Su6nyeId06SZH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712085894/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1280654807","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1280654807?l=en-US"}]}}},"1712141356":{"id":"1712141356","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712141356?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mick-mars/26234627","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features126/v4/a1/d2/3b/a1d23b5b-7dff-fbed-32a0-8b0839eee312/313f1f73-1d3d-4bbe-a374-c44f7c00fcf4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cfcecf","textColor2":"eaeaea","textColor4":"cfcecf","textColor1":"eaeaea","bgColor":"626162","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Other Side of Mars","artistName":"Mick Mars","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/fb/8e/95/fb8e958d-c4ff-ac4c-4f53-c043b4cdaf2b/197190156836.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"d5d5d5","textColor4":"adadad","textColor1":"efefef","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1712141356","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-other-side-of-mars/1712141356","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5TRAaDkZZtOWzxHMd3A7Xy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712141356/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"26234627","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/26234627?l=en-US"}]}}},"1713723916":{"id":"1713723916","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1713723916?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/real-estate/258003534","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/66/60/0a/66600abc-0aab-de6a-f9d1-0dde6fd83203/Jobc7813edd-3bb3-48a2-92b4-1d11fa185eec-159586275-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_307788233_1628202605-Time1701787641676.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","bfe7e8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b3bdb9","textColor2":"bfe7e8","textColor4":"9cbcbd","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/2e/01/b6/2e01b6f4-0cd9-2517-2c7d-6f515b9a6913/dd76d263-b6f2-4c34-a19f-1dec3c88a978.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0c2c6","textColor2":"dcbab4","textColor4":"b09590","textColor1":"f0f2f7","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video126/v4/c6/72/cb/c672cb1c-2242-ab18-b8ab-0ee70f328c32/Job6c09fb23-5925-4402-979d-9d8f4782ea84-159586274-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_307788234_1628202304-Time1701786342914.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"262d2c","textColor2":"17292e","textColor4":"34494e","textColor1":"050604","bgColor":"a7cccc","hasP3":false}},"name":"Daniel","artistName":"Real Estate","editorialNotes":{"standard":"“It feels like a new beginning for us,” Real Estate singer-songwriter Martin Courtney tells Apple Music of the indie rock veterans' sixth album, after 15 years together as a band. “I’ve learned a lot about how to write songs and my own process through the first five records we made. This album is me taking stock of that and being like, ‘What if I tried something totally different?’” Less concerned about how <i>Daniel</i> would fit in with the rest of their catalog, Courtney wanted to simplify his songwriting by writing bright pop music that felt warm and welcoming. The final result is opposite to their last release, 2020’s <i>The Main Thing</i>, which had an intentionally dense and murky sound. “We made this messy album that was full of ideas,” Courtney adds, “but this was more about precision and stripping things away—keeping things to the point and concise.”\n\nRecorded in nine days at RCA Studio A in Nashville, famously known for hosting legendary artists such as The Beach Boys and Dolly Parton, <i>Daniel</i> benefits from the band trying a series of firsts, whether by enlisting a new producer outside of their usual circles (Daniel Tashian, co-writer/co-producer on Kacey Musgraves’ <i>Golden Hour</i>) or having a group of session musicians at their disposal if needed. These songs—which expand on their sound with a wide array of instruments like pedal steel guitar, organ, and piano—navigate themes of existential rumination (“Interior”), overcoming uncertain times (“Haunted World”), and the music they grew up listening to (“Water Underground”). One landmark ’90s record inspired Courtney more than most. “I'm really obsessed with the R.E.M. album <i>Automatic for the People</i>,” says Courtney. “I wanted to use an acoustic and sonic palette similar to that album, just use a lot of instruments that felt very organic but without it feeling country or Americana.” Read on as Courtney walks us through the album, one song at a time.\n\n<b>“Somebody New”</b>\n“It feels good as an opener. It thematically sets up this vibe, which runs throughout the record, about coming to terms with the fact that I'm a different person now than I was before, trying to figure out who that person is and being okay with that. It has this looping thing, which I kind of ripped off of my bloody valentine—they do that a lot where the timing is just a little off, but not in a way that is overt. It gives it this kind of propulsion where it feels like it never ends.”\n\n<b>“Haunted World”</b> \n“We were in Nashville recording with people that work a lot on country music, and we were like, ‘I think pedal steel would sound really good on this track.’ We had access to this amazing world-class pedal steel player, a Nashville session guy named Justin Schipper. He adds this element that you can't really put your finger on, more like sound effects using these ethereal-sounding chords, which is kind of magical.”\n\n<b>“Water Underground”</b>\n“Initially, I just came up with the phrase ‘water underground.’ I thought it sounded good for a chorus, but then I had to figure out what it meant. I wrote the whole song without really understanding what I was writing about, but I thought about it later and it came to me: ‘Oh, it's like your subconscious.’ People always refer to water as it being associated with your subconscious, so to me it's the creative flow of your brain in getting an idea and then trying to hold on to it and not forget it. You're just living your everyday life, and then you find some kind of inspiration and try to turn that into something.”\n\n<b>“Flowers”</b>\n“I wrote this song in three hours, which is funny since it usually takes me at least a couple of days. I wrote the guitar part thinking it was cool, but then I had to drive two hours to play a solo show in New Jersey and I wrote the rest of the song on the way there. I played it at the show that night, which was pretty fun. It feels very different for me for this band—it kind of sounds like Tom Petty or Sheryl Crow, like this radio-rock vibe. There's this one part where the drums are just hitting the kick drum. Our bass player Alex Bleeker would keep jokingly making this ‘Come on, boys!’ Bruce Springsteen impression during this vamp. I was like, ‘You’re making me hate this song right now. Please stop. It's too much.’”\n\n<b>“Interior”</b>\n“I wrote it and then thought it sounded like Big Star, but I couldn’t figure out which song. It took me a long time to realize it’s ‘September Gurls,’ the little guitar turnaround that starts the song. When we recorded it, it was way more straight. It had the same general shape: the build and the parts added throughout the song with the drums gradually coming in with this big guitar solo in the middle. But after recording it that way, Daniel Tashian thought it would be cool if there was a super funky drumbeat happening the whole time, with the bass just grooving with the drums.”\n\n<b>“Freeze Brain”</b>\n“If you heard the demo, it sounds nothing like what's on the record. What I recorded was like, again, a my bloody valentine song in that it’s very fast and very distorted and heavy. We were about to record it that way, and as we were setting up in the studio getting ready to record this song, Sammi [Niss] started playing this groove to test her drums and get some levels. We started playing the song along to the groove, just joking around, and thought it sounded really cool. We recorded it like that with the intention of doing it like this first and then doing the other version that we had practiced, but then we were just moving so fast. We forgot and moved on to the next song, and this is the version we ended up with.”\n\n<b>“Say No More”</b>\n“Throughout our career, our band has come up with working titles that are some other band's name. We've probably had five songs called 'The Feelies,' and this is one of them in that it's got that sort of soft intensity. I've had multiple people tell me that it feels like a standout track to them, which is great. Because honestly, this album has 11 songs, and I would've been really happy with 10. But I was like, if I was going to cut a song, it probably would've been this one. Right after we finished it, I thought it felt unfinished somehow, or that it just needs something. Which is weird, because it has a pretty well-thought-out arrangement, and there's a lot of different parts to it. But anyway, now I feel better about it. I’m glad we didn't cut it.”\n\n<b>“Airdrop”</b>\n“I got this little Mellotron keyboard, and I was just having fun with brass sounds. I wrote the little riff that opens the song on that keyboard, thinking it sounded sort of classical and Baroque. It was the trickiest one to nail down on the album, because I wasn't really happy with it, so we kept cutting and moving things around. I don't think you can tell in the final recording. I actually am really happy with it now, but I was really ready to just abandon it, since it was a nightmare to make.”\n\n<b>“Victoria”</b>\n“We all switched instruments on this one. I’m not even sure how we're going to do it live, honestly. Everyone in the band is more than welcome to contribute songs, but a lot of times I'm the only one, or I write the most. On the last record, Bleeker wrote a song, but when he wasn't happy with it, he wouldn’t end up finishing it. He didn't end up having a song on the record last time, but Julian [Lynch, guitarist] did. And then the opposite happened this time: Julian wrote a song for this one, and I was really into it, but once we were in the studio, he felt it wasn’t ready.”\n\n<b>“Market Street”</b>\n“It’s one of the early ones that I wrote for this record. It Informed a lot of what I wanted in terms of the style of songwriting. More simple verse-chorus form, but the parts are catchy. I remember Julian was attempting to record a solo, and I kept telling him that it’s got to be bigger. It has to be a stupid guitar solo, dumb but powerful. And he was like, ‘Do you want to try?’ I gave it a try and I'm happy with my solo. The only thing is I do this vibrato wiggle at the end that I kind of wish I hadn't done. It's almost too over the top. Still, I really like that song in that it has a Neil Young driving kind of vibe. It ended up being the only time I play electric guitar on the album.”\n\n<b>“You Are Here”</b>\n“It's the only song on the record that strays from this concise pop thing that we were trying to do, with this long extended outro. I play piano on this one, which I think is the first time. It’s another one I wrote on guitar where the original demo almost sounds like a garage rock song. We were messing around with it when we were rehearsing before we went to the studio, but it didn’t feel like it fit with the rest of the songs. We came up with this baggy beat where it was organ-driven, sort of like Yo Tengo’s 'Autumn Sweater'—that was one of the inspirations for the arrangement. It's built around a drum loop, which is also new for us. Sammi was playing that beat the whole time, so we thought of looping it with an almost hip-hop thing to it. It does get a little psychedelic, but it felt right to do it like that.”","short":"Martin Courtney on the band’s sixth LP: “It feels like a new beginning for us.”","tagline":"New Album and

EP","artistName":"TWICE","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Released in the midst of TWICE’s READY TO BE world tour, mini album <i>With YOU-th</i> deepens the discography of one of the most successful girl groups of all time. Almost a decade into their careers, the nine-member group has found a musical niche for themselves as masters of bubblegum dance-pop. The six-track EP doubles down on the third-generation veterans’ commitment to bright tunes and heartfelt optimism.\n\n“We were lightning from the start and it keeps me going to know that,” TWICE member DAHYUN sings in album opener “I GOT YOU,” a synth-driven English-language tribute to the group’s togetherness and to their fandom, known as ONCE. The “you” highlighted in the album’s title is a reference to the same bonds, and is a theme that ties the entirety of <i>With YOU-th</i> together. Members CHAEYOUNG, JEONGYEON, and DAHYUN participated in the songwriting for three of the album’s tracks, adding a more personal touch to B-sides “RUSH,” “BLOOM,” and “YOU GET ME.” Here the members comment on each song.\n\n<b>“I GOT YOU”</b>\nNAYEON: “‘I GOT YOU’ is about the friendship our members share and the whole journey we’ve been on. Even when we were lost or struggling, we had each other to rely on. This song’s about sticking ‘together’ no matter what comes next.”\nSANA: “There’s a line: ‘No matter what you got me, I got you.’ It’s saying we’re always going to be there for each other, either as a family or a team.”\n\n<b>“ONE SPARK”</b>\nMOMO: “This is the ‘title track’ of our 13th mini album. TWICE’s sparkling moment of youth and passion—that’s what we wanted to express here.”\nJIHYO: “'ONE SPARK' is our first attempt at the drum ’n’ bass style. It’s got a dreamy sound and melody that I hope listeners will find exciting.”\n\n<b>“RUSH”</b>\nCHAEYOUNG: “I wrote the lyrics for this one. In a relationship, there are moments sometimes when it seems like your feelings are stronger than theirs. So here I'm giving them a cheeky nudge that a bit more attention would be appreciated.”\n\n<b>“NEW NEW”</b>\nMINA: “We went full-on peppy and lovely for ‘NEW NEW.’ The song kicks off with a tropical-sounding synth lead, which gives the track a refreshing feel.”\nTZUYU: “Like the words suggest, this song’s perfect for enjoying the sweet springtime breeze.”\n\n<b>“BLOOM”</b>\nJEONGYEON: “In the lyrics I wrote for ‘BLOOM,’ I wanted to express the long wait, the drawn-out process until a flower can finally blossom in all its splendor. All nine of us sing in harmony on this track.”\n\n<b>“YOU GET ME”</b>\nDAHYUN: “This song is like an extension of ‘I GOT YOU.’ The story of ‘you’ and ‘I’ that begins in ‘I GOT YOU’ culminates in ‘YOU GET ME,’ where we share memorable moments and find a better world together. Pay attention to the lyrics, I wrote them!”","short":"The girl group talks through the six tracks on their 13th mini album.","tagline":"New Mini

you think the world is going easy only on us?” the members of K-pop girl group LE SSERAFIM ask in unison on “Good Bones,” the guitar-driven musical manifesto that introduces the five-track EP <i>EASY</i>. Mostly spoken—in Korean, English, and Japanese, covering the first languages of the group’s five members—and seemingly a reference to Maggie Smith’s 2016 viral poem of the same name, “Good Bones” reminds the listener that despite being idols and evoking angelic beings in their name, LE SSERAFIM lives on the same mortal plane as the rest of us: “We're all gonna die evеntually/And half of our life will be in pain/The othеr half depends on what we do.” \n\nWhat LE SSERAFIM does is <i>work</i>. As a mini album, <i>EASY</i> is presented as a laidback listening space to poetically allude to the sweat behind the group’s signature brand of fearlessness. The distinction between “easy” and “making it <i>look</i> easy” is central to the R&B title track “EASY,” which juxtaposes a smooth vocal delivery and rolling trap beat with the stuttering tension of its lyrics: “After the lights turn off, I wander in the night/Don’t know what is right, don’t know ’bout my rights/Envy, doubt, distrust, now friends of me, yuh/To the world, I'm half seraphim, yuh.” \n\nThe cyclical chorus of B-side “Swan Song” glides right by the phrase’s common definition to the perceived grace of the bird the members can most relate to: “Pretending to be elegant again/Dive like a swan/Although I'm out of breath.” On the groovy, amapiano-inspired “Smart,” the members suggest it’s not just effort but also cleverness that informs their continued success (“I'm a kid who will become a butterfly/I’m a smarter baby”), while the vocal flourishes of fan song “We got so much” defines with gratitude what all that hard work is for: “We got so much love/I won't take it for granted.”\n","short":"Over five tracks, the K-pop girl group shows their work.","tagline":"New Mini

Symphony No. 9","artistName":"Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra & Keri-Lynn Wilson","editorialNotes":{"standard":"This performance of Beethoven’s colossal symphonic landmark, given in Warsaw during the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra’s European tour of 2023, was bound to be noteworthy, both as the UFO’s debut recording, and as the first—symbolically—to be sung in Ukrainian.\n\nLeonard Bernstein, when performing Beethoven’s Ninth just weeks after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, famously changed the sung text’s “Freude” (“Joy”) to “Freiheit” (“Freedom”). Following his example, the UFO’s founder-conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson has replaced “Freude\" with “Slava,” familiar from the now-famous phrase “Slava Ukraini!” (“Glory to Ukraine!”).\n\nThe UFO’s sound is plush and veiled—a contrast to the more historically informed performance style we’ve become accustomed to. But it amply demonstrates how the work’s grandeur is ultimately and credibly the source of its all-embracing humanity, reaching its apotheosis here in the choral finale sung with heart-felt emotion by a fine team of Ukrainian soloists and the 40-strong Ukrainian Freedom Chorus.","short":"Beethoven’s mighty Ninth Symphony performed with heart and humanity.","tagline":"New Album"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/43/53/2e/43532e02-2f49-bc38-cdbd-7f8c1974e377/24UMGIM07189.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8cabd","textColor2":"fff108","textColor4":"cbc006","textColor1":"fafdec","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1729994069","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-symphony-no-9/1729994069"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729994069/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1729994072","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1729994072?l=en-US"},{"id":"268921894","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/268921894?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730018353":{"id":"1730018353","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730018353?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/krust/54761","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Irrational Numbers, Vol. 4","artistName":"Krust","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/f9/ca/d5/f9cad5db-fd8c-1dd7-b073-068b7100aace/198391133923.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"dbdbdb","textColor4":"b0b1b1","textColor1":"f4f4f4","bgColor":"050508","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1730018353","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/irrational-numbers-vol-4/1730018353","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/56K2L1VTHj2k6JO4IhBMGd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730018353/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"54761","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/54761?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730117733":{"id":"1730117733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730117733?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"releaseDate":"2024-02-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vince-pope/434368722","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"True Detective: Night Country (Soundtrack from the HBO® Original Series)","artistName":"Vince Pope","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/e7/03/91/e70391e1-6b8b-1865-fe6f-0287e398fc0c/794043219863.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"97b2c8","textColor2":"6abbda","textColor4":"59a2c3","textColor1":"b8cfe1","bgColor":"134065","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/true-detective-night-country-soundtrack-from-the-hbo/1730117733","playParams":{"id":"1730117733","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YYtxCRIwJ7whWUZoSBtqL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730117733/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"434368722","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/434368722?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730789450":{"id":"1730789450","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730789450?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"releaseDate":"2024-02-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/french-montana/475816358","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/e1/66/8f/e1668f41-9e62-31b4-3d92-7f499c095003/d1a4fe99-2267-42da-9cd5-6482620d8637.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"32302e","textColor2":"28292a","textColor4":"4a4948","textColor1":"0a0909","bgColor":"d1cac3","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/93/67/eb936736-3466-ca00-0613-232fec0707ac/83462ca7-96fb-4795-a7ab-559258d209e0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c0bf","textColor2":"d6d7d4","textColor4":"abacaa","textColor1":"f2f0ef","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false}},"name":"Mac & Cheese 5","artistName":"French Montana","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Longtime French Montana fans and mixtape aficionados know the <i>Mac & Cheese</i> imprimatur well. Within and beyond the Bronx, 2009’s <i>Mac Wit Da Cheese</i> and its successors—along with his other series and one-offs—made the Coke Boys rapper’s name in the streets. Over the years, the installments arrived with a certain amount of excitement and fanfare, with the ill-fated <i>MC4</i> intended as his second proper album until 2016’s leaks made that an impossibility. Nearly eight years later, thankfully, he returns to the saga, defiantly and with perhaps its most robust entry yet. \n\nReflective of Montana’s respected stature in hip-hop’s elite circles, <i>Mac & Cheese 5</i> boasts features from a sizable number of recognizable names across its hour-long duration. Given his history and often star-studded discography, the presence of formidable figures like Westside Gunn, Buju Banton, and Kanye West here make sense. Even so, there’s something undeniable about what these features bring out in him as one of rap’s most cocksure performers, not to mention what he gets from them in turn. On the standout “Splash Brothers,” he forms a nefarious yet dope trio with Lil Wayne and Rick Ross. Another repeat collaborator, Lil Durk, joins in for the uncompromisingly dark yet brutally frank “Money Ain't a Thing.” \n\nInterestingly enough, the inveterate hip-hop curator gets some of his best bars off when his other famous friends aren’t around. On “Talk to Me,” he makes pointed punchlines out of hedonism and opulence.

USHER’s accomplishments, creative and otherwise, should be enough to allow him to rest on his laurels, but instead, in the lead-up to that halftime show performance, he enters his next era with <i>COMING HOME</i>.\n\nUSHER’s ninth album is a return to his roots and a celebration of his legacy. It’s also his first project as an independent artist, and it reunites him with longtime collaborator L.A. Reid, who signed him at 14. (<i>COMING HOME</i> also features frequent collaborators Johnta Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Bryan-Michael Cox.) “I’ve been coming home in a lot of different ways,” USHER tells Apple Music. “The choice of music and reconnection to some of the people I’ve worked with from my past and always wanted to work with; writers I’ve actually made hit No. 1 records with. In a sense, I’m coming home because I’m in that comfortable space.” \n\nThe album, he says, “is a love letter to the experience that I have as a man. It’s filled with romance.” Across 20 tracks, USHER narrates vignettes of love, lust, love lost, and everything in between. On the opening title track—which also features Nigerian singer-songwriter Burna Boy—he longs to return home to his lover after being on tour. He teams up with Summer Walker and 21 Savage on “Good Good,” in which the trio deals with an amicable breakup. “‘Good Good’ is not necessarily the most positive, but it is not bad,” USHER explains. “It’s not toxic. It's still a romantic song in the sense that we ain’t got to be enemies. That’s still a romantic way to have a conversation.” But on the tender ballad “Risk It All,” H.E.R. details a romantic journey between two lovers putting it on the line in the name of love. USHER then gets vulnerable on “Room in a Room” as he reflects on the hardships of growing apart within a relationship. \n\nIt's all delivered with dreamy, intoxicating vocals set against bedroom pop, with beats ranging from bouncy (“Kissing Strangers,” “Keep on Dancin’”) to trap (“Cold Blooded”) to Afrobeats (“Ruin”) to new jack swing (“I Love U,” “Please U”). “Love is so central. It’s the source of it all, man,” USHER says. “Love is the thing that makes your heart beat, the thing that moves your spirit. Love is at the center of all things. The love of money, the love of life, and the love of partnership, love of even just a moment, love of connection.”","short":"The King of R&B expands his ninth album with two additional
