was a point early in the creation of the swaggering second record by Yard Act when the Leeds quartet realized they were holding themselves back and needed to let go. “We were putting some drones and synths on the track ‘Fizzy Fish,’ which was the first one we wrote for the record, and someone raised the point that we weren’t going to be able to do it live,” vocalist James Smith tells Apple Music. “But we quickly agreed we’d worry about that later. Once we cut our losses with the idea of how we could do it, there was no real discussion on the areas the album went to.”\n\nThat sense of daring is at the heart of <i>Where’s My Utopia?</i>. The four-piece has emerged with a kaleidoscopic pop record that dramatically builds upon the playful post-punk of their 2022 debut <i>The Overload</i>, its expansive sound taking in Gorillaz-meets-Ian Dury future funk, art-rock wigouts, orchestral epics, careening disco punk, and explosive indie sing-alongs. <i>The Overload</i> earned them a Mercury nomination and the chance to rerecord 2022 single “100% Endurance” with star fan Elton John, and its follow-up finds Smith searching for meaning in the wake of all his dreams coming true. “The record is about me realizing that the thing I’d wanted since being a teenager wasn’t going to magically solve all the problems that I live with,” Smith explains, “and the idea that everyone just has problems regardless of what position they’re in. I’m starting to wonder now if we just create them for ourselves because it shouldn’t be this hard.” It’s a narrative arc delivered with Smith’s trademark humor but always laced with poignancy, their anthemic hooks even sharper than those that fired their debut to success. <i>Where’s My Utopia?</i> is a bold, brilliant second album from one of the decade’s most imaginative bands. Smith guides us through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“An Illusion”</b>\n“This song definitely sets the score for ‘This isn’t a minimalist guitar post-punk album this time.’ The chorus lyric really sets up the whole premise of the situation I ended up in—that I’m in love with an illusion—and the idea that being in a successful band would solve my problems. Then, whilst my head was so buried in this world that I couldn’t get out of because of how much energy and time it was sucking out of me, all my other principles fell by the wayside. This song’s probably harder on myself than most are. The verses are about me being pissed, which I was for 18 months, and basically being just a bit useless, which I’ve got out of now. I stopped drinking off the back of the touring, I learned that I had to.”\n\n<b>“We Make Hits”</b>\n“This was one of the last songs written. We wrote it in Ryan [Needham, bassist]’s spare bedroom in a break from touring. I think Ryan had been going for that kind of French disco, Daft Punk, Justice vibes and everything fell out of me quite fast. I started by writing the story of me and Ryan and how we started the band. With this song, we were acknowledging that we’d always had ambition and we’d always wanted to do something bigger with music. Even though, at our core, all we wanted to do was make music, we always knew we would quite like to see what it was like on the other side and achieve something.”\n\n<b>“Down by the Stream”</b>\n“This was written in Turin. Everyone else had gone out for a meal and I decided to stay in the hotel room and wrote it using Jay [Russell, drummer]’s laptop. I’ve been looking back on my childhood a little bit more since my son was born and projecting him into scenarios I was in, even though historical truth and accuracy is a vague thing in terms of songwriting. It’s not literal, but it draws on my childhood. I was framing myself as this struggling person who was having a bit of a rough time, doing the woe-is-me thing about being in a successful band. I realized that if I was going to ask that empathy of the listener, then I should make sure that there was some corruption within me as well and highlight that I’m not some innocent person. It’s me dragging myself through the mud to let people know that I’m capable of being a dickhead just like everyone else.”\n\n<b>“The Undertow”</b>\n“‘Down by the Stream’ starts by the stream and then the stream leads to the sea, and that’s where the sharks start circling. We’ve ended up at sea on ‘The Undertow.’ The stream is the journey into adulthood and the sea is the murky open waters of adulthood and being out on your own in the big, bad world, then getting caught by the undertow of the industry. This is a thank-you note to my wife, really, who’s supported me through this entire caper that I’ve ended up on and been solid as a rock through it. There’s a part of me that’ll never be able to understand why I was selfish enough to do this for a living and leave my family behind to do it, so I’ll always live with that.”\n\n<b>“Dream Job”</b>\n“I caught myself writing the chorus in an interview when we were in Europe. Someone asked how it felt to have done a song with Elton John and have a Mercury nomination and all these things and I wasn’t really in the room and I just went, ‘Yeah, it’s ace, it’s wicked.’ I just started listing all these positive words without actually taking stock of what they were saying. It’s funny because I don’t really know how those things have affected me. I definitely wanted them and I’m glad I got them but they just happen and you move on. You get asked about them a lot, and the truth is that you don’t really think of them. I feel like the second you start wearing your achievements with pride, you’re dead in the water. I think the whole album is trying to strike that balance between being cynical and maybe a bit arsey, but also going, at the same time, ‘Things are great!’ It can be both, and it is both for us, and that’s life, even if it’s your life or my life in this band I’m in.”\n\n<b>“Fizzy Fish”</b>\n“The lyrics changed a lot on this one—I was literally writing about Fizzy Fish sweets for about three verses originally. With those seeds, you don’t really know where you’re going with them a lot of the time, but you let your mind chase after it and see where it goes. The Fizzy Fish, it was nostalgia, it was going back to the playground and that’s me having a conversation with another version of me from my childhood or a parallel universe. Again, it’s set in a lake, going with the water theme, because that’s a stagnant body of water that’s separate from the sea. It stands alone from the rest of the album. It’s set in my subconscious. ‘The Undertow’ through to ‘Grifter’s Grief’ is one narrative arc that follows me going into this successful Yard Act. ‘Fizzy Fish’ is me learning to cope with this newfound spotlight and who I am, whether I’ve changed from who I was, whether that’s positive or negative and the fact you have to create new masks to deal with a public-facing job because you don’t want to give too much of yourself away but, ultimately, to connect with people is the entire reason you’re making music.”\n\n<b>“Petroleum”</b>\n“This is based on an incident that happened at a gig at Bognor Regis at the start of 2023, the point within the story where I hit the bottom. I bottled the gig. Not anything drastic, we got through a set, but I was really disappointed in myself and my performance that night. I told the audience I was bored and I didn’t want to be there. We’d bitten off more than we could chew and I hadn’t had a break in 18 months, and I had a bad gig. This looks at the idea of what is expected of musicians when they perform live and this consumerist demand that they deliver. I realized that people don’t actually want honesty, they want the version of honesty they’ve paid to see. It’s learning to deal with these extra masks that we develop. I was trying to get to the core of ‘How can I channel a true version of how I’m feeling into an enjoyable performance that people deserve to see?’ This whole song reignited my passion for playing live and I’ve since learned how to process my emotions and funnel them into a performance that creates something that I’m proud of.”\n\n<b>“When the Laughter Stops” (feat. Katy J Pearson)</b>\n“It’s maybe a reaction to a lot of people saying, ‘Oh, Yard Act is the fun band, the jokers, and they don’t take it too seriously,’ and we don’t—because you can’t—but it’s that whole sad-clown complex. We’re not base level: We feel things just the same as everyone else! A lot of this album is rooted in that paranoia of not being able to maintain this—because it felt like I couldn’t do it if what it took to make a living from this job was those first 18 months over and over again. Fortunately, it’s changed, it’s fine but it has to stay at this level for it to be OK. If it drops back below, it’s hard work being in a band.”\n\n<b>“Grifter’s Grief”</b>\n“This is to do with the fact that my entire job now is based around sucking electricity out of giant venues and getting on aeroplanes and constantly burning up road miles and air miles and sea miles just to selfishly make a living whilst the planet burns. I spoke to my dad about it and he was kicking off about something and I was like, ‘Yeah but, Dad, I do that, I get on planes all the time.’ He went, ‘Yeah, but you need to do it to work.’ And I was like, ‘But I don’t. I could get a job that doesn’t involve that.’ It’s that everyone’s selfish inherently, I think.”\n\n<b>“Blackpool Illuminations”</b>\n“This is probably the most important song on the album. When we do the zany and comical stuff, we’re always trying to do it so you can pull the rug from under people with a song like this and prove what we’re capable of if we really put our minds to it. We supported Foals in Blackpool in May 2022. I had such nostalgic memories of Blackpool from going as a kid. My wife and son came and joined us for those two nights with Foals, and we had a couple of days and weekend in Blackpool because I wanted to show my baby where I had holidays as a child. Seeing him walking along the promenade, I saw myself in him and realized that he was just following the exact same footsteps that I did when I was a kid. [The song] follows my journey through childhood to that moment, really—these footprints of the past that we leave and then the future treads over them in a very similar way.”\n\n<b>“A Vineyard for the North”</b>\n“This is the note of hope that comes at the end. Climate change punctuates the album but I didn’t want to write too heavily about it. I read an article that French vineyard owners are starting to buy land in the south of England—because of the rising temperature, the south of England is now [in] prime condition for growing grapes for champagne. I was thinking how, as it gets hotter, it works its way up the country. It’s clutching at straws in a sense but it’s more to do with human nature and our ability to adapt and problem solve. I don’t think the answer is that everyone in the north starts buying vineyards and growing grapes. But, in essence, it is that things will change and we’ll have to adapt, and there’s hope and there are avenues we can always take.”","short":"Singer James Smith unpacks his band’s second LP and the personal tale within.","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wheres-my-utopia/1712518914","playParams":{"id":"1712518914","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1mRX6QPV832KdiDhsdOb09"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1712518914/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1499415658","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1499415658?l=en-US"}]}}},"1714316786":{"id":"1714316786","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714316786?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":33,"releaseDate":"2024-02-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=5519614-1186297280-4720761-270373074","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5c/df/48/5cdf4839-d02f-9fd3-dccf-4813464d73a6/43dcd9dd-2d08-41f6-9b7d-942f18c0e50f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"464442","textColor2":"31231e","textColor4":"504642","textColor1":"25201f","bgColor":"cdd1d0","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/f2/09/5c/f2095cb0-1d6b-975a-1f6b-f9cc68b9ec4c/8f4efb3e-84b2-4955-befe-48fafa11897c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4b403d","textColor2":"102c3c","textColor4":"334b57","textColor1":"2e1f1b","bgColor":"c1c5c4","hasP3":false}},"name":"Saint-Saëns","artistName":"Lang Lang, Gina Alice, Gewandhausorchester & Andris Nelsons","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/be/2f/23/be2f2312-5801-cf87-99da-b2107f73bc14/23UMGIM60590.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2c352d","textColor2":"00314c","textColor4":"2c556a","textColor1":"000900","bgColor":"e0e5e1","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"It wasn’t that long ago that Saint-Saëns was generally, and snootily, regarded as a second-division composer. That’s clearly a nonsense because, in truth, the late 19th-century French composer could do it all: symphonies, operas, concertos, chamber music, all infused with melodic inspiration, an unmatched craftmanship, and an irresistible Gallic charm. Maybe his detractors couldn’t compute a composer whose music oozed sophistication and geniality in equal measure. \n\nAnd Saint-Saëns’ music doesn’t get more genial than the riotous <i>Carnival of the Animals</i> and sunny Piano Concerto No. 2, both enticingly showcased here by Lang Lang and a terrific line-up of musicians, all of whom rise to the composer’s challenges with ebullient energy and joyful abandon. Saint-Saëns originally tossed off <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i> in 1886 as a gift to his students (and a welcome distraction from “serious” composing). Full of in-jokes and gentle gibes at fellow composers, <i>Carnival</i> was never intended to be published, but rather performed and enjoyed in private.\n\nLang Lang leads a spirited, high-octane performance that includes appearances from his pianist wife Gina Alice—the first time they’ve appeared together on an album. They spar brilliantly and hilariously on “Pianists,” Saint-Saëns’ caricature of two hopeless learners, and are delightfully as one in the whirlwind of “Wild Asses” and the ethereal rippling of “Aquarium.” Andris Nelsons corrals his menagerie of fine musicians, including star turns from flute, cello, double bass, and xylophone, with great humour.\n\nFresh from his zoological adventures, Lang Lang launches headlong into the Piano Concerto No. 2, with its opening cadenza that pays homage to Bach (and by the end of the concerto, as the adage goes, to Offenbach). This is Saint-Saëns in full virtuosic mode, yet with virtuosity always at the service of the music. Like the composer himself, Lang Lang is possessed of such technical skill that difficulties are no barrier to musical fluency, evident in the gamboling second movement. And the final, furious “Presto,” the perfect amalgam of everything that makes Saint-Saëns great, proves a wonderful showcase for the warm yet alert sound of the Gewandhaus Orchestra.\n\nThe remaining 15 tracks are a rewarding adventure in French Romantic music, including Debussy’s <i>Petite Suite</i> for piano duet, again performed by Lang Lang and Alice, and no less than five pieces by female French composers. <i>Valse lente</i> by Germaine Tailleferre, the only female member of the group of French composers called “Les Six,” is a beautiful mix of Satie-esque calm and sultry modern jazz.","short":"Lang Lang and friends bring artistry and energy to their Saint-Saëns celebration.","tagline":"New Album"},"playParams":{"id":"1714316786","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/saint-sa%C3%ABns/1714316786","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3923ndf9zKgvppYaawmuIO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1714316786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5519614","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5519614?l=en-US"},{"id":"1186297280","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1186297280?l=en-US"},{"id":"4720761","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4720761?l=en-US"},{"id":"270373074","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/270373074?l=en-US"}]}}},"1715682690":{"id":"1715682690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1715682690?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-03-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-dickinson/546389","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/a8/35/d1/a835d111-53fa-6e8a-5806-40321cc6f117/Jobb2cc68ea-51cf-411f-870c-873d1f97a355-163086476-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315859220_1686886362-Time1708017660071.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d8aa8c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"baa097","textColor2":"d8aa8c","textColor4":"ad8b75","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/d4/17/78/d417781c-6fac-48e3-5295-5be9fef1460c/0df9635d-7148-412e-966b-eabb79dd5005.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b99ba9","textColor2":"709ce2","textColor4":"5d83c4","textColor1":"e2bac0","bgColor":"131e4c","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/29/c5/63/29c56376-d38e-9d65-160b-ba108583f645/Job617c8b36-9138-493f-97d8-526da4b1f8c5-163086477-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315859214_1686885873-Time1708018942150.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d69c7d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c8cdd1","textColor2":"d69c7d","textColor4":"ac7f69","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/33/7d/de/337dde73-5337-107b-6207-0847499ddcb6/9d0ba68a-9dfc-4432-a26e-77b04349d3a0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8998f","textColor2":"cea792","textColor4":"a68879","textColor1":"d1bcad","bgColor":"060d19","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Mandrake Project","artistName":"Bruce Dickinson","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/dd/8b/cd/dd8bcd34-84ca-e607-ab62-a357a3bac131/4050538951417.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"ccced1","textColor2":"d8a883","textColor4":"ad896e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040e1a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"For his seventh solo outing, Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson almost made a concept album. Instead, he made an album with a concept. Some of the songs on <i>The Mandrake Project</i> detail episodes from a 12-issue comic series (also called <i>The Mandrake Project</i>) created by Dickinson, scripted by Tony Lee, and illustrated by Staz Johnson. “It was never intended to be this big,” Dickinson tells Apple Music. “At first, I had an idea about doing one comic only, like a little bit of extra vibe around the album. I was already thinking in the comic world, because originally the title of the album was taken from a Doctor Strange episode called ‘If Eternity Should Fail!’ I came up with these two characters, Dr. Necropolis and Professor Lazarus, and it’s a really dark story. It's not a superhero story. It’s more like a <i>Watchmen</i>-style comic in 12 episodes.”\n\nWith longtime producer and guitarist Roy Z, Dickinson wrote songs that tie in with the comic storyline, like “Afterglow of Ragnarok” and “Resurrection Men,” and others that are completely unrelated, like “Many Doors to Hell,” about a female vampire, and “Fingers in the Wounds,” which imagines Jesus resurrected as a social media influencer. And then there’s “Eternity Has Failed,” an earlier version of which was nicked by Iron Maiden for their 2015 album, <i>The Book of Souls</i>. Below, the singer details each track. \n\n<b>“Afterglow of Ragnarok”</b>\n“This is meant to be like a hallucination from mandrake juice. Dr. Necropolis is a brilliant scientist, and an orphan. He’s interested in bringing back his brother who died at birth. He’s wondering why he survived and his brother died. And he’s tortured by this voice in his head, which he assumes is his brother. The voice just says, ‘Save me,’ over and over. It hits Necropolis like a depression. He gets into drugs and sex magic and the occult to try and contact his brother and try to figure out a way to bring him back. That’s what drives him and propels him through the story.” \n\n<b>“Many Doors to Hell”</b>\n“This is about a female vampire who wants to be human again. She wants to feel what it's like to not just bite people in the neck, but to maybe kiss them or make love. Instead of the weird vampire orgasm of drinking blood and stuff, she wants to feel what it's like to be a woman again. She's fed up with living forever with dead people. So she's waiting for the moment when she can step outside. And that moment is when there's an eclipse. During the eclipse, she can go out and she can be human. And maybe there's a way back for her to be human permanently.” \n\n<b>“Rain on the Graves”</b>\n“The title is a phrase I’d written down 10 years before I actually wrote the song. I was in a part of England called the Lake District, a very beautiful area that lots of poets and artists lived in. William Wordsworth had a cottage there and wrote a lot of his best poetry there. He’s buried in the local church, which is where this wedding was that I was invited to, and I decided to find his grave. It was raining and really atmospheric, and I sat there for about 40 minutes just thinking about what an incredible creative mind he had. Years later, Roy and I decided to write this song, which is kind of like ‘Cross Road Blues’ by Robert Johnson, where he meets the devil, but instead of at a crossroads it takes place in a graveyard.” \n\n<b>“Resurrection Men”</b>\n“This one is related to the comic. The Resurrection Men are Professor Lazarus and Dr. Necropolis. While I was doing the beginning bit with these open guitar chords, I noticed the tremolo button on the amp. I went, ‘Hang on, what does this button do?’ It was the full-on Dick Dale surf sound, so I thought, ‘What would a Tarantino heavy metal opening sound like?’ So I played that on guitar. I thought Roy would redo it, but he decided to keep mine. And then I put the bongos on it later, because if you’ve got a Tarantino thing, you’ve got to have bongos on it as well.” \n\n<b>“Fingers in the Wounds”</b>\n“The fingers in the wounds are the stigmata of Christ. I think it was St. Francis who had the stigmata appear, which proved that he was holy. The song is about the wonderful world of influencers, but with a twist: What if Jesus came back as an influencer? Like, ‘Put your fingers in your iPhones, put your fingers in my wounds, I’ll sell you a piece of my cloth. I can sell pearls to oysters, feed them to swine.’ It’s the way that everything on the internet now is just degraded by trolls and idiots and fake news and all that stuff. And all these influencers are just worthless, fake people. What have they done in their lives to justify all these people following them around like little dogs? I hate all that. That’s why I’m not part of it.” \n\n<b>“Eternity Has Failed”</b>\n“Originally, it was entitled ‘If Eternity Should Fail.’ The title comes from a Doctor Strange episode. It was going to be the title track to the record, but then Maiden co-opted it onto their record. By the time I returned to it, I'd already got this idea for the comic series pretty well developed, so I thought I'd just tweak a couple of the words to make it reflect the story more. So we did that, and then stuck a few more bits on, like the flutes and percussion at the beginning that give it that spaghetti western type of feel. The last bit of spoken word is the last slide of episode one of the comic.” \n\n<b>“Mistress of Mercy”</b>\n“Who is the mistress of mercy? It’s music. I wrote this on acoustic guitar, but the middle bit, the funny little Jeff Beck-type guitar riff, I wrote on a keyboard. And then Roy played it on guitar. I wanted a mashup of something that was really thrashing, like some garage band going apeshit, along with the acoustic feel. The idea is that the music is the dominatrix. She holds you, pins you down, but you can’t help but adore her and love her. The ecstasy, the harmony, the melody drives you absolutely crazy. That’s what the song is about.” \n\n<b>“Face in the Mirror”</b>\n“This is a melancholy tune. It's about alcoholism, but also it's about the way people judge other people and judge themselves. It's sung from the point of view of somebody who is a drunk, but he's turning around and saying, ‘You're laughing at me because I'm lying on the ground, but when I hold my glass up, I can see right through you. I can see all your bullshit. I can see all your lies. You’re going to judge me because I’m an alcoholic, but take a look in my mirror, because you might see yourself as well.’”\n\n<b>“Shadow of the Gods”</b>\n“This one goes back to just after <i>Tyranny of Souls</i>. This and the title track from that album were written as a pair for a project that never happened called The Three Tremors, which was supposed to be three metal singers, like The Three Tenors in classical music. It was going to be me, Rob Halford, and Ronnie James Dio. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen because Ronnie passed away. So I recorded ‘A Tyranny of Souls’ for myself and then kept this one. When I revisited it, I put a couple references to the comic in it. There’s a part two-thirds of the way through that sounds very reminiscent of Judas Priest because that’s who was supposed to sing it.” \n\n<b>“Sonata (Immortal Beloved)”</b>\n“This is the oldest song on the record. It’s almost 25 years old. There’s a sample of Beethoven’s ‘Moonlight Sonata’ running underneath the drum machine, so Roy and I were just calling it ‘Sonata’ for a while. Roy later told me it was inspired by the film <i>Immortal Beloved</i>. He went to the movies, came home, and pulled an all-nighter, layering keyboards and guitars just for the hell of it. When he sent it to me, I didn’t have any ideas, but I just gave it a try and what came out was about 80% of the vocal, including the spoken word. I just did it freestyle, with no notes or anything.

The tones are richer and deeper; the arrangements expand and breathe like massive lungs; her voice layers over itself and ripples, decadent and deeply felt. Webster’s genre-blending approach may have been slightly overstated in the past—a result of her early association with Atlanta’s rascally, defunct hip-hop crew Awful Records—but her sonic playfulness has never been more fully realized than it is on on <i>Underdressed at the Symphony</i>. Slinky, flute-dotted R&B is situated up against sumptuous country pop and grungy flips on ’50s sock-hop rock music; longtime friend and rap chameleon Lil Yachty pops up on “Lego Ring” as the pair switch off from a Weezer-esque chug to spacey, astral psych-rock. \n\nLyrically, <i>Underdressed at the Symphony</i>—which was written and recorded coming off of a breakup—carries Webster’s now-trademarked mixture of emotional intimacy and straightforward humor. She finds potency in simple sentiments (“Thinking About You,” “He Loves Me Yeah!”), and on the sparse hyperpop “Feeling Good Today,” she details the small pleasures that come with moving through one’s daily existence. “I used to be self-conscious/Well, really, I still am/I’m just better at figuring out why,” Webster ruminates over the lush guitars of “Wanna Quit All the Time,” one of several songs that feature Wilco guitarist Nels Cline. This is music that’s as mesmerizing as it is disarmingly personal, and <i>Underdressed at the Symphony</i> represents an artist who, similar to cosmic kin Cass McCombs, seems increasingly intent on proving she really can do anything.","short":"The Atlanta singer-songwriter proves she can do anything on her fifth LP.","tagline":"New

had been moments when John Squire wondered how little the future held for him as a musician. In 2020, a thumb he’d broken while playing basketball with his son was struggling to heal and he worried he might never be able to play guitar again. Before that, The Stone Roses—the Manchester band with which he’d helped to completely dilate the horizons of indie music during the late ’80s and early ’90s—had seemed to wither to a final close when their 2016-17 reunion produced two new songs but no desire on any member’s part to make another album. Going into the 2020s, Squire seemed more consumed by his work as a visual artist.\n\nNevertheless, in early 2022, his thumb righted by physiotherapy, Squire had a nagging sense that he wasn’t quite done with music. “I started thinking I’d like to get back out there,” he told Apple Music’ Radio’s Zane Lowe. “‘Have I still got it in me?’ I started putting some ideas together. I wouldn’t say they were songs, they were more like glorified riffs.” He’d had a thought that he might find a female singer to help flesh out those ideas, but then his guest appearance at Liam Gallagher’s Knebworth concert that June sparked a different idea: What if he asked the Oasis man to sing them? It was a question worth asking. Before the end of the year, Gallagher was in Squire’s home studio in Macclesfield, recording demos and igniting Squire’s creative zeal again. “On paper, it’s a slam dunk but to actually hear it and feel that magic was amazing,” said Squire. “The buzz for me has always been that moment of conception when you realize you’ve got something great. When you’re doing that within the framework of a band and an album and gigs, you know all that’s coming down the line at you once you’ve completed the song—there’s nothing better than that feeling. It’s like, ‘I’m the first person that’s heard this and it’s going to travel, it’s going to be released into the wild and do some damage.’”\n\nFor his part, Gallagher was just chuffed to be working with one of his musical heroes. “John going, ‘Look, I’m back to writing songs and that again,’ made me happy regardless of me singing on them,” Gallagher told Lowe. “These songs came my way and I was double pleased to sing them. I love them. I think John’s equally as good [at songwriting] as he is playing a guitar. I’m sure people know that anyway, but it’s nice if more people get to know it.” You can sense the duo’s mutual satisfaction in an album that was recorded over a two-week period in L.A. with producer Greg Kurstin, a collaborator on Gallagher’s three solo records. While the core elements are familiar—Squire’s roaming, nimble guitar lines, Gallagher’s serrated voice—nothing feels tired or overcooked. Instead, buoyed by the strength of Squire’s melodies, the two turn in performances that might be their best since the Roses and Oasis heydays. Writing the words and music, Squire gives Gallagher moods and colors he’s always worked well with—sneering disdain (“I’m so Bored”), sore-headed yearning (“Mars to Liverpool”), and measured psychedelia (“Love You Forever”)—and successfully coaxes him onto relatively new ground (the blues on “I’m a Wheel”).\n\nThe world’s recording studios are littered with the ghosts and abandoned recordings of stellar collaborations that should have worked on paper but didn’t create any chemistry on tape. Gallagher thinks his particular super-duo has succeeded for a simple reason. “John’s guitars are lairy, man, and my vocals can be as well,” he said. “I think it lends well to it. [It’s not that] one’s light and one’s heavy. They’re both just fucking coming at you.”","short":"John Squire on the super-duo’s debut: “To feel that magic was amazing.”","tagline":"New Album and

Top Dawg Entertainment fixture since the early 2010s, ScHoolboy Q played no small role in elevating the label to hip-hop’s upper echelon. With his Black Hippy cohorts Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, and Jay Rock, the tremendously talented Los Angeles native made a compelling case for continuing the West Coast’s rap legacy well beyond the G-funk era or the days of Death Row dominance. Even still, his relative absence from the game after <i>CrasH Talk</i> dropped in 2019 has been hard to ignore, particularly as the most prominent member of his group departed TDE while SZA became the roster’s most undeniable hitmaker.\n\nIndeed, it’s been nearly five years since he gave us more than a loosie, which makes the arrival of his sixth full-length <i>BLUE LIPS</i> all the more auspicious. His concerns as a lyricist draw upon the micro as well as the macro level, as a parent decrying mass school shootings on “Cooties” or as a rap star operating on his own terms on “Nunu.” Elevating the drama, the <i>Saw</i> soundtrack cue nods of “THank god 4 me” accent his emboldened bars targeting snitches, haters, and fakes.\n\nQ’s guest selection reflects a more curatorial ear at work than the gratifying star-power flexes found on <i>CrasH Talk</i>. Rico Nasty righteously snarls through her portion of the menacing “Pop,” while Freddie Gibbs glides across the slow funk groove of “oHio” with scene-stealing punchlines. A producer behind TDE records by Isaiah Rashad and REASON, Devin Malik steps out from behind the boards to touch the mic on a handful of cuts, namely “Love Birds” and the booming paean “Back n Love.”\n","short":"Five years later, the Top Dawg mainstay returns with his sixth album.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-lips/1730821885","playParams":{"id":"1730821885","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/107WsrBqn5xVPgystkziry"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730821885/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"333097675","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/333097675?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730850381":{"id":"1730850381","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730850381?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-02-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cravity/1507226584","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bd/09/5d/bd095d10-bf57-19b4-6438-904716e6cccf/fd940152-77eb-4b08-b92c-202706a93ac4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a3a6a8","textColor2":"bbccd9","textColor4":"9aa6b3","textColor1":"c7cccc","bgColor":"13111c","hasP3":false}},"name":"EVERSHINE -

On their subsequent debut album, 1989’s <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i>, the group—Trugoy, Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer), and DJ P.A. Pasemaster Mase (Vincent Mason)—and deliriously twisted producer Prince Paul laid out a 63-minute blueprint for rap’s odd future, a playful, quirky masterwork that popped the balloon of hip-hop formalism. They were outcasts before Outkast, the roots of The Roots, the big brothers to Little Brother. De La were alternative-nation thought-leaders doing for hip-hop what contemporary weirdos like Jane’s Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies were doing for rock. What started as a trio of rap misfits making leftfield funk ultimately evolved into the most consistently great catalog in New York hip-hop history.\n\nAfrika Bambaataa famously combed the corners of Planet Rock looking for the perfect beat, but De La’s genre-agnostic outlook to crate-digging imbued hip-hop with alien moods and new textures. Their tools weren’t just blips of James Brown and Funkadelic (though the latter’s rubbery melody would drive “Me Myself and I,” the band’s lone moment in the Top 40). De La Soul and Prince Paul’s playground included <i>Schoolhouse Rock!</i>, Steely Dan, learn-to-speak-French records, the Parliament song with the yodeling, Eddie Murphy, Johnny Cash, a Liberace cassette they found in the studio, loads of ’60s soul, and psychedelia-adjacent rock groups like The Turtles. (The latter group sued the trio that year, the first major sampling lawsuit, a historic moment for a historic album. The necessary work to clear all the samples from a career of creative copyright infringement helped keep the bulk of De La Soul’s catalog off streaming services for years.) “Everything we did on <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i> was based off ideas we had been putting together since we were 15, 16,” said Posdnuos.\n\nLighthearted skits and interludes filled the album with wacky accents, inside jokes (“What does, ‘Tuhs eht lleh pu’ mean?”), and whispered silliness. “Stand by Me” is looped for a 56-second song about body odor. Loopy slang words (either invented or inherited from fellow members of the Native Tongues crew) create an insular universe where sex songs are about “buddy” and “jenny,” something good is “strictly Dan Stuckie,” and your MCs for the evening are “Plug One” and “Plug Two.” Their freewheeling poetry—what they called a “Change in Speak”—broke sentences apart into expressionist clouds that ranged from pure poetry to inspired nonsense: “When that negative number fills up the cavity/Maybe you can subtract it/You can call it your lucky partner/Maybe you can call it your adjective.”\n\nProudly eccentric and preaching their message of self-expression while dressed in African medallions instead of fat gold ropes, they became the bohemian model for years of alternative-minded rappers. “We was trying to take it to the next place, letting people know there’s individuality here,” Trugoy said. “Not all of us have to wear Adidas; you could wear Le Coq Sportif.

Beyond the heroic artist portrait of DannyLux that graces its cover, <i>EVOLUXION</i> only further serves to showcase the vulnerability of this sad sierreño star. Along the twisting path of this nearly hour-and-a-half-long journey, he bears the damage of lost love with a certain familiarity on “ATRAPADO” and via genre-expanding opportunities like “LA LLUVIA.” Deeply relatable moments like “MALDITO ALCOHOL” and the cleverly executed “FERXXO 100” will no doubt soothe the tortured souls of his expanding fanbase, for whom his words provide not so much comfort as a sense of community. \n\nTo that end, he bounces between the romantic sentiments and gestures of “CIUDAD DEL SOL” and the wrecked ruminations of “AMAR Y PERDER” with surprising ease, perhaps getting somewhat used to the volatility that defines young love. As with his prior album <i>DLUX</i>, he brings other talented artists into the mix to excavate this emotional minefield. Frequent collaborators Eslabon Armado share his anxieties on the standout “ME CAMBIASTE,” while Gabito Ballesteros seeks shelter from heartbreak amid luxury on “DIME QUÉ HAY QUE HACER.” ","short":"The young star subtly builds upon his sad sierreño foundations.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evoluxion/1732139467","playParams":{"id":"1732139467","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2amMAPbRhZFTcoSu8pJpw0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732139467/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1523636464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1523636464?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732360582":{"id":"1732360582","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732360582?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"releaseDate":"2024-02-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anella-herim/1480977142","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Season 1: I Love You -

Hot on the heels of his fan-friendly 2023 joint album with Rick Ross comes <i>HEATHENISM</i>, the erstwhile Maybach Music Group rapper’s first independent EP. Though “Came From the Bottom” starts out like a potential return to the existential catharsis of his infamous “Dreams and Nightmares” intro, he boisterously dismisses any suspicion of this being a sad song. Instead, it hits with a triumphant beat-switch halfway through as he describes luxe living in the company of a bevy of baddies. Clearly he’s thriving, evident via the casual flexes of “Big Boy” and emboldened threats of “Times Like This.” On the feature front, drill don Fivio Foreign drops in to match his energy on “Whatever I Want,” while his reliable repeat collaborator Future serves the base from 30,000 feet in the air on “Giving Chanel.”","short":"Dreamchasers, assemble!
