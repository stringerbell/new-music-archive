made this record in two and a half weeks,” Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “People always go, ‘Whoa, you must've been really nervous, you haven't made a Black Crowes record in a hundred years.’ We're in here to get it. We've done everything that we've done because it feels good.”\n\nThe Black Crowes never slunk from excess, from the kind of glorious hyperbole that fortified the popular arrival of their anachronistic Southern rock strut at the exact moment grunge dominated the mainstream. There was, of course, the famous and relentless feud between Chris and Rich Robinson, respectively flamboyant and pensive brothers who evoked opposite sides of the same acid sheet. All of that jibed with records of extravagant indulgence—hour-long major-label escapades that declared freaks and priests belonged in the same congregation whether it was Saturday night or Sunday morning. The Black Crowes didn’t just want to sound rock ’n’ roll; they wanted to live its dichotomies, vainglories, and sagas, too. But after a 15-year stalemate that included an eight-year break without speaking, the Robinsons reconciled and have returned with an efficient and charged 37-minute album, <i>Happiness Bastards</i>, that posits the two have moved beyond mere rapprochement. \n\nThese 10 songs alternately ferry the pomp, grit, sneer, and swagger that made The Black Crowes interesting nearly 35 years ago, without the theatrics that always suggested they were actually trying twice as hard. Opener “Bedside Manners” finds Chris strutting around Rich’s sharp little riff like some lost ’70s rock god, dismissing a wanton lover one last time. With the help of stylistic descendant Lainey Wilson, they glide across and through the acoustic beauty of “Wilted Rose” like The Doobie Brothers dosed on both gospel and doom. And “Flesh Wound”—one of the sharpest and most surprising songs in their entire catalog, somewhere between Tom Petty sparkle and J. Geils Band verve—is the sort of song you want playing as you hit the road, leaving a love affair that only ever let you down.\n\nIn the context of The Black Crowes’ contentious past, it’s tempting to hear that and the other kiss-offs on <i>Happiness Bastards</i> as potential relics of a more fraught moment in the Family Robinson. Or when Chris sings “Tomorrow owes nothing to the past” early in the swaying closer “Kindred Friend,” a mea culpa for lost time, it’s easy to hear a fraternal apology. The Black Crowes, though, resonated the first time around not just because they supplied unabashed retro chic in spades but because they implied that classic rock done well had something timeless to offer. Arguably the least fussy and most focused record this long-wayward band has ever made, <i>Happiness Bastards</i> reinforces that idea and The Black Crowes’ place within it.\n","short":"The Brothers

Leonidas Kavakos, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and pianist Emanuel Ax continue on their thrilling <i>Beethoven for Three</i> journey through all the composer’s nine symphonies, this time showcasing No. 4.\n\nDeftly arranged here by pianist Shai Wosner, Symphony No. 4 is perhaps the least appreciated and known of all Beethoven’s nine symphonies, but in this trio’s hands it rightly emerges as one of the composer’s finest creations. In its trimmed-down scoring the anticipatory drama of the opening “Adagio” feels enhanced, while its explosion into the “Allegro vivace” is a thing of unbounded joy. \n\nThe “Adagio” second movement feels epic, its details beautifully spotlit. There’s a muscular richness to the playing that goes a long way to mimicking the original scoring’s breadth and depth. There are, however, so many glorious subtleties, as if Beethoven’s workings were laid out on a table for all to see. This is also true in the rambunctious “Allegro vivace” third movement and “Allegro ma non troppo” finale where the music dances with unstoppable energy. This feels as much like a new chamber work as a fresh reading of a colossal masterpiece.\n\nArranging large-scale works for small forces, whether piano duet, organ or, in this case, piano trio, is part of a long tradition. These scaled-down versions weren’t usually produced solely for the novelty—back in the 19th century and early 20th, they served a social purpose. Before the advent of recordings, audiences could only hear an orchestral performance at a live concert. Most neither had the means nor lived close enough to a venue large enough to hear great symphonic works in their original scorings. But experiencing them in chamber form was cost effective and, in the right arrangement, just as exciting. \n\nThese arrangements also opened the doors for home performances, as Yo-Yo Ma explains to Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe: “My good friend Manny Ax says that if you were interested in Beethoven’s symphonies in the 1800s up until the recording industry started happening, you might hear it twice in your life. The only other way you could hear it is if you played it yourself in a version for two pianos or for three people.” \n\nMa likens the advent of recording technology to the printing press. “Before the printing press,” he says, “that’s how you got the Bible. Someone who could read would read from it, but you didn’t have your own copy. If you want a Beethoven Symphony cover, you’re not going to hear it any other place. You’ve got to do it yourself. That’s before Edison came along.”\n\nThe album also includes a performance of Beethoven’s “Archduke” Trio from 1811, a work of sweeping grandeur, poise, and humor that proves the perfect vehicle for these finest of musicians. There’s even almost a sense that the piece could have started life as a symphony, such is the emotional strength of their account.","short":"Three classical stars bring their all to a chamber version of Beethoven’s Fourth.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-for-three-symphony-no-4-and-op-97-archduke/1725363052","playParams":{"id":"1725363052","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1725363052/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"275557","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/275557?l=en-US"},{"id":"31304425","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31304425?l=en-US"},{"id":"137760419","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/137760419?l=en-US"}]}}},"1726095840":{"id":"1726095840","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726095840?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tierra-whack/1209032442","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/dc/a0/87/dca087e6-6c2c-60be-9d45-3e0cf106bcc9/Job7356e991-4d3b-4147-884a-dde1e7bffac9-163107575-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315907578_1687282327-Time1708045793796.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"c2beb8","textColor2":"e3d9dc","textColor4":"b8afb3","textColor1":"f0ebe3","bgColor":"0c0a0c","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/80/d8/1c/80d81cfc-30dd-f97b-79e3-c151f23e6e72/77511106-04c9-46ec-aef5-3a9675617800.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0a5a7","textColor2":"cab6b1","textColor4":"a59592","textColor1":"d8cacc","bgColor":"111113","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/a4/3d/0d/a43d0d50-25e9-e6dc-a1d2-54f7931b8621/Jobefe5e6db-642e-488e-9450-85663ea74baf-163107576-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315907579_1687282330-Time1708046732587.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bfbebf","textColor2":"ebe2dd","textColor4":"bcb5b2","textColor1":"eeedef","bgColor":"030203","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/23/e3/3823e337-5871-7f27-cea8-2fe6b3bdaa9c/22f8fee4-f4d8-418f-b16b-819ffe358fd2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b4aaac","textColor2":"d7d0d6","textColor4":"afaaaf","textColor1":"ddd0d3","bgColor":"0f1013","hasP3":false}},"name":"WORLD WIDE WHACK","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tierra Whack","artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/37/02/a5/3702a50f-1e46-b541-2932-c3108e72ceb7/23UM1IM58229.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"c8bbc1","textColor2":"f5eadd","textColor4":"c4bbb1","textColor1":"fae9f1","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The hip-hop polymath built a reputation on witty freestyles that befitted her Philadelphia roots, then broke through in 2017 with “MUMBO JUMBO,” a purposefully unintelligible trap ditty that brought new resonance to the term “mumble rap” with a Grammy-nominated video that should come with a warning for those with dentophobia. Her debut album, 2018’s <i>Whack World</i>, crammed an LP’s worth of ideas into the time it takes to brew a pot of coffee: 15 sharp, surrealist minute-long tracks that veered from slapstick vocal hijinks to straight-ahead spitting, each accompanied by its own micro music video. The world Whack built was carnival-esque, all funhouse mirrors and sensory overload, with a darkness lingering at the edges.\n\nAside from a trio of three-song EPs (the tentatively titled <i>Rap?</i>, <i>Pop?</i>, and <i>R&B?</i>) released in 2021, Whack kept a puzzlingly low profile in the years that followed. The colorful critical darling who’d had so much to say in so little time had more or less gone quiet. Then, six years after <i>Whack World</i>, she announced <i>WORLD WIDE WHACK</i>, billed as the rapper’s real full-length debut. Early videos continued the high-concept ideas and cartoonish costumes, but listen awhile and you heard something new: naked vulnerability, almost shocking in its rawness. “I can show you how it feels when you lose what you love,” Whack sing-songs on the twinkling “27 CLUB,” looking like a cross between Pierrot the clown and Bootsy Collins. The hook was one word, drawn out into a wistful melody: “Suiciiiiide…”\n\nIn other words, there’s more to Whack’s world than you might expect. (“Might look familiar, but I promise you don’t know me,” she reminds you on the minute-and-change “MOOD SWING.”) Over the 15 songs of <i>WORLD WIDE WHACK</i>, the rapper grapples with real life, where echoes of abandonment and instances of suicidal ideation coexist with bursts of cockiness, uncertainty, lust, loneliness. The constant is her voice, thoughtful and brimming with ideas as ever. “BURNING BRAINS” is an expression of depressive thinking filtered through Whack’s imagistic lens: “Soup too hot, ice too cold, grass too green, sky too blue.” And there’s a great deal of whimsy, too, as on “SHOWER SONG,” a space-funk bop on the joys of singing in the bathroom.","short":"The hip-hop polymath grapples with ego, loneliness, uncertainty, and lust.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/world-wide-whack/1726095840","playParams":{"id":"1726095840","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/03n6Lqj31iP7ZtcRRWcefR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726095840/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1209032442","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1209032442?l=en-US"}]}}},"1727024213":{"id":"1727024213","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727024213?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/justin-timberlake/398128","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f8/57/4a/f8574ab3-5b86-92cf-94d1-3a37d9bc9236/Job269c88b0-f731-483b-b833-460a7a222c86-164557831-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319179463_1711415406-Time1710356800761.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","edb995"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b7adab","textColor2":"edb995","textColor4":"c5967a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/b8/28/b6/b828b60b-780f-c16c-edec-5926d4f775a1/4d411f32-54fe-4e23-87db-79d7fc91abdf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"291d13","textColor2":"211911","textColor4":"3c2e1f","textColor1":"090401","bgColor":"a68259","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/be/73/cebe73b3-fe1f-d03c-779c-310aa4595340/Jobd95662e3-3eef-488d-abdf-cf32114d4f71-164557832-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319179462_1711415407-Time1710361186194.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e2985e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c49c78","textColor2":"e2985e","textColor4":"be7e4f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/ab/a7/6e/aba76e53-1a99-4f58-dd7b-ef2958bf2457/612e01b4-3528-4344-8d5d-51b4d8cb23b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"26170e","textColor2":"060302","textColor4":"28170e","textColor1":"030202","bgColor":"b06a40","hasP3":false}},"name":"Everything I Thought It Was","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Justin Timberlake","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e4/dc/dd/e4dcdd8c-1adb-fee4-d5cf-a1faba79b1b0/196871753425.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"88a4b6","textColor2":"edb97f","textColor4":"c59766","textColor1":"a0c9e3","bgColor":"2a1002","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"A lot happened in the six years between Justin Timberlake’s last studio album, 2018’s <i>Man of the Woods</i>, and <i>Everything I Thought It Was</i>. After a world-changing pandemic, the pop star appeared in films, hopped on numerous collaborations (Jung Kook, Coco Jones, and Jack Harlow among them), and reunited at long last with his fellow *NSYNC members for the <i>Trolls Band Together</i> soundtrack. With <i>Everything I Thought It Was</i>, Timberlake is back to creating for himself. “I think there are moments that are incredibly honest,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But also, there’s a lot of fucking fun on this album.”\n\nAs <i>Man of the Woods</i> was a tribute to Timberlake’s family and Tennessee roots, <i>Everything I Thought It Was</i> is a homecoming in its own way. Opening track “Memphis” is a pensive reflection on his hometown and the pressures of doing it proud: “You’re the one that’s chosen to make it out/Gotta seize the moment, don’t let us down.” He revisits his boy-band days with yet another new *NSYNC team-up, “Paradise,” whose simple guitar melodies highlight the quintet’s harmonies in all their timeless splendor. \n\nWith help from producers including Calvin Harris and longtime collaborators Timbaland and Danja, <i>Everything I Thought It Was</i> is Timberlake’s return to peak pop-R&B form and a credible sequel to his club-influenced 2006 LP <i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i>. Beyond the breakup ballads (“Drown”) and syrupy seductions (“Play”), the album glides across the dance floor with hip-grinding electro-R&B (“What Lovers Do”), Afrobeats (“Liar” featuring Fireboy DML), and sweat-slicked disco grooves, occasionally throwing curveballs with beat switches (“My Favorite Drug”) and delivering a modern-day “Rock Your Body” in “Fuckin’ Up the Disco.” \n\n“I think that's where I came up with the album title,” Timberlake says. “I was playing it for people around me. They're like, ‘Oh, this sounds like everything we know you for.’ And then another friend of mine was like, ‘Oh, this sounds like everything I thought I wanted from you.’ It was like that sort of phrase, in one way or another, was in the air.”\n","short":"Bringing shades of “SexyBack” back on his first album in six years.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything-i-thought-it-was/1727024213","playParams":{"id":"1727024213","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/44e3xckIbDMtFm8jeZLLZ7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727024213/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"398128","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/398128?l=en-US"}]}}},"1727772363":{"id":"1727772363","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727772363?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/merry-lamb-lamb/1035505252","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Exodus (Remixes) - EP","artistName":"Merry Lamb Lamb","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/c3/cf/1c/c3cf1c3a-cd1b-b222-5604-68bfce7b9b36/2472.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfc8cc","textColor2":"f3f2f7","textColor4":"c3c2c7","textColor1":"effaff","bgColor":"040404","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/exodus-remixes-ep/1727772363","playParams":{"id":"1727772363","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1727772363/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1035505252","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1035505252?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728540492":{"id":"1728540492","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728540492?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/holly-humberstone/1495433177","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/4d/9b/664d9b00-7805-70d8-cca8-9bb06caa274d/ee1da18f-3f4a-40a6-adc3-6cf8aaff75ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c3ac","textColor2":"e8ebe7","textColor4":"bebfbc","textColor1":"f5efd3","bgColor":"141311","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e9/8c/f8/e98cf87b-a379-963b-f5e6-5e5da3ffb413/757d9c39-c435-473b-b027-18b47e2ea678.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2a2b27","textColor2":"2f251f","textColor4":"4b433b","textColor1":"060606","bgColor":"babeae","hasP3":false}},"name":"work in progress - EP","artistName":"Holly Humberstone","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/34/97/ef/3497ef6a-c7d0-5fc0-01c6-22ac7aad73d2/24UMGIM05447.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b4b6ab","textColor2":"7dcccd","textColor4":"6aa8a9","textColor1":"daded0","bgColor":"1f1616","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"“I’ve made enough mistakes/To fill up the oceans, babe,” sings Holly Humberstone in the opening verse of “Dive,” the gauzy first track on <i>work in progress</i>.

Over pared-back synths and warm chords, the BRIT Award-winning singer-songwriter leaves room for growth and understanding as she laments her missteps and stumbles.

Four Tet is the rare artist who has managed to knock it down. The endlessly curious English producer Kieran Hebden—who has been bridging gaps between far-apart sounds like spiritual jazz, indie rock, R&B, and techno since the late ’90s—surprised fans in 2023 when he teamed up with main-stage party boys Skrillex and Fred again.., transforming Coachella and Madison Square Garden into pop-up raves. What had become of their underground darling? But Hebden isn’t one to unpack. Here, on his 12th full-length, he veers back into the cerebral sounds he’s known for: lush, patient, radiant soundscapes that verge on meditations.\n\n“Daydream Repeat,” a clear standout, is twinkling and weightless, the sort of flow-state reverie that can lift you outside of yourself. “31 Bloom” has similarly club-friendly grooves but feels fully rooted, with synths and drums that rub together like sneakers across a dance floor. But no track stretches quite like the mystical, New Age-y “Three Drums,” an eight-minute panorama of birdsong flutes, rainfall textures, and pulsing synths that echo Moby’s 1999 hit “Porcelain.” As the song unfolds into an ambient canvas of sound waves and sighs, it begins to feel less like music and more like breath—a blissful sanctuary to slip into and get lost in. As a destination, it isn’t too far from that of his big-tent contemporaries; dance music, in essence, is about freedom and release. In that way, <i>Three</i> finds Hebden doing what he does best: finding clever, unexpected ways to bring disparate listeners into the same space.","short":"After shaking up mainstream dance music, Four Tet reenters his flow state.","tagline":"New Album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/three/1729585296","playParams":{"id":"1729585296","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7mpTSR6E855VhdCeoPgpCF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729585296/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"35888604","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/35888604?l=en-US"}]}}},"1730935061":{"id":"1730935061","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730935061?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rising-sun/111648362","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Eternal","artistName":"Rising Sun","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/a2/80/53/a2805398-3ec5-833c-8f0d-4e6e507f7beb/4250101467653_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"323633","textColor2":"003336","textColor4":"2f5759","textColor1":"040907","bgColor":"eee9e3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-eternal/1730935061","playParams":{"id":"1730935061","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/53igit3YBM2ehbWlyvnqNw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1730935061/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"111648362","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/111648362?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732027972":{"id":"1732027972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732027972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1084277564-315660493","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Tribalism EP","artistName":"PUSHMANN & Fixon","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/ec/1a/75/ec1a7569-3d9a-5b9f-246e-b33553931a27/198391228094.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4c4240","textColor2":"482d24","textColor4":"6c5750","textColor1":"201310","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-tribalism-ep/1732027972","playParams":{"id":"1732027972","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5R3LAdblVF7Irk6FYjhTwM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732027972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1084277564","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1084277564?l=en-US"},{"id":"315660493","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/315660493?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732146670":{"id":"1732146670","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732146670?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryce-dessner/220281501","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/55/b5/3d55b591-1be3-c9e1-a6bc-53b73fe31636/aed6d2ac-8706-4a24-b641-c0ce7ff992c7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0b894","textColor2":"f2b67c","textColor4":"c29263","textColor1":"f0e7b8","bgColor":"010001","hasP3":false}},"name":"Manhunt (Apple TV+ Original Series Soundtrack)","artistName":"Bryce Dessner","artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/04/15/e4/0415e45c-3bd4-da9e-75a7-d619406bd5a7/5059449167237.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"592b24","textColor2":"420000","textColor4":"632b24","textColor1":"360000","bgColor":"e7d7b8","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/manhunt-apple-tv-original-series-soundtrack/1732146670","playParams":{"id":"1732146670","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64GUQpq6y7LssTvYmYqONB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732146670/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"220281501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/220281501?l=en-US"}]}}},"1732249477":{"id":"1732249477","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732249477?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2024-03-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/u/1429080109","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Parade / Watchers -

After teasing listeners over the past couple of years with loosies opposite the likes of Ozuna and Peso Pluma, the Medellín native drops a focused EP with none other than Myke Towers by his side. In line with his producer’s core strengths, the Puerto Rican trapero turned reggaetonero leans into the latter style here, resulting in the pop-wise perreo moment “DESATAAA” with Saiko as well as more overtly tropical ones like “AMOR NARCOTICO.” Interestingly enough, the pair favor slower tempos more often than not, evident on “TU CUERPO ME LLAMA” and the hypnotic La Joaqui duet “BELLAQUERIA.” Representative of Ovy’s expansive palette, an Afrobeats element pervades “POBRE DIABLA,” while “GODIVA” with Blessd and Ryan Castro gives off a rootsier reggae vibe that nods not so subtly to his chosen genre’s origins.","short":"Medellín’s hitmaker meets the Puerto Rican rapper for reggaetón greatness.","tagline":"New

Her 2022 follow-up <i>You Still Here, Ho ?</i> kept up that momentum with songs like “Bed Time” and “Conceited,” signaling her pop chops to those who dared to count her out. Whether a continuation of or conclusion to the more-than-implied titular saga, <i>Fine Ho, Stay</i> serves to solidify her position as the worthy successor to a proud tradition of brash women in rap. \n\nIf the explicit opener “Understand” and its bar-by-bar punchlines somehow don’t make it clear enough, Flo Milli operates on a different level than the competition. It certainly doesn’t hurt that she broke big on the charts with “Never Lose Me,” included here as a remix with SZA and Cardi B features as well as in its original solo take. The supreme energy of that big hit resonates with the similarly sleek “Can’t Stay Mad” and “Life Hack.” Working with seasoned producers like Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E. and Lex Luger, she drops post-trap anthems “New Me” and the Monaleo-backed “Neva” opposite winking Southern rap throwbacks like “Got the Juice.” The sole male guest she deigns to allow on the record, Gunna, rightfully treats her like a lady on his gentlemanly “Edible” verse.
