Album and Interview","standard":"In the early 2000s, few would have bet on The Libertines making it to a fourth album album at all, let alone one as robust as <i>All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade</i>. Intra-band strife, prison, and Pete Doherty’s well-documented drug problems seemed to have scuppered the mercurial talent shown on 2002 debut <i>Up the Bracket</i> and 2004’s self-titled follow-up for good. However, following 2015’s galvanizing reformation album, <i>Anthems for Doomed Youth</i>, <i>All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade</i> finds the good ship Albion coming ashore with one of the strongest sets of songs of the band’s career. On an album recorded at The Albion Rooms, the group’s studio-cum-hotel in (UK seaside town) Margate, Kent, the ramshackle charm which sometimes felt like their songs could collapse at any moment has been bolstered by something far more muscular and sturdy. Rollicking opening track “Run Run Run” lands like The Clash at their anthemic peak, while closer “Songs They Never Play on the Radio” transforms a tune Doherty has been tinkering with in various forms for years into a swooning, Beatles-esque ballad.\n\nWhere Libertines songs of old sprung from a mythical vision of England conjured from Doherty and fellow singer/guitarist/songwriter Carl Barât’s imagination, here they’re more rooted in the here and now. “Mustangs” is populated by a litany of colorful characters observed around Margate, Barât singing about day-drinking mums, day-dreaming nuns, and 24/7 ne’er-do-wells over a glorious Stones-y groove. While “Merry Old England” looks at a land of discarded crisp packets and B&B vouchers from the perspective of migrants traveling to the UK looking for work. “It’s a rich tapestry,” Doherty tells Apple Music. “It’s not just about Margate, it’s about England. I don’t think the English realize how the rest of the world gazes upon us with curiosity and wonder and bafflement, really.” Read on for Doherty and Barât’s track-by-track guide.\n\n<b>“Run Run Run”</b>\nPD: “It’s a bit of a belter that one, I love it. It’s got a bit of a Squeeze thing going on.”\nCB: “The song doesn’t have to be about running away from your past. It’s about running because that’s what you do. It can be in terror, or it can be a thing of great elation or purpose.”\nPD: “It’s just how you get your kicks, baby.”\nCB: “Yeah. It can be processing a trauma or getting your kicks. Either way.”\n\n<b>“Mustangs”</b>\nPD: “We spent an endless amount of time trying to get this together which isn’t normally our style. At one point it had 10 verses.”\nCB: “It was like a Velvet Underground epic. It was my [T.S. Eliot poem] ‘The Waste Land.’ It took a lot of shuffling in the sand to get that one to settle. It’s got a summer air to it, that kind of looseness. It’s got a Lou Reed-y narrative to it about all these characters in Margate.”\n\n<b>“I Have a Friend”</b>\nCB: “That’s a topical song given it’s about war and what’s going on in Ukraine.”\nPD: “It’s hard to look away from that. A few of us in the band have got Russian and Ukrainian roots. It was too much for me to take, we had to sit down and talk about it which merged into ‘I Have a Friend.’ It was just a desperate cry from all the darkness and confusion of all of this. I kept saying, ‘NATO are going to step in any day, are we too old to enlist?’ I said to my wife, ‘We can’t just sit here and watch it, we’ve got to go!’ She said, ’We’ve got a two-week-old baby.’”\n\n<b>“Merry Old England”</b>\nPD: “The people who travel here and risk life and limb to come to England and try and make a life for themselves is something we spend quite a lot of time talking about. A lot of these people are trained doctors, they speak four or five languages. It’s not that I’m pro-illegal immigration, I’ve just got this thing against borders. It’s very easy to create fear and anger and hostility about people.”\nCB: “It’s about discussing something that’s topical. There’s no didactic approach from us. Maybe we do have opinions, but it’s just a good song.”\n\n<b>“Man With the Melody”</b>\nCB: “That’s as old as time, that song.”\nPD: “From back when we were in Kentish Town. We didn’t have a B&B or our own recording studio or a bar. All we had was John [Hassall, bassist]’s basement with our little amps. He’d sit there in his skintight Dairy Queen T-shirt and his cowboy boots strumming this mad little song. We were secretly jealous of it because it was so melodic. So we took it apart, stripped it down and put it back together, put our own bits in and gave it a lick of paint. It’s got this creeping, gothic, Bram Stoker-ish element to it.”\nCB: “That’s Gary [Powell, drummer]’s singing debut. I think it’s the first time we’ve all sung on a song and shared it like that.”\n\n<b>“Oh Shit”</b>\nCB: “It’s essentially about the proprietor of The Albion Rooms and her husband. It’s about these young people jacking in their lives and just doing something different and worlds apart. It’s that sort of romance of the road, having no regard for their own immediate safety or life past what’s just straight in front of their faces, and being in love and all the experiences that come with that.”\n\n<b>“Night of the Hunter”</b>\nPD: “There’s a lot of references to tattoos. I’ve always been fascinated by that thing of ‘love’ and ‘hate’ tattooed on the knuckles. When we play it live it really slows down and I like this idea of all these people singing along to ‘ACAB’ which stands for ‘All coppers are bastards,’ which is an old skinhead tattoo. Prison is mostly full of young men, but you always get that old lag in there and they’ve got these weird tattoos and you make the mistake of asking, ‘Oh, what do those dots mean?’ Then you’re like, ‘Oh, fuck…’ You hear some really dark stuff.”\n\n<b>“Baron’s Claw”</b>\nPD: “That was mostly born in The Albion Rooms. We were all sleeping there and trying to put the album together. I had these chords and I was playing them and Carl’s room is directly above where I was sitting. It was six or seven in the morning and I was playing it louder and louder, just hoping that it would somehow penetrate his dreams. So I opened the window and then I was playing it on the stairs. He finally came down a bit grumpy, as he tends to be in the morning, and I thought, ‘I’ll wait for him to say something…’ And he didn’t. I waited and waited and then finally I got a little ‘So, was that a new tune, then?’ [from him]. Because I don’t think he believed it was.”\nCB: “You’re lucky. In the old days, if you were playing outside my window I would have told you to shut the fuck up.”\nPD: “The song’s about this quite shameful episode in our history when we [Britain] funded the White Russians against the Bolsheviks. This guy is over there with a unit of White Russians fighting the Red Army and then comes back without a hand. Is it based on a true story? Why not? It could have happened!”\n\n<b>“Shiver”</b>\nPD: “If you did a DNA test on that song it would be 23 percent me, 25 percent American bully, a bit of sausage dog, a bit of Scottish terrier, a dash of dachshund…It went on a lot of weird deviations that song.”\nCB: “We were in Jamaica and we wrote a really misty-eyed ballad about 25 years of friendship and going from rack and ruin and dreams and reasons for staying alive. We cut it down and used the middle eight for ‘Shiver’ and the other song got thrown on the scrapheap. That’s how decadent art can be.”\nPD: “It turns out with ‘Shiver’ that we’ve actually made a half-decent pop song. That song’s had more radio play in its first month than [debut single] ‘What a Waster’ has had in 25 years.”\n\n<b>“Be Young”</b>\nPD: “The message of this song was to be young and fall in love, because we were coming out with all this depressing data about the planet’s impending doom. We wrote it in Jamaica as this hurricane was crashing through the Caribbean. We just thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all this stuff in here about being born astride a grave and the world boiling in oil, so let’s throw in a chorus about just being young and in love.’”\nCB: “It’s difficult to write a song like that. Jim Morrison could say, ‘I just want to get my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames.’ But he died in 1971, do you know what I mean? Now, you can’t have that mentality. You can’t say, ‘Just be young and fall in love.’”\nPD: “A lot of people do though, a lot of them just don’t give a fuck.”\nCB: “And more fool them.”\n\n<b>“Songs They Never Play on the Radio”</b>\nPD: “We got that song together years ago, at the very beginning. It’s got a checkered past. It’s like an old mate who you really believed in and you’ll always have a place for him in your heart, but he just sort of seemed to fade away. But then, it turns out he’s written the jingle for the new Audi advert and he’s sitting in a fucking mansion.”\nCB: “The bastard.”\nPD: “I took it under my wing and made it all jangly and jazzy. I could never quite do it with Babyshambles and I could never quite do it on my own, so I brought it to the table for this one. And then John said, ‘Why don’t you try it like this?’ He turned it into this Beatles thing, and it completely turned it on its head. I was aghast. We wrote another verse, gave it a lick of paint and here it is.”","short":"The revitalized Libs deliver album four: “It’s a rich tapestry,” says Pete

Arriving after the group spent a few years exploring collaboration (including 2022’s <i>Ali</i> with the Malian guitarist Vieux Farka Touré and the R&B-centric <i>Texas Sun</i> and <i>Texas Moon</i> EPs with singer Leon Bridges), <i>A La Sala</i> goes back to the bass/guitar/drum-and-occasional-distant-vocals setup they managed to get so much mileage out of in the first place. The collection conjures the psychedelia of spaghetti western soundtracks (“Ada Jean”), the pop of West African funk (“Pon Pón”), and the whispered intimacy of indie folk (“May Ninth“) in strokes so minimal it almost breezes by. Of course, breezing is what this band does by design, and in their range, they give you an album as varied as a mixtape and as gently communicative as a great lamp—you know, the kind of thing that can change the whole mood just by turning it on.","short":"Sunset soundtracks from a band that finds their bliss and stays

Album and Interview","standard":"The Black Keys have spent the past two decades carrying the banner of blues-rock revivalism into the present. The duo have sold more records than most pop stars and have proven, time and time again, that rock has always been here—if you were willing to look. The band, made up of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney, emerged from Akron, Ohio, in the early aughts as a welcome counterbalance to what was monopolizing record shelf space at the time. The New York City alternative scene was thriving, with bands including The Strokes, LCD Soundsystem, and Interpol dictating the sound coming out of venues, warehouses, and loft spaces up and down the East Coast. \n\nAuerbach and Carney, meanwhile, were crafting a sound that was more Mississippi Delta than Mercury Lounge. The duo’s shared love of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Thin Lizzy, and T. Rex formed the foundation of their lo-fi sound, and they spent the next two decades expanding their range, introducing elements of psychedelia and big-chorus anthems that made them festival-headlining mainstays. \n\nNow, The Black Keys are returning with album number 12, the aptly titled <i>Ohio Players</i>, a project that bubbles over with the energy of two dudes just here for a good time. “I think once we experienced success, it was like, ‘Let’s try to keep it going and not make the same record again,’” Carney tells ALT CTRL Radio’s Hanuman Welch. “But what happened during this process was the pandemic hits, and after a year of not seeing each other, we walk in the studio to start working on our next record, and something had just changed between us. It was like we finally became best friends; everything was enjoyable. Creatively, we were starting to kind of push things a little bit, but as soon as we finished [2022 album] <i>Dropout Boogie</i>, before it was even released, we started working on this record. The intention was to call our friends to come in and work with us.” \n\nPast collaborations have netted The Black Keys the sort of accolades other bands work their entire careers hoping to achieve. The duo’s <i>El Camino</i>, co-produced by Danger Mouse, won Grammys for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Performance in 2013. But <i>Ohio Players</i> is the first time the band has truly collaborated in the sense of sharing writing and performing duties. And then they brought on some friends. \n\nThe album’s first single, “Beautiful People (Stay High),” was co-written by Beck and Dan the Automator, and is the result of supporting Beck on tour 20 years ago after meeting him at a 2003 <i>SNL</i> after-party. “I just busted out this promo CD,” Carney remembers. “And I was like, ‘This is my band.’ And two weeks later, Beck reached out and took us on tour. So, this track is a result of this relationship and fandom that I have for Beck. We’ve been talking about making music off and on for years, and right when we finished our last record, we’re like, ‘Get down, it’s time.’” \n\nThe Black Keys managed to enlist another generational talent for the project: Oasis’ Noel Gallagher. “[Collaboration] can always fall flat on its face,” says Carney. “And so, we basically spent 80 grand running the gamble of, ‘This could not work,’ because we didn't have a song. So, we booked the smallest, tiniest studio in London, really, Toe Rag—it’s where The White Stripes did <i>Elephant</i>. It was, like, zero frills. We showed up, and Noel was there—a guy we’ve briefly met a couple of times, and a legend—and we’re now going to write a song from scratch. Within two hours, we had it, and within another two hours, we had the take. Noel was like, ‘I’ve never actually done this before.’” \n\nTwo decades in, the novelty of working with people whose music they love still hasn’t worn off. “The thing I’m most proud of, as a fan of

Album","standard":"Gen Z pop star and low-key fashion icon Conan Gray summons the glam-pop gods on his third studio album, <i>Found Heaven</i>, which builds on the synth-pop odysseys of his 2022 breakthrough <i>Superache</i>. The album finds Gray singing of love lost and heartbreak, shining a light on the lonely and desperate, those looking for a hand or simply a path forward. On the disco-tinged “Lonely Dancers,” he implores those looking for a temporary home to follow him as he sings, “We’re lonely dancers, join me for the night/We’re lonely dancers, baby/Dance with me so we don’t cry.” There’s a beauty in owning your vulnerability, and Gray makes that a philosophy of the album.\n\n“Miss You” is an icy number with ’80s New Wave chic during the verses—before reaching for the dance floors during the euphoric choruses. “Forever With Me” is built for the credit sequence of a John Hughes film, mixing Queen-esque harmonies with ecstatic dedications to the underdog. This theme is most apparent on the triumphant album closer “Winner,” a piano ballad in the vein of pop classics from Elton John and Warren Zevon. He sings, “The only thing you’ve proven is that there’s no one who ever has done better/At makin’ me feel worse/Now you really are the winner.” Even in the jaws of heartbreak, there’s a certain grace in owning the pain.\n","short":"The synth-pop of 2022’s Superache gets a glam

debut. Across seven tracks, the chameleonic singer brings elements of hard rock, soul, and rootsy pop to his take on country, landing somewhere between the sounds of contemporaries like Bailey Zimmerman and Old Dominion.\n\nThe EP opens with single “Bulletproof,” a fiery take on the country trope of trying to drown heartbreak in bourbon. The acclaimed husband-and-wife duo The War and Treaty joins Smith on “Make It with You,” a swelling folk-pop love song that softens Smith’s edges and makes good use of the Trotters’ powerhouse voices. “Here’s to Hometowns” glides effortlessly on a smooth and catchy melody while offering a laundry list of what makes home special. Smith closes the project on an unexpected note, faithfully covering the 1993 Nirvana classic “Heart-Shaped Box.”","short":"A varied and surprising seven-track follow-up to his 2023 debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/through-the-smoke/1728492234","playParams":{"id":"1728492234","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5rQ9bj7fCon5qGgve7QmzL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728492234/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1468317180","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1468317180?l=en-US"}]}}},"1728945682":{"id":"1728945682","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728945682?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vampire-weekend/259437105","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/14/c3/06/14c306fd-807a-c231-10fb-1fb69e427fc3/30e7a1aa-38c0-4ea4-8789-5fdb240cb51e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"0a2317","textColor2":"040504","textColor4":"0b2417","textColor1":"020403","bgColor":"29a165","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a7/09/fa/a709fac6-2442-33b0-eb3b-7628ac936fd1/5384dfb1-eeb3-43ad-ac7d-349820c3ab26.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"0a2617","textColor2":"070607","textColor4":"0e251a","textColor1":"020804","bgColor":"28a265","hasP3":false}},"name":"Only God Was Above Us","artistName":"Vampire Weekend","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f9/9f/ed/f99fed7a-3b13-3531-3db6-fac34e1d1c7c/196871790307.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfb8a6","textColor2":"b6c3cb","textColor4":"98a2a7","textColor1":"fbdec9","bgColor":"1e1d18","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"There’s a sense of optimism that comes through Vampire Weekend’s fifth album that makes it float, a sense of hope—a little worn down, a little roughed up, a little tired and in need of a shave, maybe—but hope nonetheless. “By the time you’re pushing 40, you’ve hit the end of a few roads, and you’re probably looking for something—I don’t know what to say—a little bit deeper,” Ezra Koenig tells Apple Music. “And you’re thinking about these ideas. Maybe they’re corny when you’re younger. Gratitude. Acceptance. All that stuff. And I think that’s infused in the album.”\n\nTake something like “Mary Boone,” whose worries and reflections (“We always wanted money, now the money’s not the same”) give way to an old R&B loop (Soul II Soul’s “Back to Life”). Or the way the piano runs on “Connect”—like your friend fumbling through a Gershwin tune on a busted upright in the next room—bring the song’s manic energy back to earth. Musically, they’ve never sounded more sophisticated, but they’ve also never sounded sloppier or more direct (“Prep-School Gangsters”). \n\nThey’re a tuxedo with ripped Converse or a garage band with a full orchestra (“Ice Cream Piano”). And while you can trainspot the micro-references and little details of their indie-band sound (produced brilliantly by Koenig and longtime collaborator Ariel Rechtshaid), what you remember most is the big picture of their songs, which are as broad and comforting as great pop (“Classical”). “Sometimes I talk about it with the guys,” Koenig says. “We always need to have an amateur quality to really be us. There needs to be a slight awkward quality. There needs to be confidence and awkwardness at the same time.”\n\nNext to the sprawl of <i>Father of the Bride</i>, <i>OGWAU</i> (“og-wow”—try it) feels almost like a summary of the incredible 2007-2013 run that made them who they are. But they’re older now, and you can hear that, too, mostly in how playful and relaxed the album is. Listen to the jazzy bass and prime-time saxophone on “Classical” or the messy drums on “Prep-School Gangsters” (courtesy of Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes), or the way “Hope” keeps repeating itself like a school-assembly sing-along. It’s not cool music, which is of course what makes it so inimitably cool.\n\nNot that they seem to worry about that stuff anymore. “I think a huge element for that is time, which is a weird concept,” Koenig says. ”Some people call it a construct. I’ve heard it’s not real. That’s above my pay grade, but I will say, in my experience, time is great because when you’re bashing your head against the wall, trying to figure out how to use your brain to solve a problem, and when you learn how to let go a little bit, time sometimes just does its thing.” For a band that once announced themselves as the preppiest, most ambitious guys in the indie-rock room, letting go is big.","short":"Ezra Koenig and co. dare to feel hope: “Gratitude.

After making the tough decision to part ways with her producer, she surrounded herself with a full band, re-recorded most of the songs, and assembled a project that confronts a breakup’s gray areas (on “Drunk, Running,” she wonders if she’s partly to blame for an ex’s struggles with sobriety). McAlpine ordered the songs on the album to trace the arc of the relationship, culminating in four tracks that illustrate the perspective she gained. Read on to discover the story behind each song.\n\n<b>“The Elevator”</b>\n“When I decided to remake the album with a band, I knew I wanted it to have a proper, cool intro. This song was the first one we recorded together. We didn’t even have a drummer yet. But it felt right. And it was proof of concept, like, ‘OK, we’re going to be able to do this.’” \n\n<b>“Come Down Soon”</b>\n“This was one of the first songs that I wrote for the album in 2021. It’s gone through a lot of different iterations, and only when I brought it to the band did it begin to make sense. Prior to that, we were just putting pieces together one by one, and it wasn’t working. Finally, I realized this music needs a band behind it. A collective force.” \n\n<b>“Like It Tends To Do”</b>\n“This was the first song I wrote for this project, back when I was finishing up <i>five seconds flat</i>. Immediately it was my favorite song I’d ever written. It felt like some of my best songwriting. I knew it deserved its own place on a different project.” \n\n<b>“Movie Star”</b>\n“I wrote this with my friend Olivia Barton who opened for me on my last tour. We initially had a wild outro that was full of electric guitars and big drums. But when we got into the studio with the band, we realized that ‘Elevator’ had a similar arc and sound. So we cut the whole outro out of this one and now it’s just a short, simple little song. I think it’s so much better this way.” \n\n<b>“All Falls Down”</b>\n“I wrote this one when I was on tour, which is weird. I never write songs on the road because I hate touring, so I’m usually pretty miserable and uninspired. But I guess this was different because I was writing it about <i>that feeling</i>. Originally, it was slow and ballad-y because that’s what the lyrics feel like, but it evolved into this fun, upbeat number. I love that juxtaposition.” \n\n<b>“Staying”</b>\n“This was supposed to be a really short interlude, and it had this outro section that I had written that my old producer suggested we cut. But later, when I took it to the band and they jammed on it, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m actually going to add the outro back in. I think it could be cool.’ And now it’s my favorite part of the song. I’m so glad I decided to do that, and that I didn’t let that producer’s opinion sway me.” \n\n<b>“I Guess”</b>\n“Most of the time, in my revisions with the band, we were taking a lot of stuff out. It didn’t feel like the original recordings had enough space, had room to breathe. This one was sort of the opposite. It had a lot we wanted to keep—strings, drums, horns. Instead, we just layered in some additional elements—guitar, piano, and bass chords—to try to make it cooler.” \n\n<b>“Drunk, Running”</b>\n“I wrote this song after I was out of the relationship [that this album is about] and pretty far removed from it. I went out with my friends one night and my ex was there; we were at a bar and he was ignoring me and just looked really miserable. I was like, ‘Damn, this is hard to watch.’ This song is about that experience, and our time together before that. I ordered the tracks in a very specific way to carry you from the beginning of the relationship into the second half, where things start to devolve and get really toxic. ‘Drunk, Running’ is the beginning of that toxic chapter. The bridge is kind of like, ‘Oh God, what if I did this to you? What if I made you this way? I’m so sorry for staying when I should have left.’ It’s me realizing my part that I played.” \n\n<b>“Broken Glass”</b>\n“I played this one on my last tour. The original version was done. I love this song so much and think it fits perfectly in this spot on the album. It’s just really dark.” \n\n<b>“You Forced Me To”</b>\n“I wrote this song during a recording session when I stepped outside to take a break. I went home that night and recorded it on my laptop, and that’s what you hear. We didn’t re-record anything. When I went to the band and I played them this demo, they were like, ‘That’s it. We don’t need to do anything.’ And Mason [Stoops] in particular—he’s our guitar player, and kind of the leader of the band—he was adamant about me being the only person credited.” \n\n<b>“Older”</b>\n“This song changed everything for me. I had the first verse and chorus written in a voice memo that I’d kind of forgotten about because my first producer thought it might be too Disney. But when I played it for Mason and Taylor [Mackall], they were immediately like, ‘No, this is amazing.’ The only issue was that I didn’t know how to finish it, since by the time we revisited it, I was so far removed from the intensity of that breakup. They suggested I write about where I am now. Doing that tied the whole song together for me, and cemented the album’s entire concept. It unlocked everything. We finished the song in 20 minutes, did three takes, used the third one, and never looked back.” \n\n<b>“Better Than This”</b>\n“I knew I wanted to update this song from the original version, so the band and I did a bunch of live takes. That was generally our process throughout. We’d do a bunch of live takes, pick one, and then pepper stuff on top of it. I loved that the core of the album was live recordings—everyone huddled in a room. It felt like that was the only way to approach this project, and this song in particular.”\n\n<b>“March”</b>\n“This song is about my dad, who passed away in 2020. Every 13th track on all of my albums is about him. He passed away on the 13th of March, and my first album came out on the 13th, and there were 13 tracks, and the 13th track was about him. I didn’t really plan that, but it created a tradition. I don’t really write about my dad with anyone because it’s just really heavy and personal, but I wrote this song with [songwriter/composer] Ethan [Gruska] who made me feel safe and open. Recording it was amazing. It feels so warm when the band comes in. It’s a hug for your ears.” \n\n<b>“Vortex”</b>\n“This song was supposed to be the title of the album for so long, but again, it felt like tunnel vision. This album is, ultimately, about so much more than a breakup. But I still thought it was a perfect way to end the project. I love that the lyrics are forward-facing and hopeful, like, ‘Someday I will be strong enough to say no to you,’ or ‘Someday I’ll be strong enough to let this go.’ The gist is: I may not be there yet, but I know I will be.”","short":"Cathartic reflections on coming of age from one of folk-pop's rising

Mini Album","standard":"Five years after their debut, TOMORROW X TOGETHER takes the time to reflect back on their journey so far. From a short, Morse-code-only track that calls back to the iconic opening of debut single “CROWN” to a song called “I’ll See You There Tomorrow” to another about connecting with their past selves, <i>minisode 3: TOMORROW</i> is the K-pop quintet’s most self-referential album to date.\n\nImagined as mini-album interludes between chapters of a larger musical story, TXT’s “minisode” series began with 2020’s <i>minisode1 : Blue Hour</i>, a breezy five-track pop album written during the initial phases of the pandemic that tells the story of a teen boy struggling to ground himself in a changing world. The story got more intense with 2022’s <i>minisode 2: Thursday’s Child</i>, a five-track exploration of the feelings of grief, anger, and denial that can come with someone’s first breakup. \n\n<i>minisode 3: TOMORROW</i> takes as its theme the promises we make to ourselves as we grow. In lead single “Deja Vu,” Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and HueningKai sing to their past selves, comforting the versions of themselves who first dreamed of success. Designed as an optimistic progression from TXT’s previous release, 2023 studio album <i>The Name Chapter: FREEFALL</i>, <i>minisode 3: TOMORROW</i> is ultimately about finding courage and comfort in an uncertain world: “There’ll be no more sorrow/I’ll see you there tomorrow.” Here is what Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and HueningKai had to say about each of the tracks:\n\n<b>“I’ll See You There Tomorrow”</b>\nBeomgyu: “This song will instantly make you feel better with its catchy chorus melody. I think it really captures the sleek freshness of our sound.”\n\n<b>“- --- -- --- ·-· ·-· --- ·–”</b>\nSoobin: “There’s a title that’ll catch people’s attention—it’s Morse code for ‘tomorrow.’”\n\n<b>“Deja Vu”</b>\nYeonjun: “This one features our heartfelt vocals, with lyrics that will remind you of our earlier stuff. We’re also bringing something a bit different to this song—I hope you find it as exciting as we do!”\n\n<b>“Miracle”</b>\nHueningKai: “The lyrics on this song are so warm and tender. It’s about how every moment spent with you is like a miracle. It’s also got a moving melody that will get you right in the feels. ❤️”\n\n<b>“The Killa (I Belong to You)”</b>\nSoobin: “This is the first track from our hyung line unit. It’s got a sultry, sexy vibe to it.”\nYeonjun: “This groovy track is packed with pure hyungaz sexiness!”\n\n<b>“Quarter Life”</b>\nBeomgyu: “This song has great lyrics. The more you pay attention to the words, the more you’ll get into this track.”\nTaehyun: “The theme here was to spread consolation and empathy for everyone in our generation today. That sentiment really comes across in the chorus where we’re shouting.”\nHueningKai: “The song is about the things we feel—the worries and anxieties—as we hit the quarter mark in our lives. I hope many listeners find it relatable and uplifting.”\n\n<b>“Deja Vu (Anemoia Remix)”</b>\nTaehyun: “In this version, we toned down some of the bold flashiness of the original, so that you can focus more on the song’s emotional side. It has its own little charm that I hope many will appreciate.”","short":"The third in their series of minisodes tackles nostalgia and maturity."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/minisode-3-tomorrow/1733096604","playParams":{"id":"1733096604","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0RFuTYmc3LtPHt0rs0Mqwl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733096604/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1454642552","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1454642552?l=en-US"}]}}},"1733484937":{"id":"1733484937","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733484937?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/charisse-c/1586352334","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"EVERGREEN - EP","artistName":"Charisse C","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a6/5b/93/a65b9307-ae04-0a8c-5347-e1ecdc471af3/5059449168425.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"285926","textColor2":"21381c","textColor4":"35602b","textColor1":"113016","bgColor":"84ff6a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evergreen-ep/1733484937","playParams":{"id":"1733484937","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733484937/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1586352334","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1586352334?l=en-US"}]}}},"1733846679":{"id":"1733846679","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733846679?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/om-unit/347126170","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Fragments","artistName":"Om Unit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/99/13/a4/9913a4b0-232f-e5e3-0607-4b927bd11008/5056467380822_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"368abb","textColor2":"8d9ad8","textColor4":"757eb5","textColor1":"3eaadf","bgColor":"150d2a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fragments/1733846679","playParams":{"id":"1733846679","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2wsIdNJiG4CkPTVC0eXwjo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733846679/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"347126170","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/347126170?l=en-US"}]}}},"1733929711":{"id":"1733929711","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733929711?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-04-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zeina/214277797","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3c/70/dd/3c70ddf7-6c55-0470-8ce0-8e0d80d46f51/Job94c7c241-2fca-4459-bf2f-f2835803c5de-164204557-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_318385786_1705177292-Time1709763878322.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fadec9"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d1d3d6","textColor2":"fadec9","textColor4":"d2c3b9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c2/7d/18/c27d189e-352f-060e-bce9-e856d3342aef/4beea323-9915-4985-9746-904005993e47.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb9585","textColor2":"d9aa95","textColor4":"b18d80","textColor1":"e5b59b","bgColor":"10172b","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3a/c9/e3/3ac9e339-6df5-dec0-b2f5-475906c58f92/Jobbc378e37-5d6f-4ed9-ba96-b84e0d9356ec-164204558-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_318385787_1705177291-Time1709766265238.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e7c9b7"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"ccc3c7","textColor2":"e7c9b7","textColor4":"c4b3ac","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Eastend Confessions","artistName":"Zeina","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/e0/44/f1/e044f10d-4445-1bd2-c932-12e1361fff0e/467.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7c5c3","textColor2":"ecbfb4","textColor4":"c7aaa9","textColor1":"ede1d4","bgColor":"33567e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When you hit play on Zeina’s <i>Eastend Confessions</i>, you’d be forgiven for double-checking the fine print to confirm that it is in fact a 2024 release and not some unearthed gem from 20 years prior. The Montreal-bred singer’s first proper full-length album presents a vivid flashback of her formative post-Y2K dance-pop and R&B influences, recalling both the proudly provocative divas of the day and the internationalist, off-kilter sensibilities of producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes. But in Zeina’s case, the oud-driven melodies, hand-clapped rhythms, and clattering percussion of sweat-generating bops like “NASTY” and “Problematic” aren’t mere exotic ornamentation to help her get her freak on; rather, they’re deliberate assertions of an Arab heritage rarely platformed in Western pop music. Where Zeina’s earliest R&B recordings from the late-2010s largely downplayed her Lebanese Egyptian identity, <i>Eastend Confessions</i> boldly reclaims it—as she declares on the sizzling opener “Hot”: “My body talk[s] with an accent.”\n\n“Growing up, I feel like we were kind of taught to mute our culture,” Zeina tells Apple Music. “Especially in the early 2000s, it wasn’t really accepted to be an Arab person. So I always felt a little bit like, ‘I cannot represent this,’ because it was ingrained in me almost from a fearful place. But as I grew up, I realized, ‘No, that's what makes me different. This is truly me, and I have the power to be this right now and not be scared and really embody that.’”\n\nOn <i>Eastend Confessions</i>, Zeina isn’t merely hybridizing the traditional music of her culture with the futurist pop music of her childhood—she’s imagining an early 2000s landscape that made space for people who look and sound like her. With “Hooked,” she delivers an irresistible R&B jam that channels the sassy attitude of Destiny’s Child and Mary J. Blige, heightening the song’s amorous allure by dropping in a few lines <i>en francais</i>; by contrast, the aching “Money or Love” sees her tapping her inner Alicia Keys for a soulful piano serenade elevated by an exquisite string arrangement.\n\n“‘Money or Love’ talks about the battle between making decisions for your career versus sometimes disappointing people that you love,” Zeina admits. “That’s more of a heartfelt record.

Expanding well beyond prior hits like “Riri” and the Feid team-up “Classy 101,” as well as high-profile collabs with Bad Bunny and KAROL G, her album boldly engages with sounds and styles that help solidify her status as one of Latin music’s most compelling young artists.\n\nThe nostalgic charms of “arcoiris” and “wiggy” speak to an era in hip-hop from well before trap music’s global dominance. An irresistible highlight, “princess peach” reframes a mid-2000s electro-meets-crunk style to tell a love story from a queer perspective. That freedom is even more prominent on “MADRE,” a house music jam that centers the genre’s LGBTQ+ foundations. “I definitely can’t die without me being able to just say whatever I want to say and express myself,” she says proudly. “Hiding yourself sounds so exhausting.”\n\nNaturally, Miko retains many of the familiar elements and touchpoints that pushed her deservedly into the spotlight. Her trap and reggaetón bona fides remain very much intact, evident on opener “rookie of the year” and late standout “curita,” among others of note. She reunites with Feid on the thumping “offline” and cultivates a dancehall reggae vibe with her “COLMILLO” collaborators Jowell & Randy on the inspired “ID.” But mostly, <i>att.</i> is an expression of a singular talent seizing her moment and standing out in the best of ways. “At the end of the day, that’s what every artist tries to be: unique.”","short":"The Up Next rapper’s debut is here: “Hiding yourself sounds so exhausting.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/att-apple-music-edition/1734324964","playParams":{"id":"1734324964","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734324964/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1576521417","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1576521417?l=en-US"}]}}},"1734529385":{"id":"1734529385","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734529385?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sam-hunt/214150835","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/14/92/fc/1492fcf2-580c-57ec-6b31-0f1096c76801/e6eafce9-2e78-4fe8-8c0a-05d405b07f6d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"43433f","textColor2":"2c2b27","textColor4":"50524c","textColor1":"1c1916","bgColor":"deeee1","hasP3":false}},"name":"Locked Up - EP","artistName":"Sam Hunt","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/1a/ca/5a/1aca5acf-fb6a-adf8-04b0-fe3370ea8126/23UMGIM59808.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e3b31","textColor2":"16100a","textColor4":"423e35","textColor1":"120c04","bgColor":"f0fae2","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/locked-up-ep/1734529385","playParams":{"id":"1734529385","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734529385/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"214150835","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/214150835?l=en-US"}]}}},"1734861742":{"id":"1734861742","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734861742?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-godfather/4376849","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Love, Detroit","artistName":"DJ Godfather","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/86/91/e2/8691e25a-0938-9650-2c89-1169574ca473/8718723252621.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dad7d2","textColor2":"d5eadf","textColor4":"becfc7","textColor1":"f8f4ed","bgColor":"636564","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-detroit/1734861742","playParams":{"id":"1734861742","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6AQobyiorlhP7dFO6Zjaxt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734861742/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4376849","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4376849?l=en-US"}]}}},"1734894806":{"id":"1734894806","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734894806?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/odie/1240311971","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"N.F.A.

Although Tiller tends to take a bit of a hiatus between projects, he’s ready to reintroduce himself and show the world what he’s capable of.\n\nTiller has always been known to toe the blurry line between singing and rapping. Here, the Grammy-nominated star blends elements of R&B, dancehall, pop, drill, hip-hop, and more throughout the album’s 19 tracks. Executive produced by Tiller and Charlie Heat, <i>Bryson Tiller</i> invites listeners into a world where genre boundaries are not only crossed but reimagined in vignettes of his love life—whether he’s saying goodbye to an ungrateful lover (“Ciao!”), dealing with the heartache from a failed relationship (“Random Access Memory [RAM]),” “Peace Interlude”), or enjoying the bliss of a newfound relationship (“Find My Way,” “No Thank You,” “Prize”).","short":"The Louisville crooner reintroduces himself on his self-titled album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bryson-tiller/1735996601","playParams":{"id":"1735996601","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0frVQ5nctt6zS9ZR1g5HMX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735996601/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"642591128","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/642591128?l=en-US"}]}}},"1736051351":{"id":"1736051351","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736051351?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/benson-boone/1587414058","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ee/e5/e8/eee5e86e-33de-3568-be56-ecf1941ca6f8/Joba4c70d9b-b310-4754-8c1a-568c89447435-164640615-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319385144_1713176842-Time1710472738078.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d38f67"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bb7440","textColor2":"d38f67","textColor4":"ad7858","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e5/95/ad/e595ad8e-dfc1-0822-1877-3452e8e32463/f53d7491-60d8-405b-9559-ef1ba1862e0f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"48433d","textColor2":"2d241a","textColor4":"554f47","textColor1":"1c150d","bgColor":"f8fbfc","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/95/da/d6/95dad62a-a5c6-fa8c-85de-e67e01741d74/Job190c0b6f-e3c7-4a2c-a2eb-09e21170682d-164640616-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_319385512_1713176833-Time1710474000925.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","de7936"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c1752d","textColor2":"de7936","textColor4":"b76832","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/37/36/47/3736472f-0804-2af2-ebe6-a7045ed510b1/4806792f-d241-49cc-a130-5124f0393ba8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2a48e","textColor2":"d5a177","textColor4":"ab805f","textColor1":"f2ceb2","bgColor":"020000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Fireworks & Rollerblades","artistName":"Benson Boone","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a5/c1/9c/a5c19c62-d641-93b4-2800-e74778569f5f/093624852483.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfaea5","textColor2":"e8a14e","textColor4":"bb8441","textColor1":"edd6ca","bgColor":"090f0f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Benson Boone hails from tiny Monroe, Washington, but his songs tackle big dreams that showcase his global ambition. After a number of singles and his debut EP, <i>Walk Me Home…</i>, the small-town kid made good on his potential and ramped up anticipation for his debut album with “Beautiful Things,” a pensive, guitar-driven slow-burner that takes cues from alt-country thrillers before evolving into an emo-pop anthem. The track was a bold introduction to <i>Fireworks & Rollerblades</i>, which builds on the cathartic ecstasy of <i>Walk Me Home…</i> and finds Boone expanding his scope into unexpected territory.\n\nBoone is an enthusiastic lover on <i>Fireworks</i>, like on “Be Someone,” where he puts his cards on the table: “Wanna be that guy that’s making it hard for you to sleep at night/I want you to call me when it’s getting late/You can tell me anything.” The synths are bouncy and the drums pull rhythm from disco influences, giving the song an undeniable pep. In contrast, piano ballad “In the Stars” finds Boone paying tribute to a departed friend, reckoning with religion and the afterlife, the pure pain of losing someone he loved very much. It’s in this track that he showcases his power, pouring his entire being into these devotions of love, heartbreak, tragedy, and the little moments in between.\n","short":"The rising star expands his scope and ambition on his debut album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fireworks-rollerblades/1736051351","playParams":{"id":"1736051351","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/168CdR21lfn0TTyw1Pkdcm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736051351/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1587414058","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1587414058?l=en-US"}]}}},"1736242186":{"id":"1736242186","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736242186?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1322012460-518351909-24138","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Electric Energy (Reimagination) -

In effect, it’s a greatest-hits set from the “Shotta Flow” rapper that covers favorites and standout cuts from 2019 breakthrough <i>Cottonwood</i> onwards, including massive hits “Camelot,” “SLUT ME OUT,” and the Roddy Ricch team-up “Walk Em Down.” Beyond the convenience of having all of these tracks in one place, fans and newcomers alike have the clearest snapshot yet of his catalog to date, from the sample-drill madness of “DO IT AGAIN” to the melodic boom of early single “Free Youngboy.”","short":"The Memphis spitter properly celebrates his greatest hits."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/certified/1738121746","playParams":{"id":"1738121746","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3kKlvphz0K4uabkNcQQIMh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738121746/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1449052753","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1449052753?l=en-US"}]}}},"1738371408":{"id":"1738371408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738371408?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/txc/1626508795","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/89/01/f8/8901f88b-78fa-0b78-2d04-c1d72a0e2abb/8d5ba6f3-2d10-4458-a578-2b4b15404f7b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2a2f2f","textColor2":"290e09","textColor4":"3e2a24","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"a6cac9","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/93/84/fd/9384fd56-7824-b173-6003-a8528c3f6527/e93a824c-eb87-4491-b846-b452fb99a0ba.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"35150c","textColor2":"110e0d","textColor4":"3f1d13","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"f7592a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e4/09/dd/e409ddfb-1c70-bb45-9281-0dac40421d2e/dbed3399-5444-4756-8bd3-e12f7cb0c713.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"361309","textColor2":"141414","textColor4":"431f15","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"fe4e1a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d3/d8/da/d3d8dab5-f282-33cb-aa55-0b0fb01d5042/a7772d81-1ffa-4ba8-95cf-f965630c1cc6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"28211f","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"303030","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"bdb7b6","hasP3":false}},"name":"Africa Now: April 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"TxC","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/81/b9/e1/81b9e1b2-8261-dd31-567c-087d37c14462/d0a0200c-3ab5-499c-9ef8-5f2347ad0b69.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"320f05","textColor2":"1b1b1b","textColor4":"48251b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe4d1a","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"For April 2024, South African amapiano duo TxC (Tarryn Reid and Clairise Hefke) bring together some of Mzansi’s biggest dance-floor hits, featuring tracks from Mellow & Sleazy, Ggoldie, Kelvin Momo, Daliwonga, Nandipha808, and more, alongside some of their own biggest hits. “[It’s] a delightful musical adventure,” the duo tells Apple Music, “as the vibrant rhythms and soulful melodies of amapiano music blend seamlessly, creating a harmonious tapestry that transcends boundaries and elevates the spirit.”","short":"TxC spin up a soulful yet electrifying mix of all things ’piano."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/africa-now-april-2024-dj-mix/1738371408","playParams":{"id":"1738371408","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738371408/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1626508795","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1626508795?l=en-US"}]}}},"1738387572":{"id":"1738387572","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1738387572?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wisp/1681331842","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Pandora -

Those who remember Doja’s breakthrough (a viral 2018 joke song, “Mooo!”, whose DIY video had her shoving french fries in her nose in front of a homemade green screen) probably wouldn’t have predicted that a few years later, the girl in the cow suit would be a household name. But for Doja, being an internet goofball and a multiplatinum pop star aren’t just compatible, they’re complementary—a duality attuned to her audience’s craving for realness. With her fourth album, <i>Scarlet</i>, the maverick adds “formidable rapper” to her growing list of distinctions.\n\nIn since-deleted tweets from April 2023, Doja made a pledge: “no more pop,” she wrote, following up with a vow to prove wrong the naysayers doubting her rap skills. <i>Scarlet</i> makes good on that promise, particularly its first half, a far cry from the sugary bops on 2021’s star-making <i>Planet Her</i>. Instead she hops between hard-edged beats that evoke NYC in ’94 or Chicago in 2012, crowing over the spoils of her mainstream success while playfully rejecting its terms. “I’m a puppet, I’m a sheep, I’m a cash cow/I’m the fastest-growing bitch on all your apps now,” she deadpans on “Demons,” thumbing her nose at anyone who conflates glowing up with selling out. And on “97,” the album’s best pure rap performance, she embraces the troll’s mantra that all clicks are good clicks, spitting, “That’s a comment, that’s a view, and that’s a rating/That’s some hating, and that’s engagement I could use.”\n\nBehind the provocations, though, is an artist with the idiosyncratic chops to back them up. That’s as true in <i>Scarlet</i>’s lusty midsection as it is on its gulliest rap tracks: No one else would interrupt a dreamy love song (“Agora Hills”) to giggle in Valley Girl vocal fry, “Sorry, just taking a sip of my root beer!” (No one, that is, but Nicki Minaj, Doja’s clearest influence, who paved the way for women who juggle art-pop with hip-hop bona fides.) \n\nAs catchy as it is contrarian, <i>Scarlet</i> offers a suggestion: Maybe it’s Doja’s willingness to reject the premise of being a pop star that makes her such a compelling one. On the album’s sweetest track, “Love Life,” she takes in her view from the top—still the weirdo her fans met in a cow suit but more confident in her contradictions. “They love when I embrace my flaws/I love it when they doin’ the same,” she raps softly. “I love it when my fans love change/That’s how we change the game.”","short":"The 2023 album gets a new coat of paint with seven additional tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/scarlet-2-claude/1739234520","playParams":{"id":"1739234520","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2IUoE0jqkViW6gGfqLcjG2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1739234520/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"830588310","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/830588310?l=en-US"}]}}},"1739698034":{"id":"1739698034","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1739698034?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-04-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/j-cole/73705833","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f3/cf/6f/f3cf6f34-2885-b43e-454b-4f1f8e677d9e/981ba2b7-59af-4bd3-8c1d-964576c6dc37.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e3131","textColor2":"1a1a1d","textColor4":"3e4141","textColor1":"070708","bgColor":"cedbd1","hasP3":false}},"name":"Might Delete Later","artistName":"J.
