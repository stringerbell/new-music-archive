up. Such was the case when an 18-year-old Chief Keef followed up his anthemic major-label debut (2012’s <i>Finally Rich</i>) with a pair of self-released 2013 mixtapes (August’s <i>Bang, Pt. 2</i> and October’s <i>Almighty So</i>) that sounded obscure in comparison, prompting many a claim that he’d fallen off as quickly as he’d gotten on. These days, you can hear echoes of both projects everywhere, in particular <i>Almighty So</i>, the better of the two. You might argue that the slurry, intuitive style which has dominated the past decade of rap began here. Eleven long years later, the project’s sequel arrives after a half decade of teasing. (Keef previewed <i>Almighty So 2</i>’s initial cover art way back in 2019.) Hip-hop’s reinvented itself a dozen times over in that time span, perhaps the only constant being Keef’s enduring influence. \n\nOn <i>Almighty So 2</i>, the 28-year-old veteran sounds as if he’s well aware of just how tall his legacy looms. “I done been through so much smoke to where I couldn’t even see myself,” he raps in his oft-copied swing on “Treat Myself” before busting out a classic Sosa-ism: “Diamonds shining off my charm, I think I Christmas tree’d myself!” He spits fire and brimstone over sinister church choirs on “Jesus,” puffs out his chest on the soulful “Runner,” and offers up the most demented Scarface impression since Future circa 2011 on “Tony Montana Flow.” And on “Believe,” the former teenage phenom is now a man who’s done some soul-searching in his time off from shaping the sound of modern rap.","short":"After half a decade of teasing, the sequel to his influential 2013 mixtape."},"artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a2/5c/db/a25cdb1d-ccd5-42fc-d1ea-75a9c0b73111/dj.eshhdqqc.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"d3b4a1","textColor2":"d6b163","textColor4":"b39254","textColor1":"ffdbc5","bgColor":"281916","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/almighty-so-2/1649723670","playParams":{"id":"1649723670","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6xw2hoSzBYynn2dGmERunp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1649723670/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"516663045","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/516663045?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715330829664}}},"1720224491":{"id":"1720224491","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1720224491?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/fe/a9/58/fea958fd-1ecd-16eb-602b-0027e00285b1/ecc9af84-5d66-4dae-b6fc-4e783ec57a91.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6d8df","textColor2":"d8e9f8","textColor4":"b4cbe1","textColor1":"eff9f6","bgColor":"235585","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e0/00/72/e00072cb-318b-cf9e-fa60-2dfaba7acb42/e940a5c6-a35f-42df-8005-8b8b06c9b0ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afc7da","textColor2":"d5e0e4","textColor4":"b1c4d0","textColor1":"d4e4f0","bgColor":"1f5384","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jordan-rakei/705284964","name":"The Loop","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Jordan Rakei","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jordan Rakei’s dreamily delicate voice is as poised as ever on his fifth album, even on tracks where more than 40 people might be contributing. Those sheer numbers are thanks to robust string and horn sections and a smaller choir, lending scope to <i>The Loop</i>’s self-produced majesty. Yet for all of the bravura flourishes here, Rakei sounds every bit as intimate as he did when he was cutting tracks in his humble bedroom. “Hopes and Dreams” especially hinges on his confiding vocals, unfolding against a sparse backdrop featuring no drums. It’s one of several songs inspired by Rakei settling into fatherhood, and even the album title comes from the idea that his son may someday have children of his own. Elsewhere, the Brisbane-raised, London-based multi-instrumentalist takes notes from classic soul of several eras, from Marvin Gaye to D’Angelo and beyond. The arrangements are impeccable throughout, whether it’s the warmly dusty breakbeats on opener “Flowers” or the rustling loops and handclaps on “Cages.” There’s a live-in-the-room quality to it all, even when a track like “Everything Everything” bolsters Rakei’s heavenly vocal flutter and a cool rhythmic snap with lively tides of celestial layering. As he meditates on the subtle complexities of parenthood and friendship alike, the instrumentation remains transfixing right alongside his words of wisdom.","short":"Strings and horns buoy the

artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stephan-moccio/941440","name":"Legends, Myths and Lavender","artistName":"Stephan Moccio","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Radical honesty is easily applied when judging others, much harder to apply to oneself. Stephan Moccio found the space and courage required to look deep into his psyche while staying at Miraval Studios in the heart of Southern France. The Canadian composer, producer, and pianist used his time there to meditate on the true nature of being, and channeled his feelings into <i>Legends, Myths and Lavender</i>. Moccio’s suite of 17 solo piano miniatures evolved during his month at Miraval, inspired by the abundant natural riches of Provence, among them the region’s ancient forests and lavender meadows.\n\n<i>Legends, Myths and Lavender</i> explores thoughts of mortality, family, illusion and reality, and life’s purpose—heavyweight themes translated into highly personal, strikingly beautiful keyboard pieces. Its tracks flow from the same stream of melody that has always nourished Moccio’s music, whether conceived for movie soundtracks, the pop charts, or his growing number of solo recordings. Together, they chart the course of a spiritual journey. “Home” and “Polaris,” the album’s first and last tracks, represent facets of the place where we begin and the place to which we return. Between those two poles lie life’s excursions, setbacks, and celebrations.\n\n“The Wanderer” conveys what Moccio describes as “beauty in impermanence,” something to be welcomed not feared. “We’re all wanderers through life,” he says. “Often it’s about confronting your own soul, your own demons. If you’re able to come to terms with them and be honest with yourself, then you will get through it. Impermanence is part of life. If you can accept rather than fight that, then I think you’re better off.”\n\nMiraval offered Moccio a retreat from the demands of work in Los Angeles. He traveled there soon after turning 50, armed with a sharp awareness of life’s transience. Here he could take stock and create under ideal conditions. “I was already questioning many things,” he recalls. “I was questioning how my career choices have affected my family and my time with my kids, which was a big thing. I’ve had an illustrious career, but it’s come at a cost. I’m not saying that I regret it. I’m just saying I want to change certain things in how I handle that, moving forward.”\n\nMoccio’s musical invention was supported by the calming ritual of daily routines. Despite spending up to 15 hours a day in the studio, he made time to walk alone and record whatever came to mind on his iPhone. “It could be about anything,” he notes. “About the creative process or my feelings that day. Some days it would be, ‘I miss my family, I miss my kids.’ And then I’d go back and record for two hours, have dinner, then record until midnight and repeat the process the following morning. That discipline created boundaries and goals that allowed me to go crazy, in a good way—to go wild and experiment.”\n\nWhile his initial improvisations began to take shape as distinct compositions, he recalled the rituals he encountered as an altar boy at the Catholic church where his mother was organist. “Catholicism and the Church, and, more importantly, church music bled into my life, my art, my music,” notes Moccio. His abiding sense of spirituality was amplified by the psychogeography of Miraval, the site of a long-dissolved monastery. “Even if I hadn’t wanted any element of spirituality in the music, it was impossible to avoid because it was present in the world around me. It felt like this was spiritual music.” His connection to the place surfaces in the introspection of “Communion,” the album’s longest track, and permeates its reflections on the natural world, “Lavender Fields,” “The Sound of Snow,” and “Soleil de Provence.”\n\n<i>Legends, Myths and Lavender</i> considers the concealing disguises so often worn by those seeking success in the creative arts, the stuff of “Make-Believe.” Stephan Moccio used his time at Miraval to divest his own masks, raising eternal questions in “You Can’t Run From Yourself” and “The Unveiling” without supplying categorical answers. “We create our own mythology to survive this crazy life and our own versions of legends. Sometimes we tell ourselves lies. I know I have, and I fight that a lot. That’s what ‘You Can’t Run from Yourself’ is about. But I didn’t solve any questions about the meaning of life. We’ve used these four words as a creed for the album: feel more, think less. And I hope <i>Legends, Myths and Lavender</i> awakens a certain feeling in people.”","short":"Stephan Moccio confronts his soul: “We’re all wanderers through life.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c9/16/1a/c9161a6c-063f-cf83-d283-fa2a8a30e7f8/23UM1IM56308.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b3b4b2","textColor2":"b8c3d2","textColor4":"959dad","textColor1":"dddfd7","bgColor":"09081d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/legends-myths-and-lavender/1721400753","playParams":{"id":"1721400753","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5A2whd1HFhaMTAfDkPJci8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1721400753/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"941440","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/941440?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715348799221}}},"1722558142":{"id":"1722558142","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1722558142?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/like-moths-to-flames/354095901","name":"The Cycles Of Trying To Cope","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Like Moths to Flames","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/72/b5/68/72b56846-ed10-6762-91db-35150b9fd1d5/197190565881.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bcc5c5","textColor2":"d1cfa5","textColor4":"aba987","textColor1":"e7f1f2","bgColor":"131311","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-cycles-of-trying-to-cope/1722558142","playParams":{"id":"1722558142","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2caVxg6PlddTgxtz8abZXM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1722558142/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"354095901","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/354095901?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715316210949}}},"1724391565":{"id":"1724391565","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724391565?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/46/dc/a9/46dca93b-42f3-3fc3-22e7-bd5b2f441125/Job27897c62-eab3-48cc-8821-d36d3c1d602b-162484358-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314406484_1677275619-Time1707146482698.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"273938","textColor2":"1b2020","textColor4":"374746","textColor1":"060f0f","bgColor":"aae1dd","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/01/b9/e1/01b9e10d-8fc1-445e-274c-7785f77892c6/48508675-ddb1-4afe-b6aa-4c4fe1584f87.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c6c8","textColor2":"fbc59b","textColor4":"e3af89","textColor1":"d9e2ea","bgColor":"835a42","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video116/v4/90/1d/06/901d0635-245c-eb6f-c2db-297f86d134bb/Job28fdaeac-972d-4588-8f63-b9126e67cf48-162484357-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_314406485_1677275618-Time1707145614672.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"09302c","textColor2":"132120","textColor4":"133e3a","textColor1":"060f0f","bgColor":"15b1a3","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/i-jordan/524995046","name":"I AM JORDAN","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"I. JORDAN","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Recent years have been full of change for I. JORDAN. The Doncaster-born producer has been on a meteoric rise, collaborating with the likes of SHERELLE and Fred again.. and taking their thundering, freewheeling DJ sets to packed clubs and festival stages across the globe. Closer to home, they have also been transitioning their gender. The result of this exhilarating, tumultuous, and life-affirming period now finds its expression on their debut album, <i>I AM JORDAN</i>. “It’s a collection of tracks that signify where I’m at as an artist and also serve as a snapshot of my life over the last few years,” they tell Apple Music. “It’s trans-led and full of trans artists, a celebration of my community.”\n\nAcross 12 tracks, <i>I AM JORDAN</i> showcases each aspect of the producer’s ever-evolving artistry, veering from paying tribute to the hardstyle and donk music they grew up hearing on “The Countdown” to euphoric trance synths on “Close to You,” hammering techno on “Butterlick” and an immersion in “wobby” basslines on “Round n Round.” “It’s a record by trans people, allowing us to be ourselves, which feels more important than ever,” they say. Read on for their in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track. \n\n<b>“When Lights Flash”</b> \n“This track feels like the encapsulation of a whirlwind. I had just landed in Melbourne while on tour and was feeling disoriented and jet-lagged. I wanted to make something experimental, so I started playing with a plug-in synth that produced this really dramatic sound that was unlike the music I usually make. It felt like a turning point in my creation of the album and something I needed to start it with—a siren or a call to action.”\n\n<b>“Casino High”</b> \n“I made this track a week after ‘When Lights Flash’ while I was still in Melbourne. I was staying in this high-rise and it reflects how energized and uplifted I was feeling in the city. I feel like it has a classic ‘me’ sound, since it’s the only track on the record with a sample and so is a nod to my earliest productions where I would sample quite a bit.”\n\n<b>“Real Hot n Naughty” (feat. Felix Mufti)</b>\n“I first met Felix when he was dancing for me at Homobloc festival a few years ago, and we became friends. I later found out he did rap and spoken word and knew I had to get him on some demos. As soon as I sent him this one, he fired back this hook right away, and it all happened really quickly. We wanted it to be a northern working-class queer anthem, which is tongue-in-cheek and punctuated by Felix’s Liverpool accent.”\n\n<b>“The Countdown” (feat. TAAHLIAH)</b>\n“I’ve been mates with TAAHLIAH for a while and, since we both grew up with donk and hardstyle and other northern working-class dance floor sounds, we decided to make ‘The Countdown’ as a celebration of that shared heritage and of our friendship. It always goes down really well when I play it live and is basically just a tribute to the fun we have together.”\n\n<b>“Butterlick” (feat. Sister Zo)</b>\n“I first met Sister Zo in a production workshop, and she sent me the drum loop you hear on this intro. It came at a time when I was making loads of tunes in preparation to play at Glastonbury 2022 and so those drums soon developed into this tune, which used to be called ‘For Glasto,’ since it ended up playing out really well there. It’s also a nod to my growing love of techno, which is really technically challenging to make well, so I’m very proud of it.”\n\n<b>“Reification and Pathetic Fallacy”</b> \n“I wrote this track on the train home after spending a week at a residency in Newcastle for trans artists. I was really inspired after being around all these different creatives and, while it was looking gloomy outside on the way back, this track just emerged. It’s me trying to put the overwhelming emotions I was feeling into sound, as well as connecting with the mood of the weather.”\n\n<b>“People Want Nice Things”</b> \n“Once I started taking testosterone, it led to changes in my voice that I wanted to document, so I began recording myself saying the phrase ‘People want nice things’ every month to track how my voice was dropping. Those recordings are part of this track, like an archive of the changes I’ve gone through to honor my transness, all set to a nice house tune!”\n\n<b>“Round n Round”</b> \n“I will always love ‘wobby’ sounds and basslines—those bass frequencies that anchor the sort of music I grew up listening to in clubs in Doncaster and Sheffield. ‘Round n Round’ is a tribute to that sound, as well as the music I have released before like ‘Hey Baby’ and ‘WARPER.’ I initially made it for a set I was playing at AVA festival in Belfast, where it really went off.”\n\n<b>“The Woodpecker”</b> \n“This is the oldest track on the record, which I started in 2020. I wasn’t going to include it on the album since it felt too heavy but my A&R convinced me otherwise! It’s got this intense hardstyle kick and wood-chopping sound, which made it the perfect tribute to my favorite bird, the woodpecker. Those who follow me online will know I’m a keen birdwatcher, so this is also a nod to that part of my life.”\n\n<b>“7 Degrees of Despondent”</b> \n“If you’re going to make a record that is a documentation of your life, you need to include the lows as well as the highs. This was written during a difficult period in 2021 when I was isolating with COVID and feeling pretty miserable. It was seven degrees outside, and I was feeling despondent—it’s not really a track for the club but rather something that speaks to the sadness we can sometimes all feel.”\n\n<b>“Close to You”</b> \n“After the mood of ‘7 Degrees of Despondent,’ this track switches it up by launching into a euphoric trance feeling. It came really quickly and was another one I made just before Glastonbury, encapsulating the feeling of hope and happiness for the summer to come. It felt like the perfect note for the record to draw to a close on.”\n\n<b>“Rapt Finis”</b>\n“I came up with ‘Rapt Finis’ after becoming really absorbed by playing this melody and the dramatic mood it creates, which isn’t really one for the club. In the same way that ‘When Lights Flash’ is something more experimental from me, setting the tone for the record to come, I wanted this closing number to bring people gently back down to earth as it ends.”","short":"The producer takes us into their debut: “It’s a celebration of my

Fall</i> and her second album of original material, <i>CASSANDRA (cherith)</i>—but such are the consequences when you become a multidisciplinary crossover star who crafted one of the most uplifting anthems of the Black Lives Matter era (“Rise Up”), got invited to perform at the Biden/Harris inauguration, and won a Golden Globe for portraying one of the greatest jazz singers of all time (in 2021’s <i>The United States vs. Billie Holiday</i>). With <i>CASSANDRA (cherith)</i>, Day makes up for lost time in the most wonderful way, by crafting an epic song cycle that perfectly balances elegance and attitude. \n\nAs Day tells Apple Music, her engagement with Billie Holiday’s legacy didn’t end once the cameras stopped rolling. “A lot of her spirit and a lot of that music and her feeling found its way onto this project,” she says. “Not necessarily sonically, but through attitudes and mentality and the things that I'm saying. I'm a little less apologetic here for sure.” \n\nOver the course of its 16 tracks, <i>CASSANDRA (cherith)</i> charts Day’s soul-cleansing journey to rid herself of dysfunctional relationships and toxic influences and carve out some inner peace in her whirlwind life. But from that thematic focal point, Day ventures out in myriad musical directions, complementing her theatrical retro-soul showstoppers (“Probably”) with tropical piano-jazz reveries (“In the Meantime”), smoky after-hours torch songs (“Where Do We Go”), and old-school hip-hop flavors (courtesy of guest rapper Wale on “Heavy on My Mind”). “My main thing with this record is that I really wanted to chase down everything that I loved,” she says—and with <i>CASSANDRA (cherith)</i>, Day gives us nothing less than a 360-degree view of her life and art.

During an airplane takeoff that triggered Garris’ fear of flying, the woman seated next to him offered the comforting words, “You won’t go before you’re supposed to.” “The line struck him so strongly that it immediately occurred to him that it should be the title,” Knocked Loose guitarist Isaac Hale tells Apple Music. “It also became a lyric in the last song, ‘Sit & Mourn.’ Like the rest of our records, this is a collection of stuff from Bryan’s personal struggles dealing with anger and loss and depression and sadness. It’s a reminder to him—and all of us—that we’re still here. We made it through all the hardships that came with the past four years of writing this.” \n\nMusically speaking, Knocked Loose entered the writing sessions for <i>You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To</i> with a very different mindset than the one that drove their 2019 breakthrough <i>A Different Shade of Blue</i> and revered 2021 concept EP <i>A Tear in the Fabric of Life</i>. “There was just way more pressure, and we had way more experience,” Hale says. “Some people view the third album as a make-or-break record. We had pressure from the fans and the outside world, but more so pressure from ourselves. We thought, ‘How can we possibly outdo what we’ve done before?’ It was tough, but I think we were able to come up with a record where every song accomplishes something unique.” Below, he discusses each track. \n\n<b>“Thirst”</b>\n“This was written in the first session that we ever had for this record. It was written before <i>A Tear in the Fabric of Life</i> even came out. It came from a jam session we were having where we wanted to create a really difficult song on drums to challenge our drummer Pacsun. We wanted something super short, super intense, and we just made it as complex as we could. And to start the record, it’s something we’ve never done before—a super in-your-face jump scare.” \n\n<b>“Piece by Piece”</b>\n“This was our attempt at doing kind of a Hatebreed-esque banger. It has a hook to it, but the hook is one of the mosh parts in the song, akin to [Hatebreed’s] ‘Perseverance.’ One of the things we wanted to accomplish on this record was to create stuff that was hooky and catchy, but at the same time crazy heavy. In many ways, I think that it’s the most hardcore song on the record, and that’s what we love about it. It’s our version of a catchy hardcore track that can really connect with people.” \n\n<b>“Suffocate” (feat. Poppy)</b>\n“We wrote this song after we thought we had a finished record. Before we went to record, Poppy slid into Bryan’s DMs asking if we would be interested in collaborating on some music. Me and Bryan are huge Poppy fans, so of course we said yes automatically. That same day, Bryan called me like, ‘Hey, man—I’m coming over. We need to write another song.’ We wrote the track the next day, and it was one of the smoothest writing experiences on the record because we wrote it knowing Poppy was going to be a part of it. And because of that, we were able to do some sassy parts that maybe we wouldn’t put on a normal Knocked Loose song but that really work with her voice. I think it’s one of the most special songs we’ve ever written.” \n\n<b>“Don’t Reach for Me”</b>\n“This was our attempt at writing a song with a more rock- or pop-oriented structure. It’s different from stuff that we've done before because it has a slightly melodic chorus with a hook. It has a soft bridge with a jam part and some cleaner guitar. And a lot of it is midtempo, besides the very beginning. It only gets fast very briefly. That’s very new for us. There’s like seven mosh parts, so we needed to balance those. It took a long time to figure out, but I think the final product really succeeds in that juxtaposition.” \n\n<b>“Moss Covers All”</b>\n“This was written in the second writing session that we did for this record, up in Michigan. We woke up one morning, started jamming, and we were just not coming up with a lot of stuff we liked. We were pretty much just throwing paint at the wall and getting aggravated. When we took a break, I had an idea and basically wrote this entire song in my head in about a minute. I voice memo’d it briefly on my phone and then immediately started putting it down without telling the guys. When they came back, I played it for them—and what I played is pretty much exactly what’s on the record. It’s short, sweet, and super heavy, with a breakdown and a spooky lead that goes directly into the next song.” \n\n<b>“Take Me Home”</b>\n“‘Moss Covers All’ and ‘Take Me Home’ are very much connected songs. ‘Moss Covers All’ was written first, but then we really felt the need to have a song on here that’s meant to scare you. We didn’t worry about a mosh part or any sort of heaviness. We just wanted a scary track that’s uncomfortable and throws the listener off guard. When we were thinking about what shape that could take, I immediately thought of that spooky lead from ‘Moss Covers All,’ which we ended up looping as the blueprint for this track.” \n\n<b>“Slaughterhouse 2” (feat. Chris Motionless)</b>\n“This song started as an inside joke because Motionless in White was kind enough to reach out to Bryan and have him collaborate on one of their songs, ’Slaughterhouse,’ a very heavy, politically charged track. We’re all huge Motionless in White fans, so of course he accepted. And then we were able to tour with them. As soon as Bryan did that track, we were joking that we should do a song called ‘Slaughterhouse 2.’ We were just kind of laughing about it for a while, but then we thought we were kind of shooting ourselves in the foot if we didn’t do it. Chris was down from the beginning, and his voice is amazing on this. It was a challenge to match the theme and vibe of the original song, but I think we were able to create something that’s not just a great sequel, but that really stands on its own as a highlight of the record.” \n\n<b>“The Calm That Keeps You Awake”</b>\n“The funny thing about this one is that the song totally revolves around the huge breakdown at the end. That part was written first, as part of another thing that was written before <i>A Tear in the Fabric</i> had even come out. So, like four years ago, we needed to write new parts because the rest of the song we’d written wasn’t up to par, but that breakdown was super necessary. In doing so, we created this really cool, Meshuggah-esque, kind of Sepultura-auxiliary-percussion vibe that’s one of the most unique parts of the record.”\n\n<b>“Blinding Faith”</b>\n“We definitely have some jabs at religious hypocrisy throughout the Knocked Loose discography, and this is just kind of an update on that situation. We hadn't done one in a while, and it was something that was feeling close to home for Bryan at the time. To me, this sounds like a mix of some of our greatest riffs that we’d written over the course of a year—it’s kind of a riff-salad song. In some ways, it’s one of the heaviest and scariest songs on the record, so we put it out as a single to say, ‘If you thought we were going to get any softer, absolutely not. And here’s proof.’” \n\n<b>“Sit & Mourn”</b>\n“This one revolves around the melodic lead and the kind of ambient post-rock breakdown at the end. We wrote that in the first writing session in Joshua Tree, and it took us a while to come up with more parts that we felt were that good. But the song is very, very anthemic. It sounds very dark and melancholic, but at the same time, the lyrics are positive in a way. Thematically, it’s kind of a title track in the way that the lyrics relate to the name of the record. I know it was a very cathartic song for Bryan. In many ways, it’s the saddest song on the record, but in other ways it’s the most positive. And it’s mentally exhausting from start to finish. It ends with a sound clip that I won’t disclose, but it’ll take you by surprise.”","short":"“Every song accomplishes something

CANTANTE DEL GHETTO","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ryan Castro","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“It’s my first album, and I designed it so that my fans can understand where I come from—the soul of my roots,” Ryan Castro tells Apple Music about his debut, <i>EL CANTANTE DEL GHETTO</i> (The Ghetto Singer), a title that underscores the project’s autobiographical nature. “Everything that ever influenced me is here: graffiti, skating, hip-hop and salsa, reggae and dancehall. And the classic reggaetón sound that I fell in love with.” Fittingly, <i>EL CANTANTE DEL GHETTO</i> transports us to the neighborhood of Pedregal, in the north of Medellín, the starting point where Castro experienced the birth of reggaetón in his city, spearheaded by artists such as J Balvin, Maluma, and, later, KAROL G. It is now his turn to contribute his particular style and vision to the genre. “Our brand of reggaetón is highly original—we experiment with the format and take it to another level,” he says. “You could recognize our seal of distinction anywhere, on account of our dialect and the melodies.” \n\nNow that Castro has built on the legacy of his predecessors and expanded the sound of Medellín alongside genre stars like Feid and Blessd, he embraces the responsibility of opening a new path for future generations. The principles of gratitude and respect are vital to him, together with a strong faith in the unique qualities of his sound, making <i>EL CANTANTE DEL GHETTO</i> an album of stark originality. “My contribution to urban music has influenced other artists,” he admits. “It’s because my style is authentic.”\n\n<b>“EL CANTANTE DEL GHETTO”</b>\n“I wrote it in song camp. A number of artists and producers wrote the salsa portion, while the melody and lyrics flowed out of me with ease. Héctor Lavoe is a huge inspiration on this one.”\n\n<b>“PUEBLO DE MEDALLO”</b>\n“I’m honored to present this song. At my current level, I’m incredibly grateful to record a track with Arcángel. He is the kind of icon who generates inspiration and respect in the urbano genre. I met him through Panamanian producer Dímelo Flow. It’s a really good cut—the energy flowed seamlessly during the recording process.”\n\n<b>“GATA G”</b>\n“This is a really strong track in terms of trap, generating a romantic vibe and that classic R&B flow. It’s also from the song camp, with contributions by genius songwriters like Keityn and Edgar Barrera. The producer is off the charts: Taiko, from Chile.”\n\n<b>“BIG DREAMS”</b>\n“This one comes from the heart. It’s a war story: getting up in the morning, ready to go after your dreams, whether they’re related to music or not. I know it will touch my fans, because it’s a true-life story about motivation and finding inspiration.”\n\n<b>“JORDAN REMIX”</b>\n“‘Jordan’ is one of my biggest songs. It allowed me to meet other artists, like Ñengo Flow and Myke Towers. I’m not into remixing my own tracks, but Ñengo suggested it, and he lent a hand. The song also was ripe for a remix. I’m proud to release this one—I know my fans have been waiting for it since day one, and they will definitely enjoy it.”\n\n<b>“MI DIABLA Y MI DIOSA”</b>\n“We made this one with Natan & Shander—they’re like my brothers, my own family. They’re also Colombian, super talented, representing the younger generation. They’re known for the ‘Poblado’ song, but we recorded this one earlier, a good three years ago. It went viral to a certain extent, because a video leaked out. Every time we get together at the studio, we end up recording five, six, seven songs. This one I had saved up, but my fans love it, and so do I. I’m putting it out there for my people.”\n\n<b>“RICH RAPPERS”</b>\n“This one has a different kind of flow, closer to trap. It’s pretty amazing to collaborate with an American artist like Rich The Kid, someone of his caliber and trajectory, on a trap song about becoming successful and being able to splurge on jewelry and luxury items. I love this track.”\n","short":"The Colombian singer shows his roots on his debut: “My style is authentic.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/46/26/24/46262410-4460-1b8c-a8b9-000ea1542737/196872044447.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ebc8c8","textColor2":"fff0f3","textColor4":"f4bfc3","textColor1":"f3fafa","bgColor":"cc0004","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-cantante-del-ghetto/1741663846","playParams":{"id":"1741663846","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0d9r31X5eeyHWLkYAZIxmE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741663846/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1263552447","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1263552447?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715340947588}}},"1741764102":{"id":"1741764102","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741764102?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tal-fussman/1418189820","name":"Definition -

Elton John joins Peck for a spirited take on the former’s 1973 hit “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),” with Peck’s Roy Orbison-esque croon a dramatic counterpoint to John’s masterful belt. Peck and Allison Russell make formidable partners on “Chemical Sunset,” with a loose, jazzy arrangement that’s one of the project’s better grooves. Midland, Noah Cyrus, Bu Cuaron, and Nathaniel Rateliff round out the guest list on the star-studded project.","short":"The masked singer ropes in some famous friends for a duets collection."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/13/a9/c3/13a9c3af-fe20-d437-8426-f5340cdfe2d9/093624845997.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343132","textColor2":"29221f","textColor4":"494442","textColor1":"0f0b0b","bgColor":"cacacc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stampede-vol-1/1742851762","playParams":{"id":"1742851762","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5xmQFJ2yArFC5glJ3xclfE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742851762/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1319633580","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1319633580?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715338126874}}},"1742855574":{"id":"1742855574","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742855574?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756","name":"No Hard Feelings - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"The Chainsmokers","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"Six new songs from the super-duo, including hits “Friday” and “Addicted.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/88/d8/59/88d85935-dd2f-8b7b-a9e4-752ef669a89e/196872067590.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5d2ba","textColor2":"0cf0a6","textColor4":"0ec789","textColor1":"f1fee2","bgColor":"162118","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-hard-feelings-ep/1742855574","playParams":{"id":"1742855574","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742855574/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"580391756","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/580391756?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715347867354}}},"1742857315":{"id":"1742857315","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742857315?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/99/eb/20/99eb2097-12ea-4242-f2f2-446285a7c98b/Job95ed11d5-ccca-49d0-baa4-d6c4417d8126-167338289-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325478219_1758182028-Time1714684913397.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","29241e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2d2c2b","textColor2":"29241e","textColor4":"48433e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/5d/f4/1e5df442-460a-99c0-c131-b2aae3b792a7/208daceb-f0bf-4160-bac5-3cfc462d2b41.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2b1a4","textColor2":"f1d2b7","textColor4":"c1a893","textColor1":"f2ddcc","bgColor":"010203","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/af/2d/c2/af2dc288-81d4-195d-52fb-2c37eccc4515/Jobd6a25c76-4b39-4566-8560-c5ed47970a39-167338290-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_325478220_1758182023-Time1714697706770.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","27241b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2e2b29","textColor2":"27241b","textColor4":"44413a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/conway-the-machine/924551002","name":"Slant Face Killah","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Conway the Machine","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since dropping <i>WON’T HE DO IT</i> in 2023, Conway the Machine began teasing that the album was merely one-half of a hip-hop diptych. Though the Buffalo-bred rapper abandoned the austere working title <i>Side B</i> for the more definitive <i>Slant Face Killah</i>, the auspicious arrival of this hour-long set fulfills his promise to further its predecessor’s high-caliber, highly diversified vibes. It does that, to be sure, with the Griselda vet turned Drumwork don laying waste to beats as unconventional as “Raw!” or as comfortably familiar as “Milano Nights.” Beyond his now undeniable, possibly innate ability to convincingly convey his unique voice and learned perspective, the cunning spitter brings along an impressive roster of guests like Ab-Soul, Key Glock, and Larry June that showcases both his reach and his taste.\n\nMethod Man may never have truly left rap, but “Meth Back!” has him sounding downright exuberant on the mic, heading up a tight posse cut that also includes SK Da King and Flee Lord. Conway did that, as he did before with the esteemed Wu-Tang clansman on 2020’s <i>From King to A GOD</i>. The feature flexes continue almost unabated, tapping Pro Era’s Joey Bada$$ for “Vertino” and the notorious Swizz Beatz for the Jamaican beat-switcher “Ninja Man.” While the Griselda’s core trio was represented on the other side of <i>WON’T HE DO IT</i>, he brings a couple of its more recent cohorts in for the back half. Jay Worthy sips freely from his pimp cup for the boastful “Surf & Turf,” while coke-rap dynamo Stove God Cooks emerges from the kitchen for the far grittier “Mutty,” both tracks produced by Conductor Williams himself.","short":"The Drumwork don completes the WON’T HE DO IT story."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/49/6c/f1/496cf133-9257-decf-29e2-464f7769d97c/197342587068_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"282625","textColor2":"232322","textColor4":"424240","textColor1":"020000","bgColor":"bebdb9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/slant-face-killah/1742857315","playParams":{"id":"1742857315","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2If4aVsZl3y3bzPT4lcvPh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742857315/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"924551002","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/924551002?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715338759273}}},"1743186240":{"id":"1743186240","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743186240?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/47/72/87/4772878a-bb1e-9e35-7951-c731694269a0/7f07523a-724f-42f9-af53-f86bf7b8360d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dad7d2","textColor2":"f7e0d3","textColor4":"d8c5b9","textColor1":"faf6f2","bgColor":"5b5854","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/36/81/c1/3681c133-ee69-5fac-016f-632a3ef989cb/766f3ad2-9a92-45ae-bee4-af573c803248.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5b1ac","textColor2":"ccc6c0","textColor4":"aca8a2","textColor1":"d6d1cc","bgColor":"30312c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grupo-frontera/1613772487","name":"JUGANDO A QUE NO PASA NADA","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Grupo Frontera","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5c/b2/7c/5cb27c01-7799-8e77-b3ee-817107625550/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5515f","textColor2":"f84e5f","textColor4":"c94256","textColor1":"f4616a","bgColor":"0a1331","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jugando-a-que-no-pasa-nada/1743186240","playParams":{"id":"1743186240","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4j58S9wNTTLgllMslsSMhk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743186240/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1613772487","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1613772487?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715349063896}}},"1743823041":{"id":"1743823041","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743823041?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/34/71/5f/34715f6c-04e2-1bf8-26f9-951a940aeefd/d1d51d78-f4a6-4f4b-9be5-ab43dde62d09.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"94b1c4","textColor2":"eab27f","textColor4":"bb8f65","textColor1":"b9def5","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/four-tet/35888604","name":"Three +","artistName":"Four Tet","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/07/bc/32/07bc3225-318b-a1da-6912-7d259f7b7b1c/3663729313355_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8bec9","textColor2":"c0e895","textColor4":"a1c07c","textColor1":"dde6f6","bgColor":"261f17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/three/1743823041","playParams":{"id":"1743823041","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4pnU9CGKI2YneVwkqK6EIN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743823041/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"35888604","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/35888604?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715337209453}}},"1743823674":{"id":"1743823674","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743823674?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/a-g-cook/744253464","name":"Britpop","artistName":"A.

Cook announced the closing of his beloved PC Music label in 2023—a project synonymous with the giddy, synthetic sound sometimes known as hyperpop—it was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. Like his 2020 debut <i>7G</i>, 2024’s <i>Britpop</i> has the rangy feel of an artist good at writing songs (the warped doo-wop of “Greatly”; the gorgeous, melancholic “Serenade”) but even better at expressing atmospheres and ideas, whether it’s contrasting the gabber thump of “Out of Time” with sparkling ambience or how “Luddite Factory Operator” turns its chilly glitches into something you could take home to mom and dad. His central argument—that pop can be weird and still be pop—has been proven by clients and collaborators from Charli XCX to Beyoncé, but if you want to drink from the source, it’s here.

He sings: “You're a different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me scared/The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there.” \n\nOn second single “I Sent My Therapist to Therapy,” he flips the traditional tale of analysis on its head and showcases his dexterous rap skills. After Benjamin encounters a therapist unable to help him cope with his issues, the shrink turns around and solicits the young songwriter for any advice. It’s a playful yet powerful moment, a reminder that we all need some help, whether we’re globe-trotting stars or accredited professional counselors.","short":"The singer-songwriter delivers more vulnerable pop on his third album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/33/ad/14/33ad1480-ebeb-7e23-db13-65105059e43e/075679659811.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"282629","textColor2":"011016","textColor4":"26282a","textColor1":"040d15","bgColor":"b8887a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/12-notes/1743852148","playParams":{"id":"1743852148","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZavFNoQHApc5NExeJl5Xj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743852148/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"632781795","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/632781795?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715338260746}}},"1743875733":{"id":"1743875733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743875733?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f2/d9/95/f2d995ef-eed9-833e-33f4-25b86e743e7d/a8dc247a-304c-4588-9671-2a9a96939717.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c17e6d","textColor2":"d19781","textColor4":"b27c6a","textColor1":"e59a85","bgColor":"341010","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/da/36/b5/da36b532-615c-4ca8-e49b-df7aab3feb7e/45d1c93c-080e-4125-b7da-d8025b922e9b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c1c17","textColor2":"060302","textColor4":"2b1d19","textColor1":"070200","bgColor":"c28472","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tiwa-savage/324225716","name":"Water & Garri (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tiwa Savage","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Original Soundtrack","standard":"Released in May 2024, <i>Water & Garri</i> marks Afrobeats superstar Tiwa Savage’s debut as a filmmaker. The feature-length film, where Savage takes on dual roles as lead actor and executive producer, unpacks the story of Aisha, a fashion designer who returns to Nigeria after a decade of living in the US and has to navigate cultural shifts within her hometown and how they manifest in her own life.\n\nNamed after the West African staple cassava dish, the film loosely draws inspiration from Savage’s 2021 EP of the same title, a project that reflects her own mélange of global influences—gleaned from spending primary years in Lagos and teenage years in London, then attending university in the US—and the intersectionality of her journey through creativity and culture. Though they share a name, the two projects were created as stand-alone entities, with the film getting its own soundtrack of 10 original songs, giving Savage the opportunity to lean into more direct experiments with jazz, R&B, gospel, and folk elements, and allow for a full exploration of Aisha’s complex emotional journey.\n\nFrom love to grief, pain and joy, Savage tracks the story of Aisha with bold vocal statements underpinned by slick productions. A collab with Richard Bona and The Cavemen. (“Water & Garri”) allows for jazz and highlife infusions, while a turn with Aṣa (“Emotions”) sees them leaning into folk territory, and the Black Sherif- and Young Jonn-assisted “Kilimanjaro” brings in street pop and amapiano. “Lost Time” perhaps best captures the tension of reconciling the guilt of being away from home, while reminiscing about a past love and wanting to relive happier times.","short":"The Afrobeats star pairs her film debut with an emotional original

of Wun","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Gunna","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s understandable if Gunna feels a bit isolated these days. For some two years now, the Georgia-bred rapper has been on the defensive—first, when he was indicted in a sweeping YSL Records RICO case and, subsequently, in the time since his release by the feds. “I’m still fighting,” he tells Apple Music. “I still got friends incarcerated, and I’m still growing, too and getting massive.” Indeed, amid the sly whispers and outright accusations levied against him in hip-hop’s court of public opinion, he nonetheless managed to maintain both his commercial viability and star status with 2023’s <i>a Gift & a Curse</i>. That earned him one of the biggest singles of his career in “fukumean,” which, like the rest of the album, eschewed features and put the spotlight squarely upon himself. “It’s a bittersweet moment for me,” he admits. \n\nNearly one year later, he returns with <i>One of Wun</i>, another defiant and largely solo testament to his endurance in the face of genuine adversity. Opener “collage” seems to take stock of his current situation, dismissing those who wish he’d retire or otherwise quit the rap game. From there, Gunna faces down opposition with impeccable drip while reveling in the lifestyle he’s become accustomed to, conflating matters on “whatsapp (wassam)” and the title track. From his perspective, professional jealousy and rumor-mongering are no match for his swag. “I’m wearing clothes differently now,” he says of his sartorial aesthetic, which comes up not infrequently throughout the project. “It’s not just about the name. It’s more like really where it come from or the cut of it.”\n\nUnlike on <i>a Gift & a Curse</i>, a few guests do stop by to show support. Gunna and Offset go way back to the <i>Drip Season 2</i> days, making their reunion on “prada dem” all the more momentous.
