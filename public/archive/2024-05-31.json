embodied 21st-century witchy mysticism, seeming to pull her synthy, sensuous chamber pop from the great beyond. Where past records were springboards for high-concept world-building (2016’s <i>The Bride</i> hinged around a grieving woman whose fiancé died en route to their wedding, and 2019’s <i>Lost Girls</i> followed an all-girl biker gang through the dystopian streets of LA), her sixth record as Bat for Lashes brings her storytelling back home. On <i>The Dream of Delphi</i>, she mythologizes her early motherhood (she gave birth to her first child in 2020) with songs that ripple with strings, elegant piano, and gentle synth arpeggios. Khan sings her wispy, haiku-esque lyrics directly to her newborn: “Your life an echo, my darling, of all before/Your life an echo, my darling, of all to come,” she coos on “Letter to My Daughter.” The outlier is the soaring “Home” (on whose credits appear club gods Hudson Mohawke and Baauer), which escapes from the nursery and makes its way to the dance floor.","short":"Natasha Khan brings her high-concept chamber-pop storytelling back home."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/28/1d/1d/281d1d5d-37a3-665a-c910-694d4d6821b1/24UMGIM02959.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"7e89b6","textColor2":"89a1e0","textColor4":"6f81b5","textColor1":"9cabe1","bgColor":"09020a","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1728134472","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dream-of-delphi/1728134472","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Z3IO9jsrSAxdTluJGZerG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728134472/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"145014446","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/145014446?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717152420943}}},"1728305078":{"id":"1728305078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728305078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0a/36/a8/0a36a8ca-5c93-1a8a-f3b2-14bb20a87c9b/03da7170-5762-4c4f-b879-56f3c80043bc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cbcbc9","textColor2":"dbdbdb","textColor4":"b8b8b8","textColor1":"f2f2f0","bgColor":"2d2d2c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/52/07/fc/5207fc73-2633-4baa-736f-aa4f6a5a0e1a/84c30451-8713-40eb-8c1b-ebea30e01054.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c5","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"c2c2c2","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/crowded-house/490131","name":"Gravity Stairs","artistName":"Crowded House","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"While speaking with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about Crowded House’s eighth studio album, <i>Gravity Stairs</i>, vocalist/guitarist (and primary songwriter) Neil Finn noted that, “People have said that there’s a dreamy sort of semi-psychedelic atmosphere that runs through the record. It’s not something we ever discussed, but...we were excited about having layers and atmospheres through the record.”\n\nThat quality is especially pronounced in the calming “Black Water, White Circle,” opener “Magic Piano,” and closer “Night Song.” The latter two tracks essay the joys and struggles of the creative process, with “Night Song” inspired in part by an unknown man talking to himself outside the songwriter’s hotel room at 3 am (Neil recorded the one-way conversation on his iPhone, which plays underneath the music).\n\nAs with 2021’s <i>Dreamers Are Waiting</i>, Neil is joined on <i>Gravity Stairs</i> by his sons Elroy (drums) and multi-instrumentalist Liam, alongside original bassist Nick Seymour and keyboardist Mitchell Froom, who produced the band’s first three records. \n\nThe psychedelic sheen that washes over the lush, melodic collection of songs reflects the increased input of Neil’s bandmates. “I think we got really obsessed with allowing everybody’s viewpoint,” he told Lowe. \n\nThe album’s familial ties deepen on “Some Greater Plan (for Claire),” co-written by and featuring Neil’s brother Tim. Its flourishes of Mediterranean-inspired acoustic guitar are befitting a song inspired by their father Richard’s brief romance with a woman in Florence during the war; the track represents the idea of redemption, that happiness and love can still flourish even in dark times.\n\nThe LP’s cover was drawn by bassist Seymour and pays homage to The Beatles’ <i>Revolver</i>. Its title, meanwhile, is inspired by a set of heavy stone stairs near Neil’s holiday home in Greece, and the fact they feel more difficult to climb than regular stairs. Representing the symbolic struggle to ascend both in life and creatively (“I began to sense my own weight walking up the gravity stairs,” Neil sings in “Magic Piano”), Crowded House is clearly still willing to put in that extra effort.","short":"Crowded House’s dreamy eighth LP is a family

The heartfelt track offers glimpses at Marlowe’s life growing up small-town North Carolina, like the job his father worked “for 20-some-odd years” and his mother’s Mary Kay side hustle. It’s fitting, then, that the track would title Marlowe’s sophomore album, as the up-and-comer and <i>The Voice</i> alum continues to establish himself as an exciting new voice in the genre. Opener “911” is a clever take on a dive-bar meet-cute, with Marlowe likening a new flame to “a five-alarm fire.” “Tennessee Don’t Mind” is an evocative love song to the Volunteer State, likening it to “a star in the Southern sky.” And songwriter Ella Langley joins Marlowe on “Strangers,” a breakup song about splits that won’t stick. Music Row favorite Dann Huff (Rascal Flatts, Martina McBride) produced the LP, with co-writers including Daniel Tashian, Kendell Marvel, and Josh Osborne.

Me Now?","artistName":"Becky Hill","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"By her own count, Becky Hill’s debut album, 2021’s <i>Only Honest on the Weekend</i>, was “nine years in the making.” However, this follow-up, arriving in May 2024, came together in just nine months. “I grew a little musical baby,” Hill tells Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd. Then again, plenty has changed since Hill released <i>Only Honest on the Weekend</i>. The Worcestershire-born artist won two BRIT Awards for Best Dance Act—in 2022 and 2023—and booked her first arena tour for October 2024. This album’s defiant title is a lyric from its hard-hitting opening track “True Colours,” on which Hill opens up, with help from fellow British singer-songwriter Self Esteem, about her harrowing experience of sexual assault. “If I’d written this song any earlier, it would’ve been too difficult,” she says. At the same time, naming the album <i>Believe Me Now?</i> is Hill’s retort to naysayers and negative voices generally. “I think there was a lot of disbelief in terms of whether or not I’d make it,” she says. “That’s from myself and from people in the industry. I think it’s amazing that I’m doing a second album now and I have no intention of stopping or slowing down.” \n\nIndeed, working with songwriters and producers including Mark Ralph (Years & Years, Clean Bandit), PARISI (Ed Sheeran, Fred again..), and her close friend MNEK (Beyoncé, Little Mix), Hill has doubled down on her catchy, club-ready sound. <i>Believe Me Now?</i> draws from trance, Eurodance, drum ’n’ bass, house, and electronica to deliver anthems primed for raves and the radio alike. “This time around, I wanted to do something that was way more deep-rooted in dance music,” she says. “I wanted to be focused more on the music that I go and listen to in the clubs myself.” Here, Hill talks us through some of her favorite tracks on <i>Believe Me Now?</i>.\n\n<b>“True Colours” (with Self Esteem)</b>\n“This whole song is about sexual assault. When I was going through that at 21, Uzo [Emenike, aka MNEK] was the person that I would go to. I remember crying in his studio about it—he was there by my side throughout the whole thing. He knew I wanted to write a song about it, but I had no idea what I wanted it to be. [Singer-songwriter] Lauren Aquilina has also had her own [negative] experiences in the music industry and been very vocal about it. So when we were writing this song, I had two people: one that knew me very well and one that knew the situation very well. I said, ‘Guys, I don’t want it to be sad. I don’t want it to be a ballad. I want it to be uplifting and to feel powerful.’ And they got the brief instantly. It was the label’s decision to put Self Esteem on [the track] and I loved the idea straight away. She’s actually been helping me quite a lot through talking about sexual assault. I’ve never done it before, and I’ve wanted to do it [now] because I guess I’m the most healed I’ve ever been. I think when you’re able to talk about something on this public level, any shame or guilt, it’s just completely taken away, and you can show people the freedom in that. The first week of it all, when we were talking about ‘True Colours,’ I said to Self Esteem, ‘God, is it normal to feel like a shame hangover?’ She was like, ‘Oh, yeah—it’s draining and exhausting.’ It’s been really powerful having somebody like her on the record—somebody who talks about sexual harassment and sexual assault a lot in her music—and [for her] to be able to guide me through it. I adore Self Esteem and I’m so proud that she’s on this record.”\n\n<b>“Darkest Hour”</b>\n“I wrote this song with [DJ/producer] Franky Wah, MNEK, and [producer] Mark Ralph. I’d been such a massive fan of Franky for ages, but there’s always a sense of careful steps when you approach underground DJs and producers because you’re always worried how they [might] feel about working with somebody like me. But Franky was the biggest gentleman and was like, ‘I absolutely want to work on your album.’ I’d been working with Pete Tong at the time, doing his Ibiza Classics [live] show. I really wanted to merge the orchestral side of things with dance music like Pete had been doing. So we all started writing ‘Darkest Hour’ and [out came] these classic MNEK melodies. When we came to the end of that session, I was like, ‘This is where I want to go [with the album].’”\n\n<b>“Outside of Love”</b>\n“I was at a writing camp where I’d start each morning off by telling [my collaborators], ‘I want you to write songs in this vein. I’m going to come around to every room and help you write sections of the record.’ [At first] I was like, ‘I’m not sure what the concepts are, but I’m really in love and everything is settled and great.’ But by Wednesday, everything had gone to shit. For some reason, my partner wasn’t speaking to me and completely blocked me out. He was really stressed with work—he’s a festival booker [and] this was after COVID when all the festivals had gone downhill. I felt like I was totally on the outside of it all with no explanation. I went in with [Italian dance duo] PARISI. Mike Kintish, who I wrote ‘I Could Get Used to This’ with, and Charlotte Haining, who I wrote ‘My Heart Goes (La Di Da)’ with, were also in the room. I couldn’t understand what I was going through and I was nearly in tears. I was like, ‘I’ve got this idea. It’s called “Outside of Love” and that’s all I’ve got. Guys, this is too painful for me.’ I left the room, came back in [and] they’d written the verse, the pre-chorus and a bit of the chorus. It just told the whole story from start to finish. I sat with them [and] wrote the rest of the chorus and the second verse. It was a lovely session and I felt very held by those people.”\n\n<b>“Multiply”</b>\n“We wrote this in Ibiza—it was midweek, but we did all go to Pikes [nightclub] at the end of [the session], and that was quite messy! It was me, Neave Applebaum—an amazing producer who is behind so many records—plus [songwriters] Charlotte Haining, Emily Makis, and Kieron McIntosh. Charlotte came up with the chorus and I was like, ‘I’m so here for this,’ and then we wrote the whole thing together. Neave gave it that driving bassline as well.”\n\n<b>“Swim”</b>\n“I had the title and the lyric ‘You used to answer straight away/Now you just let it ring.’ Then, I went in [the studio] with Rob Harvey, who you’ll definitely know from co-writing hits like ‘Head and Heart’ by Joel Corry and MNEK. When we started working together, I thought he was going to be this big-shot writer who was a bit arrogant. But he was just the absolute complete opposite and we fell in love with each other a bit—musically, it makes so much sense with me and him. I also wrote this song with [UK duo] Maur, who are incredible producers.”\n\n<b>“Linger”</b>\n“Again, this is a song from a writing camp in Ibiza. I had ‘let love linger’ written down and I said to Charlotte Haining and Mark Ralph, ‘I want it to feel choppy [and] cut up.’ Charlotte came up with the melody and when I walked back in, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is sick, but it needs more.’ But we never actually got around to doing more to this record. My A&R guy Richard O’Donovan was like, ‘I love it as an instrumental. Let’s get Mark to make it into a full trance record and leave it as that.’ So if you like this one, send all your thanks to Richard!”\n\n<b>“One Track Mind” (with RILEASA)</b>\n“I met RILEASA at a launch party for a new ice cream. There were all these drag queens performing on podiums and, as I finished my ice cream, out came this beautiful, Rihanna-look-alike queen called RILEASA. She was just fabulous and I was taken with her. My partner manages an artist called Charlie Boon and said, ‘I need some spoken word stuff for Charlie’s record.’ So I was like, ‘This might be a stab in the dark, but I just met a drag queen with a really beautiful island accent.’ We sent her the track and what came back was a record called ‘We Back’ by Charlie Boon and RILEASA [as Rileasa Slaves].

the early aughts and remaining a pivotal figure in the genre since. Her 1995 self-titled debut still serves as an influence for contemporary artists, so it’s not surprising that the Canadian singer-songwriter might want to connect the dots between generations nearly three decades after that album’s release. On <i>Terri Clark: Take Two</i>, Clark taps some of the genre’s best and brightest to bring some of her biggest hits to a new audience. Highlights on the eight-song project include the Lainey Wilson collaboration “Poor, Poor Pitiful Me,” a 1996 <i>Just the Same</i> cut with enough wit and sass for both firebrand singers to shine. Cody Johnson joins Clark on “I Just Wanna Be Mad,” the opening track from Clark’s 2003 release <i>Pain to Kill</i> and an excellent song to rework as a duet. Kelly Clarkson brings her powerhouse voice to “If I Were You,” a melodic ballad infused with the kind of hard-earned wisdom befitting such a seasoned guest. And Ashley McBryde joins the fun on “Better Things to Do,” another debut cut and one of Clark’s finest and fieriest kiss-offs.

Beethoven’s Triple Concerto, as its name implies, needs three—a violinist, cellist, and pianist—and as such is virtually unique in the history of classical music. “It’s certainly the first and only piece I know for that combination which is performed often,” cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason tells Apple Music Classical.\n\nPlaying alongside Kanneh-Mason on this Decca album are two fellow alumni of the BBC Young Musician competition—violinist Nicola Benedetti and pianist Benjamin Grosvenor. Reaching a common interpretation with a conductor and orchestra can, Kanneh-Mason observes, be more tricky with three soloists, and their own opinions to contend with, than it is with one.\n\n“That’s quite a lot to have going on,” he says, “so we rehearsed a lot as a trio separately from the orchestra, and I also rehearsed a lot with Nicky on the violin, to make sure we were coordinated in terms of what we were doing string-wise and on intonation. As long as we as a trio were very strong and convincing with our ideas, the process of combining with the orchestra would be smooth.”\n\nJust how smooth the process was can be heard on the new recording, where the Benedetti, Kanneh-Mason, and Grosvenor trio combine to brilliant effect with conductor Santtu-Matias Rouvali and the Philharmonia Orchestra, not least in their sparkling account of the Triple Concerto’s “Rondo” finale.\n\nThree high-profile international soloists coming together for a one-off project does not necessarily guarantee a high-quality end result. “We had never played together as a piano trio before, although I knew Nicky’s and Benjamin’s playing and admired it,” Kanneh-Mason explains. “But it was risky in a way, and it might not have worked.”\n\nKanneh-Mason points to a string of live performances of the Triple Concerto, which the trio gave in the run-up to the recording, as crucial in creating the tightness and unanimity needed for a successful studio session. “It gave us time to settle, and to work on small details such as what the best position is for the three soloists on stage.”\n\nAnd although the Triple Concerto is far from being the best-known work by Beethoven, Kanneh-Mason reports that their live performances drew strong audience reaction. “It definitely felt like a special occasion, having three soloists on stage playing together like that,” he says. “And the music itself has such a warm and generous spirit, and an enthusiasm for life reflected in the playful interaction between the parts. It’s a very exciting and celebratory piece.”\n\nIncluded on the album is a selection of Beethoven’s folk song arrangements, where a piano trio accompanies the singer. The Canadian bass-baritone Gerald Finley is the soloist, a luxury casting choice for these rarely performed pieces. “I’d heard a lot of these settings before, and as a trio we selected our favorites,” Kanneh-Mason explains. “With Nicky being Scottish, Benjamin having Irish roots, and myself having Welsh, we wanted to represent those somewhat equally.”\n\nFar from writing simple accompaniments to the folk tunes, Kanneh-Mason feels that Beethoven put considerable time and attention into making his arrangements. “It’s folk music, but it’s also very highly gilded and crafted chamber music,” he comments. \n\n“Like the Triple Concerto, I think these songs are for quite a unique combination of piano trio and voice, and some of Beethoven’s writing in them is a bit more experimental. Gerald Finley is a singer who embraces all of that, and it was wonderful to work with him.”","short":"“This music has such a warm, generous spirit and an enthusiasm for

outlaw: “The guy who’s standing against a whole bunch of folks and it’s like, ‘We’re going to take them down.’ Yeah, you can try!” the musician tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. The obsession is less quaint than it sounds. Having pored through old western films, dime-store pulp novels, and gunslinger ballads à la Marty Robbins, the Virginia native noticed that old-school cowboy culture and hip-hop share a preoccupation with all things American renegade. \n\nThe conversation around country music’s Black roots will sound familiar to anyone who tuned in to Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>, which featured Shaboozey on two tracks. (“Beyoncé’s been such a big part of being Black in America,” he said, still in awe of the opportunity. “At every point in our lives, she has had some sort of cultural impact.”) But the 29-year-old singer/rapper has been staking his territory in the space between hip-hop and country for a decade, redefining what it means to be a modern country star.\n\nHis third album, <i>Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going</i>, plays out like a classic American road movie, opening with steel guitar, the gallop of horse hooves, and Shaboozey with his foot on the gas, fresh out of smokes and headed nowhere in particular. On tracks like “Let It Burn,” his rich baritone is equal parts Willie, Waylon, and woozy blues rap à la Future. Elsewhere, he channels Imagine Dragons’ arena-ready roots rock, where breakup banger “Annabelle” hits the sweet spot between Fleetwood Mac and Post Malone. But the star-making moment is “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the breakaway hit of 2024’s Stagecoach Festival: a Southern-fried riff on a 20-year-old J-Kwon club classic with TGIF vibes.","short":"Fresh off

Album","standard":"Arooj Aftab’s star-making 2021 album <i>Vulture Prince</i> was marked by a distinct and undeniable sadness—a chronicle of grief following the death of Aftab’s younger brother Maher, whom the record was dedicated to. Despite its many contributors, <i>Vulture Prince</i> felt nearly monastic in sound and focus, conjuring images of someone processing pain alone and amidst the cosmos, and since its release, the Pakistani American singer and composer has opened up her sonic world to increasingly thrilling effect. <i>Love in Exile</i>, released in 2023, found Aftab expanding the jazz side of her sound in collaboration with jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, and now her fourth solo album <i>Night Reign</i> reflects her biggest leap yet. It’s the kind of record that makes you realize that Aftab can, when it comes to songwriting and style, do pretty much anything—from smoldering balladry à la the late Jeff Buckley and Sade’s endless-sounding quiet storm to trip-hop’s shadowy iridescence—without losing an ounce of raw emotion.\n\nSimilar to <i>Vulture Prince</i>, <i>Night Reign</i> features a bevy of notable musicians pitching in throughout: Moor Mother delivers raw incantations over the foreboding structure of “Bolo Na,” while Iyer’s keystrokes are deeply felt across the patient tapestry of “Saaqi” and guitarist Kaki King lends her considerable talents to the refracted jazz-folk of “Last Night Reprise.” But it’s Aftab’s voice—rich, resonant, malleable, and instantly recognizable—that provides the true gravitational pull at the center of <i>Night Reign</i>’s universe, echoing through the sparse rustling of “Raat Ki Rani” and shimmering on the surface of the devastating closer “Zameen.” In the press materials for <i>Night Reign</i>, Aftab expresses a desire to “make music with and for everybody,” and this record is undoubtedly the fullest realization of those aims yet, revealing new contours in her songwriting and further cementing her as a singular talent in popular music.","short":"Her fourth solo album is proof the singer and composer can do

favorite tool for escapism,” Cakes da Killa tells Apple Music. Setting the scene for his Pride DJ mix, the rapper describes his current headspace: “I’m still buzzing from last night’s festivities, but I’m in a very, very chill mode.” He admits he’s nursing a hangover, but the calming sound of rainfall outside his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sublet is helping. \n\n“I hope this mix feels like home,” he says. “For the community, clubs and nightlife are safe havens or sanctuaries, and the music is the lifeline that keeps it going. Everything I do is about promoting Black excellence through a queer lens, so that's the vibe I'm giving.

“freaky and energetic” mix from the Paris-based DJ.","standard":"u.r.trax’s Pride DJ mix was tried and tested at clubs before it was compiled: “I selected tracks especially for this mix, tried some things with them live, and compiled the great moments it created in this recording,” she says. “It’s a mix to make you party, and a mix for the afterparty. I see it being played during the daytime, following a sleepless night. It’s freaky and energetic, it’s meant to channel your c**ty, unapologetic self. I think it would fit as much wide-open-air gatherings as much as intimate celebrations.” \n\nThe Paris-based DJ describes the mission of her mix—and DJing, broadly—as creating “an ephemeral space-time where problems are left at the door. A moment to let go of the ‘real world’—a world that is already difficult to navigate in itself, even more if you’re a queer POC—and to reconnect with your community.”\n\n“There’s no need to intellectualize club music, as its main function is to have fun. Still, having fun and occupying the space <i>is</i> political when you’re part of a minority. It is time to reclaim our spaces back.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1744963062","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1744963062"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744963062/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1509294529","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1509294529?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717143892565}}},"1745016086":{"id":"1745016086","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745016086?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"releaseDate":"2024-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/40/46/8e/40468e11-c7e3-eccf-34c4-663db2bc92d7/ed42f192-372a-435f-8224-10d975649e11.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"99ac79","textColor2":"bcc4cc","textColor4":"9ba1a9","textColor1":"b9d18f","bgColor":"18181f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/24/2e/83242e4b-a9a7-b78f-cf2b-6de4e90c0734/15e6da7c-4d37-431c-8841-a4b955038eb0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ddc28f","textColor2":"edbf85","textColor4":"d7a773","textColor1":"f4e0a7","bgColor":"80482e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ayra-starr/1536429348","name":"The Year I Turned 21","artistName":"Ayra Starr","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“In my head, I was looking at this album like a TV show,” Nigerian singer Ayra Starr tells Apple Music about her sophomore album <i>The Year I Turned 21</i>. “Every song is an episode.” Structured as a series of life’s key moments, the album features the sonic adventures and lyrical savvy that saw Starr’s debut album, 2021’s <i>19 & Dangerous</i>, set Afropop streaming records. \n\nBrimming with self-confidence and unvarnished introspection, <i>The Year I Turned 21</i> covers a range of topics, from the fear of failure, newfound love, growing fame and fortune, and gender positivity to parental loss, intimacy, and mental wellbeing. \n\nStarr blends R&B and Afropop with stylistic borrowings from Latin pop, Jamaican dancehall, Nigerian highlife, gospel, and more. “Dem never know I kala,” she sings on “Commas.” The phrase (a mixture of pidgin and Yoruba, which means being underestimated based on looks) shows a keenness for being accessible, a theme explored throughout the album. Combinations of languages and instrumentals abound, buoyed by disparate samples that include ’70s R&B, a field recording, and taped confessions from family members.\n\nProduction was provided by notable hitmakers that include LONDON, P2J, P-Prime, and Starr’s brother and frequent songwriting collaborator, Milar. The main attraction, however, remains Starr’s singing voice, which has grown along with her stardom. “This album has made me who I am now,” she explains. “It was proper character development.” Here, she talks through the album, track by track. \n\n<b>“Birds Sing of Money”</b>\n“My brother, who is a music video director, paid a guy to just sing a Fuji song about me, which is in the beginning of ‘Birds Sing of Money.’ This was a day after I released my first EP, as a gift. And the guy was just hyping me up. That’s a very Yoruba thing.”\n\n<b>“Goodbye (Warm Up)” (with Asake)</b>\n“This is one of my favorite tracks I’ve ever recorded. Ever. Before I sent it to Asake, I wasn’t even sure if he was going to like the song. He was like, ‘OK Ayra, give me some time.’ He sent me his verse in two days. I was like, ‘Oh, this is sounding good.’” \n\n<b>“Commas”</b>\n“‘Commas’ is about how God has blessed me and I’m really grateful for where I am in life and where I’m about to go. I’m grateful for just even being present in this moment and being alive. I feel like that’s what has brought me here, my gratitude and the continuous hard work I will keep putting into this job. God is good.”\n\n<b>“Woman Commando” (with Anitta & Coco Jones)</b>\n“‘Woman Commando’ is such an Afrobeats/amapiano banger in a way, because of the log drums, and I wanted different perspectives. I’ve been watching Coco Jones since I was 12 on Disney’s <i>Let It Shine</i>. I sent her a different song, which she loved, but she was like, ‘Ayra, I want to be on your Afrobeats vibe,’ and I was like, ‘Say less.’ Anitta is such an amazing musician and I really just knew that I wanted to go for that Latin element. Her verse is perfect.”\n\n<b>“Control”</b>\n“Is relinquishing control the same as submission? It depends on how the listener, the audience wants to take it. The lyric goes: ‘I’m lit tonight/You know my lips lie.’ I want you to take control. I want you to be the man. Do your thing. It’s not really about submission, it’s more like I’m giving you hints—take control.”\n\n<b>“Lagos Love Story”</b>\n“‘Lagos Love Story’ is about being in a very happy state of mind. We have that moment where we are so happy, [that] it starts to feel wrong. It starts to feel like, ‘I feel guilty for being this happy.’ You kind of feel relieved when something bad happens, because you’re not used to that amount of happiness. That’s what the song is about: being in a very high state of happiness.”\n\n<b>“Rhythm & Blues”</b>\n“When I released ‘Rhythm & Blues’ [in 2023], I didn’t know if it was the right time. The headspace I was in was a lot of work. I remember recording this song for the first time and how beautiful it was. Also, there is a lyric that goes, ‘My jigga, my muse,’ which I wrote because you don’t expect girl singers to refer to a male love interest as a muse.”\n\n<b>“21”</b>\n“The first demo of ’21’ was a 21st birthday gift from a friend. Writing it, I was kind of stuck because I don’t really know how to write about myself. I’m really good at writing about other people and the TV shows I watch and movies I watch, but never myself. So this album was the first time I actually put myself out there and learned how to write by myself.”\n\n<b>“Last Heartbreak Song” (with GIVĒON)</b>\n“GIVĒON’s verse made me cry the first time I heard it; I was so happy. I’ve always wanted to see what we would sound like together, because we both have really low range. GIVĒON came with the most perfect perspective, because anybody that has been in an argument with a man, or any man that’s been arguing with a girl, would know [that] ‘Last Heartbreak Song’ is literally the dynamic.”\n\n<b>“Bad Vibes” (with Seyi Vibez)</b>\n“Translating Yoruba to English is so annoying sometimes because it doesn’t just hit the same in English. In the hook, the lyric in Yoruba means ‘Don’t poke me in my eye or don‘t hit me in my eye. I don’t break. I’m good.’ It’s an idiom, right? For the guest feature, I wanted a perspective from somebody that would understand what I was trying to do with the song. I felt like that with Seyi Vibez, we sound amazing together.”\n\n<b>“Orun”</b>\n“‘Orun’ is a highlife song and a juxtaposition of a puzzle of life. Highlife songs are usually known for being joyful and you want to dance to it. But with ‘Orun,’ it’s kind of different because I’m talking about mental health and depression.”\n\n<b>“Jazzy’s Song”</b>\n“I’ve been wanting to sample a Don Jazzy production [Wande Coal’s 2009 single ‘You Bad (feat. D’banj)’] for so long and I’m glad I did. The title ‘Jazzy’s Song’ shows my respect for him and how much I admire him as a person, as an artist, and as a musician.”\n\n<b>“1942” (with Milar)</b>\n“This song is introspective and so vulnerable. I’ve been working for so long, and for the first time in my life, I took a vacation on my birthday. I remember being in the pool with a bottle of 1942 tequila, and I was like, ‘Wow, this moment makes everything all worth it.’ After all the time we’ve put into this job, all the hard work, everything I’ve done, that moment of relaxing in that villa, overlooking the ocean, made everything worth it.”\n\n<b>“The Kids Are Alright”</b>\n“Turning 21 is a big [moment] and you start to notice things—like certain behavioral patterns are reflections of certain childhood trauma, or things that you’ve gone through in the past. I noticed that I had not really mourned the death and the loss of my father, and it was something I was holding at the back of my head.”\n\n<b>“Santa” (with Rvssian & Rauw Alejandro)</b>\n“I’ve been a big fan of Rvssian for so long, and we’ve been wanting to work [together] for so long. I recorded the verse and was made to sing in Spanish, literally. It’s so crazy that, once it drops, it becomes this global song, and I’m so happy.”","short":"The singer gets candid: “It’s the first time I actually put myself out there.”"},"artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fa/d4/c4/fad4c4ce-2b3f-0304-8965-3c618987824e/24UMGIM51453.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"e8b181","textColor2":"f8ae3c","textColor4":"e59537","textColor1":"fbd299","bgColor":"993021","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1745016086","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-year-i-turned-21/1745016086","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1W25XYjRQPob14CkgOYVms"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745016086/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1536429348","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1536429348?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717154342091}}},"1745530831":{"id":"1745530831","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745530831?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cassimm/637023672","name":"House Moves EP","artistName":"CASSIMM","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4d/e3/be/4de3bee3-7d8d-5f40-479a-3366e33a3dda/198391885464.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbc3a9","textColor2":"fb2e20","textColor4":"c92519","textColor1":"fff4d4","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1745530831","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/house-moves-ep/1745530831","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ydmKIesUFlzqRt3VKSXIh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745530831/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"637023672","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/637023672?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1715389405837}}},"1745607260":{"id":"1745607260","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745607260?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-05-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aespa/1540251304","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/00/95/f9/0095f936-12e7-985f-a53d-a72493fadf49/5269e9cc-cf57-4928-bff3-67764c11c2fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4baad","textColor2":"cbb8b2","textColor4":"a69692","textColor1":"f1e4d4","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/76/f9/4f/76f94fde-6d52-3cfb-89f0-06f16a1bf69b/3cec0325-0546-4aa3-8793-ec474328a935.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b3d199","textColor2":"c9f2aa","textColor4":"accf93","textColor1":"d1f4b2","bgColor":"3b4534","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a6/83/7c/a6837c25-b720-5bb7-fc97-44ba252c306b/8a59b59f-f816-4919-a379-ce41ab5959db.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9d9ca0","textColor2":"46d5b0","textColor4":"3cae91","textColor1":"c0bec3","bgColor":"111113","hasP3":false}},"name":"Armageddon - The 1st Album","artistName":"aespa","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5f/ca/6e/5fca6e51-ceae-4408-67a4-5a4fe546dd4f/24UMGIM52996.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b9cda4","textColor2":"c1e499","textColor4":"a7c784","textColor1":"d7ebc1","bgColor":"405431","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Fourth-generation K-pop phenoms aespa may be best known for their hyperpop sound and ambitious metaverse concept, but it’s their next-level confidence that lingers long after their songs fade to silence. On their first studio album, <i>Armageddon</i>, the four-member girl group calls on the large-scale language of the universe to express themselves, most especially in the dual lead singles “Supernova” and “Armageddon.” \n\nOn the pre-release track “Supernova,” members Giselle, Karina, Ningning, and Winter compare the group’s work to a star’s explosion: “Bring the light of a dying star/Watch this universe I've brought out.” The song’s synth melody builds to a sample of Afrika Bambaataa’s 1982 “Planet Rock,” paying homage to the hugely influential electronic hip-hop track.

Pride starts as a riot. I want this to feel like a joyful riot.” The US-born, UK-based DJ and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion has crafted a Pride DJ mix that looks to history for inspiration.\n\n“If you can listen to the medley from Sylvester's live album <i>Living Proof</i> and not cry, then I don't know what's wrong with you,” she says, paying tribute to the queer trailblazer’s 1979 album and citing it as the starting point for her mix. “It's a record that for me has so much built into it. I wanted it all to be a part of this. There’s victory, but also sadness and loss. I can't listen to it without thinking about what would come next, which was the total decimation of a whole generation of queer elders,” she says.\n\n“I hope this mix conveys that I’m so proud to be the child of those elders—the spiritual and literal child of queer people who lived through a time that is so different to my own. My own grandmother was a lesbian, and my family is full of gay people. What they went through, and lived through, and who they lost, all of that is built into this.” Her mix has been curated in honor of the “untold queers that we lost before I came of age,” she says, “that we continue to lose when we don't stick up for kids who are learning who they are, and losing their lives for who they are. This is for them.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1746812792","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746812792"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746812792/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1524829861","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1524829861?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717102615917}}},"1746837236":{"id":"1746837236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746837236?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-30","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/aa/30/f2/aa30f265-1754-2a96-2c5f-f7edbf701b93/Job8db1ed97-f616-4669-8ecd-bf019c956e17-168298038-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327364008_1773630336-Time1715996752293.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","222223"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"4a4a4b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"363738","textColor2":"222223","textColor4":"434446","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"4a4a4b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/39/a6/f6/39a6f62d-feed-c9f9-abf1-ebb576a52362/93492282-ce23-47d0-a4ea-b2719374b8e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"a8a8a8","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"141414","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/6b/cb/68/6bcb6828-4da7-0aa4-a1c1-fe812d575aa0/Jobbebde8a0-c385-4368-89a2-7f763d09d946-168298039-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327364009_1773630213-Time1716009447480.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cdced1"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"4a4a4b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"b3b7bc","textColor2":"cdced1","textColor4":"a5a6a8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"4a4a4b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=394293896-264191430-28446224","name":"Black

Seoul-based DJ honors the city’s LGBTQ+ community and parties.","standard":"“I want to take people on a musical journey,” LIGRYE tells Apple Music about his exclusive Pride DJ mix. The South Africa-born, Seoul-based DJ carefully curated each step of the mix. “I took my time to build and tell a story—halfway through, you might have a moment where you say, ‘Okay, I see where this is going.’” LIGRYE curated the mix at home, in Seoul, and credits so much to the city. “South Korea is the first place where I actually celebrated Pride, in Seoul, and fully came out,” he says. “This place is extremely special to me.” It’s only fitting, then, that the mix directly represents the queer nightlife scene in Seoul—and queer music and community around the world. \n\nHighlighting one of his favorite moments on the mix, he draws attention to “Freak Like U” by Masarima. “It resonates on the personal level of growing up, being different, and not understanding why you’re different. And then getting to the point where you’re able to fully accept who you are and celebrate that. I never got to celebrate Pride in my home country, so Pride in Seoul is very, very important to me,” he says. “It started with something so tiny, in Hongdae, and has progressed to something so big—yet we still see a loud minority exhibiting hate.

I ensure clear and clean transitioning, but at the same time, the songs have conversations with each other.” The mix covers plenty of ground—and is designed to be the ideal soundtrack for a range of moments. “I hope this mix helps revive any spirit,” she says. “It’s for anyone who wants to have fun, anyone at home and trying to clean on Sundays, anyone who wants to start their Friday night.

While 2023's <i>Colmillo De Leche</i> evokes the image of biting teeth, <i>Boca Chueca, Vol. 1</i> is about the punches he’s taken that have helped him propel regional Mexican music into an undeniable global force. This project reveals his bad habits, the language he learned on the street, and the essence of who he is. He croons, “Perdona por ser como soy” (“Sorry for being the way I am”), in the gospel-tinged closer “Despídase bien,” but this record makes no apologies. He considers these 19 tracks to be the products of his flaws: “Things that happen to you throughout life, they’re related to you,” he tells Apple Music. “They’ve helped me to carry on living my life the way I like to live it, and, most importantly, to do a lot of healing through my own music.”\n\nFrom the outset, with “Cuando la vida sea trago,” the Hermosillo, Sonora, native cheekily admits that he was always the one giving his mother gray hairs thanks to his ambition and temper. These same traits have led him to where he is today, enabling collaborations with Mexican icons like Pepe Aguilar and Panteón Rococó as well as country and R&B stars like Kane Brown and Leon Bridges, imbuing the album with a texture that resonates on both sides of the Rio Grande. Below, he tells the stories behind some of the songs on <i>Boca Chueca, Vol. 1</i>.\n\n<b>“Frené mis pies”</b>\n“I’m a huge fan of the songs by my friend, composer Alejandro Lozano, and I loved this tune from the moment I heard it. I like the theme of the lyrics, and his use of language. It has a bohemian component, and the meaning is visceral. Drowning your sorrows in tequila, drowning them in Bacanora, like we say in my hometown. Those guitar licks that switch between rock ’n’ roll and the blues evoke the sounds of a bar, and that’s exactly what we wanted to achieve here: a great bar story, right?”\n\n<b>“No sé” (feat. Panteón Rococó)</b>\n“Panteón is a major reference point for Mexican music at an international level, especially within the rock scene, which continues to grow in strength and which I love to give my support. This album proposes a return to those sounds, with plenty of guitars and the classic rock vibe—boosted, of course, by the presence of a great band like Panteón Rococó. This song is my take on cumbia, and the connection that exists between all those different genres belonging to the same family: rumba flamenca from Spain, a little bit of salsa, and then the specific brand of cumbia from the south of Sonora, reflecting the connection between Guamúchil and Navojoa. I explore all those sounds, and then include a guitar solo that brings Santana to mind. All those influences shaped me as a kid, and now I can incorporate them into a single track.”\n\n<b>“Lamentablemente” (feat. Pepe Aguilar)</b>\n“Pepe’s music has been a huge inspiration. Considering everything that he has been doing for such a long time, I believe he is a major reference point. This song is informed by his sounds, and the different sonic paths that he carved as he introduced new horizons to the genre. Being able to record with him was a natural, as I have a deep knowledge of his songbook. I know his style, and I love working with him.”\n\n<b>“Aviso importante” (feat. Bolela)</b>\n“Quite often, artists are too busy trying to find that elusive hit, or obsessing about collaborating with the star of the moment. My only departure point has always been a desire to make good music. It’s the only goal that motivates me, and I’m proud to have recorded this track with my good friend Diego Bolela. He embodies the right direction to follow for Latin music. I love his version, and because the song is his, he has a clear grasp of how this particular story should be told. We’re experiencing a musical renaissance of sorts, and artists like Bolela will have a huge impact on Mexican music.”\n\n<b>“Aunque tú no lo sepas”</b>\n“I love this cover. I keep revisiting baladas and romantic music in all my records. I’m a fan of those slow tempos and the way in which this kind of music can give you chills. No matter what kind of a cover you may attempt to record, the lyrics of ‘Aunque tú no lo sepas’ are enough to move you to tears, regardless of who’s singing. I wanted to record my own version.”\n\n<b>“Despídase bien”</b>⁠\n“Unless I’m mistaken, we were in Madrid, because it was Latin Grammy week. I remember we went to record a feature with Arcángel that is still unreleased, and it was then that my good friends KEITYN and Edgar Barrera showed us ‘Despídase bien’ and ‘Casi oficial,’ which is also on the album. The outro is actually a segment from another song, a bonus track called ‘Con La Misma Espina,’ a song that’s steeped in folklore and reminds me of my grandfather and the music that I listened to when I was growing up—my first taste of regional Mexican. But it also has the kind of lyric that takes on a new meaning in your personal life as the years go by. The implication is that music knows no boundaries—everyone tells their story in their own idiosyncratic way.”","short":"The música mexicana star embraces his

Kia au to moe (rest in peace).”\n\nListen out for her debut single “E Tu” on the mix. “For me as an Indigenous woman, there is nothing like playing music in queer spaces in my language, te reo Māori (the language),” she says. “I dedicate this Pride to all my queer and trans Indigenous whānau (family), tangata Māori (Māori people), tangata moana (people of the ocean), and tangata whenua (people of the land).”\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ef/01/b8/ef01b8f3-509f-de0d-3c3c-78713ddbdde1/31e75a78-7509-46ff-81c2-07861c92b1b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"eebddc","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"e0b9d4","textColor1":"f9edf2","bgColor":"c30083","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1748014447","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748014447"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748014447/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1596372606","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1596372606?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717111395202}}},"1748184410":{"id":"1748184410","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748184410?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-05-27","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6a/37/96/6a3796fc-133f-2b72-d684-47bfb4cbb497/655a30be-96cc-4da2-b31f-fcc11ffb8328.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2beb1","textColor2":"dd8d4f","textColor4":"b87948","textColor1":"eae3d3","bgColor":"25282a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/muyeez/1734992586","name":"Muyeez (Deluxe) -

The best Pride celebrations are where all members of our community feel free and celebrated, and I can imagine myself playing this mix at all sorts of steamy clubs across the city.” The city in question is New York City, of course—the drag icon took inspiration from the city itself while creating the mix: “I’ve been working on it from my home office in Brooklyn, overlooking the East River and Manhattan skyline. I’m always so inspired when I look out and reflect on my past 10 years living in this city and working in queer nightlife. I’m reminded of countless unforgettable moments, and I wanted to encapsulate the spontaneity and excitement of my experiences here.”\n\nOf all the tracks on Aquaria’s mix, Romy’s “Enjoy Your Life” is a particular standout. “To me, this represents one of those songs that you can put on at any time, and even if you’re feeling down, its message and energy will always be there to uplift you,” Aquaria says. “The track reminds you that despite the obstacles life can throw at you, sometimes the solution really does boil down to the simple old-fashioned advice to enjoy your life. I’m all for lyrics with lots of nuance and deeper hidden meaning, but sometimes you don’t need a convoluted metaphor to express pure joy through music. Romy does that so perfectly on this track, and the DJ HEARTSTRING remix pushes that BPM—and message—even harder.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1748666072","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748666072"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748666072/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1097091378","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1097091378?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717079053792}}},"1748849284":{"id":"1748849284","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748849284?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":39,"releaseDate":"2024-05-30","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/thomorrow/1610571241","name":"Isle of Lofi: Soulful Beat Tape 2 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Thomorrow","artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/32/01/f4/3201f4f8-1550-0d9d-0a8a-ea7b8ba214d5/83eff67e-715d-492b-8e66-9f191953893e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"acd3d8","textColor2":"fbc94d","textColor4":"cead4a","textColor1":"d2f8ff","bgColor":"174140","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/isle-of-lofi-soulful-beat-tape-2-dj-mix/1748849284","playParams":{"id":"1748849284","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748849284/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1610571241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1610571241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717099917872}}},"1749160454":{"id":"1749160454","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749160454?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ian/1699587685","name":"Valedictorian [Deluxe]","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"ian","editorialNotes":{"short":"The Dallas rapper leans into caricature and cred on his debut project.","standard":"Existing in the mold pioneered by Asher Roth and Lil Dicky—see: white and nerdy—Dallas-born rapper ian packs this caricature with winking self-awareness. He’s goofy, and as DJ Holiday says in the intro to his debut project, <i>Valedictorian</i>, he “dress white as hell, though.” Everything on the album is a nod to ian’s cred, from the inclusion of Holiday, the Atlanta-based mixtape king, to his ability to speak the language of ATL icons like Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, and more. ian’s self-awareness as the new white dude in rap is constantly pushed up against his ability to mimic the language of hip-hop pioneers. \n\nTake “Bentayga,” a woozy-synth jam with tons of ad-libs and bouncing 808s that get slowed down to near chopped ’n’ screwed pace. The signifiers are bountiful, and any student of rap in the 2010s can pick out a few artists who ian models himself after. “Chauncey,” which pays homage to Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, features blown-out synths and chunky hi-hats, a signal that his ear is also as tuned in to rap’s current era as its predecessor.\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/59/8d/5a598d79-7606-b85d-ddb9-c58c859f7443/196872167238.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2bdbe","textColor2":"dccbbb","textColor4":"b1a699","textColor1":"f2e8e9","bgColor":"031312","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/valedictorian-deluxe/1749160454","playParams":{"id":"1749160454","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0HklW0u2UIH4rurxX6ML8q"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749160454/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1699587685","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1699587685?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717150648210}}}},"artists":{"71676":{"id":"71676","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/71676?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["Country"],"name":"Willie
