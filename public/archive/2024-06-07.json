Album and Interview","standard":"When Elkka turned her sights towards making a debut album after a run of critically acclaimed EPs that established her as one of dance music’s most exciting breakthrough talents, she knew she wanted the record to come from a very personal place. “I really thought about what inspires me,” the Welsh DJ/producer tells Apple Music. “Where have I come from? Where am I now in my life, in my thirties as a woman? Those themes just poured through. One of my main inspirations has always been women and women’s sensuality, and sexuality is something that’s always been at the forefront of what I do. It felt very natural to pour that into the record.”\n\nThe result is <i>Prism of Pleasure</i>, an album of beguiling emotional scope, where vulnerability and strength are at the heart of songs that range from club bangers to ambient techno to euphoric house anthems, the presence of Elkka’s vocal adding a soulful intensity. “I think when you challenge yourself as a musician and you expose certain parts of yourself, things really translate musically. I wanted people to feel like I’ve poured myself into this.” After her father passed away during the album’s creation, Elkka found a new resilience to push forward. “I decided I had to finish this and I had to do that for him, for me, for my family. He wouldn’t have wanted his passing to derail my passion and my future,” she says. Read on as she guides us through a poignant, propulsive debut, track by track.\n\n<b>“Break all my walls down”</b>\n“Opening the record with my voice was quite important as a statement of what I want this record to be about. That vulnerability in singing is very different to a dance track without me on it, which I’ve done before. This song is very much like I’m pouring myself out to you here, that I’ll give everything to you to make sure that you love me and that you feel my love. I wrote this track because I needed someone to hear that, so it’s not a made-up story, it's very much part of my life. [It] was quite important to me for people to hear that straight away, to let them know that this record isn’t just going to be pure dance music, it’s more than that.”\n\n<b>“Right Here”</b>\n“I wrote this on the day of my dad’s funeral. It was the last track written for the record. In the back of my mind, I was searching for another song subconsciously before he passed away. But there was a moment where I just needed to go in on myself and put my headphones on and sit at the kitchen table, which I did, hours before his funeral. I felt the real urge to write, which is not usually how I go about things. Sometimes, out of sheer vulnerability, really beautiful things can happen and this is probably the most vulnerable point in my entire life thus far. There’s a beautiful melancholy to it. I really love this song and it’s a nice way to dedicate something to my dad but I don’t want it to be necessarily seen as a sad song, it oddly feels uplifting at the same time.”\n\n<b>“Make Me”</b>\n“‘Make Me’ was one of the first tracks I wrote, a number of years ago, before the album process started. I love the fact that it has this incredible energy to it but also this softness and warmth. Warmth is something that I really treasure throughout everything I write, and I think it’s a tangible consistency between everything that I do. It was a collage of different things that came together and I was able to add my vocals to it. I think it’s an interesting track because it has this powerful cursive element to it, but also this kind of warm, ‘sing along with your friends and family or lovers on the dance floor’ moment as well.”\n\n<b>“Crushhh” (feat. John Carroll Kirby)</b>\n“This is probably the most vulnerable track because it came from a real place. They all have come from a real place, but [this is] about a real person. And crushes are hard. Crushes can be unrequited, they can be unfulfilled. I think you can hear that in my voice on this song. I wrote this with John Carroll Kirby. It came out of the session where we also wrote ‘Passionfruit.’ We laid the groundwork of melodic ideas for this and then I came home and wrote it. It just poured out of me, and this person that I had in my life at one point poured out of me as well. It’s one of my favorite tracks on the record.”\n\n<b>“Air Tight” (feat. Dot Major)</b>\n“I wrote this with Dot from London Grammar, who’s wonderful, and we just instantly became really good friends. It’s a more simplistic song than some of the other ones because it’s just a really great dance track. It took us a while to pull together, sometimes things sound simple but it’s quite a complicated track in production. Getting the balance right with everything and the structure was more challenging for this track. It took several sessions and different forms.”\n\n<b>“Your Skin”</b>\n“This was fairly early on in the writing process where I was like, ‘I want to sing more…how do I do this?’ I was kind of crystallizing what I wanted the record to be about, about feeling liberated to talk about women’s sexuality and sensuality, and this is about that, being in bed with someone, about how they feel to you, they taste to you, lust for someone. I think that tension is in there in that song, you can hear it. I performed it quite a lot last year as well. There were a few tracks that I put into my live show that were unreleased just to see how they felt and this always garnered such a great reaction. And I got David Kennedy [the London DJ/producer Pearson Sound] to mix it as well, which was another great collaboration for the record.”\n\n<b>“Passionfruit” (feat. John Carroll Kirby)</b>\n“This came from an improvisation with John. We had one main session where we wrote the basis of these two tracks and it was a long, sprawling improvisation. I fully expected to listen to it back and be like, ‘Right, I’m going to take this section from here and this section from here and craft this,’ but I was listening to it over and over again and being, ‘I don’t want to cut any of this out.’ There’s something beautiful about the journey of this track and how it’s about taking your time. It made me think about the record and the symbolism of taking your time with someone and the joy of that. When I think of women, I think of that, not being in a rush. Exploring someone is the most beautiful thing.”\n\n<b>“I Just Want to Love You”</b>\n“This is a previous single of mine and I really felt like it had a place on the album. It’s very relevant to this record and it’s just a beautiful love song. It uses a sample of John Martyn’s ‘Small Hours’ and the response to this song’s always been so prevalent. At gigs, it’s the song that people talk to me about the most. I think a record about pleasure is also about love and heartbreak, so this song needed to be on there for that.”\n\n<b>“surrender2me”</b>\n“This is a dance-floor-moment track, it has that want-to-put-your-arm-around-someone feeling to it. There’s a bit of heartbreak in there with the words. It was originally sung by Olivia Newton-John, ‘Love Song,’ which is a beautiful, beautiful track.”\n\n<b>“FCKD It”</b>\n“Like the beginning, this was an expression of ‘I need to write something to tell someone how I’m feeling and what’s happened.’ I wrote the first version of this in lockdown. I had a really rough time, like a lot of people, during that time, and I nearly fucked it up and I needed to tell the person I love that I’m not in a good place, but I am trying to get out of it. Luckily, I didn’t fuck it up, but I was very close. This record was never going to be just about pure joy, I didn’t want it to feel like it was not showing all sides of being a woman. Women’s pleasure comes with pain sometimes from different points in your life, and it would be naive to not explore that too, the vulnerability that we have at different moments, which can be beautiful and painful. It was a nice bookend from the first song to the last song, a record of something that I came through.”","short":"The DJ/producer on her deeply personal debut: “I’ve poured myself into this.”"},"playParams":{"id":"1724176280","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/prism-of-pleasure/1724176280","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0fGG1bH61jnLMW2cvpB6Er"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1724176280/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1183479094","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1183479094?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717751296325}}},"1726888259":{"id":"1726888259","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726888259?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video112/v4/2a/86/17/2a861791-5511-3502-e7a4-b6162cf802bc/Jobc97875aa-2752-43b9-821f-d95948a659b3-163076312-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315835112_1686728789-Time1708008340327.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","81bfd0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"6cabb6","textColor2":"81bfd0","textColor4":"6799ab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/04/1b/c3/041bc381-d017-c566-046d-6dfd42e72a4b/c85b0069-42c7-462c-b0e2-8a19720fa743.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"90a3a4","textColor2":"d2b196","textColor4":"ab917b","textColor1":"b0c7c9","bgColor":"0f100f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video122/v4/08/6c/c0/086cc046-3e67-c776-16f3-8035ce8271ef/Jobf1c3b5fd-e9f0-4e1b-9291-d7ceca8d85cb-163076313-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_315835111_1686728790-Time1708010338114.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"7eabb7","textColor2":"71a6d2","textColor4":"5b85ad","textColor1":"9ed6de","bgColor":"00001d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/goat-girl/1151399185","name":"Below the Waste","artistName":"Goat Girl","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The trio calls on electronics, choirs, and strings for its most expansive set yet."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/a0/74/f3/a074f3e9-c185-4034-e8eb-7e103ae5b48c/191402047578.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"82acb4","textColor2":"8cb9da","textColor4":"7094b4","textColor1":"a3d7d9","bgColor":"00001e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/below-the-waste/1726888259","playParams":{"id":"1726888259","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Jyr6ZID2DRvvj4FLQ7Sxa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1726888259/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1151399185","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1151399185?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717754298273}}},"1728697606":{"id":"1728697606","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1728697606?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/39/58/95/39589575-e271-9df4-1619-77db01d74978/e06c45fe-a6f8-40be-8679-5e989939250a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"323a3f","textColor2":"282f2f","textColor4":"51514d","textColor1":"01121f","bgColor":"f3ddc3","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/52/9d/8f/529d8fb2-aff6-faf5-7068-3cb195bd1f16/4739a287-7b56-47bd-abfe-0f0e5b1c578f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"23242a","textColor2":"1f1d1a","textColor4":"3c3833","textColor1":"00040f","bgColor":"afa494","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alfie-templeman/1199962512","name":"Radiosoul","artistName":"Alfie Templeman","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/d2/bd/d2/d2bdd2a7-972f-1381-a0d3-6ca7754adb85/198391074080.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9b8a6","textColor2":"edcf9b","textColor4":"c1a882","textColor1":"f6e2c9","bgColor":"12101e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"If Alfie Templeman’s 2022 full-length debut <i>Mellow Moon</i> was a record that—from the confines of lockdown—dreamed of freedom and losing yourself with your friends, then his second record is a joyous address from the wild. The Bedfordshire singer-songwriter spent an extended stretch on the road before hunkering down to work on <i>Radiosoul</i>—and from the sound of the album, he had the time of his life. It’s an ecstatic, groove-laden indie-pop record full of uplifting, radiant hooks and a disco swagger (a guest appearance from Nile Rodgers no doubt helped with that). “I feel like this is the most me-sounding record I’ve made,” Templeman tells Apple Music. “It was recorded in summer, and it’s got that spontaneous energy that comes from being in the sun.”\n\nShielding during lockdown, Templeman was stuck in his room while writing <i>Mellow Moon</i> with nowhere but his own mind to explore. Here, however, he had a wealth of joyous experiences to draw upon. “I had so much to sing about this time,” he says. “This album was essentially about making up for lost time and shoving a lot of experiences into a small amount of time.” <i>Radiosoul</i> is an album that documents the first steps into adulthood for Templeman, who turned 21 a few months before its release. “It’s about moving out from my parents’ house, going to London, and trying to figure out how to fit in,” he explains, reflecting on leaving his teenage self behind. “It was about ‘How do I start from the beginning? Where do I go next?’” The answer, it seems, was to a place where exuberant pop bangers are the order of the day. Here, Templeman talks us through <i>Radiosoul</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Radiosoul”</b>\n“This was one of the earliest ones, it began to take shape in the summer of ’22. It’s all about me wrapping my head around that growing, profound impact of social media, the idea that people are so obsessed with being on their phones all the time, and no one’s hanging out with each other anymore. It doesn’t help that we’re in a cost-of-living crisis and everything’s too expensive, you can’t go out with anyone because it’s so expensive, so the norm now is social media and [to] sit on your phone all day. I wanted to write a song about observing the fact that this is just growing and getting bigger and bigger.”\n\n<b>“Eyes Wide Shut”</b>\n“This was also one of the early songs and it was about feeling overwhelmed by the world. As I’ve got older, I’ve become quite a bit more sensitive, and I guess that comes with being an artist from a young age. Basically, in ’22, when I was on tour, this therapist I was talking to at the time was saying, ‘You should write down whatever you think of in the morning, the first 10 minutes of the day, just write down your thoughts.’ So I started collecting them and then I continued it after the tour. The juxtaposition between the two was really interesting so I cut up the words later on and put together ‘Eyes Wide Shut.’ It felt like a really good way to write, it kicked off that idea of making quite a personal record.”\n\n<b>“This is Just the Beginning”</b>\n“When you’ve had two very intense subjects in songs on the album, it’s quite nice to break it up with something a bit more sweet and innocent. I wrote this one when I was about 14. The melody was so addictive to me, and it used to run around in my head for years and years. If that naturally happens and comes to you and it’s still kicking about in your head seven or eight years later, then it’s probably worth having a look at again. For me, it sounds like being 14 again. It had been in the back of my mind for so long, and I wanted to make something really cute and happy-go-lucky for the record and that’s how this song fit in.”\n\n<b>“Vultures”</b>\n“I’m really proud of ‘Vultures.’ It’s the only song that I produced on the record by myself. It’s an insight into how I see a lot of famous artists explode overnight, and it’s quite scary, so intense, and how does anyone know what to do with that? Especially with TikTok and social media, a lot of people will just blow up overnight, and then it’s like, ‘How do I have a career out of this?’ If they see something that’s making a quick buck, then the vultures of the industry will eat that up very quickly. It’s about how people get fucked over by people in the industry, because they have a big hit by accident or something, and then next minute they’re being controlled and puppeted.”\n\n<b>“Drag”</b>\n“‘Drag’ is about co-dependency in relationships, but also friendships. It’s about the idea of burdening other people without really knowing that you’re doing it, relying on other people to help you and make you feel better. It’s a bit of a dilemma, because you need these people and you need their affection and love to make you feel better, but, at the same time, you’re dragging them down. It’s quite a sad song but also maybe the happiest-sounding of all of the tracks. I’ve always tended to go for that, where musically, it’s really happy but lyrically, it’s quite sad.”\n\n<b>“Hello Lonely”</b>\n“This captures the existential thoughts that everyone had during the pandemic and how coming out of it, no one really knew what to do. ‘What now? Where do I go?’ It was like essentially checking in on yourself after two years. I haven’t released too much music in the last couple of years, so on the forefront it looks like I disappeared, but actually I’ve had a very hectic couple of years, so I wanted to answer people’s questions. It was about checking in with myself, but also with my followers and my fans and my friends and saying, ‘OK, this is what I’ve got up to the last couple years.’ It sounds like a chat with a therapist almost. It’s very direct—a very melodic, very sugary pop song, yet it still sounds like you’re just talking to someone.”\n\n<b>“Just a Dance”</b>\n“Nobody has rhythm like Nile Rodgers so having Nile Rodgers on a song of yours is pretty crazy. I was lucky enough to develop a relationship with Nile over the last couple of years and I went to Miami to record with him. We had two or three days together and he made me feel so comfortable. He’s such a humble, lovely person. I’d get in at 10 in the morning and leave at 10 at night, we’d have massive sessions, but he’d tell me so many stories and make me feel so comfortable. He taught me so much about being spontaneous and not overthinking things too much. This song plays into what Nile Rodgers is so good at and that’s making catchy, simple, good choruses.”\n\n<b>“Submarine”</b>\n“‘Submarine’ is a song about coming back from tour. It was like a fever dream I had on tour. I was ill, and I was just thinking about coming back home, and I was really tired. I wanted to see my girlfriend. I was thinking about her a lot. She’s really into marine biology so I wrote a song about coming home in a submarine to go and see her. It’s the idea of being back at home and being in your natural element and being happy, having a really simple life with your girlfriend. At the time, my life was really hectic and I was touring a lot, living out of a suitcase for months and months, and I was fed up of that. I just wanted to go home and cuddle up to her.”\n\n<b>“Beckham”</b>\n“I did this with Dan Carey [Wet Leg and Fontaines D.C. producer], who’s one of my dream producers to work with. It was a very spontaneous song, it just came out of nowhere. I’m still trying to figure out what the lyrics exactly are about because they just fell out of me. I wanted to make something that sounded really absurd and really strange and just out of this world. The chorus says, ‘Sutton, Bexley, Tooting, Earlsfield, Streatham, Peckham, David Beckham,’ which is weird, but it was actually a list of places that I was looking to move to in London and it accidentally became the chorus because David Beckham rhymes with Peckham. I was like, ‘Why not?!’ which is quite funny.”\n\n<b>“Switch”</b>\n“One time, I had this amazing cold shower that completely revitalized me. Cold showers really help me to just calm down and face whatever comes my way, so I wanted to write a song paying homage to taking cold showers. The verse lyrics go into the details of giving into commercial pressure and sacrificing your art, which is something that I really wanted to reverse with this album and do my own thing. I wanted to talk about the idea of trying to stay true to yourself, like having a cold shower and flicking that switch in your brain, just being you, being on it, and being true to yourself, sticking up for yourself.”\n\n<b>“Run to Tomorrow”</b>\n“‘Run to Tomorrow’ is definitely the song that I’m the most nervous about releasing, because it’s very direct. It’s a very personal song. The lyrics are a set of words that I wrote down to help myself [to calm] down when having a panic attack, so it goes into detail about that and ways of me calming myself down to be OK—a step-by-step guide to calming yourself. When I have wobbles, I have little instructions and reminders that I tell myself, to help me out, like ‘no feeling is final,’ that kind of thing, ‘keep moving on.’ ‘Run To Tomorrow’ is about trying not to work yourself up too much, because once I get in the headspace of doing that, I go a bit crazy. But there’s a real vulnerability in the vocal takes because at the time of recording it, I was in a pretty rough place. I only did a couple [of] takes so it’s quite a vulnerable song, but I think it’s a really special song.”","short":"“It’s about making up for lost time”: The alt-pop star on his joyful second

Album","standard":"Carly Pearce’s fourth studio album opens with an admission: “Country music made me do it, and I’ll do it till I die.” The award-winning singer-songwriter goes on to list a string of “its,” including taking it “way too far” and letting “the wrong boy” kiss her. Of course, it’s those very moments that Pearce so deftly documents, establishing herself as a major songwriting force in the genre with her evocative, often gut-wrenching accounts of hard times and heartache. On <i>hummingbird</i>, there is no shortage of such moments, though this follow-up to 2021’s <i>29: Written in Stone</i> feels sonically lighter and more spacious than its predecessors, a vibe hinted at by the record’s delicate title. \n\nPearce co-produced the LP alongside Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, marking her first time in a producing role. Standouts include “things I don’t chase,” a slow-burn torch song for “the stubborn kind” of man Pearce just “don’t chase,” as well as the head-over-heels infatuation of “trust issues.” Chris Stapleton joins Pearce on the aching duet “we don’t fight anymore,” a ballad about a love whose spark is long burnt out. And Pearce closes the project with its title track, an image-rich accounting of memories that linger and haunt.","short":"On her fourth album, her evocative songwriting gets a more spacious

Album and Interview","standard":"Meghan Trainor is back, just in time. “I survived two C-sections, period—I'm alive,” she tells Apple Music's Zane Lowe. “And a week after the C-section, I started in the studio immediately because I'm a workaholic and I really love this album. Babies bring inspiration and they make me want to be the best human being I can try to be.”\n\nHer sixth studio effort <i>Timeless</i> is a mix of vintage Trainor with a few twists, which she points out is intentional. “My fans love when I do pure pop,” she says. “And then a lot of the world likes when I do just the doo-wop stuff. So I try to make everybody happy, and so I tried to blend it together and was like, let's make a weird new genre that's different or something, or I haven't heard that in a while. And I love when that happens.” \n\n“To the Moon” certainly fits that bill, with a sound that meshes “All About That Bass” with circa-2006 Justin Timberlake. And “Been Like This,” a duet with T-Pain, starts with an old-timey jazz riff but transforms into a bouncy back-and-forth between the two singers, with Trainor’s signature sassiness in the lyrics (“Ain’t nothin’ new, still that bitch”). T-Pain, who also appears on “Love on Hold,” isn’t the album’s only special guest. \n\nThe pop-soul sibling duo Lawrence add their stylings to “Crushin’,” and “I Wanna Thank Me” features a snippet of Niecy Nash’s 2024 Emmys speech as well as the actor, her daughter, and her wife Jessica Betts on backing vocals. “I was like, ‘Please, I want you to feature on it, have publishing, because you inspired it, you're all over the song,” Trainor says. “And then I want your daughters and your wife to come sing background with you. Come over and we'll do the chorus together.' And we did.”","short":"A mix of her vintage sound with some twists: “I try to make everybody happy.”"},"playParams":{"id":"1735386056","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/timeless/1735386056","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58UwdMAci96aMa30xLuutY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735386056/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"348580754","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/348580754?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717753840822}}},"1735405553":{"id":"1735405553","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735405553?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bon-jovi/122782","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/ea/a9/8beaa90b-1d6e-c2a1-7798-514b38a3db86/98c03ea0-b4f6-4bb0-bc1c-c5d0f8c1bba1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cccbca","textColor2":"f5d9c1","textColor4":"cdb7a4","textColor1":"f3f3f1","bgColor":"2e2d2d","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/01/80/64/01806445-0432-8ece-6368-3f07b9013f1e/400c6beb-6395-4137-b14b-c43b9e70b17b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"252525","textColor2":"0b0b0b","textColor4":"282828","textColor1":"070707","bgColor":"9f9f9f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/92/20/cf/9220cfc2-a0ff-485b-70e6-9c2d2d4a0df6/e9a4f82c-9b54-4f5e-8a90-cf2d07ead151.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a3a3a","textColor2":"2b2b2b","textColor4":"525252","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"eeeeee","hasP3":false}},"name":"Forever","artistName":"Bon Jovi","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/38/2f/d0/382fd059-054c-625e-b10c-0c692f7d9b66/24UMGIM27342.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfcfcf","textColor2":"d8d8d8","textColor4":"b7b7b7","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"353535","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Bon Jovi's career has been defined by optimism since its leader, the ever-affable Jon Bon Jovi, hustled his way onto New York rock radio in the early ’80s, with songs like “Wanted Dead or Alive” and “Keep the Faith” serving as shout-along anthems. On <i>Forever</i>, the New Jersey band's 16th album, the band's outlook remains bright—although this go-round, marking their 40th anniversary, they're celebrating themselves, too. “In the last decade, it's been hard to find joy for a lot of reasons; there's a lot of joy in this,” Bon Jovi tells Apple Music's Zane Lowe. Personal and global challenges—the departure of longtime guitarist Richie Sambora, the pandemic, vocal cord issues that resulted in experimental surgery for the lead singer—weighed heavily. “It was a decade in the making because of that: trials and tribulations. I don't want to sound pompous about it, but talk to me about a career after 20. And when you get to 40, now we can start talking about this for real.” <i>Forever</i> is a loud and proud shedding of those troubles, 12 tracks that honor and burnish their legacy as one of the MTV era's hugest rock bands. \n\nOpening track “Legendary” turns the doubt that hovered over the band into a reason for celebration, finding reasons to “raise my hands up to the sky” in old songs and old friends—and in the act of being alive. “Living Proof” harkens back to talk-box-assisted Bon Jovi jams of yore like “Livin' on a Prayer” in chugging sound and unyielding spirit, with Jon Bon Jovi, his voice a little huskier but still unmistakable, wondering, “Is there anything left for a sinner like me?” and realizing the answer is right under his own roof. Perhaps appropriately given the album's name, <i>Forever</i> finds Bon Jovi getting a little meta, reflecting on their individual and collective journeys. “We Made It Look Easy” is a charging anthem that calls back to the days when the band was “chasing the dawn/Getting lost in a song,” while “I Wrote You a Song” is a slow-blooming ballad that'll have arena audiences raising their lighters, or their phone flashlights. \n\n“My First Guitar,” a sparkling power-pop track, is an ode to the instrument on which Jon Bon Jovi cut his teeth, a story inspired by him actually retrieving it—still in its cardboard case—from the New Jersey neighbor who bought it years ago. Its romanticism—“She's the only one who knows the way I feel,” he croons—underscores just how passionate Bon Jovi and his bandmates still are about music four-plus decades into their storied career. “Nobody wants to go through the dark periods to get to the light,” he tells Apple Music. “But when you get to the light, it's even more joyous.”","short":"JBJ on the decade-in-the-making 16th album: “There’s a lot of joy in this.”"},"playParams":{"id":"1735405553","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever/1735405553","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MCqgJGGIXwh9YhZFtwwXW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735405553/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"122782","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/122782?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717753143194}}},"1735512900":{"id":"1735512900","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735512900?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f1/91/35/f19135a0-d500-20c9-782b-299e029a09ac/0e65db44-0679-4b4e-9057-2837fdc4f61d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"28272b","textColor2":"171416","textColor4":"333233","textColor1":"09070c","bgColor":"a3aba8","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/07/5d/ef/075def6a-afac-e7f6-7e55-e7aad940ba40/fae0f7c5-8fc0-4053-a2af-325ad0873d3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cbd4da","textColor2":"eaeffa","textColor4":"cbd1df","textColor1":"eaf2f4","bgColor":"505c76","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/54/ce/d7/54ced7b3-4c03-89ae-f6c1-80bb60789b69/7c1d2c7f-e728-4fe1-83e8-d5d29873ed20.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4d565d","textColor2":"38312d","textColor4":"5c5855","textColor1":"252e37","bgColor":"edf6f4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/peggy-gou/1068912248","name":"I Hear You","artistName":"Peggy Gou","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5d/67/1e/5d671e2a-5130-5296-69ac-0457c8a8ed94/191404137574.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"393c3d","textColor2":"23303c","textColor4":"4c5761","textColor1":"0a0e0f","bgColor":"f4f4f4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The cover artwork for Peggy Gou’s debut album features the South Korean DJ/producer wearing a mirrored headpiece that creates kaleidoscopic reflections of her ears. The piece, an aural sculpture by Olafur Eliasson, is an artful interpretation of Gou’s view that “everybody wants to be heard.” Years after crashing dance music’s radar in the late 2010s with shimmering tracks “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)” and “Starry Night,” she found crossover success in 2023 when her sunny single “(It Goes Like) Nanana” went viral.\n\n<i>I Hear You</i> welcomes more people to Gou’s party utopia. It straddles the line between mainstream and underground, pairing the sleek production heard spilling from smoky nightclubs and Ibiza terraces with song-structured vocals. “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” “I Go,” and “Back to One” are effortlessly cool yet earnest, communicating messages of positivity, perseverance, and staying true to oneself atop ’90s dance rhythms. R&Balearic serenade “I Believe in Love Again” with Lenny Kravitz continues the throwback influence with a classic organ bassline, followed by Villano Antillano collaboration “All That,” which samples Kevin Lyttle’s 2003 song “Turn Me On.”\n\nBeyond the summer anthems, the album occasionally gets experimental, swerving into drum ’n’ bass with a side of traditional Korean instrument gayageum on “Seoulsi Peggygou (서울시페기구)” and drifting through hazy acid breakbeats on “Purple Horizon.” Of all the sounds in Gou’s technicolor palette, her best instrument is her breezy voice, with which she delivers simple yet irresistible hooks in English and Korean. That she’s had hits in both languages is proof of music’s universal nature. As she sings in the latter on “Lobster Telephone,” “I know you don’t understand this/But it doesn’t matter/It’s all the same/We’re all the same.”","short":"The South Korean DJ/producer’s long-awaited

Album","standard":"It’s no surprise that “PARTYGIRL” is the name Charli XCX adopted for the DJ nights she put on in support of <i>BRAT</i>. It’s kind of her brand anyway, but on her sixth studio album, the British pop star is reveling in the trashy, sugary glitz of the club. <i>BRAT</i> is a record that brings to life the pleasure of colorful, sticky dance floors and too-sweet alcopops lingering in the back of your mouth, fizzing with volatility, possibility, and strutting vanity (“I’ll always be the one,” she sneers deliciously on the A. G. Cook- and Cirkut-produced opening track “360”). \n\nOf course, Charli XCX—real name Charlotte Aitchison—has frequently taken pleasure in delivering both self-adoring bangers and poignant self-reflection. Take her 2022 pop-girl yet often personal concept album <i>CRASH</i>, which was preceded by the diaristic approach of her excellent lockdown album <i>how i’m feeling now</i>. But here, there’s something especially tantalizing in her directness over the intoxicating fumes of hedonism. Yes, she’s having a raucous time with her cool internet It-girl friends, but a night out also means the introspection that might come to you in the midst of a party, or the insurmountable dread of the morning after. \n\nOn “So I,” for example, she misses her friend and fellow musician, the brilliant SOPHIE, and lyrically nods to the late artist’s 2017 track “It’s Okay to Cry.” Charli XCX has always been shaped and inspired by SOPHIE, and you can hear the influence of her pioneering sounds in many of the vocals and textures throughout <i>BRAT</i>. Elsewhere, she’s trying to figure out if she’s connecting with a new female friend through love or jealousy on the sharp, almost Uffie-esque “Girl, so confusing,” on which Aitchison boldly skewers the inanity of “girl’s girl” feminism. She worries she’s embarrassed herself at a party on “I might say something stupid,” wishes she wasn’t so concerned about image and fame on “Rewind,” and even wonders quite candidly about whether she wants kids on the sweet sparseness of “I think about it all the time.” In short, this is big, swaggering party music, but always with an undercurrent of honesty and heart.\n\nFor too long, Charli XCX has been framed as some kind of fringe underground artist, in spite of being signed to a major label and delivering a consistent run of albums and singles in the years leading up to this record. In her <i>BRAT</i> era, whether she’s exuberant and self-obsessed or sad and introspective, Charli XCX reminds us that she’s in her own lane, thriving.

To 2003, in fact, when the orchestra’s then music director Esa-Pekka Salonen conducted the premiere of her percussion concerto <i>Altar de Piedra</i> (<i>Stone Altar</i>). Two decades later, the relationship is stronger than ever, as <i>Revolución diamantina</i> (<i>Glitter Revolution</i>), this new all-Ortiz release, vibrantly demonstrates.\n\nVisceral colors and a dynamic rhythmic impetus are central to Ortiz’s music, and a large part of what audiences find attractive. But in the ballet score <i>Revolución diamantina</i> a strong social justice element is at work too. The piece’s title references a march which took place in August 2019 in Mexico City, following the alleged rape of a teenage girl by four police officers. Pink glitter was thrown at the local Security Minister in protest.\n\n“Feminicide is a major issue in my country,” Ortiz tells Apple Music Classical. “In Mexico and Latin America, every single day a woman is killed by a man, and there are mothers whose daughters have disappeared or whose bodies are found in the desert. When I got the opportunity to write a ballet, I wanted to write something really strong, and immediately I decided to use voices in the composition.”\n\nEight women’s voices are woven into the textures of <i>Revolución diamantina</i>, and some of what they sing is based on recordings made at women’s protest marches in Mexico. “They are part of the orchestra, not soloists,” says Ortiz. “They represent all of the women who are fighting these injustices.”\n\nImaginative sound combinations are also a feature of <i>Altar de cuerda</i> (<i>String Altar</i>), the violin concerto which opens the program, performed here by violinist Maria Dueñas, for whom it was written. Its middle movement meditates on the “open chapels” built for indigenous peoples to use in 16th-century Mexican churches. “As a metaphor, I wanted to create open spaces for the orchestra, from the lower register to the higher register,” Ortiz explains. “And I needed something really mysterious and enigmatic for that, and the sound of the glasses melted into these really slowly growing chords.”\n\nThe ebullient tone poem <i>Kauyumari</i>, a piece commissioned to celebrate emergence from the pandemic, completes the album. It’s a project Ortiz is extremely proud of, and she heaps praise on the LA Philharmonic and conductor Gustavo Dudamel for the outstanding qualities they bring.\n\n“The drama and the energy of live performance is all there, something you can never get in a studio recording,” she says. “Gustavo, you know, he can read my mind, he understands everything about my music. And working with the musicians of the Los Angeles Philharmonic is one of the most incredible things that ever happened in my career.”","short":"Experience the visceral power of Gabriela Ortiz’s

things with them live, and compiled the great moments it created in this recording,” she says. “It’s a mix to make you party, and a mix for the afterparty. I see it being played during the daytime, following a sleepless night. It’s freaky and energetic, it’s meant to channel your c**ty, unapologetic self. I think it would fit as much wide-open-air gatherings as much as intimate celebrations.” \n\nThe Paris-based DJ describes the mission of her mix—and DJing, broadly—as creating “an ephemeral space-time where problems are left at the door. A moment to let go of the ‘real world’—a world that is already difficult to navigate in itself, even more if you’re a queer POC—and to reconnect with your community.”\n\n“There’s no need to intellectualize club music, as its main function is to have fun. Still, having fun and occupying the space <i>is</i> political when you’re part of a minority. It is time to reclaim our spaces

Pride starts as a riot. I want this to feel like a joyful riot.” The US-born, UK-based DJ and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion has crafted a Pride DJ mix that looks to history for inspiration.\n\n“If you can listen to the medley from Sylvester's live album <i>Living Proof</i> and not cry, then I don't know what's wrong with you,” she says, paying tribute to the queer trailblazer’s 1979 album and citing it as the starting point for her mix. “It's a record that for me has so much built into it. I wanted it all to be a part of this. There’s victory, but also sadness and loss. I can't listen to it without thinking about what would come next, which was the total decimation of a whole generation of queer elders,” she says.\n\n“I hope this mix conveys that I’m so proud to be the child of those elders—the spiritual and literal child of queer people who lived through a time that is so different to my own.

People have wanted me to do this for a long time.” The Grammy Award-winning pianist and composer is talking about the direction of his latest album <i>Let Go</i>, a project he created in partnership with Apple Music with the express intention of helping listeners recalibrate mentally. “I wouldn't call it the ‘meditation project’ or nothing like that,” Glasper says. “But it’s something you can put on that helps you find your center. It's just something that quiets the world and allows you to see what’s within.” \n\n<i>Let Go</i> may be the first Glasper project with an overtly meditative direction, but it’s hardly the first time the man has approached creating from an altruistic angle. Glasper says that his last proper release, 2022’s <i>Black Radio III</i>, was concocted in an effort to uplift some of his favorite voices, an undertaking that yielded collaborations with names like Q-Tip, Meshell Ndegeocello, Gregory Porter, Killer Mike, and Esperanza Spalding, artists who exist across the jazz, hip-hop, and R&B spaces he so regularly traverses between. “I wasn’t going to do a <i>Black Radio III</i>,” Glasper says of the beloved series in which previous installments have also played out like pitch-perfect Grammy-week jam sessions. “I didn’t feel like it was needed—and then I don’t want to become a broken record with this shit. But then when COVID hit, I felt like a musical first responder. I felt like I could really help people with that record—and it could help me. It’ll give me something to do and it’ll give other artists something to do.”\n\nTwo years out from that project, what the world needs now—according to Glasper—is peace, sweet peace, a mission that requires a particular kind of instrumental support. Here, that means cherished Glasper collaborators like drummer Kendrick Scott, bassist Burniss Travis, and guitarist Chris Sholar, players Glasper knew would bolster this album’s very particular energy. “The musicians are very, very important because they have to have that same flow and that same center,” he says. “The drummer that’s on here, he’s a water sign. Everything he plays is water. He feels like water. And that’s what I wanted for this. I wanted it to be liquid.”\n\nCoincidentally, esteemed singer and bassist Ndegeocello guests on a song called “Breathing Underwater,” one of the album’s few vocal moments. Otherwise, we’re hearing from Glasper directly, serving to further articulate why he needed to deliver <i>Let Go</i> in this moment. “Every year I make a record, I'm more of myself,” Glasper says. “I’m growing up, I’ve lived more life, I’m really telling my story. The way you find your sound is you write music—and anything you write, it’s going to be the only thing like that in the world.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1746851220","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-go/1746851220"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746851220/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4643652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4643652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717758457639}}},"1746939671":{"id":"1746939671","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746939671?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/broken-english-club/852389941","name":"Decade - EP","artistName":"Broken English Club","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/88/21/71/88217122-3a9e-195c-d854-2b61b47054dc/8718723258548.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"292929","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"393939","textColor1":"050505","bgColor":"b9b9b9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/decade-ep/1746939671","playParams":{"id":"1746939671","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746939671/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"852389941","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/852389941?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717736377578}}},"1746987972":{"id":"1746987972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ligrye/1746985963","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/4d/9c/664d9c2e-da58-70bc-02a4-5cee3fb899d5/506c699f-d895-4a7c-9ba9-a28afa20434e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"38172d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"401f35","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/ec/46/beec4643-e4a3-eb21-3f3c-af51393395cd/5bc9c93a-131b-4ec7-b6d3-53b086c29ae8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/b9/80/ceb98053-fbaf-6d70-ed52-4e589c97bdbd/524910a2-ef9f-4d9d-9202-c3385cc38458.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4f2f44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/51/00/0651006d-0f0a-067c-ec78-9771add01651/bc3967cc-b6ab-4f4c-82e0-ecd3901acf16.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b0/83/2d/b0832d2c-be4a-2a39-fbe9-bdf0613d06f2/9519d231-09b4-4c83-96ab-7de97d891110.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46243b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b2d40","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6fd0","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/a9/05/16a905ef-701f-d9aa-e176-cc28da1ac6ea/c74dab08-de76-4121-ac33-24cf44db7350.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47243c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false}},"name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ligrye","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/d3/66/4ad366d0-f4ff-a034-54d0-b57f7e12edd9/be24ea6d-1032-4e58-ae01-c401f04abc94.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"321629","textColor2":"242021","textColor4":"503144","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe71cf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Seoul-based DJ honors the city’s LGBTQ+ community and parties.","standard":"“I want to take people on a musical journey,” LIGRYE tells Apple Music about his exclusive Pride DJ mix. The South Africa-born, Seoul-based DJ carefully curated each step of the mix. “I took my time to build and tell a story—halfway through, you might have a moment where you say, ‘Okay, I see where this is going.’” LIGRYE curated the mix at home, in Seoul, and credits so much to the city. “South Korea is the first place where I actually celebrated Pride, in Seoul, and fully came out,” he says. “This place is extremely special to me.” It’s only fitting, then, that the mix directly represents the queer nightlife scene in Seoul—and queer music and community around the world. \n\nHighlighting one of his favorite moments on the mix, he draws attention to “Freak Like U” by Masarima. “It resonates on the personal level of growing up, being different, and not understanding why you’re different. And then getting to the point where you’re able to fully accept who you are and celebrate that. I never got to celebrate Pride in my home country, so Pride in Seoul is very, very important to me,” he says. “It started with something so tiny, in Hongdae, and has progressed to something so big—yet we still see a loud minority exhibiting hate. It gives you goosebumps to see queer people with their flags against those trying to prevent this joy. You just wonder, ‘Where’s the love?’ But we still fight. They try to change the location and we still show up. We still put on our brave faces and stand together.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1746987972","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746987972"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1746985963","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1746985963?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717751726807}}},"1747039538":{"id":"1747039538","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747039538?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/44/41/90/4441901f-5507-a07b-e2f5-63a8d437a5d5/d0aa787f-c752-4743-89b1-06225e272d97.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bb665c","textColor2":"e07664","textColor4":"b35f53","textColor1":"e97f6f","bgColor":"02020f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/72/f9/15/72f91552-64ef-061c-eb24-ba874bf6dd2a/ffe7bf76-f723-4b6d-b489-98a76748eaf6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d2d2d2","textColor2":"e2e2e2","textColor4":"bbbbbb","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/29/ff/8c/29ff8c8f-db1c-982a-d922-1088bf4363cd/8468747c-c2cb-4e82-ab86-5e037f7e5390.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cccbcc","textColor2":"c0bbc9","textColor4":"9d99a5","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"151115","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kaytranada/602382713","name":"TIMELESS","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"KAYTRANADA","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7c/67/dd/7c67dd0e-c3aa-9f6c-40b6-7e10b74a39ef/196871978699.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cecfd1","textColor2":"c9c6d7","textColor4":"a4a2b2","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"121321","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When KAYTRANADA left the 2021 Grammys with two awards (Best Dance/Electronic Album for 2019’s <i>BUBBA</i> and Best Dance Recording for “10%”), he made history as the first Black and first openly gay artist to win the former category. The industry recognition was long overdue for the producer, who had been building a devout following for nearly a decade. “In my mind I was finally a true artist,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. After relocating to Los Angeles, he channeled that confidence into making his third solo album, <i>TIMELESS</i>: “It felt more serious—more legit. I was still having fun making <i>TIMELESS</i>, but making <i>BUBBA</i> was another type of fun where I didn’t really take it seriously.”\n\nLike its predecessor, <i>TIMELESS</i> is a collection of club grooves for catching a vibe. It’s packed with guests who effortlessly acclimate to KAYTRANADA’s singular sound while imprinting their own touch. PinkPantheress’ saccharine voice is richer on the squiggly house beat of “Snap My Finger,” Ravyn Lenae offers breathy seductions on the hard-edged R&B of “Video,” and Thundercat delivers comical disses in soothing falsetto on the jazzy hip-hop of “Wasted Words.” Back-to-back tracks “Do 2 Me” (featuring Anderson .Paak and SiR) and “Witchy” (featuring Childish Gambino) hit an energy peak, their tales of late-night infatuation framed by sultry, body-enveloping production. \n\nIf <i>BUBBA</i> was about finding KAYTRANADA’s sound, <i>TIMELESS</i> expands it. The producer is in what he calls his “experimental bag,” and Channel Tres joins him in it on the incendiary “Drip Sweat.” Channel’s trademark baritone drifts in and out of disembodied Auto-Tune, dropping bars over punchy drums and breaks sampled from Lyn Collins’ “Think (About It).” “We were just making the funkiest thing, like how it would sound if we did new jack swing today,” KAYTRANADA says. “What is that Bobby Brown energy? We were trying to give it that.” He tries out AI sampling on the breezy instrumental “Seemingly.” He also sings on a track for the first time on the Weeknd-inspired “Stepped On,” creating his version of ’80s New Wave with strobing synths and a dark disposition.

I ensure clear and clean transitioning, but at the same time, the songs have conversations with each other.” The mix covers plenty of ground—and is designed to be the ideal soundtrack for a range of moments. “I hope this mix helps revive any spirit,” she says. “It’s for anyone who wants to have fun, anyone at home and trying to clean on Sundays, anyone who wants to start their Friday night. It's not too uptempo—it loosens the fit between EDM and electro-house versus amapiano; you’ll hear those drums every now and again.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1747318695","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1747318695"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747318695/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1205296907","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1205296907?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717751774356}}},"1747604920":{"id":"1747604920","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747604920?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"releaseDate":"2024-06-05","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fancy-hagood/859825960","name":"Smothered, Covered & Fried - EP","artistName":"Fancy Hagood","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e8/9b/66/e89b664d-d586-39cf-941c-3cb24fad67f0/1963622212086_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bab5bf","textColor2":"c5c7ce","textColor4":"a1a4ac","textColor1":"e5dde6","bgColor":"121724","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Fancy Hagood serves up tunes as tasty as a late-night plate at Waffle House on <i>Smothered, Covered & Fried</i>, a collaborative covers EP featuring some of the singer-songwriter’s queer musical friends. Hagood opens the project with a solo cover of Fleetwood Mac’s classic “Landslide,” pairing his soulful voice with simple keys that gradually give way to a lush acoustic arrangement. She Returns From War and Jaime Wyatt join Hagood on the Pistol Annies’ signature “Hell on Heels,” making a meal of the track’s three-part harmonies and leaning into its sassier one-liners.\n\nTJ Osborne brings his rich baritone to the Shania Twain favorite “From This Moment On,” with the pair nailing the over-the-top theatrics the track builds to at its crescendo. The Taylor Swift-penned Little Big Town hit “Better Man” gets an assist from The Kentucky Gentlemen, whose brotherly harmonies do the famed vocal group justice. And Brooke Eden locks into the wildly infectious melody of the Eli Young Band hit “Even If It Breaks Your Heart”—originally written and performed by Will Hoge—showing the chart-topping tune works just

I honor Georgina Beyer, the now-passed trans Māori icon—and the first trans member of parliament in the world. Kia au to moe (rest in peace).”\n\nListen out for her debut single “E Tu” on the mix. “For me as an Indigenous woman, there is nothing like playing music in queer spaces in my language, te reo Māori (the language),” she says. “I dedicate this Pride to all my queer and trans Indigenous whānau (family), tangata Māori (Māori people), tangata moana (people of the ocean), and tangata whenua (people of

the drag icon’s mix, inspired by NYC and its vibrant queer nightlife.","standard":"“I envision my Pride mix to be a source of euphoric energy,” Aquaria tells Apple Music. “I’ve crafted it using songs that uplift my spirits in one way or another, and give me no choice but to find the nearest dance floor and sweat it out in the name of life. The best Pride celebrations are where all members of our community feel free and celebrated, and I can imagine myself playing this mix at all sorts of steamy clubs across the city.” The city in question is New York City, of course—the drag icon took inspiration from the city itself while creating the mix: “I’ve been working on it from my home office in Brooklyn, overlooking the East River and Manhattan skyline. I’m always so inspired when I look out and reflect on my past 10 years living in this city and working in queer nightlife. I’m reminded of countless unforgettable moments, and I wanted to encapsulate the spontaneity and excitement of my experiences here.”\n\nOf all the tracks on Aquaria’s mix, Romy’s “Enjoy Your Life” is a particular standout. “To me, this represents one of those songs that you can put on at any time, and even if you’re feeling down, its message and energy will always be there to uplift you,” Aquaria says. “The track reminds you that despite the obstacles life can throw at you, sometimes the solution really does boil down to the simple old-fashioned advice to enjoy your life. I’m all for lyrics with lots of nuance and deeper hidden meaning, but sometimes you don’t need a convoluted metaphor to express pure joy through music. Romy does that so perfectly on this track, and the DJ HEARTSTRING remix pushes that BPM—and message—even harder.”\n"},"playParams":{"id":"1748666072","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748666072"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748666072/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1097091378","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1097091378?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752258407}}},"1748842240":{"id":"1748842240","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748842240?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/d6/89/83d689f1-de41-42c0-c795-21e41828b9b5/53d9446d-a493-43b7-a45f-846308f111b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"412d15","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c432f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fac964","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/8e/d4/068ed416-34b5-71c2-a161-4ed24892e39a/e3a5fbe3-0cc0-4fc4-9829-88a8b60f78eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"302816","textColor2":"252526","textColor4":"4e4431","textColor1":"000204","bgColor":"f4c060","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a2/db/00/a2db0025-816a-68db-66b7-c084d8b638d8/27eb4870-c36b-44e7-b629-d2caee7d3a13.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"392519","textColor2":"141414","textColor4":"3f2c20","textColor1":"0d0b0b","bgColor":"e98b51","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/61/be/9a/61be9a4a-e9e7-1156-5ba4-ef7e593ef496/981ee59e-3482-43ac-89ce-8caea5b79e49.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"332814","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"483e2b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f5c462","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-kaywise/555309125","name":"Africa Now: June 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"DJ Kaywise","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f0/20/bc/f020bc7a-696a-7b6a-113d-582adc9c2b32/d760af7f-9394-44f8-8863-8d3b4be45955.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"322814","textColor2":"212121","textColor4":"4d422e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fac864","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"Known for his eclectic mixtapes and passion for talent discovery, Nigerian DJ and producer Kaywise curates a who’s who of the continent’s biggest hitmakers for this Africa Now DJ mix.

rising to meet the sun? Often the artists helming Apple Music's exclusive Early Hours DJ mix series cater to both frames of mind. Such was the case for Berlin's D.Dan, who crafted this month’s downtempo journey with tracks he has “a personal relationship with.” “These songs have grown alongside me through moments and memories, and are selections I keep returning to,” he says. \n\nFor D.Dan, the key to a good downtempo mix is balance: “It shouldn’t ever feel like too much or too little for too long—you have to find the right mix and pacing between drifting ambient sections that don’t stretch out too much, and more traditionally structured songs that aren’t overstimulating or in your face.” He thinks about these qualities a lot, especially while he’s on the road. He chose the tracks included here from a personal playlist he keeps while he’s touring called “High Speed Calm Air.” The title was a way to capture those “candid moments after intense nights where everything feels like it’s moving so fast that, afterwards, I want to listen to music that’s recentering and grounding,” he says. “These songs help me process, integrate, and cherish these experiences and emotions—and put me in the right state of mind.” \n","short":"The Berlin techno heavyweight shares selections that ground and inspire him."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d5/85/48/d58548ef-e5a8-748a-8946-94b57e7db8ae/b43bc05f-19f7-4450-b73b-7ef02ef015c3.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"342730","textColor2":"472410","textColor4":"6c443d","textColor1":"010000","bgColor":"ffc4f0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/early-hours-dj-mix/1749198920","playParams":{"id":"1749198920","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749198920/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"548613499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/548613499?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717714053268}}},"1749333219":{"id":"1749333219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749333219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-06-06","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-game/261727947","name":"Time","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"The Game","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8a/60/c9/8a60c9c2-8b0c-5516-7217-79ffd722f9e1/797885197627_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"392b2a","textColor2":"3b3129","textColor4":"59514b","textColor1":"130100","bgColor":"d2d2d2","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1749333219","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/time/1749333219","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6kaR3V58Zeg0kBOMFQjAmx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749333219/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"261727947","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/261727947?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717755616218}}},"1749643730":{"id":"1749643730","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749643730?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-06-06","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4d/2a/49/4d2a4989-3b62-b6da-bd93-3eb56118baf9/1e84ba08-a06e-48e2-b266-76ab36cd5a41.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d0cecd","textColor2":"dbd7d7","textColor4":"bbb8b7","textColor1":"f6f2f1","bgColor":"3c3c3a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=448916501-1481245915","name":"1 OF 1","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Maluma & Blessd","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Ever since Maluma co-signed him in 2021 by way of the “IMPOSIBLE” remix, Blessd has remained a formidable presence in Latin music.

Little did fans know back then that the Medellín-bred pair had this collaborative EP in store, a concise yet undeniably effective demonstration of their respective and collective powers. \n\nThe opening title track lays out the project’s ethos with clarity, their mutual admiration evident amid the rich production. “Call Me” exudes summery vibes as the two singers trade off with their signature vocal styles, while “Oe Bebé” keeps that same energy albeit in a more laidback reggaetón form. Things occasionally get rugged, namely on “Sisas Nada” with Hades66, though the Rudeboyz-helmed split “Goyard/GTA” returns to relative sleekness with booming trap bass and unapologetically explicit lyricism.","short":"The Medellín natives live up to their high collaborative expectations."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8b/20/c5/8b20c5d0-e18d-77ee-6465-1d68c34dbdab/196872172669.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"23272a","textColor2":"392319","textColor4":"50433e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b0c4d6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/1-of-1/1749643730","playParams":{"id":"1749643730","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6nrflCSqW4aAy4ZZ1PGp7I"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749643730/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"448916501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/448916501?l=en-US"},{"id":"1481245915","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1481245915?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717763342361}}},"1750044689":{"id":"1750044689","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750044689?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/saleka/1529634494","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Release (Original Music From The Motion Picture TRAP) - Single","artistName":"Saleka","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3c/19/7b/3c197b94-45bc-1f36-79cb-1211dbe7d6d6/196872154917.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e6d6d7","textColor2":"cbcfda","textColor4":"bdb0ba","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"85363b","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1750044689","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/release-original-music-from-the-motion-picture-trap-single/1750044689"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750044689/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1529634494","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1529634494?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717736866047}}},"1750361972":{"id":"1750361972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750361972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-06-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/62/63/a0/6263a09e-43fb-6192-0218-6a2af12134eb/82b3c1f6-a631-42de-93b0-e9994788845e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c39a7d","textColor2":"f5aa79","textColor4":"c58a62","textColor1":"f3be9a","bgColor":"060a07","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0a/8b/5e/0a8b5e06-7e95-bdcc-eba1-b87c452735d6/a76059dc-fa27-48b3-9d69-764b22e23231.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"ef875d","textColor4":"c36f4e","textColor1":"efefef","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tems/1413909060","name":"Born in the Wild","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tems","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Almost six years after releasing her breakout single, 2018’s “Mr Rebel,” Nigerian superstar Tems delivers her debut LP, <i>Born in the Wild</i>. Of course, that interim has been characterized by a trajectory that’s trended upward at almost every turn. From her acclaimed 2020 debut EP <i>For Broken Ears</i> to global megahit collaborations with Wizkid (and later Justin Bieber) on “Essence” and Drake on “Fountains” to 2021’s sophomore EP, <i>If Orange Was a Place</i>, to appearances on 2022’s <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i> soundtrack (including songwriting credits for Rihanna’s “Lift Me Up”) and Beyoncé’s <i>RENAISSANCE</i> and a Grammy win for Future and Drake’s “Wait for U” in 2023—the alté-R&B star has experienced an almost exponential rise. \n\nThat kind of journey is part of what makes <i>Born in the Wild</i> all the more captivating. Over 18 tracks, Tems cracks open her journal through those career highs, and reveals how the person behind them grappled with it all. “I had to step back a bit, to check in with myself,” Tems (Temilade Openiyi) tells Apple Music, “and also just find healing from all the trauma and everything I experienced before ‘Tems.’ I think I had to unlearn a lot of things. This album is just a new way of me expressing myself, while still centering who I am in it.” Here, she works through moments of feeling like an impostor, of rebuilding her self-confidence, of learning the ins and outs of relationships, and of learning to trust herself. Don’t read that as insecure, however—this is the journal of someone who’s done the work, and who’s fully ready to embrace the next chapter.\n\nIt’s all brought to life through Tems’ usual brand of honest, mature storytelling—and here, as ever, the centerpiece remains a distinctive voice that simultaneously balances multiple layers of raw, delicate emotion and a natural, unforced ease. That reflective songwriting shows a sonic maturity that’s unrestricted by genre: She traverses from R&B (“Burning”) to fusions of Afrobeats and amapiano (“Get It Right”), balanced with celebrations of culture and heritage, like her reimagined version of Seyi Sodimu’s 1997 hit, the breezy “Love Me JeJe.” Below, Tems talks through these and more key tracks from <i>Born in the Wild</i>.\n\n<b>“Born in the Wild”</b>\n“‘Born in the Wild’ is a story of transformation from a cocoon to a butterfly. It speaks on surviving a mental wilderness that comes with life, and coming to a place where one can thrive. It's about accepting oneself, and embodying the woman I was born to be. It shows the different dimensions of who Tems is, and her journey from a cub to a lioness.”\n\n<b>“Burning”</b>\n“‘Burning’ is about the feelings I felt when I first started getting popular as Tems. I didn't really understand what was happening, and everything was happening so fast. And it's about me looking back on that time and realizing that we are all going through something. We all have our internal battles. We all have the things that we struggle with, our triggers. And ‘Burning’ is really about understanding that I have my triggers too, and now I know that I'm not alone. And there's many people that have felt the way I do about not wanting to be seen, not really being used to attention, and people trying to take advantage of you in many different ways.”\n\n<b>“Love Me JeJe”</b>\n“‘Love Me JeJe’ is a sweet, happy song about finding unconditional love. The joy of finding a love that doesn't run out and not settling for anything else. Just basking in the sun, basking in that unconditional type of love.”\n\n<b>“Get It Right” (feat. Asake)</b>\n“This is just about a conversation between two people and one is saying, ‘I know you're scared, but if you do me right, I always got your back, because that's who I am.’ And it's just about two people feeling each other and wanting to explore more.”\n\n<b>“Unfortunate”</b>\n“‘Unfortunate’ is about realizing that the person that you put your trust in isn't worth your time. And also being thankful that the person showed themselves early, and the person disappointed you. And it's basically finding the good in the bad. This was a disappointment, but it is actually great that it was, because it means that I'm winning, and I'm going to overcome this, and I don't need to be with you anymore. It is a blessing that I'm not obligated by any means to stay with you, and it's a blessing that I'm not with you.”\n\n<b>“Forever”</b>\n“Forever is about the aftermath of a breakup, when the guy comes circling back, and it's coming from a place of healing, it's coming from a place of ‘I’ve moved on already, but it's interesting to see you scramble because I'm moving on. It's the desperation for me from you. I love that you are so desperate to get me back you're always checking for me, stalking me, checking for what I'm doing, and it's really intriguing and fascinating to see.’”\n\n<b>“Free Fall” (feat. J. Cole)</b>\n“This is about, after you fell in love with someone, they fell in love too. It was great until you realize that you both were new to it, and they didn't really know what to do in the relationship. It's about knowing, ‘If I stay, I'm going to be drained,’ and knowing your limits and setting your boundaries. It's basically reflecting on all of that. Reflecting on the fact that I had to go, because if I didn't go, it would have been detrimental.”\n\n<b>“Me & U”</b>\n“‘Me & U’ is about reconnecting with God. It's a new conversation. It's about reconnecting with your inner child and the truth. It's about now being honest with yourself about who you are, and about having faith that everything is going to be okay, as long as you believe.”\n\n<b>“You in My Face”</b>\n“‘You in My Face’ is a conversation with the inner me, the inner child, and it's about finding peace within, and also hoping that I don't get lost again.”","short":"Tems’ debut LP is here: “I’m embodying the woman I was born to be.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/11/d4/91/11d4914d-4d97-91e8-e9db-690e0951f11c/196871994477.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcdcb","textColor2":"e88243","textColor4":"bb6937","textColor1":"fefefc","bgColor":"080705","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/born-in-the-wild/1750361972","playParams":{"id":"1750361972","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1FGGv0vvSTerGQ91Mkvf9p"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750361972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1413909060","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1413909060?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717765740717}}},"1750593666":{"id":"1750593666","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750593666?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hunxho/1266800437","name":"Before The Album","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Hunxho","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"If there’s one thing you can rely on with Hunxho, it’s the consistency with which he feeds the streets.
