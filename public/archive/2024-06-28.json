The Brazilian and sambalike rhythms of “Telescope” lay the foundation for a journey into space, the song inspired by photographs from the Hubble telescope on each band member’s birthday.\n\n“Cinnamon Temple,” a schizophrenic, head-bending mélange of noise, funk, and jazz that’s been in the band’s live set since 2015, takes its title from the mud-brick mosques in Mali, which look like they have cinnamon stuck in them, while “Make Friends” riffs on deep platonic love, with its one verse repeated three times, each from a different gender perspective. Acclaimed Brazilian producer Mario Caldato Jr. (Beastie Boys, Björk, Beck) proves himself a willing accomplice, harnessing the band’s devil-may-care, genre-bending approach to arrive at a record that is equal parts engrossing, befuddling, and intoxicating, but never, ever dull.","short":"The quartet’s looser, more spontaneous fourth

Hisaishi in Vienna: Symphony No. 2 & Viola Saga","artistName":"Joe Hisaishi & Vienna Symphony","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since the mid 1980s, Joe Hisaishi’s soundtracks have breathed life into the fantastical, animated worlds of Studio Ghibli. Here, however, away from the narrative and graphic demands of cinema, Hisaishi is able to express himself more freely as a composer in his own right. In these live performances from Vienna’s Musikverein, Hisaishi fans will recognize the large-scale scoring, hints of traditional Japanese music, and melodic inspiration—but there’s a lot more to discover, too.\n\nSymphony No. 2, a three-movement work conceived and written during the pandemic, bubbles with an abundance of influences. In the opening two movements, the music has the sweeping optimism of 20th-century American symphonic music (think Aaron Copland or early Bernstein) tempered with the rhythmic insistence of John Adams’ large-scale minimalism. The final “Nursery Rhyme”, based on an ancient Japanese folk tune, sparkles with rhythmic and melodic vitality, settling in its final few minutes into a pared-back, crystalline beauty reminiscent of Arvo Pärt or Henryk Górecki.\n\n<i>Viola Saga</i>, written for and performed here by violist Antoine Tamestit, is an intensely expressive work. There’s a playful, driving energy to the opening movement—the sort that suffuses the best of Hisaishi’s Ghibli scores. And the beautiful, rippling second movement takes Bach as its inspiration in the twisting, turning harmonic directions of the arpeggiated solo part, and the pulsating underlying orchestral

Album and Interview","standard":"The follow-up to Headie One’s chart-topping 2020 debut, <i>EDNA</i>, finds the Tottenham MC in a state of gratitude. <i>The Last One</i> draws up hard-hitting home truths, clear-eyed reflections, and flashy verses on success, failure, and the thin lines that separate them. “I could approach it any way I want, to be honest—it all depends on my frame of mind,” he tells Apple Music’s Dotty about surveying the pains of his past. “Naturally, as I’m growing up and maturing, I do change my view on things, so I had to see what I was doing from the outside, analyze it properly, and see what I needed to progress and take steps forward.” To that effect, Headie frequently flashes to key crossroads. Opener “I Could Rap,” credits inspiration from fellow inmates (while serving a sentence in Scotland at HMP & YOI Polmont) for his unlikely conversion from prison ID number A6436CK to UK drill kingpin. “I wouldn’t say that I use it as fuel,” Headie says. “But I don’t think the world’s against me now either, so it’s just important that I keep doing what I’m doing.”\n\nThe album’s immersive opening chapter throws up a string of tricky predicaments, including crashing at the house of an addict on “Martin’s Sofa,” touring the UK in custody on “I Still Know Better,” and having the law hamper his early career on “Form 696.” Later, he basks in the warm glow of success on collabs with Aitch, D-Block Europe, and a trio of club steppers that draws in acts from Nigeria, but it’s these bold, feature-less tracks—tackling homelessness, inequality, and government tyranny—that wonderfully illustrate how one of life’s winners almost fell through the cracks. Though its title suggests a pump-faked retirement threat, <i>The Last One</i> is best described as a testimony to the rapper’s ability to survive and thrive through the toughest of trials. “I’m letting go of a lot of things,” Headie explains. “I’m speaking on them, and deciding to wash my hands of it and move forward. I actually accept what is now and what was then.”","short":"The OFB star on his clear-eyed story of survival: “I’m letting go.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-one/1740778963","playParams":{"id":"1740778963","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/26PpclJsqvQlP50d5XcLWp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740778963/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1235623728","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1235623728?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719558121188}}},"1740852209":{"id":"1740852209","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740852209?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/7b/50/ce7b5083-23d4-2be0-38a4-8cf0d9281721/Joba2b74911-b0ef-4928-b661-93dcb61e52f5-168026982-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_326846913_1768332320-Time1715721864003.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c4cbcf"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b5babc","textColor2":"c4cbcf","textColor4":"a2a8ac","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c9/14/78/c9147841-2b3c-ff34-5186-6c997853d26a/eef526b2-ea58-46ed-8b34-3bc87ff52031.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c5","textColor2":"d1d1d1","textColor4":"ababab","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/fb/75/10/fb7510d9-55d2-6d3f-f148-9f3b6730a5ec/Jobf929a98b-0e38-4970-b12d-0b0b0220053f-168418543-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327587200_1775380150-Time1716241884945.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d3d4d4","textColor2":"c6cdcf","textColor4":"a6acae","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"27292b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/10/78/88/10788803-da1b-7ced-78b2-ac16dc8a9c9a/65c9b93a-edad-496d-85af-3b88807cb828.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cccdce","textColor2":"dbdbdc","textColor4":"bababb","textColor1":"f2f4f4","bgColor":"343536","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/74/08/5d740837-992b-f68a-35ee-43b15b4cdb9c/78ee28f7-720c-4490-991d-a28c7d340e93.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bac1c3","textColor2":"d1d2d2","textColor4":"aaabab","textColor1":"e5edf0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/johnny-cash/70936","name":"Songwriter","artistName":"Johnny Cash","artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/36/d8/ff/36d8ff7d-d0c0-18ef-56f4-ffab18288747/24UMGIM38883.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"d2d2d3","textColor2":"e3e5e4","textColor4":"bcbebe","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"222325","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"<i>Songwriter</i> takes a set of demos Johnny Cash recorded in early 1993 and builds them out with posthumous recordings from a full band. Casual fans may find this a weird proposition, but those versed in Cash will recognize ’93 as the year preceeding the career-changing <i>American Recordings</i> and hence a kind of tremor before the quake. With the exception of “Drive On” and “Like a Soldier,” both of which showed up on <i>American Recordings</i>, and 1962’s “Sing It Pretty Sue,” these songs are new to us. Several are great: the cosmic “Hello Out There,” the gritty “Drive On,” the quaintly noble “Have You Ever Been to Little Rock?” and, best of all, “Well Alright,” in which a man meets a woman in a laundromat on a “dangerous, beautiful night” and, having helped her with her load (“she was washin’ extra hot”), begins a life with her.

The album is playful at times but intense during others, building from the act’s signature pop-rock style to incorporate more elements of rap and electro than ever before. On <i>LOOM</i>, they also reckon with their own legacy, noting how the project simultaneously marks the end of one era and the beginning of something new.\n\nOn “Take Me to the Beach,” Reynolds infuses his signature melodic delivery with a hopping pace, giving the song a gleeful edge even as he digs into hot-button issues like the surveillance state that surrounds us. The chorus extols the virtues of a warm, relaxing day on a sandy hideaway, but Reynolds uses the refrain as an opportunity to dig at his personality: “You take the snow/It’s way too cold/My heart is cold enough,” he sings. It’s funny, but the vocalist grimaces as he chuckles.","short":"At turns playful and intense, and a reckoning with their legacy."},"playParams":{"id":"1741841621","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loom/1741841621","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7EPrkhjTBrwAV8yAKCmY0Y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1741841621/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"358714030","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/358714030?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719565420239}}},"1742012449":{"id":"1742012449","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1742012449?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/72/95/b2/7295b2f6-e829-ecd7-9947-ccffff9edd2d/406cca18-a9f1-42c8-ac9d-6649402a226d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0a98d","textColor2":"c7c7a7","textColor4":"aea789","textColor1":"dec8ac","bgColor":"4a2b11","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3b/8f/49/3b8f4915-d962-616d-b4d7-31f308ef82a0/feab2f47-0683-459b-927d-db463cd739fd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d1c8","textColor2":"dce4f6","textColor4":"bfc7d6","textColor1":"f6f1e5","bgColor":"485254","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lupe-fiasco/2851441","name":"Samurai","artistName":"Lupe Fiasco","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c4/f4/bc/c4f4bce2-9c54-fc8b-47a6-3f450c457a65/198391855535.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2ccd2","textColor2":"ded7c3","textColor4":"c1beb6","textColor1":"f3e9e7","bgColor":"4d5981","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Across his varied, genre-pushing discography, Chicago spitter Lupe Fiasco has kept one thing consistent: He remains one of the best bar-for-bar rappers in the game. His ninth album is a milestone in many ways, although it continues his trend as one of hip-hop’s strongest lyricists: The entire project was produced by Soundtrakk, making it their second full-album collaboration, following 2022's <i>DRILL MUSIC IN ZION</i>, and it’s the first album that Lupe and Soundtrakk worked on with their longtime manager Charley \"Chill\" Patton since 2007's <i>The Cool</i>.\n\nConsidering it’s a family reunion of sorts, Lupe and his go-to producer wanted to make the album as personal as possible, weaving narratives with anecdotes unique to the Windy City wonder. On the throwback “Mumble Rap,” Fiasco tells the story of a woman entranced by a mysterious sound before realizing its danger, which Lupe highlights by mumbling his way through the chorus. It’s conceptually daring commentary on the industry Lupe has made his name in, while still reflecting his singular POV. In that way, too, <i>Samurai</i> is more of the thrilling same from rap’s poet laureate.","short":"His ninth album continues his streak as one of rap’s strongest

Album and Interview","standard":"“Gqom started as a sound for taxis, actually,” South African sonic pioneer DJ Lag tells Apple Music. “It was being played in taxis. And even now, if you go to taxi ranks, you’ll hear all the taxis are playing gqom sounds. In South Africa, the taxis have their own culture; they have big sound systems. [As a driver] if you have the big sound system, you’re going to get more customers. And that was another way we used to push our music.”\n\nLike the minibus taxi system that helped gqom artists get their sound out there, DJ Lag remains a driving force behind the growth of the scene, and with his 2024 album <i>THE REBELLION</i>, he presents the next chapter of the drum-heavy sound’s evolution. “I think if I stop [producing gqom], a lot of people will just stop,” Lag explains. “It’s my responsibility to keep pushing stuff. The style I’m trying now is gqom mixed with amapiano. And I just had to call it <i>THE REBELLION</i>. It’s slow like ’piano, but the beats—you can hear it’s gqom. I like experimenting a lot, and I think that’s how most of the producers are moving right now in Durban. It’s a mix of Afro-tech, but you can still hear the bass and the darkness of the song—so you can hear it’s two different sounds. On the album, we have three-step, we have proper gqom—like the old style—we have gqom with hip-hop, and we also have gqom mixed with amapiano.” Below, he talks through key tracks from the album.\n\n<b>“Iza Ngamandla” (with Sykes & Vanco)</b>\n“It’s a mixture of two genres. It’s three-step, but it changes and becomes darker in the middle, and then it goes back to Afro-tech-ish. And Sykes is really good with the vocals. I made it number one because it’s chilled, but it’s talking about how hot the album is. When they say ‘Iza Ngamandla,’ they’re saying, ‘This album is coming with force.’”\n\n<b>“Hade Boss” (feat. K.C Driller) (with Mr Nation Thingz)</b>\n“I started producing that style around 2021, trying to link gqom with ’piano, but I don’t think I was really good at it. In 2023, that’s when I started perfecting the sound. We sent three beats that are made with K.C Driller to unleash things, and one of them was the one he used for ‘Hade Boss.’ I thought he was going to release that song, but he was like, ‘No, you release it.’ I was like, 'OK, cool—but I don’t know when.’ Then he started doing this challenge on TikTok and the song started growing. We just uploaded a small clip of the song, and some guy who was a dancer started dancing using the song. Then everybody started doing it. It was crazy. So that’s why I wanted to release more music which is on that style. Another song called ‘Bamba’ is the same style but with no vocals, just a beat.” \n\n<b>“Trouble” (feat. Novaboy)</b>\n“That’s the new wave. That’s the new wave that these new guys are making in Durban. Novaboy is one of the new good producers from Clermont, where I come from.”\n\n<b>“Yebo” (feat. Thobeka)</b>\n“I made the beat around December [2023], and it’s one of the songs I’ve been playing in all my gigs. The vocals, the first part, the deep voice, it’s K.C Driller. What is he saying is something that we always shout in the club. It’s something everybody just likes to shout in the club, and we just created a song out of it. I used to always use that thing on the mic when I’m DJing and the crowd would say [it] back. So now I’m playing the actual song, everybody’s going crazy when I’m playing it. It’s nice to bring that live element into a song.”\n\n<b>“Oke Oke” (with Jazz Alonso)</b>\n“I was on tour, and I was working with different producers. That’s when I went to [producer] GG’s studio. Then Jazz came along, and one of the beats that we made that day she jumps on. It’s about love.”\n\n<b>“Kwenzakalan” (feat. BIxckie, Leodaleo & Dezzodigo)</b>\n“This is the second song that I tried mixing gqom with trap. Dezzo is another producer, and Leodaleo is an MC—so it was Blxckie and Leo on the vocals. And Blxckie is one of the biggest hip-hop artists here in South Africa. He’s amazing. Blxckie is crazy, man. He is crazy. He wrote that verse, he just listened to the beat for two minutes, and then he was like, ‘Yeah, record.’ And he was like, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, fast. Every time [I’m in the studio with another artist], I know they’re doing a different sound, but I always try to put my sound with their sound, trying to fit in. Because I really love hip-hop, but I don’t want to do proper hip-hop. I want to mix it with my style.”\n\n<b>“Yeyeyeyeye” (feat. Sane & Charlie Magandi)</b>\n“We did that song and we were coming from a club. I just decided, ‘You know what, let’s just go to the studio.’ I made the beat. While I was making the beat, my friends behind me, they were like doing those chants, ‘Ye ye ye ye ye ye.’ We just decided, ‘You know what, let’s just put this thing on the beat.’ And yeah, we just left it like that, because there’s no verse on that song, there’s nothing. It’s just the chants and the beat. Sane’s not singing—she’s just saying that boys are dogs. I’ve seen people pointing at each other when I’m playing that song. This one causes trouble.”\n\n<b>“Umlilo” (feat. Holy Alpha & Kay Faith) (with YoungstaCPT & Dee Koala)</b>\n“This one is gqom trap. All the artists who are on that song are from Cape Town. I was doing a show when I was there and I just brought everyone to the studio. They have their own style in Cape Town, their own gqom style. These new guys who are rapping on gqom, their beats are also insane and different. Everybody has his own taste, every province has their own style. Even in East London, they have their own style. I know all of the producers, actually. We share music.”\n\n<b>“Hade Boss (Re-Up)” (feat.

Despite the album’s rather downcast outlook, Apollo continues to populate his songs with candy-sweet melodies and inventive textures that separate him from pop’s mainstream pack.\n\nTake “Spite,” which gallops along with pulsing tom drums and a whimsical synth hook that Apollo engages with in a call-and-response format. Is it worse to feel love in a diminished form or spend the night alone? The Indiana-born songwriter relishes these moments of pain, because they often yield his best writing. He tells Apple Music, “It was a dark time in my life, but usually when I’m in that zone of uncomfort, I get a lot done. I learn a lot about myself, the introspective thoughts start to surface, and I’m able to write how I’m feeling.”\n\nDespite this, Apollo ultimately sees the album as a testament to his self-improvement and growth as an artist and person. “I had to be the best version of myself…rewiring my brain to think in that way, somebody who deserves all this,” he says. “I have this, I can do this. This is different.”","short":"A rising pop star treats good times with a wary eye on his second album."},"playParams":{"id":"1745056462","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/god-said-no/1745056462","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0bIXnppwOEeFqEUV0vqJJn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745056462/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1258165134","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1258165134?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719583688757}}},"1745183700":{"id":"1745183700","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745183700?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/93/90/5c/93905cde-1e25-cfd2-7b95-190dd6c9bf34/Job1bc18a5a-fb1b-4230-b4e6-3a5c0329b852-167747233-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_326295505_1764374225-Time1715302938682.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cdb49e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5f643f"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"ac9b98","textColor2":"cdb49e","textColor4":"a89584","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5f643f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/87/4d/6f/874d6fa2-a5bf-0843-926a-85dac00f8f34/Job1d45b3f2-5541-4da6-9a83-600ff36e1bf6-167747234-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_326295504_1764374224-Time1715313014595.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"9ea46d","textColor2":"d4bbb3","textColor4":"ad9a95","textColor1":"c2c881","bgColor":"11171e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/towa-bird/1517035946","name":"American Hero","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Towa Bird","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cd/33/ba/cd33ba4b-e1ae-884d-2fa9-1c5c3927ad28/24UMGIM51863.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ac9f97","textColor2":"d39a83","textColor4":"ad806f","textColor1":"d2c0b6","bgColor":"13181c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-hero/1745183700","playParams":{"id":"1745183700","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21HMENCxfw31djGv60lk88"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745183700/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1517035946","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1517035946?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719566195115}}},"1745257770":{"id":"1745257770","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745257770?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/camila-cabello/935727853","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/07/bd/31/07bd319c-e95e-9a50-9f01-d66f8d126507/Joba226c2a2-fa74-44ee-9462-5bbd9087e94d-168725896-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_328185872_1781469685-Time1716587124631.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d8aa8c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"312c26"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b8a590","textColor2":"d8aa8c","textColor4":"b48f73","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"312c26","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0b/1b/c1/0b1bc18f-a374-e62a-f027-f06c9978297d/87444314-4307-4786-8e18-57632da5c4c8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7794b6","textColor2":"84aad2","textColor4":"6b89a8","textColor1":"93b9e3","bgColor":"060300","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/68/e4/4a/68e44aad-e2a3-da6d-243e-432189cd3c15/Job95488d26-0f82-423b-b972-c30ef3851056-168725897-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_328185871_1781469684-Time1716589230284.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","88bbdb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"312c26"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"ac9a84","textColor2":"88bbdb","textColor4":"729bb4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"312c26","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cc/65/b5/cc65b51d-122d-dad2-a6d3-f1441c41f228/055bcca8-800a-4a16-882a-445e32e2c49b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a19d8b","textColor2":"e1b398","textColor4":"b7927c","textColor1":"c6c1aa","bgColor":"0d0d0d","hasP3":false}},"name":"C,XOXO","artistName":"Camila Cabello","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/87/46/e3/8746e363-cc23-75dd-3fbc-32244777cdae/24UMGIM39247.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d8dfe0","textColor2":"e1d4dd","textColor4":"c1bdc5","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"416466","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The first sign that a new era had arrived was Camila Cabello’s platinum blonde locks. Then came “I LUV IT,” the shake-up of a lead single for the Miami native’s fourth studio album—loud, brash, and diamond-hard, with a hook that interpolates a 2009 Gucci Mane classic (“Lemonade”) and an expressionistic verse from Playboi Carti. Speaking to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, the 27-year-old singer emphasizes <i>C,XOXO</i>’s most crucial evolution: For the first time in her career, the songwriting feels like her own. “Letting go of the safety net of other co-writers in the room allowed for there to be more space for me to hear my own voice,” she tells Lowe. “When you are younger, you feel like you are looking for other people to point out the way a little bit more, and that voice inside you, you’re listening to, but you don’t totally trust. I think as I’ve gotten older, I’m like, you know what? I’m just going to listen to myself. I’m comfortable being, like, it’s on me today, and whether it fails or succeeds, I can trust myself to do it.”\n\nCall it a vibe shift or a reintroduction or, as Cabello cheekily called <i>C,XOXO</i>, her “hyper-femme villain arc,” with dreamy production from Spain’s El Guincho. There are odes to her tropical hometown, as she recruits City Girls to twerk out the sunroof on Collins Avenue for “Dade County Dreaming.” She’s covered in glitter and dressed for revenge on “pretty when i cry” and tempting an ex on the scorching “HOT UPTOWN,” which features Drake in peak <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i> form. Things get deeper on moody, wispy tracks like “June Gloom” and “Twentysomethings,” downcast odes to messy, complicated relationships: “Twentysomethings, gotta have a sense of humor/When it comes to us/Don’t know what the fuck I’m doing,” she coos on the latter.\n\nBut it’s the gorgeous and strange “Chanel No.5” that best represents Cabello as a songwriter. It’s an ethereal experiment she describes as having “pop melodies, but with rap structure,” with twinkly piano and lyrical nods to Haruki Murakami and Quentin Tarantino, spritzes of perfume, and chipped nail polish. “It is the thesis statement for the album,” she tells Lowe. “I was like, this is literally the voice of <i>C,XOXO</i>. It’s playful. She’s in control. She’s putting on her lip gloss. She’s toying with this guy. She’s magical. She’s sensitive.”\n","short":"Call it a vibe shift or a reintroduction—the Miami native’s fourth album is here."},"playParams":{"id":"1745257770","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/c-xoxo/1745257770","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/004ywPlW72Hgn1Bo9PlNOr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745257770/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"935727853","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/935727853?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719580208346}}},"1745709913":{"id":"1745709913","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745709913?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-exies/1365197","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Closure - EP","artistName":"The Exies","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/65/e6/d7/65e6d7e4-02d5-d5e6-9f6f-e70034d03571/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca7861","textColor2":"e8896d","textColor4":"ba6e57","textColor1":"fc9679","bgColor":"010100","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1745709913","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/closure-ep/1745709913","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0ar3RsCe3FgwwXBvtdGwWc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745709913/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1365197","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1365197?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719548246405}}},"1746209476":{"id":"1746209476","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746209476?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/badsista/1076110776","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/04/49/a8044968-f6d0-ec03-069d-0d8e1b95cadc/ad75aa04-c39c-4c51-8bfb-be50fabc3b8a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"3f1e34","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b2c40","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ca/35/7b/ca357bc9-5d87-7cac-6c63-a348a1eaf834/f9f3f9c2-f333-4855-b4ac-103cf99c2d2c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ec/46/b5/ec46b56f-45b2-f10d-f686-4ceeda7bf860/3997e2ef-6fb1-4e62-be17-fb2db35c169d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"562a48","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/82/01/eb82018b-d470-e282-7558-97d6a6f19b62/18b24720-4107-4d62-82c3-2e3b14d30f17.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/09/90/64/09906447-8237-0855-c34f-e552782ea13f/b54a73a7-5a85-4d11-839b-18b538cb2f3c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46233b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5a2b4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6acf","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e8/66/f2/e866f246-7f7c-1d10-afcf-eb01c3d79f35/1f45e996-a35c-45ef-ae93-82c3ef28313d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47243c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false}},"name":"​Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"BADSISTA","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/19/23/3f/19233f03-2820-aaea-a791-2ca0a3659c2d/3ded9568-8c17-4aa8-a8a4-630e408f57f6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"321729","textColor2":"1a1716","textColor4":"48293b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe72ce","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Brazilian DJ’s mix is all about love, connection, and celebration.","standard":"“This mix is to feel sexy and love yourself, to connect and cheer with the people around you,” Brazil’s BADSISTA tells Apple Music about their Pride DJ mix.

“joyful riot” of a mix inspired by—and in honor of—queer history.","standard":"“Pride is not just confetti and rainbows,” The Blessed Madonna tells Apple Music. “It's supposed to be so much more. Pride starts as a riot. I want this to feel like a joyful riot.” The US-born, UK-based DJ and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion has crafted a Pride DJ mix that looks to history for inspiration.\n\n“If you can listen to the medley from Sylvester's live album <i>Living Proof</i> and not cry, then I don't know what's wrong with you,” she says, paying tribute to the queer trailblazer’s 1979 album and citing it as the starting point for her mix. “It's a record that for me has so much built into it. I wanted it all to be a part of this. There’s victory, but also sadness and loss. I can't listen to it without thinking about what would come next, which was the total decimation of a whole generation of queer elders,” she says.\n\n“I hope this mix conveys that I’m so proud to be the child of those elders—the spiritual and literal child of queer people who lived through a time that is so different to my own. My own grandmother was a lesbian, and my family is full of gay people. What they went through, and lived through, and who they lost, all of that is built into this.” Her mix has been curated in honor of the “untold queers that we lost before I came of age,” she says, “that we continue to lose when we don't stick up for kids who are learning who they are, and losing their lives for who they are. This is for them.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746812792","playParams":{"id":"1746812792","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746812792/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1524829861","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1524829861?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752351856}}},"1746987972":{"id":"1746987972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/66/4d/9c/664d9c2e-da58-70bc-02a4-5cee3fb899d5/506c699f-d895-4a7c-9ba9-a28afa20434e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"38172d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"401f35","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f361c5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/ec/46/beec4643-e4a3-eb21-3f3c-af51393395cd/5bc9c93a-131b-4ec7-b6d3-53b086c29ae8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5b2a4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/b9/80/ceb98053-fbaf-6d70-ed52-4e589c97bdbd/524910a2-ef9f-4d9d-9202-c3385cc38458.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"422338","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4f2f44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6bce","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/51/00/0651006d-0f0a-067c-ec78-9771add01651/bc3967cc-b6ab-4f4c-82e0-ecd3901acf16.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"432138","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c233f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f964cb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b0/83/2d/b0832d2c-be4a-2a39-fbe9-bdf0613d06f2/9519d231-09b4-4c83-96ab-7de97d891110.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"46243b","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4b2d40","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6fd0","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/a9/05/16a905ef-701f-d9aa-e176-cc28da1ac6ea/c74dab08-de76-4121-ac33-24cf44db7350.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"422238","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"47243c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fa6ccf","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ligrye/1746985963","name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ligrye","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/d3/66/4ad366d0-f4ff-a034-54d0-b57f7e12edd9/be24ea6d-1032-4e58-ae01-c401f04abc94.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"321629","textColor2":"242021","textColor4":"503144","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe71cf","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Seoul-based DJ honors the city’s LGBTQ+ community and parties.","standard":"“I want to take people on a musical journey,” LIGRYE tells Apple Music about his exclusive Pride DJ mix. The South Africa-born, Seoul-based DJ carefully curated each step of the mix. “I took my time to build and tell a story—halfway through, you might have a moment where you say, ‘Okay, I see where this is going.’” LIGRYE curated the mix at home, in Seoul, and credits so much to the city. “South Korea is the first place where I actually celebrated Pride, in Seoul, and fully came out,” he says. “This place is extremely special to me.” It’s only fitting, then, that the mix directly represents the queer nightlife scene in Seoul—and queer music and community around the world. \n\nHighlighting one of his favorite moments on the mix, he draws attention to “Freak Like U” by Masarima. “It resonates on the personal level of growing up, being different, and not understanding why you’re different. And then getting to the point where you’re able to fully accept who you are and celebrate that. I never got to celebrate Pride in my home country, so Pride in Seoul is very, very important to me,” he says. “It started with something so tiny, in Hongdae, and has progressed to something so big—yet we still see a loud minority exhibiting hate. It gives you goosebumps to see queer people with their flags against those trying to prevent this joy. You just wonder, ‘Where’s the love?’ But we still fight. They try to change the location and we still show up. We still put on our brave faces and stand together.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1746987972","playParams":{"id":"1746987972","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746987972/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1746985963","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1746985963?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718214743030}}},"1747006050":{"id":"1747006050","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747006050?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/0f/54/a40f54ca-34c4-cea1-00c3-581b311dac8f/Job7a42efd5-4cff-424d-9d34-0175e3020baa-170879065-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332681957_1818282265-Time1719510725866.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dec18d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c4a37c","textColor2":"dec18d","textColor4":"b29a71","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ee/56/8c/ee568cd9-f288-9e28-ba46-221d0b949fa1/2016a3ae-be26-455e-993e-5661bfdf337d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aead9f","textColor2":"dba887","textColor4":"b28a70","textColor1":"d5d4c3","bgColor":"111112","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/9e/20/4c/9e204cf3-ebdc-babf-e390-a55e987d52c0/Jobbe6d0e1a-8630-46cc-a4c0-07690c04c9f9-170879066-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332681958_1818282266-Time1719512368576.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dba776"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c39266","textColor2":"dba776","textColor4":"b38961","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marsha-ambrosius/474910","name":"CASABLANCO","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Marsha

I ensure clear and clean transitioning, but at the same time, the songs have conversations with each other.” The mix covers plenty of ground—and is designed to be the ideal soundtrack for a range of moments. “I hope this mix helps revive any spirit,” she says. “It’s for anyone who wants to have fun, anyone at home and trying to clean on Sundays, anyone who wants to start their Friday night. It's not too uptempo—it loosens the fit between EDM and electro-house versus amapiano; you’ll hear those drums every now and again.”\n"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1747318695","playParams":{"id":"1747318695","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747318695/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1205296907","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1205296907?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719535275790}}},"1747565519":{"id":"1747565519","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747565519?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f3/77/3c/f3773cb7-4874-7d8e-122a-a1709e35986f/70745c5c-9842-4351-b401-8599ac4b3f1b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4c4644","textColor2":"2b2828","textColor4":"4e4c4d","textColor1":"28211d","bgColor":"dcdce1","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cain/1497328984","name":"Jesus Music Deluxe","artistName":"CAIN","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3a/28/fb/3a28fb02-272d-a86f-56d7-c25fcc3f6e1b/196872002201.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e2828","textColor2":"222415","textColor4":"4c4232","textColor1":"110409","bgColor":"f2b9a6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jesus-music-deluxe/1747565519","playParams":{"id":"1747565519","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22269npvtP1J11HLRYouyG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747565519/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1497328984","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1497328984?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719554777494}}},"1747951729":{"id":"1747951729","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747951729?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/07/27/88/07278845-65a8-e650-56bb-892379a9c347/Job2ed62e5f-639c-448b-a296-68ac37f689dd-169423678-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329745566_1792731237-Time1717519512586.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1e1e1e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"353535","textColor2":"1e1e1e","textColor4":"454545","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/71/b4/28/71b428c9-bcfe-5cff-539e-b0242f399bae/a61ba500-1e53-4310-adf0-4e678ad215b4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"acd465","textColor2":"c9f76a","textColor4":"a4d667","textColor1":"d2f567","bgColor":"13505d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e0/be/0b/e0be0b28-e7e7-85fb-c282-1acb50ddfbef/Jobe366aac0-da03-42e5-a4f2-e7be22ab2b7a-169423679-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329745567_1792731238-Time1717522372719.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3c3c3c","textColor2":"272727","textColor4":"4b4b4b","textColor1":"131313","bgColor":"dddddd","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e2/c2/2f/e2c22fa7-9ea0-1d64-1cf0-84a85f58c40c/31af3435-d2f0-470d-b6a3-453f3b3844db.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"272727","textColor2":"161616","textColor4":"363636","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"b5b5b5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lucky-daye/1110820355","name":"Algorithm","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lucky Daye","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Some two years after the sublime <i>Candydrip</i>, Lucky Daye ensures that his third studio album is required listening for R&B fans and lovers everywhere.

The carnal delights depicted on “Top” feel downright palpable thanks to the singer’s earnest and eager delivery, a move that proves equally efficient on relatively more abstract cuts like the title track.\n\nA standout swirling with circular rhythms and squelchy bass, “Think Different” makes an assertive plea for cuffing in order to break an unfulfilling cycle of one-night stands. You can hear how much he’s enjoying himself on the blues-inflected novelty “Mary,” a steamy entry in the canon of lothario lore. At the same time, he’s also coming to understand the existential terror of being alone, particularly via “That’s You.” On the guest front, Teddy Swims adds his countrified soul-pop seasoning to the vulnerable duet “Blame,” while RAYE nudges Daye closer to commitment on the tender “Paralyzed.”","short":"The R&B sensation drifts through the sensual and existential sides of love."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/12/b5/3e/12b53ecc-3665-68ad-eb9a-30653ca4ecc5/196871943505.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"353535","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"464646","textColor1":"070707","bgColor":"ededed","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/algorithm/1747951729","playParams":{"id":"1747951729","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4L587s3QXoaroQTIdDWBiW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747951729/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1110820355","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1110820355?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719565143671}}},"1747969138":{"id":"1747969138","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747969138?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-me-est%C3%A1s-matando/1336742635","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"COMO ARRUINARTE LA VIDA (con una herida prohibida)","artistName":"Daniel, Me Estás Matando","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c0/b8/af/c0b8af6d-a9fc-82e7-fea1-5c816f1a8f5b/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"232323","textColor2":"111111","textColor4":"2a2a2a","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"8e8e8e","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1747969138","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/como-arruinarte-la-vida-con-una-herida-prohibida/1747969138","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1NNdcOYT3w0wuwazJhuiNc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747969138/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1336742635","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1336742635?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719567778076}}},"1748014447":{"id":"1748014447","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748014447?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"releaseDate":"2024-05-31","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/d8/91/38d8915a-bf4d-bee7-26fe-4bf094e0d0fa/c487f7af-0be2-49f7-b04c-cebbaa03fc95.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"310a23","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320a23","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e928a3","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e9/06/de/e906ded8-e2df-eddb-d90e-985c2a659f99/afd6fabe-70a0-4414-996d-94beb159340d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"310d25","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320d25","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e737ac","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ca/35/7a/ca357a07-6200-1e5a-a3d1-fab2a849a6e9/2fd7839b-f08c-47e5-863d-ea8b5e61df4f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"eccae0","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"d0c1c0","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81c84","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6d/c3/ad/6dc3ad46-357e-16de-b15f-7dcaf5a97e49/f2624c8b-9350-4995-ac09-16fe2e52f9df.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"310b24","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320b24","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e52da5","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/17/2f/4d/172f4d4e-4de7-101e-d0ae-1c484f401cac/5089ae6c-67a0-4b44-bd24-76177690218c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"edc7e0","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"ebbfdc","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b81d83","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/af/bb/be/afbbbe70-d332-94fd-cec8-0f9edec4a03f/38d29fde-f8d8-486a-ae9e-92f07946630d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"310d25","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"320d25","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"e737ac","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lady-shaka/1596372606","name":"Pride 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lady Shaka","editorialNotes":{"short":"The Aotearoa New Zealand artist’s mix honors her queer Māori identity.","standard":"“I wanted this mix to feel unapologetically Brown, unapologetically Black, unapologetically Indigenous, unapologetically queer, and unapologetically trans,” Lady Shaka tells Apple Music, setting the bar high for her Pride DJ mix.

Pride mix to be a source of euphoric energy,” Aquaria tells Apple Music. “I’ve crafted it using songs that uplift my spirits in one way or another, and give me no choice but to find the nearest dance floor and sweat it out in the name of life. The best Pride celebrations are where all members of our community feel free and celebrated, and I can imagine myself playing this mix at all sorts of steamy clubs across the city.” The city in question is New York City, of course—the drag icon took inspiration from the city itself while creating the mix: “I’ve been working on it from my home office in Brooklyn, overlooking the East River and Manhattan skyline. I’m always so inspired when I look out and reflect on my past 10 years living in this city and working in queer nightlife. I’m reminded of countless unforgettable moments, and I wanted to encapsulate the spontaneity and excitement of my experiences here.”\n\nOf all the tracks on Aquaria’s mix, Romy’s “Enjoy Your Life” is a particular standout. “To me, this represents one of those songs that you can put on at any time, and even if you’re feeling down, its message and energy will always be there to uplift you,” Aquaria says. “The track reminds you that despite the obstacles life can throw at you, sometimes the solution really does boil down to the simple old-fashioned advice to enjoy your life. I’m all for lyrics with lots of nuance and deeper hidden meaning, but sometimes you don’t need a convoluted metaphor to express pure joy through music. Romy does that so perfectly on this track, and the DJ HEARTSTRING remix pushes that BPM—and message—even harder.”\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/99/71/40/9971408b-29b2-1239-bb86-5010d3bef13a/75fb8657-aa33-43b7-b72e-aafda9b7dafa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"32212b","textColor2":"221f1f","textColor4":"4d3a44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fba6d7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1748666072","playParams":{"id":"1748666072","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748666072/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1097091378","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1097091378?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1717752258407}}},"1748712324":{"id":"1748712324","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748712324?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kr-z/1493450699","name":"Horo

UK artist’s mix celebrates inclusion and change in the garage scene.","standard":"“My mission within the rave sphere is to connect people to themselves and to let go of the worries of daily life,” UK-based DJ and producer Oppidan tells Apple Music. “Pride is all about connecting with yourself and joining together as a community, and every rave should be a celebration of Pride.”\n\nShe crafted this exclusive Pride DJ mix at her home in Bristol while reflecting on the ways her own presence is having an impact on her wider music community. “I work in a scene that’s very hetero- and male-dominated, and I believe my involvement in the garage space is making it more inclusive for women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ people,” she says. “The crowds at my shows are getting more and more diverse, and I’m really proud that so many people from different walks of life can come together to appreciate garage music with me.”"},"playParams":{"id":"1749170518","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2024-dj-mix/1749170518"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749170518/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1518613324","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1518613324?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1718225599991}}},"1749618344":{"id":"1749618344","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749618344?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/21/76/7d/21767daa-5990-6410-84ff-478adb57ba60/Job997c183b-031b-4a88-8cf9-f11e5af29b7c-169586773-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330072220_1796221181-Time1717685425229.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","32b0ed"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1737"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d1c5d0","textColor2":"32b0ed","textColor4":"2e90c7","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1737","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/a6/78/19a67852-1def-8cff-01a8-e1dab801b309/Job597a02b6-91d7-4732-a181-a2ead1bedde3-169586774-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330072219_1796221182-Time1717690721851.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2994f2"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1737"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d1cad2","textColor2":"2994f2","textColor4":"2678c8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1737","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flaujae/924913012","name":"Best

Album","standard":"During the Latin R&B wave of the late 2010s, Lyanno emerged as a breakout star via posse cuts like the “A Solas” and “Toda” remixes. Nearly halfway into the 2020s, the Puerto Rican singing sensation has since developed into an artist capable of solo standouts like “JOLLY” as well as memorable collaborations within and beyond his reggaetón roots. The concise yet diverse <i>PARA TODAS LAS MAMACITAS</i> offers a sampling of how his skill set applies across styles. Naturally, there are ample perreo opportunities, as “LO QUE TE DOY” and the pulsating “PTLM” plainly show. Continuing their long-standing back-and-forth creative exchange, Rauw Alejandro helps slow things down for the bump-and-grind prospects of “LA NENA.” Throughout the album, he steps into other sounds, basking in the reggae vibrations of “MÁS DE UN BESO” or emoting over the broader bombastic pop of “NOTAS DE VOZ.” Leaning fully into the explicit territory alluded to by the album title, the provocative “CRÈMEPIE” makes his intentions clear over a scintillating hip-hop beat.","short":"The Latin R&B star does a little something for the ladies."},"playParams":{"id":"1750737526","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/para-todas-las-mamacitas/1750737526","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3vybLae46btPWds1OXSHTK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750737526/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1153752366","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1153752366?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719564353814}}},"1750755036":{"id":"1750755036","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750755036?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"releaseDate":"2024-06-27","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/villano-antillano/1441570441","name":"Miss Misogyny","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Villano Antillano","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/d4/b7/10d4b7a2-17a9-aace-af18-07e1a9794266/198588320518.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cb8bd6","textColor2":"fd7bbb","textColor4":"d067a1","textColor1":"f7a8fd","bgColor":"1c173b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/miss-misogyny/1750755036","playParams":{"id":"1750755036","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2XCLHKZxCU9hKsenQR72di"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750755036/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1441570441","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1441570441?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719548078876}}},"1750814473":{"id":"1750814473","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750814473?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=553342-31526769","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Metiendo Mano (Remastered 2024)","artistName":"Ruben Blades & Willie Colón","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/35/3a/a6/353aa6a9-1ca5-ba18-76f2-cc2ff0ab6e4f/24CRGIM42758.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343535","textColor2":"2b1f15","textColor4":"554b43","textColor1":"010303","bgColor":"fffffd","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"1750814473","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/metiendo-mano-remastered-2024/1750814473","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/05Dph98Y5d6WU33B54w8R7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750814473/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"553342","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/553342?l=en-US"},{"id":"31526769","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31526769?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719550365834}}},"1750924024":{"id":"1750924024","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750924024?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"releaseDate":"2024-07-26","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joy-again/1048858235","name":"Song and Dance","artistName":"Joy Again","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7b/be/3a/7bbe3a77-c978-facb-e61d-5741b6e9ffc0/193436386890_JuneNickPedroJOYAGAINSONGANDDANCE.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"c2ccd2","textColor2":"e9f4ea","textColor4":"baccda","textColor1":"f3f4e1","bgColor":"002c98","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/song-and-dance/1750924024","playParams":{"id":"1750924024","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750924024/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1048858235","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1048858235?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1719561832632}}},"1750947928":{"id":"1750947928","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750947928?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"releaseDate":"2024-06-28","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jerry-di/1253670381","name":"ASILO COLLECTIONS: VOL III -

Since debuting in 2018 with the gliding “Controller,” the LA-based artist has become the purveyor of what he calls “Compton house,” a distinctly West Coast blend of house music, hip-hop, and funk. But his skill set extends beyond the dance floor. Early cuts such as “Black Moses” and “2000 chevy malibu” showed his hard-hitting yet atmospheric approach to rap, and collaborations with artists including Terrace Martin, Jungle, Tove Lo, and Gus Dapperton proved his versatility across genres. On <i>Real Cultural Shit</i>, Channel’s 2023 EP, he leveled up his songwriting, boosting his euphoric production with catchy hooks as heard on the defiant “6am.”\n\nChannel’s ever-growing Rolodex comes through on <i>Head Rush</i>, with Thundercat, Teezo Touchdown, Ty Dolla $ign, and more appearing throughout the album. It’s familiar in that it still pulses with Channel’s slick dance grooves, but it’s also where he expands upon his songwriting focus and sonic experiments. “Joyful Noise” is a modern take on gospel house, while “Type” brings celestial, speaker-busting rap. Even his signature suave baritone becomes another instrument to play with, getting rugged and fervent on the industrial-coated “Black & Mild.”\n\nMuch of <i>Head Rush</i> finds Channel enjoying the perks of fame. “Cactus Water,” on which freak flags fly atop swirling disco, is the album’s summer joint with its inviting chorus and funky bassline. He celebrates the luxury goods he previously couldn’t afford on the chugging “Candy Paint” and the beaming “Chain Hang Low,” and “I’m Him” is well-earned braggadocio. But embedded among the joy is a sobering vulnerability as Channel peels back layers of struggles past and present. It’s how on the beat-switching “Head Rush” he can juxtapose the triumph of buying a house with the survivor’s guilt of childhood trauma. Closing track “Here” is a bittersweet tribute to his late friend and fellow artist AUGUST 08, who helped Channel break into the industry: 08 “was a tutor/I was a student/Now we are the future.”","short":"The LA artist levels up his “Compton house” on his debut

Cameo","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"James Blake & Lil Yachty","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After the ambitious yet effective psychedelic pivot of <i>Let’s Start Here</i>, the artistic possibilities afforded to Lil Yachty grew exponentially like multiversal timelines. Here was someone who could step outside of hip-hop’s comfort zones to credibly deliver a rock odyssey for the 2020s. Evidently, that intrigued singer-songwriter James Blake enough to join forces with the Atlanta-based rapper for a joint album that further blurs the lines of their respective discographies—with captivating and even magnificent results.\n\nAt times, <i>Bad Cameo</i> can feel like a push-and-pull between the two talents, something to be expected when seemingly disparate artists enter into such a venture together. A flurry of narcotized love and burnt rubber, “Woo” comes closest to the jittery clubwise energy of Yachty’s singles. Meanwhile Blake, a consummate collaborator for everyone from Beyoncé and ROSALÍA to Oneohtrix Point Never and Nico Muhly, seems to have the upper hand on the meditative “Midnight.”\n\nAnd yet, that dynamic also seems a function of the thematic gravity of these shared songs that focus heavily on internal monologues and relationships, with all the inherent messiness and complexity intact. One can detect the fundamental empathy amid the ambient drift and retro breakbeats of “In Grey,” as both Blake and Yachty turn their all-too-human vulnerabilities into open secrets. Propelled by intentionally slippery beat switches, “Transport Me” reveals commonality and camaraderie through their long-distance dramatics and poetic ruminations. By the time the harmonious finale “Red Carpet” arrives, it’s clear how respectively and collectively transformative the process was for them.","short":"Teacups and double cups collide on this

With the international success of recent collaborative projects like the Punjabi summer pop album <i>Making Memories</i> with Toronto-based producer Ikky and a team-up with Indian hip-hop legend DIVINE on <i>Street Dreams</i>, Aujla’s quick-witted bars and innovative melodies have brought Punjabi music to new heights.\n\nAnd his latest EP is no different. Preempting any stagnation, Aujla showcases his signature lyrical prowess and emotional earnestness on four diverse tracks. He brings melodious and lovesick vocals on “IDK HOW” (over a sample of the 1999 Punjabi folk hit “Aaja Sohneya”) before switching to the brooding, trappy punches of “Who They?”. “Antidote” and “Y.D.G.” feel like an extension of Aujla’s upbeat work on <i>Making Memories</i>, groovy and addictive while still grounded. If anything, despite his burgeoning career in recent years, <i>Four Me</i> is a bold reminder that Karan Aujla is only just getting started. \n","short":"His quick wit and innovative melodies take
