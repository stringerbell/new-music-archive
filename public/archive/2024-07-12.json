Album","standard":"The lights are low, the radio’s playing the soft hits of yesteryear, and Greg Gonzalez has just been struck by a cartoon vixen in a Marvel comic from the early ’90s—that look on her face reminds him of someone. “I need that sweet life with its decadent ways,” sighs the lead singer of TikTok’s biggest dream-pop band on the woozy “Silver Sable,” a Cigarettes After Sex mission statement if there ever was one. Gonzalez formed the band in 2013, though he’d written songs under the evocative moniker since 2008: sultry songs that float along in a post-coital haze in the vein of ’90s bands like Mazzy Star or Cowboy Junkies, the kind of thing you play in headphones to feel like the main character in the noir film of your life.\n\nThe band’s third full-length album, <i>X’s</i>, plays out like a dream you might have after a few hours of scrolling Tumblr. The title track is a pleasant blur of cinnamon and leopard print, candlelight and birthday cake, with a nod to Marilyn Monroe’s last photo shoot to fully set the mood, all sung like a horny lullaby as is Gonzalez’s trademark. “Hot” is all pink lemonade and backyard pools, while “Dark Vacay” reads like Eve Babitz at the Chateau: sleeping on the cool tile of the bathroom floor, drinking expensive bordeaux and listening to old voicemails. And on lead single “Tejano Blue,” El Paso native Gonzalez is the only guy at the beach in leather pants. The mood hardly deviates from the usual slow burn (though the muted disco pulse of “Holding you, Holding me” passes for upbeat in the Cigs’ catalog), but who needs bangers when you can wallow instead?","short":"TikTok’s biggest dream-pop band offers up hazy decadence and horny lullabies."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/xs/1729293463","playParams":{"id":"1729293463","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10i6evsxSFs2fuPQRWvI6I"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1729293463/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1069739468","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1069739468?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720794015517,"RTCI":0}}},"1732069006":{"id":"1732069006","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1732069006?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/salute/969249942","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d1/ca/c9/d1cac987-5a75-755d-9832-4c5e7bb041a8/Jobad29e414-8d91-4d7a-b759-ba7047a14b39-166576835-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323832480_1745742575-Time1713526961911.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f7bdc7"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"e7d4d5","textColor2":"f7bdc7","textColor4":"e9a5a9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2a/e7/ff/2ae7ff9f-b512-4efa-e92e-214672c09beb/be1b6e1e-f005-4f07-82fe-e74f17fb943a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"374447","textColor2":"2c1f19","textColor4":"454643","textColor1":"1c1e1e","bgColor":"a6deea","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d4/7a/10/d47a1054-f171-bdfd-71a8-e4e850304a91/Job52d84e97-6c2a-4ae1-9fbb-4900e8f37b7c-166576836-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323832481_1745742571-Time1713536496021.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f0eef8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"e9ceba","textColor2":"f0eef8","textColor4":"e4c8d2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7c/f1/1e/7cf11e55-f019-7817-41d9-5a4934e0f346/1597a77a-f9fc-4ba3-b94a-e0d9fe2087f5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e1d6d3","textColor2":"f78fa0","textColor4":"e17e87","textColor1":"f7fdfe","bgColor":"8b3b27","hasP3":false}},"name":"TRUE MAGIC","artistName":"salute","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When it came to creating their debut album, Vienna-born and Manchester-based DJ salute knew it had to be a collaborative labor of love. “I wanted to celebrate the musical community I’ve built over the past 10 years and make excellent pop music for the dance floor,” they tell Apple Music. “The production became just like the album’s aesthetic: bright, glossy, and fun.”\n\nSince the release of their first EP, “Lionheart,” in 2013, salute has been building a loyal dance-floor following drawn to their blend of French Touch-inspired melodic sampling, bouncing basslines and uptempo beatmaking. Their debut album <i>TRUE MAGIC</i> is no different, distilling everything from drum ’n’ bass throwbacks to Japanese jazz fusion and UK garage into a euphoric brand of club-ready bangers. “It’s an album to play loud and lose yourself in,” salute says. “It’s the truest representation of exactly where I am right now.” Read on for salute’s in-depth thoughts on <i>TRUE MAGIC</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“start”</b>\n“The album is structured to soundtrack a race where you’re in the Toyota MR2 from the cover art while a narrating voice chimes in to tell you to start, slow down, or speed up. It’s a theme inspired by my teenage love of watching old car commercials on YouTube and playing games like Need for Speed. This short opening kicks off the race and features a sample from one of my favorite bands, the Japanese fusion group Casiopea, which carries on in the next track.”\n\n<b>“saving flowers” (with Rina Sawayama)</b>\n“I’ve been friends with Rina for a decade now and worked on some production for her first album. I’ve been wanting to get her on a track of mine for a long time and we finally managed to make it happen with ‘saving flowers.’ With Rina being Japanese, it felt like a perfect fit to have her singing over a sample from one of Japan’s most iconic bands, Casiopea. It’s just a beautiful way to honor our friendship.”\n\n<b>“reason” (with Karma Kid)</b>\n“Karma Kid is one of my best friends and he is also the executive producer on the album. There’s a French Touch feel that runs through the record and for ‘reason,’ we wanted to make something that tapped into that late-’90s/early-2000s sound, in the vein of ‘Thrill Me’ by Junior Jack. This was only the second song we made on the album and it came together really quickly—it’s still one of my favorites.”\n\n<b>“lift off!” (with Disclosure)</b>\n“I was asked to remix the track ‘Looking for Love’ from Disclosure’s last album [2023’s <i>Alchemy</i>] and since they liked what I did, we wanted to find a way to work together on an original tune. I managed to hang out with Guy [Lawrence] when I was in LA and there we began a bunch of ideas, including ‘lift off!’ We have a very similar musical taste and, as a lifelong Disclosure fan, it was just super fun to watch him work so effortlessly on this track.”\n\n<b>“maybe it’s u” (with Sam Gellaitry)</b>\n“I’ve loved watching Sam Gellaitry grow into an incredible artist over the years and I have a lot of respect for his talent. We ended up on the same bill at Way Out West festival in Sweden and when we were backstage, I played this beat on my phone to him and asked him to sing over it. Not many people know that he’s an incredible singer, so it’s an honor to have him doing the vocals on this track. We ended up writing it super fast in only three hours when we were both later in LA together.”\n\n<b>“go!” (with Nakamura Minami)</b>\n“When I was in Japan on tour, I played a bunch of Nakamura Minami’s tracks and she got wind of it, so we soon connected and decided to find a song to work on together. I love her vocal energy and sent her a beat to record over, but what she sent back was such an incredibly layered performance, I knew I had to change my part to do it justice. What you hear on the final version is a completely new instrumental with that same amazing vocal.”\n\n<b>“true magic, bonus round”</b>\n“This interlude is a bit like when you’re playing Mario Kart and in the last round everything suddenly speeds up—it’s the part of the race where things get intense. I used to produce drum ’n’ bass when I was a teenager, and this is a throwback to that genre, produced through the prism of the artist that I am now.”\n\n<b>“one of those nights” (with Empress Of)</b>\n“I had never met Empress Of but she was on my list of people I wanted to work with on the album. Thankfully, Karma Kid had a connection with her, so we managed to meet for a session in LA. We hit it off immediately and became so excited about this beat as soon as we started making it. That session also produced the ideas for the track ‘system.’”\n\n<b>“move faster…”</b>\n“‘move faster…’ is the big club tune on the album, a track that represents the kind of music I love playing in my DJ sets. I actually tested out the first version of this track at my debut Boiler Room show in 2022 and people responded really well. It all centers on a jazz-fusion song [Michael Shrieve’s ‘Transfer Station Blue’] from the mid ’80s that I’ve sampled and sped up over this beat.”\n\n<b>“system”</b>\n“French Touch is such a flexible sound, ranging from the kinds of music Justice makes to Thomas Bangalter’s productions. ‘system’ is very much inspired by the latter, trying to make a two-bar melodic loop as interesting as possible while layering it with loads of huge chords. It was written with Empress Of and [UK house producer] Luxury and is always one of my favorites from the record to play during DJ sets.”\n\n<b>“softly” (feat. Léa Sen)</b>\n“This is the part of the album where I take my foot off the pedal and move into a softer zone, since everything before has been so big and dramatic. This is one of the most subtle songs I’ve ever made, since I wanted to let Léa’s emotive and beautiful vocals shine through. All I did was layer synths over the beat, and it makes the track feel so different from everything else on <i>TRUE MAGIC</i>.”\n\n<b>“luv stuck” (with piri)</b>\n“I’ve been a fan of piri’s music for ages and wanted to make something sticky and sweet for her voice, since our sounds gel so well. She is an amazing songwriter and wrote this track so quickly, delivering a vocal that perfectly complements the instrumental. It’s such clear singing and catchy writing, I think people will really gravitate towards this tune.”\n\n<b>“perfect” (with LEILAH)</b>\n“LEILAH has been a really important part of my career and we have worked on a number of my tracks together. She is an amazing songwriter and we made this track initially to play out at clubs and festivals. I was getting such a good reaction from the song though, I made the last-minute decision to include it on the album after tweaking the beat to make it fit better with the other songs. I’m so glad I did because I think it summarizes everything I’ve learned about production during the making of this record.”\n\n<b>“drive” (with LEILAH)</b>\n“‘drive’ was the first track we wrote for the album, and it’s the only 2-step song on it.

Where 2021’s <i>Wrestling</i> was completely personal, <i>Can You Hear Me Dreaming?</i> looks outward, and is comprised of made-up stories and the experiences of others. “A lot of them are based on multiple stories melded together, but we created a framework to make it more interesting or understandable,” she says, referring to herself and her wife, director and artist Dillon Howl, who contributed lyrics and ideas to several tracks. “We were trying to make them personal, even if they were made-up. We called it emotional voyeurism, and were like, ‘This is creepy, but in a fun way.’”\n\nBelow, Lowther talks through the stories on <i>Can You Hear Me Dreaming?</i> with Howl chiming in to shed light on two tracks she penned the lyrics for.\n\n<b>“Wasting Time (til the end of the world)”</b>\n“I was trying to write from the position of someone really feeling the chaos of the world. The lyrics are totally dark, reflecting the endless nature of chaos and everything that comes at you from the news. I didn’t want to write any lyrics that were, like, ‘Be happy’ or ‘This isn’t terrible,’ because it is kind of terrible. So I wanted to make the music something you can thrash around to, and at least get some physical energy out as a relief.”\n\n<b>“Heaven”</b>\n“It’s a sexy song. Wanting someone, wanting to please them, and realizing that the excess stuff everyone always talks about doesn’t matter when you actually find someone. We don’t need a week in a hotel. We don’t need a week on an island. I’m sure those things would be amazing. I would love a million dollars, but not as much as finding someone you really want to enjoy pleasure with.”\n\n<b>“Can’t Help It”</b>\n“I wrote it after chatting to a bunch of people at a party. I was with a bunch of women who were producers, and we ended up at a party with a bunch of skater bros. It was funny because everyone had their own version of people telling them how they should be creating art. I wanted to make it patronizing in return, like, ‘Oh, poor guy, you can’t help it. It’s just in your nature to be patronizing,’ as a way of having a bit of power in that situation.”\n\n<b>“Cry Cry Cry”</b>\n“I really think that sometimes a bop can just make you feel better. So I wanted to do that.”\n\n<b>“Heavyweight”</b>\n“We can all have this deluded part of our self, like ego in a way. ‘I’m a heavyweight, I’m right, I’m going to make this work.’ And you can get stuck in a cycle of delusion caused by pride or overconfidence, but at the same time, I love that feeling. It’s become so common on the internet for people to portray that side of them first. I feel pressured to be always confident and display that. I love it, but I think it can get you in trouble at the same time. It’s so hard sometimes to balance when you should be confident and push for what you need, especially if you’re in a creative field, especially when sometimes you feel like you’re not being heard, but I can overcompensate. Finding the balance is difficult, but kind of a fun game.”\n\n<b>“Communal Reverie” (with PESH)</b>\nDillon Howl: “It’s about community and symbiosis. It is influenced by the teachings of Thích Nhất Hạnh, who emphasized the way all living organisms interact: ‘You cultivate the flower in yourself, so that I will be beautiful.’”\n\n<b>“Mountain”</b>\n“There’s that concept of deep time or mountain time, the idea that everything is on different scales. Think about something from the perspective of a mountain that’s existed for thousands of years. You’re just a blip, but the mountain gets to see all of this change. I was imagining if you were just sitting on top of a mountain and you could see the whole of LA and how it changes, the past 100 years would be one second of what you would see. Seasons would feel like one day. For us it’s like, ‘It’s breakfast time.’ For a mountain, it’s like, ‘It’s spring, now it’s summer.’”\n\n<b>“One More Night” (feat. Flume)</b>\n“It’s really about obsession with a hookup. A lot of people have experienced those people who you keep running into or going back to. With ‘One More Night,’ it’s like, even when you say it’s the last time, it’s definitely not going to be the last time.”\n\n<b>“Wedding”</b>\n“It was like, ‘I’ll still come to your wedding, I love you. I’m here for you.’ But it’s hard to enjoy yourself when you feel like someone is doing something so destructive. Two of my friends have been in terrible relationships. One of them was with someone who was totally abusive, thank God they’re not together. With the other, the guy was just weird and kind of racist and it was like, ‘What are you doing?’ So the song was just a way of getting those feelings out without it being so true. I’ve been in a situation like that, and it’s easy to not see what is right in front of you, to just not register what everyone else around you is very easily able to register. And it’s hard sometimes to listen when your friends try and tell you what the issues are. So I get it from both sides, but the song is about saying I’ll support you now, and then when you hopefully break up, I’ll be there to support you then, too.”\n\n<b>“Messed Up”</b>\n“There’s that theory about how, when you meet someone and there’s a crazy obsessive dynamic, apparently your body is trying to signal something to you about it being ready bad. I remember hearing that, and I’ve definitely met people when I was dating and seen it as well, where the dynamic is so obsessive that it’s a red flag. Everyone’s had these relationships where things are obviously bad or going to go wrong at some point, but you have to let it run its course.”\n\n<b>“Gross Body” (with PESH)</b>\nDH: “I love the question, ‘If you close your eyes how do you know you have a body?’ It points to our direct experience or what is known through our felt senses. ‘Gross Body’ is an homage to this felt experience and all the chaotic and sublime truths that come with feeling our bodies responding to the world around us.”\n\n<b>“Not There”</b>\n“It sounds a little different to the rest of the album, but the process of writing it made sense. I wrote it based on a GIF that was from the perspective from a really tall building, and you could see other buildings and stuff, and the rain was coming down. Me and Dillon actually wrote the lyrics based on a completely made-up story, and we made our own story, but it all came from that one GIF.”","short":"“You can access fantasy pockets in your brain”: KUČKA on her second album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3c/f7/1f/3cf71f0e-04b4-a450-e9e6-3a985f5adfdf/5056614796254.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0966b","textColor2":"dba660","textColor4":"b0854e","textColor1":"dcbc85","bgColor":"000003","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/can-you-hear-me-dreaming/1734797360","playParams":{"id":"1734797360","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3gi2MFodyrIh2X2r1hbgvx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734797360/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"521114995","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/521114995?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720776930434,"RTCI":0}}},"1735553542":{"id":"1735553542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1735553542?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/travis/475835","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ae/d9/e9/aed9e9e0-c36b-d60e-5874-628bca6b317b/Jobfbde24d7-df77-4a7e-a029-0ac0604c67cb-169576545-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330053336_1796023704-Time1717677120701.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1a1b1e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"26262d","textColor2":"1a1b1e","textColor4":"323234","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/26/14/3c/26143c3e-44ce-d6b9-70e2-24be555465e0/0f0815c0-08a1-42cf-89e2-ba336cc0e66b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"332b2e","textColor2":"282528","textColor4":"473e43","textColor1":"0f0d0d","bgColor":"c5a2b2","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b1/a3/1a/b1a31a95-5c07-ef93-27a2-8ac271acc166/Jobade408e7-abf7-445f-aae0-b51c8bdabb61-169394776-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329689645_1792184724-Time1717498471572.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"272529","textColor2":"171618","textColor4":"302e30","textColor1":"0c0b10","bgColor":"938e8d","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/aa/4e/9d/aa4e9d6f-ec7e-4257-4d8c-c02a14f964f0/2e3904b7-0983-4471-850b-7b0072fdd4d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d6d2d4","textColor2":"ebecf9","textColor4":"ccccd7","textColor1":"f8f4f5","bgColor":"4e4c4f","hasP3":false}},"name":"L.A.

Album","standard":"On <i>Big Ideas</i>, Remi Wolf gives us grade-A pop music viewed through a funhouse mirror—familiar shapes twisted into kaleidoscopic new forms. Doubling down on the quirky charisma and unabashed joy of her debut LP, the boundary-pushing pop artist’s sophomore album reveals the true scope of her artistic vision: There are husky soul excursions (“Motorcycle”), cacophonous indie anthems (“Wave”), helium-filtered disco cuts (“Slay Bitch”), and splashes of electro and jazz. These explorations never feel scattershot or unsure of themselves. Wolf’s magic is that she knows exactly who she is. \n\nHer songwriting is more sophisticated here—but still genuinely funny—and covers a lot of emotional ground. Ping-ponging between vulnerability and cheeky bravado, she takes listeners inside the hyperactive brain of a Gen Z twentysomething—overstimulation, searching, sarcasm, and all. “So good the sound of crypto bros/Eating cubanos by myself,” she quips on “Alone in Miami,” an upbeat song about the isolation of celebrity. “The walls are closin' in on me in this Art Deco museum/Daughters in thongs are roamin' freely, pop stars in my DMs.” It’s this carefree combination of power and sensitivity—she’s both the life of the party and the friend you break down to at 3 am—that makes <i>Big Ideas</i> more than a collection of bops. Rather, it’s a dizzying, stream-of-consciousness snapshot of what it feels like to be young in 2024, searching for depth and meaning in an increasingly material world.

Both albums contain 11 tracks—each referencing one of the 22 Major Arcana tarot cards—bringing the concept to a close after more than a decade.\n\nEvery card in a tarot deck has two “meanings,” depending on whether they appear upright or inverted during a reading. <i>Incarnation</i> focuses on darker interpretations of the 11 cards reflected in the track list. “Tyrant (ɹoɹǝdɯǝ ǝɥʇ)” explores the concept of a ruthless dictator, as represented by the Emperor card being upside down (lead vocalist Jake Taylor wrote it with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> character Denethor II in mind), while “Gen Doom (ʇuɐɥdoɹǝᴉɥ ǝɥʇ)” is set in a post-apocalyptic future. The chaotic, malevolent “Orphan (lᴉʌǝp ǝɥʇ)” is about the rise of tech and the devastating impact of mass production and mono crops on the world, the Devil card represents fear and how it can overwhelm when given the opportunity. \n\n“Hollow Bone (plɹoʍ ǝɥʇ)” is a brutal and pivotal moment on the LP. Following the departure of bassist and clean vocalist Kyle Erich earlier in 2024, the group found itself at a creative crossroads. Bereft of the melodic possibilities Erich’s voice afforded, the remaining members joined forces to sing the track’s melodic chorus, proving to themselves that there was a way forward without him. \n\nSuch melodic moments are, however, few and far between, the album’s darker themes mirrored by a vicious, brutal musical attack—the inversion of the more melodically inclined <i>Divination</i>. Beyond the overall concept are several other links to the band’s debut—both are produced by Josh Schroeder with art by Johann Ingemar, while the guest vocalists from <i>Divination</i> (Parkway Drive’s Winston McCall, For the Fallen Dreams’ Chad Ruhlig, and The Color Morale’s Garret Rapp) also feature on <i>Incarnation</i>. The end result is an album that recalls In Hearts Wake’s past, while being very much about their future.","short":"The Byron Bay metalers’ fearsome sequel to their debut

Album","standard":"Windwaker’s second album is a deeply complex psychological journey into the mind of a person with two conflicting personalities—one is quiet, timid, and compassionate, the other confident, opportunistic, and pessimistic. As the album progresses, each personality realizes it can’t exist without the other, leading to an uneasy acceptance of their respective strengths and flaws. It’s fitting that an album about contrasting character traits should boast so many contradictory musical styles. While the Melbourne outfit’s sound is built on a foundation of hardcore and metalcore, they gleefully incorporate lashings of rock, metal, hip-hop, EDM, dubstep, and punk. \n\nOpener “Infinity” (about being scared to commit in relationships, as told from the perspective of the timid protagonist) fuses crushing guitars and upbeat synths with the hardcore vocals of Liam Guinane (who steps up from his previous role as guitarist to replace former singer Will King), while “Get Out” features skittering electronic beats, alt-rock, brutal metalcore, and Southern hip-hop. “Haunting Me” (a love song from the quiet personality to the more confident one) exists in the world of soul and R&B, while “Vertigo” is a carnival ride of giants riffs, metalcore, dubstep, and eerie synths. It’s a heady mix, one that only offers respite in soothing closer “Juliet.” Reprising some of the lyrics from opener “Infinity,” it’s a full-circle moment that concludes the album by returning the listener to the beginning.","short":"The genre-blending band’s devastatingly heavy second

Album","standard":"In a short time, Claire Cottrill has become one of pop music’s most fascinating chameleons. Even as her songwriting and soft vocals often possess her singular touch, the prodigious 25-year-old has exhibited a specific creative restlessness in her sonic approach. After pivoting from the lo-fi bedroom pop of her early singles to the sounds of lush, rustic 2000s indie rock on 2019’s star-making <i>Immunity</i> and making a hard pivot towards monastic folk on 2021’s <i>Sling</i>, the baroque, ’70s soul-inflected chamber-pop that makes up her third album, <i>Charm</i>, feels like yet another revelation in an increasingly essential catalog.\n\n<i>Charm</i> is Cottrill’s third consecutive turn in the studio with a producer of distinctive aesthetic; while <i>Immunity</i>’s flashes of color were provided by Rostam Batmanglij and Jack Antonoff worked the boards on <i>Sling</i>, these 11 songs possess the undeniable warmth of studio impresario and Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings founding member Leon Michels. Along with several Daptone compatriots and NYC jazz auteur Marco Benevento, Michels provides the perfect support to Cotrill’s wistful, gorgeously tumbling songcraft; woodwinds flutter across the squishy synth pads of “Slow Dance,” while “Echo” possesses an electro-acoustic hum not unlike legendary UK duo Broadcast and the simmering soul of “Juna” spirals out into miniature psychedelic curlicues. At the center of it all is Cottrill’s unbelievably intimate vocal touch, which perfectly captures and complements <i>Charm</i>’s lyrical theme of wanting desire while staring uncertainty straight in the eye.","short":"On her third album, Claire Cottrill takes another revelatory

Album and Interview","standard":"Megan Moroney chose the songs for her second full-length album because they resonated with her deeply, not because of outside opinions or perceived hit potential. “This is my life, and no one wants me to make a better second album than me, and I’m going to put out whatever songs I like,” she tells Apple Music. “I’m the one that has to perform these songs. I’m proud of them. And if it’s not your cup of tea, then good thing there’s a million artists out there.”\n\nThat said, <i>Am I Okay?</i> shows no signs of a sophomore slump. Like its predecessor, the 2023 breakout <i>Lucky</i>, the collection pulls together feisty kiss-offs and aching ballads—the latter a product of Moroney’s winking, self-professed “emo cowgirl” persona. Highlights on the album include the sweet and optimistic title track, on which Moroney falls for “a 6'2\" dream,” and the swaggering rock anthem “Indifferent.” More serious moments show a weightier side to Moroney’s songwriting, like the heartbreaking, grief-stricken “Heaven by Noon” and the vulnerable closer “Hell of a Show.” Below, Moroney shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Am I Okay?”</b>\n“People are probably going to think it’s going to be a heart-wrenching song, but it’s just not. It’s like you’re actually happy for once and you’re asking yourself, ‘Oh my God. Am I OK?’ That’s how I felt at one time. I think that when I had hope in a relationship with this guy, it lasted for a month or two until he showed his true colors. But we live and we learn. We got a good song out of it, and then we moved on.”\n\n<b>“No Caller ID”</b>\n“I was playing it at the <i>Lucky</i> shows. I was kind of giving them that treat, like an unreleased song [where] the only place you could hear it was at the live shows. But then, of course, it got posted on TikTok, and several TikToks of that song blew up. So, I thought that people cared about the song, but I didn’t know it was going to take off the way it did, obviously.”\n\n<b>“Indifferent”</b>\n“A song like ‘Indifferent,’ it was just kind of what I was going through at the time. But I think in the studio…I’m like, ‘OK, because this song turned into what it is, we need to make this rock. We need to make it punch really hard, because this is going to be crazy at live shows.’ So, it’s kind of like after the song was written, just making sure in the studio it was executed the way that we wanted it to be.”\n\n<b>“Miss Universe”</b>\n“‘Miss Universe’ is basically just a story about when you want your ex to downgrade and then they don’t, and you’re like, ‘Oh.’ So, that’s kind of just that feeling. I’m like, ‘How did you pull her?’ So, yeah, that is just kind of a story about how you want them to downgrade and then they don’t. They very much upgrade.”\n\n<b>“Heaven by Noon”</b>\nI had a title, ‘Heaven by Noon,’ and I brought it to Jessie Jo Dillon and Matt Jenkins. We wrote ‘Girl in the Mirror’ together, which is also a heart-wrenching song. So, I knew if we were going to write a heart-wrencher that I needed to have those two help me out with it. And we kind of used our own experiences in our own lives to write this song, but it was just the idea of when you lose someone, you don’t know it’s going to be the last time. A lot of people don’t know this, but my uncle died on 9/11, so I thought about my aunt when I was writing that song because the last thing they talked about was an oil change. And that’s probably not what she would’ve wanted to say to him if she knew it was going to be the last time.”\n\n<b>“Hell of a Show”</b>\n“It was a situation that I was in for a while, and it was—I knew it was toxic. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it got to a point where I wrote it as a poem in the back of my bus right after a show, and then I picked up my guitar because my guitar was still onstage or whatever, so I didn’t have it. But then I picked up a guitar and put a melody to it after. It was just one of those situations where I’m like, ‘I have a sold-out tour. It’s my debut album, sold out. People are showing up at 10 am. They’ve got shirts on. It’s like everything I’ve ever wanted, and I am crying before I go onstage because of an asshole.’ And it’s like, ‘You are ruining good moments for me.’”\n","short":"The emo cowgirl returns. “I’m going to put out whatever songs I like.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/am-i-okay/1743233224","playParams":{"id":"1743233224","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7l80BDHxpZwj8FXImqH8fw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743233224/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552469569","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552469569?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720793651309,"RTCI":0}}},"1743440218":{"id":"1743440218","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743440218?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/girl-ultra/1207957662","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ad/71/c7/ad71c7dc-9c0e-4b9e-3ab2-d582796ea7a4/Job1026c56b-fa56-4a4d-b355-88b8725c6b31-170856622-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332631610_1817917236-Time1719486746671.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","131313"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"191b1b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"313134","textColor2":"131313","textColor4":"353637","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"191b1b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d7/64/33/d7643325-14a7-05a2-d2fa-7ca5e590730c/c62a5217-849a-4726-9856-dcacbd48802d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b69fa0","textColor2":"d2bec2","textColor4":"ab9b9e","textColor1":"dfc3c4","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d7/5c/f5/d75cf51c-b9ae-37db-74a8-c5c4d511f245/Job2c581466-ce9e-43a5-8e7b-e4d9beb841da-170856623-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332631609_1817916935-Time1719488076300.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2f3032","textColor2":"1c1d1d","textColor4":"3c3e3f","textColor1":"0b0c0d","bgColor":"bfc3c7","hasP3":false}},"name":"blush","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Girl Ultra","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I feel my career as Girl Ultra has been something like a college education, and now I’m at the stage where I can allow myself to experiment more,” Mariana de Miguel tells Apple Music. Even during her younger years, the Mexico City native already oozed confidence. This creative self-awareness has always been based on her musical talent and her ability to be honest with herself. “Girl Ultra is a vehicle that allows me to channel many different genres—the many disparate influences that live inside my head.”\n\nNow the singer adds a new chapter to her story with <i>blush</i>, a seven-track EP that flirts openly with the avant-garde. Dance and garage converge organically with refined melodies and sequencers evoking the electronic anthems of the 2000s. “I love blending organic elements with digital programming—those contrasts can be either really cool or just terrible,” she says. The EP also portrays the emotional nostalgia of a young woman in her late twenties whose world exists in a permanent state of motion. Here, Girl Ultra walks us through a selection of her new songs.\n\n<b>“blu”</b>\n“It was the first track that I wrote for this project. It started with Sam Katz and Kidd from the band Noah Pino Palo and a need to make songs that sounded dynamic and carried a sense of momentum. I wanted the EP to feel like it was created in a singular space and time, and also write a melody that fell somewhere between sadness and happiness. I found this phrase on my notebook: <i>‘Te regalo el cenicero, quémalo todo, yo te espero.’</i> [‘Here’s an ashtray, go ahead and burn everything, I will wait for you.’] It refers to the desire that young people have to burn everything around them but then find a way to put things back together. It’s like, ‘I see how you destroy yourself and then you bounce back.’ This song talks about the feeling of being sad, but still needing to move forward and do what you have to do. I also like ‘blu’ because the sound reminds me of Moby’s <i>Play</i>—that specific way of programming the drums, combining them with organic elements.”\n\n<b>“blush”</b>\n“To me, melody signifies music in its raw state, before the lyrics set in. I like to sit down, get an idea going, and take it from there. Start with an empty canvas and build it up. I start recording fragments of things on my phone, and the melodies begin to emerge. I’m influenced by many different things, and ‘blush’ has some Arabic motifs in it. I love to delve into the cadence and the specific tonality behind each tune, using short words or words with more air in them. I see the voice as just another instrument, just like you connect an overdrive to a guitar. In the end, I’m the composer, but it’s also my voice—the sole vehicle for everything that I’m saying.”\n\n<b>“5to elemento”</b>\n“I was emo for a long time, and this is a little tribute to that, because the guitars have a Midwest sound to them. Sam Katz, the main producer on this project, played with many bands from that era—the screaming at the end is his. It felt natural to explore this blend, inspired by the emotronic years, when emo merged with sequencers. Sam started to record the guitar, and it sounded like the kind of song you would sing at a campfire, so I asked him to add some really aggressive drumming. It’s a sad song—that’s how we felt during the recording process, and the vibe definitely came through. I was just getting to know Sam, and we opened up as we recorded this song about being vulnerable.”\n\n<b>“bruce willisss”</b>\n“These are the songs that emerge on their own—they’re like a little piece of free candy. Sometimes the ideas that you trust the least end being a happy accident. This track stems from my love for the era of Röyksopp and Erlend Øye—they made club music that sounded immaculately clean. I thought it would be fun to use those same patterns but get them a little dirty. I also love the pop culture elements, like mentioning Bruce Willis or the film <i>The Fifth Element</i>. Those are memorable references, and I have an emotional link to them. I love those uptempo moods—sometimes I like to say less, but in other instances, I’m fine with spitting the words out and verbalizing a lot of things. This track allowed me to say a lot in a short span of time.”\n\n<b>“lalala”</b>\n“That’s Sam Katz on the drums. We wanted to recreate the opening moments from an anime—a band like Fantastic Plastic Machine—with those Japanese motifs. We also wanted it to be playful. It was more like an instrumental composition, so that we could connect it with ‘rimel,’ a fun clubby song with an acid house influence.”\n\n<b>“guapa”</b>\n“An ode to female empowerment, even though that perspective has become a bit trite. Here I’m saying something like, ‘Tonight I’m going out with my friends, because I look good and I know that I look good.’ I love dark wave and techno, and I wanted to make a somber song that never quite explodes—the tension will stay on until the very end. I like that it never quite resolves. You only get a breather at the very end, and it brings you back to the more organic elements of the EP, closer to Fantastic Plastic Machine, the Japanese sounds. I’m fascinated by the spectral moods of dance clubs and electronica of that time. ‘guapa’ espouses a darker mood, linked to female beauty, which I see as a bewitching kind of power. You know you’re good-looking, and you use it to your favor.”\n","short":"“Being an artist with a penchant for the avant-garde is my greatest gift.”"},"artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/27/04/ea/2704eafb-8986-fbe5-e3f2-9643d12fb7a7/5054429194272.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"303132","textColor2":"111112","textColor4":"333436","textColor1":"0d0d0d","bgColor":"bdc0c5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blush/1743440218","playParams":{"id":"1743440218","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6XFmWkqa5i9L4iKQSFZOHK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743440218/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1207957662","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1207957662?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720758908617,"RTCI":0}}},"1743775840":{"id":"1743775840","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743775840?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/34/97/ed/3497ede9-2279-c97f-74a8-233538bf9b6a/Job4e0f6432-8d19-42b5-8f89-9632d8f10dda-169429851-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329761906_1792894339-Time1717526273512.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","14180e"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"353530","textColor2":"14180e","textColor4":"3f4136","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cd/44/17/cd44177b-4d26-dad3-426a-59e0d78c57c0/de9c1f2b-faf0-420b-87bf-8c833bc1d056.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292a29","textColor2":"101309","textColor4":"2f3229","textColor1":"090908","bgColor":"acacac","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c5/03/d8/c503d875-a06f-bbe5-9065-fb7d75d789f7/Job25a43d65-1885-435a-b16f-7371a847f3ce-169429850-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329761905_1792894340-Time1717524334506.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"373a32","textColor2":"15190d","textColor4":"3f4135","textColor1":"0b0f09","bgColor":"e8e3d5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/d3/7a/7dd37afe-3457-5af8-d2f6-bbf1fb311c7f/8b265b62-8fa6-450c-bb9c-70fb122a9fbb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"302d2a","textColor2":"0e0c0a","textColor4":"312f2d","textColor1":"0c0908","bgColor":"bfbdb6","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/griff/1472442704","name":"Vertigo","artistName":"Griff","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/64/5b/01/645b016d-b1d7-e1a5-a0e4-7e1ce6725df6/5021732285546.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"35362d","textColor2":"0e120a","textColor4":"3a3c32","textColor1":"080b03","bgColor":"e9e3d5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When Griff was writing her debut album, she went alone to a variety of homes and Airbnbs to get it done. That’s how the UK singer, songwriter, and producer (real name Sarah Griffiths) found herself in Imogen Heap’s old home, now a residential studio, piecing together song ideas. The house was round, and in the middle was a staircase. During a FaceTime call with friend and collaborator Congee, they both noted how the stairs might give you vertigo. But the album’s title has a more layered meaning, too. “It’s this idea of vertigo in an emotional sense,” Griff tells Apple Music. “All of these songs are written from a place of autobiographical, emotional vertigo. The physical condition of vertigo is the idea of dizziness and a loss of balance and the world spinning and not really being able to grapple and find your feet in all of that.”\n\n<i>Vertigo</i> arrives three years after Griff won the prestigious Rising Star award at the 2021 BRITs, having started as a teenager teaching herself production via YouTube. A lot has changed since then, but much of this record’s DNA is still in that DIY place. “The genesis of almost all these ideas has been me by myself making beats and lyrics,” she says. (She also worked closely with her core team of Congee, Lost Boy, and Siba, who she says are “like brothers” to her.) The result is a debut record about losing parts of yourself to time and hurt, and wondering if you’ll ever get them back—and a collection offering a vast array of feelings and energy. Here, her big, unfaltering voice is met with synth, piano, and guitar, all drenched in both euphoria and melancholy. “I love how in pop you can have such a spectrum of feeling,” says Griff. “That’s really the goal for me with this album—that people are moved, whether it’s that they want to dance and scream it out and it’s super cathartic, or they hear all the notes of loneliness and sadness in there. I wanted to explore the most extreme emotions.” Here, Griff dives into her debut, one track at a time.\n\n<b>“Vertigo”</b>\n“The song’s really simple at its core. Congee and I wrote it all over one note, so it doesn’t really change. It was only later that we started putting in chords and the bridge to make it feel like it’s building. We created that climax journey where all the synths are getting more and more layered, and that was very much to create that vertigo feeling. I really love the production, and I love that the drums and the rhythm are very hip-hop-inspired, even though it’s such a pop tune. Even the BPM of it, I think we were very much inspired by old James Blake beats and <i>808s & Heartbreak</i> and that world. It’s fun to disguise those kinds of rhythms and grooves in a pop melody.”\n\n<b>“Miss Me Too”</b>\n“I wanted to write a song about the idea of missing an older version of yourself for a while. There was a version of yourself that used to exist that wasn’t so heartbroken, it wasn’t so cynical about love and people, and it had this trust in the world that you feel like you’ve lost. I wrote this with Lost Boy and Siba—Lost Boy came in with the more pop, almost dance-y piano chords. And it just felt right that it would be super euphoric. I like the sense that it’s not really a love song; it’s more a conversation with yourself and about trying to get yourself back.”\n\n<b>“Into the Walls”</b>\n“This is one of the first songs I wrote on this album. Again, I love that it’s not really a love song. It’s basically about being at such a low, numb point in yourself that you look at the walls around you and you’re almost jealous of their existence because at least they’re strong and they can hold something up and can watch the world go by. And that’s almost more than you can say for yourself. It’s a bit of a stream of consciousness. It’s all pretty true to the first time I improvised it. ‘Today, I really, really don’t think I can do this’ is the essence of the song. And it’s that fantasy, it might be nice to disappear and to not be in my body for a second. It’s quite an innocent metaphor, but also very heart-wrenching.”\n\n<b>“19th Hour”</b>\n“This is probably the one I mainly produced for myself. It’s about how hurtful the words ‘I love you’ can be when it’s not said because someone means it, but almost as a last resort, or just as a way to cover up all of the issues. And it’s about being almost too optimistic. I feel like in a lot of our lives, we can be pessimists with everything, but actually when it comes to that one person, for some reason you’re an optimist, hoping they’ll change, hoping they’ll stick around, hoping it’ll turn a corner. It’s sitting in that place of knowing maybe things aren’t right but wanting them to be. The production really sums up the album to me, because it starts off in a super melancholic way, but it builds into such euphoric big drums and those big stabs.”\n\n<b>“Astronaut”</b>\n“I was alone in a house, sitting at the piano. I started with the chorus lyric: ‘You said that you needed space/Go on then, astronaut.’ It’s got this tongue-in-cheek style. That line kind of came out of nowhere, and then made sense to what I was trying to write. It’s almost dealing with rejection by going like, ‘Go on then. But it really hurts. But go on then.’ Everyone’s got this weird mindset with dating where there’s a million fish in the sea, and everyone’s constantly thinking the grass is greener, and there’s more out there. I wrote it originally on piano, and then for some reason shied away from that and produced it up into something that was a lot more synthy and almost spacey. I’m so glad that with Chris [Martin], we ended up stepping it back and putting it on piano again, because I think the lyric deserves that. It was surreal having Chris on it [Martin plays piano on the track]. And very special.”\n\n<b>“Anything”</b>\n“It’s almost a song of trying to figure out, ‘Do you realize the hold you have on me? And if you do, that makes this even more dark, and I’m letting you know I would’ve done anything you wanted.’ That’s why that lyric is screamed. It’s like you’re almost trying to get through to this person. It’s from a young female perspective. Often you get into relationships where there is a power imbalance, especially if it’s a first real love or a first real feeling of attachment to someone. Again, the production’s super upbeat and super cathartic and epic, and I love how dramatic the lyrics are in the chorus. The bridge is more in hindsight: It’s that feeling of how, at the end of something, often it’s your confidence that’s been completely ripped from you.”\n\n<b>“Pillow in My Arms”</b> \n“It’s the most reminiscent of some of my earlier stuff, because this one really was just me on production. It’s about loneliness and the idea that at the end of everything, once you’ve lost everything or everyone, maybe your pillow is your only companion. It almost reminds me of Miss Havisham in <i>Great Expectations</i>, where she’s still in her wedding dress. You’re going through this denial and insanity, talking to this pillow as if it’s a human. And the production has that groove, and it’s really simple. It’s that one riff at the beginning that grows and grows throughout the song.”\n\n<b>“Cycles”</b> \n“I went on a writing camp with Congee, and we were put in a room with these amazing songwriters, Vera [Carlbom] and Minna [Koivisto]. Minna’s DNA is more in the dance world, so the original track was a lot more dance-y. By that point, I was aware the album was about vertigo and spinning, so it felt really natural to write these lyrics. It’s about how there’s not a linear chronology to heartbreak—you think you’re done, then you’re not, and it’s an endless cycle, and you’re exhausted, but at this point you’re just dancing in it. I got back to London and asked if Mura Masa would be down to reproduce it. We’ve worked together a little bit before. I’m a really big fan of his sound. He was an influence when I started out producing myself. So, it was a dream come true, and you can really hear his sonic stamp on it.”\n\n<b>“Tears for Fun”</b>\n“One of the really euphoric ones. I wanted to sing it with a big audience. I guess the concept is a question between yourself or God or something where you’re like, ‘Will I always be collecting tears for fun?’ It feels like, at this point, that’s what I’m doing. The chorus makes me feel really moved and like I want to yell it. I definitely think there is a second layer when you are a writer or a creative where you’re like, ‘Am I getting myself into these situations for the story of it?’ It’s all of those questions. I was listening to a lot of ’80s music, like Yazoo’s ‘Only You.’ I wanted to inject a bit of that into this song.”\n\n<b>“Hiding Alone”</b> \n“The song’s about that one person almost being your force field to the world. That one relationship or friendship that, when you’re with them, it’s almost like the rest of the world can disappear for a second, and that safety has been your bedrock. And as soon as that disappears, you’re like, ‘Whoa, who am I? What am I?’ I like it because it’s one of the only guitar songs in the album, but it just felt right.”\n\n<b>“Hole in My Pocket”</b>\n“In this album, there are a lot of metaphors and visual analogies about the idea of loneliness. On this, it’s feeling like you’ve got a hole in your pocket because you can’t explain why you’re in this place, losing things. There are romantic undertones to all of the songs, but a lot of them aren’t particularly romantic for me. At this stage in life, a lot of relationships are shifting, and with the nature of my life—going from COVID to touring to moving out of home, living by myself—so much about the relationships in my life is shifting. You’re entering adulthood and reflecting on what relationships matter and what relationships weren’t right.”\n\n<b>“Everlasting”</b> \n“I want to believe in the everlasting in that I want to believe that love can last and be good. But often, everyone carries a little bit of generational baggage into their relationships. And I especially think that’s real when you come from different ethnic backgrounds but grow up in the UK; you have a different idea of what relationships look like. I’ve always really been aware of my upbringing not being the tidy, neat picture of what often we see. I was always so aware because, culturally, I’ve got a Jamaican dad and Chinese mom. My whole upbringing was hectic in so many layers, in so many different ways. You’re confronted with it at different stages in your life. And in school, you’re confronted with it on maybe a beauty-standard level. But as you grow older, it dribbles into your relationships and everything. It’s a complex thing that will keep unraveling.”\n\n<b>“So Fast”</b>\n“With the journey of the album, it’s like we’ve built up to this bit and then it’s almost calm, simmering down, with lots of reflective songs at this point. It’s essentially a folk song, and again, it’s nearly a love song but not quite—it’s still from a point of loneliness. It’s about the end of the night or a party or whatever, and you’re having this moment with someone, and you’re like, ‘Actually I don’t want you to go so fast because I’m really lonely.’ But it’s almost like you’re too lonely and polite to say that outright. So, you’re like, ‘You don’t have to go right now if you don’t want to.’ It’s from someone who’s quite broken and doesn’t really want to put themselves out there. But it’s like, ‘I could watch everyone else disappear, but if you could stay here for a moment, that’d be really nice.’”\n\n<b>“Where Did You Go”</b>\n“I wrote this around the same time as ‘Into the Walls,’ so you can see where my head was at. I guess it’s a less conventional pop song. It felt right to keep it on vocoder and sprinkle around elements of synth. The story is basically about someone going missing in your life, and it splits into two halves. The first is like, ‘Where did you go? I’ve been looking everywhere,’ and then the second half is the person that’s gone missing going, ‘Sorry, but I’m leaving.’ For me, it was written about the idea of fleeing the nest and the guilt of that—a conversation between a parent and a child. But I’ve left it open—you could also hear it in a relationship sense. It’s the question of the album. I’m asking it about myself: ‘Where did I go?’”","short":"“I wanted to explore the most extreme emotions”: Griff on her dizzying debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/vertigo/1743775840","playParams":{"id":"1743775840","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3VA9PnquCzG4E2GHgBzFQE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1743775840/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1472442704","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1472442704?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720793094887,"RTCI":0}}},"1745010735":{"id":"1745010735","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745010735?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c1/74/4b/c1744b42-56cd-b150-8511-60b4a114b175/694d561d-298c-417b-af54-5148c46d1d9c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6ae98","textColor2":"f3caa6","textColor4":"c6a588","textColor1":"f3d6ba","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/58/19/78/58197859-7337-e652-fc2d-65e10faa0657/bbf5cf3b-386c-4392-a335-f1bc349f399d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2e2d2a","textColor2":"141413","textColor4":"302f2c","textColor1":"121110","bgColor":"a19d92","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/26/7a/5b/267a5b8a-aeb9-573b-d8c2-bfe1e935ee7e/2c5c3044-7676-4684-8ead-6df4a066baef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2c27","textColor2":"0b0a09","textColor4":"2f2d29","textColor1":"0a0907","bgColor":"c2bba9","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hardy/1438874739","name":"Quit!!","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"HARDY","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/f0/93/39f0930a-1e21-1294-aefc-b2b1ef8603bf/24UMGIM50350.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"36302c","textColor2":"1e1b1a","textColor4":"3a3530","textColor1":"191515","bgColor":"ad9e87","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When HARDY was trying to make it as a songwriter, the country star had a rude interaction that would help define his career. While performing at a writers’ round in Nashville, HARDY found a note in the tip jar that simply read, “Quit!!” He kept the paper and pinned it to the bulletin board in the makeshift studio in his apartment and used the anonymous criticism to motivate him while he wrote and recorded. “Every day I walked by it before I went into my studio, and it just meant the more success I had, [the note], for some reason, was more fuel,” he says. “It's a symbol to never give up, and that you're going to have haters in the world, that the more popular you get, the more haters you get, and it stands for a lot. I wanted to honor that moment in my life, because it was very inspiring.”\n\nHARDY got the last laugh, of course, and named this follow-up to 2023’s <i>the mockingbird & THE CROW</i> after the incident. Appropriately, the record itself is also a bit of a middle finger, as HARDY leans even further into his rock roots alongside producer and longtime collaborator Joey Moi. Highlights include “PSYCHO,” a subversion of the “crazy ex-girlfriend” narrative so prevalent in country music, and “SOUL4SALE,” a surprisingly vulnerable collaboration with Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst. Closer “SIX FEET UNDER (Caleigh’s Song)” is the record’s emotional centerpiece, as HARDY wrote the song for his wife while reflecting on a 2022 bus accident that nearly took his life.","short":"One of Nashville’s biggest players turns trolling into inspiration."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/quit/1745010735","playParams":{"id":"1745010735","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10ieExXfCjbyWeh71Z2u0e"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745010735/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1438874739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1438874739?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720767909618,"RTCI":0}}},"1746516667":{"id":"1746516667","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746516667?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-boring/1198779615","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ba/48/c0/ba48c0bd-1ea8-3196-26e2-cbe1a4efab1a/Job29ebcb8f-54db-47e1-b1dd-72f1fc18a4fd-170093195-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331148390_1805085500-Time1718389261364.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","05f2fa"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0f1d1e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bfd5da","textColor2":"05f2fa","textColor4":"0ad7e1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0f1d1e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/42/0a/18/420a1833-bf05-2e10-98e1-74340a165c8d/2090ea2c-ea4b-4839-98e6-a3b1c8425647.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"63d4d5","textColor2":"74f6f1","textColor4":"63d4d5","textColor1":"74f6f1","bgColor":"204e65","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2c/df/51/2cdf5130-ac41-a62a-4b93-31b7281591a1/Jobf2c31f91-2b56-4575-8f55-cdb730dff054-169923652-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330804674_1802404609-Time1718193255282.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d2e1e4","textColor2":"feece1","textColor4":"d1d2cd","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f6b7d","hasP3":false}},"name":"DJ-Kicks: DJ BORING (DJ Mix)","artistName":"DJ BORING","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","short":"A dynamic mix to take you from chilling at home to the euphoria of the club."},"artwork":{"width":5333,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/b8/7a/68b87ae2-3224-3f53-c46d-a5b051116819/4062548091106.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5333,"textColor3":"ccdee3","textColor2":"04e4e9","textColor4":"04c9d2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"035f74","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dj-kicks-dj-boring-dj-mix/1746516667","playParams":{"id":"1746516667","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746516667/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1198779615","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1198779615?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720757900068,"RTCI":0}}},"1746596219":{"id":"1746596219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746596219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/phish/153159","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9d/08/8f/9d088f71-6d6a-5577-8688-a1d14c8d700c/39ba3ea7-d250-48ef-b356-60cb6f2a0c31.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac9579","textColor2":"c6b5a1","textColor4":"a29484","textColor1":"d3b693","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Evolve","artistName":"Phish","artwork":{"width":3100,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/57/f1/04/57f10423-89ca-8ab7-efc3-bad441c58761/24UMGIM55190.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3100,"textColor3":"28272a","textColor2":"161311","textColor4":"2a2c2d","textColor1":"120d0d","bgColor":"7e909e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evolve/1746596219","playParams":{"id":"1746596219","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2VLYWlPH6lcfJZgl634wSM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746596219/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"153159","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/153159?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720758180385,"RTCI":0}}},"1747516252":{"id":"1747516252","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747516252?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1369501327-1269782417","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Thicc!

But few know John Schuster, the self-described introvert behind the John Summit persona. Summit reconciles the two on his debut album, <i>Comfort in Chaos</i>, revealing that he’s equally capable of showing vulnerability and restraint as he is bashing out dance-floor stompers.\n\n“EAT THE BASS,” whose engulfing low end and relentless drums merit its all-caps title, pulses with the rowdy tech-house energy of hits such as Summit’s 2020 breakout “Deep End.” Though much of the album can similarly be slotted into DJ sets, it’s more rooted in the soaring melodies and songwriting—“something that really hits your emotions, your soul,” as he once put it on Apple Music’s danceXL Radio show—that have defined his current evolution. Singer HAYLA makes longing euphoric on “Where You Are,” and the aching resolve of “Shiver” (“And I feel it now/Want this forever”) equally applies to love and Summit reflecting on his whirlwind rise. Even as Kaskade collaboration “Resonate” ups the BPM into driving melodic techno, its swirling vocals pierce the shadowy soundscape with their celebration of spiritual connection.\n\n<i>Comfort in Chaos</i> also finds Summit stepping outside of his comfort zone. “Go Back” with Sub Focus is a union of house and drum ’n’ bass that unexpectedly morphs from the former style to the latter, and “Stay With Me” is measured in its breaks-filled approach. Closing track “palm of my hands,” a dreamy, liquid drum ’n’ bass song, isn’t even really made for the dance floor. Still, it best sums up the producer’s expanded outlook on the music he can make: “No shits are given/It’s my life, I’ma live it/I don’t need your permission...Where I end up, only Heaven knows/I’ve got the world in the palm of my hands.”","short":"The new-generation club king’s debut taps into his lesser-known introversion."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e7/21/67/e721675b-c3a3-9338-bf24-9adb295b7e90/24UMGIM58701.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfc4c4","textColor2":"addaee","textColor4":"8db1c1","textColor1":"ecf2f2","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/comfort-in-chaos/1748171781","playParams":{"id":"1748171781","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2pHm3ZP2R3phzCYi7ilGN2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748171781/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1387587503","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1387587503?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720774171557,"RTCI":0}}},"1748179640":{"id":"1748179640","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748179640?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fidlar/425454362","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Surviving the Dream","artistName":"FIDLAR","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a5/33/db/a533db87-0c59-c4a3-f37f-ca2e08b6ab75/193436384834_FINAL.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"becbdd","textColor2":"dfe9e8","textColor4":"bcc8d4","textColor1":"e1edf3","bgColor":"314685","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/surviving-the-dream/1748179640","playParams":{"id":"1748179640","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748179640/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"425454362","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/425454362?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720781526561,"RTCI":0}}},"1748202608":{"id":"1748202608","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748202608?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=64490-3450395","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/16/a3/1f/16a31f9d-dd1c-4ac8-56ba-8492ce141248/Job3c0f2958-ff00-4e70-909c-50c4949b7952-169604665-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330117078_1796677702-Time1717710796873.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fec126"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2f1709"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cea63d","textColor2":"fec126","textColor4":"d3a020","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2f1709","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/cc/e3/f8/cce3f82d-f256-28d4-1cfe-68574aff3d94/2427c8c6-547b-4a86-b113-af98edd94e59.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4bbb9","textColor2":"dcccc4","textColor4":"bdada3","textColor1":"e5dedf","bgColor":"422e21","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a2/45/c3/a245c319-a4ee-1a94-fad2-a778224838b7/Jobcaf009ec-ff32-4003-ac0f-1f4127ae8c0b-169604666-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330117079_1796677701-Time1717716180034.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffa33c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2f1709"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbd0d3","textColor2":"ffa33c","textColor4":"cc8637","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2f1709","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/10/ce/46/10ce4661-6c81-fd3e-a20b-93df1e8ee82f/138dab19-add3-433e-b538-999990cbd0ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cbae77","textColor2":"f6a358","textColor4":"cc8c51","textColor1":"f5ce87","bgColor":"253035","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/76/82/ad/7682adc5-e798-e7a1-0356-416681d2722a/080bc63e-e749-482e-8bcd-eabf7f7aba6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c5c2","textColor2":"c9cac7","textColor4":"a3a4a1","textColor1":"f2f4f1","bgColor":"0c0b06","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Auditorium, Vol. 1","artistName":"Common & Pete Rock","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Having previously partnered with some of hip-hop’s most iconic producers, not the least of whom being J Dilla, Common built a career on securing superb beats to suit his agile rhymes. While many rappers of his generation hopped from trend to trend, repeat and reliable collaboration proved core to his discography, with several of the same studio figures from his early albums now fixtures in his circle decades later. It’s the native Chicagoan’s characteristic consistency, perhaps, that makes <i>The Auditorium, Vol. 1</i> such a momentous album event. \n\nA hip-hop artist indisputably worthy of the word “legend,” Pete Rock comes to this joint effort with the rare distinction of both defining and embodying Golden Era greatness. Though relatively selective about who he deems dope enough to form a duo with since the C.L. Smooth days, the Bronx-born producer generated goodwill and critical respect for his 2010s efforts opposite his city’s Skyzoo and Smoke DZA. As such, he makes a formidable complement for Common, evident from the jump on the exquisite intro “Dreamin’.” His timeless instrumentals conjure certain nostalgic tendencies from the MC, his verses on “We’re on Our Way” and “This Man” laden with old-school references and lyrical memorabilia. \n\nFrom the jazzy swing of “Everything’s So Grand” to the enlightened gospel groove of “A GOD (There Is),” the pair deliver on the promise of their premise, delivering theatrical thrills befitting their skills. And not that an album of this caliber requires special rapper guests, but Posdnuos of De La Soul is a naturally welcome addition to “When the Sun Shines Again.” Furthermore, Rock lays down some refreshing bars of his own on “All Kind of Ideas,” thus providing Common with a worthy foil on the mic as well as off and increasing anticipation for a presumed second volume.","short":"Midwest and

As the LP unfolds, the group touches on adult contemporary, soft rock, and soul-adjacent sounds, with highlights including the searching “Great Is,” featuring Jenna Barrientes on lead vocals, and the image-heavy title track, led by Hudson and Chris Brown.","short":"Another collaborative live project from the CCM collective."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-wind-meets-fire/1750583027","playParams":{"id":"1750583027","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2uwzangKgtBdy6Q1rPYqC0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750583027/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"287874918","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/287874918?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720760401506,"RTCI":0}}},"1750770734":{"id":"1750770734","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750770734?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/toe/120959326","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Now I See the Light","artistName":"toe","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6e/71/7c/6e717ce8-58e4-a968-573f-8b42f9b4ca32/103447.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"25282d","textColor2":"161821","textColor4":"32353f","textColor1":"05070a","bgColor":"a6acb8","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/now-i-see-the-light/1750770734","playParams":{"id":"1750770734","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0QQ0WLIvOiZd8jiUUSvUWc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750770734/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"120959326","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/120959326?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720766591349,"RTCI":0}}},"1751271673":{"id":"1751271673","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751271673?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/baba-stiltz/426338387","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Stockholm Remixes -

The concept-driven boy group known for their romantic vampire lore tends to go all in on their depictions of love, and this nine-track album is no different. “Moonstruck” “really sets the tone for <i>ROMANCE : UNTOLD</i> as a whole,” ENHYPEN <i>maknae</i> Ni-ki tells Apple Music. B-sides “Hundred Broken Hearts” and “Highway 1009” have the members—Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki—contributing to songwriting, signaling a behind-the-scenes shift for the Korean pop juggernauts. Find out more about the themes and sonic influences of the album directly from ENHYPEN below.\n\n<b>“Moonstruck”</b>\nNi-ki: “The title expresses a state of being deeply in love, where there’s a sense of ‘the two of us, spellbound by the moon’s allure—we’re perfect under the moonlight.’ It really sets the tone for <i>ROMANCE : UNTOLD</i> as a whole, with the theme of an enchanting moonlight date for just the two of us, as we stand ready to overcome any obstacles. The chorus brings together flowing melodies, a dreamy vibe, and our stronger-than-ever vocals.”\n\n<b>“XO (Only If You Say Yes)”</b>\nJungwon: “This is a romantic take on what being in love feels like: You would do anything for someone, as long as they say yes. It’s got catchy vocal melodies and an infectious synth riff. Hope you all enjoy it!”\n\n<b>“Your Eyes Only”</b>\nSunghoon: “This is a soft synth-pop track about a love that’s kept secret between just the two of us. It has a smooth, mellow, medium tempo and a rhythmical melody that’s sure to lift your mood.”\n\n<b>“Hundred Broken Hearts”</b>\nJungwon: “This is a track in the alternative R&B genre. It’s where you’re telling someone you’ll never let things end on a tragic note, and that you’ll never let their heart be broken into hundreds of pieces. It has a unique feel to it—I’m sure you’ll notice that on the first listen.”\n\n<b>“Brought the Heat Back”</b>\nJay: “This is a funk/dance-pop tune, sung in the voice of a boy who’s trying to play it cool in front of someone he loves, even as he’s wracked by jealousy for the first time. Cirkut, who did ‘Bite Me’ with us, returns here as producer. This is an exciting track that combines flashy melodies with a bold progression.”\n\n<b>“Paranormal”</b>\nJake: “This is a rock/drum ’n’ bass track that tells of how lovers feel like their relationship is extraordinary—and how it makes them feel like they could do anything. The song is filled with a youthful energy, and it’s got a catchy melody that’s easy to sing along to. We’re looking forward to singing this one live.”\n\n<b>“Royalty”</b>\nSunoo: “This track is a modern pop song, sung in the voice of a youth, about how he’s ready to worship, even pledge loyalty to, someone as if she were a queen. On top of the dynamic, hook-laden melodies that build up as the song progresses, the track also showcases our sleek and sexy feel. I’m recommending this track to everyone at ENGENE.”\n\n<b>“Highway 1009”</b>\nHeeseung: “In this medium pop track, we sing about how the path ahead will be like a highway that stretches out straight ahead of us—as long as we stick together no matter what. Since this is our first fan song, every member in the group contributed lyrics with heartfelt thanks to ENGENE. I also participated in the track’s production.”\n\n<b>“XO (Only If You Say Yes) (English Ver.)” (feat. JVKE)</b>\nHeeseung: “This is the English-language version of ‘XO (Only If You Say Yes).’ It’s a pop song that follows a relatable love story. JVKE, who produced the original track, contributes vocals on this version—I think that really adds to the track’s sound.”","short":"The K-pop group’s second full-length takes a high-concept look at

Album","standard":"Florida rapper $NOT is a restless experimenter, constantly looking for new ways to rap and new sounds to rap over. On his 2024 album <i>Viceroy</i>, he tells stories of cop chases and smoking more weed than his opps but obfuscates these stories with coded metaphors and unpredictable flows. The follow-up to 2022’s <i>Ethereal</i>, <i>Viceroy</i> finds $NOT building his own universe because nowhere on Earth feels quite like home. Take “CRUEL WORLD,” which features little more than skittering percussion and a barely-there melody that floats beneath the surface. $NOT gives his vocals tons of layers, such that it sounds like it’s coming from multiple directions. It’s both eerie and intoxicating. On “BULLY,” $NOT expands his style into the world of plugg, showing how he can incorporate different rap subgenres into his highly personalized flow. Even when he’s rapping over something like the hyper-specific synths of plugg, he approaches it unlike anyone else in the game.","short":"The unpredictable Florida MC finds new ways to rap and new

Album","standard":"Whether as Marshall Mathers or Slim Shady, Eminem never fails to make a strong impression. His discography regularly documents a struggle between the Detroit-bred rap superstar’s two outspoken personas, an artistic battle followed closely by his most ardent and attentive fans, while pitchfork-wielding outsiders and his more casual listeners never bothered to discern the difference. The willfully profane Slim and the comparatively less sacrilegious Marshall compose a dramaturgical dyad that makes each of his album releases feel like blockbusters. That said, the stakes feel dramatically high on <i>The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce)</i>, its title the most thematically loaded of his two-and-a-half-decade career.\n\nIf this does end up the genuine final curtain call for Eminem’s most notorious alter ego, he makes it a point to execute it on his own controversy-baiting terms, whether people like it or not. Addressing his detractors head-on, “Habits” defensively dismantles criticisms both internal and external, taking personal inventory while decrying political correctness. Cancel culture and wokeness as existential threats stay front of mind throughout, looming particularly large over the combative “Antichrist” and the Dr. Dre co-produced “Lucifer.” Repeated references to Caitlyn Jenner won’t quell the perpetual homophobia accusations Eminem has long faced, but on songs like “Evil” and “Road Rage” he at least aims to clarify his positions amid his characteristically clever wordplay.\n\nNaturally, Slim isn’t about to go out quietly. Ever the eager pugilist, he exploits his upper hand with Fight Club panache on “Brand New Dance” and “Trouble.” The character’s antagonism vacillates between self-destructive outbursts and strategic gaslighting, gleefully poking at touchy topics on “Houdini” and assigning we’re-in-this-together complicity to Marshall on the surprise sequel “Guilty Conscience 2.” Yet even as the tragicomically intertwined foes grapple with one another, the album still makes room for something as personal as “Temporary,” a heartfelt message to his daughter for after he’s gone.

Nearly twice as long as its 2023 predecessor, <i>TODO ESTÁ BIEN</i> sees the young Puerto Rican artist furthering the trajectory of his KAROL G-assisted breakout “Un Viaje” from some two years prior towards fresh new sounds. Not entirely unlike his labelmate Bad Bunny, he crosses between genres freely and eagerly for this 15-song summer-centric set. “Mi LV” throws it back to sandungueos past, while “KiNoHi” and the salacious “SuRFeRiTa” stay mainly in a more modern reggaetón mode. The underlying rhythms get less conventional yet remain reliably club-ready on “BaMBoO BeACh” and “CoNMiGo Te SaLeN CuErNos,” the beats accenting his corresponding lyrics’ romantic provocations. Towards the album’s end, the pop-rock pivot of “No Se CoRReR Sk8” and “Tu AMiGO FieL” presents yet another facet of his sonic repertoire, finishing with the breezy, reggae-fied send-off “El VeRaNo Se ACaBó.”","short":"The Puerto Rican rising star showcases his diverse sonic repertoire."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/todo-est%C3%A1-bien/1755254081","playParams":{"id":"1755254081","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2cIPrJj2wJupzUf2QGqAYN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755254081/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1542904404","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1542904404?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720765750539,"RTCI":0}}},"1755257113":{"id":"1755257113","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755257113?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chenayder/1613213421","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/56/2f/76/562f76ae-d464-ed3b-b7f1-004e4de86718/d3f660b4-a4f5-4079-b206-4d817f2df70d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1c1d1e","textColor2":"060200","textColor4":"1c1d1d","textColor1":"050201","bgColor":"778895","hasP3":false}},"name":"Maybe In Another Life","artistName":"Chenayder","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4148,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c6/5f/49/c65f49cc-a163-f021-055d-e85e8bfb7ade/196872259971.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4148,"textColor3":"353434","textColor2":"2b2522","textColor4":"4f4b49","textColor1":"0b0908","bgColor":"e0e1e6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/maybe-in-another-life/1755257113","playParams":{"id":"1755257113","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/06eUuvfojvijkzWKr8uxLL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755257113/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1613213421","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1613213421?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720796035280,"RTCI":0}}},"1755345446":{"id":"1755345446","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755345446?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dreamcatcher/1194912387","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"[VirtuouS] - EP","artistName":"Dreamcatcher","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/a9/be/caa9be00-bfe1-2396-ec4f-d9972915d8b5/8804775332708.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"404c5b","textColor2":"242839","textColor4":"4d515f","textColor1":"142234","bgColor":"eff4fa","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/virtuous-ep/1755345446","playParams":{"id":"1755345446","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755345446/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1194912387","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1194912387?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720674686026,"RTCI":0}}},"1755408609":{"id":"1755408609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755408609?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rema/1304716885","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/88/02/d3/8802d380-2364-bf58-b320-738841a7ec6c/5d5b8238-b7a9-4c23-9431-3d8362cc4a43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"97a8b0","textColor2":"cabbae","textColor4":"a89d93","textColor1":"b5c8d2","bgColor":"1f272a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/65/31/13653179-052b-b6fd-52c2-eaa73d4137df/bd6358e2-087e-447a-8209-8405f0ed6829.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"99a8b0","textColor2":"c9c1be","textColor4":"a6a09f","textColor1":"b9cad2","bgColor":"1b2025","hasP3":false}},"name":"HEIS","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Rema","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Perhaps the biggest compliment one could pay Rema is that he has always had clarity of vision regarding his artistry. Since dubbing himself “the future” right out of the gate in 2019, Rema (born Divine Ikubor) has operated with the assured air of a generational talent. His otherworldly melodies, energetic stage performances, and eerie imagery have inspired a new generation of emerging artists—and made him a beacon for Afropop’s global expansion. A lot has happened in the two years since he released his debut album, <i>Rave & Roses</i>—including standout single “Calm Down,” and its Selena Gomez-assisted remix, launching the singer to the top end of the charts across Europe and in the US.\n\n<i>HEIS</i>, the follow-up to <i>Rave & Roses</i>, arrives with hardly any warning and is packed with more of the freewheeling experimentation that Rema has built his reputation on. The album—11 songs in under 30 minutes—sees Rema step into a new era as he reckons with the thrills of global stardom and the pressures of being at the forefront of Afropop. He’s keen to be respected for his contributions to the culture, defiantly placing himself at the top of Afropop’s taxonomy on the punk-adjacent “HEHEHE.” Over a riotous instrumental on the title track, he makes a case for cross-continental pollination by infusing Swahili into the song proclaiming his musical greatness.\n\nBoth of Nigeria’s 2023 breakout stars join Rema’s metaverse here: Fellow Benin native Shallipopi dials in for a love letter to their hometown on “BENIN BOYS,” while Abuja rapper ODUMODUBLVCK delivers a thumping verse on “WAR MACHINE.” Still, the narrative of <i>HEIS</i> is solely Rema’s as he declares that he’s primed for more success on “MARCH AM” and reels off his accomplishments on the P.Priime-produced “YAYO.” It all feels like the work of a candid creator reminding his listeners that he’s still operating at the cutting edge of Afropop and laying the building blocks for the genre’s future.","short":"The Benin-born superstar embraces his destiny as an Afropop royal."},"artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/43/67/cd/4367cd08-da60-dbd5-783d-edf824fd5710/24UMGIM73107.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"a4885d","textColor2":"df6f49","textColor4":"b25a3a","textColor1":"cda975","bgColor":"000700","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heis/1755408609","playParams":{"id":"1755408609","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2DDaN7Pgx9uDPd8IbWWW9H"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755408609/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1304716885","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1304716885?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1720784341850,"RTCI":0}}},"1755433815":{"id":"1755433815","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1755433815?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/perrie/1729865272","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/6a/66/386a669f-5d31-e751-f58a-4c06410a337e/7bf99194-5068-4524-9dc3-b13f9a63b9cd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"aaa7a9","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"ad9e8f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f6/c0/e6/f6c0e634-b161-8aa2-2f7b-eeaa56ba2357/6220ff35-b087-473b-910d-9df8c701cb1e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"c0bbbc","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"bfa792","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9b/5d/fd/9b5dfd13-ba8b-9ca9-a853-e60583db730f/5355ea13-5c01-437a-af39-d600919fc88f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c2a892","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b4a393","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8c/cf/c7/8ccfc724-a421-a0d4-032d-0224886590dd/608fc570-7622-4cb0-a881-5e768844dcbf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"baa591","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"afa092","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/be/00/78/be0078bb-dfa4-abab-92f2-1eb8430d8f84/90e7c6fe-b727-4ead-9861-46698e09157f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"baaf9f","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b8a58d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f6/74/fa/f674fa3a-4b28-3be3-990d-d1b8930878b0/ea9de014-b018-4ce4-a8ea-e844bca3b23d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"bab4b3","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"ba9a7b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"212121","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6c/88/0b/6c880b55-a818-8532-f518-6302f30dab6e/3fc68a1c-ac54-4158-a668-fa85ddf04508.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a5a5","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b4a494","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false}},"name":"Apple Music Sessions: Perrie -

Leaning into a more physically driven persona—and away from the wounded loverboy themes that characterized Artemas’ earlier works—has resulted in far more kinetic productions, pitch-shifted vocals stretching around the limit-testing rattle of bass and distortion. <i>yustyna</i> is a compelling showcase from an artist and producer reaping the rewards of intense experimental labor.","short":"The
