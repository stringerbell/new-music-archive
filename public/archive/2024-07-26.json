That God","artistName":"Empire of the Sun","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“This album definitely feels like a rebirth,” Empire of the Sun vocalist/guitarist Luke Steele tells Apple Music. It’s an apt description given that the Australian electronic duo—completed by Nick Littlemore—had, for all intents and purposes, quietly called it quits some years earlier. “After the pandemic it was like, everything was abandoned—the Empire is over, it’s finished,” says Steele. “I’m leaving the castle, I don’t care if it becomes overgrown, or bears break in and steal my guitars. I just walked away. That was a great feeling after working together for 20 years to just go, I don’t need it anymore.”\n\nSteele pursued his solo album, 2022’s <i>Listen to the Water</i>, while Littlemore focused on his longstanding dance project PNAU. Somewhere along the way, though, via phone calls and “little breadcrumbs here and there,” the two halves of the duo reconnected. “You just start realizing what was so special about it in the first place and what was so special about your friendship and how you make music, and what it means to the world as well,” says Steele.\n\nThe years apart provided a fresh perspective on their creative goals. “We’re much wiser now. We’ve gone through having the worldwide success and through all that mess of trying to remake what was the hit [‘Walking on a Dream’]. I think all the trials and tribulations and understanding what was happening, how the band was breaking down and getting kind of diffused and distorted before, we’ve gone through that and understand that now. We feel recharged post-pandemic. We’re back.”\n\nThough writing for <i>Ask That God</i> began in 2022, Empire revived some of the songs they’d begun working on following the release of 2016 predecessor <i>Two Vines</i>. Closing tracks “Rhapsodize” and “Friends I Know” reach back to a series of 2017 sessions in Tokyo (“It was going to be this whole techno Tokyo album, which we scrapped”). “Music on the Radio” hails from 2016, while “Revolve” dates back to the <i>Two Vines</i> sessions when they were working with Wendy Melvoin of Prince’s Revolution.\n\nThe end result hues close to the band’s trademark brand of cosmic indie pop, while incorporating elements such as ’80s British synth-pop (“The Feeling You Get”) and disco (“Music on the Radio”). Here, Steele breaks down some of the key tracks on <i>Ask That God</i>, its title a reference to the fact that everyone has a different entity that guides them, spiritual or otherwise.\n\n<b>“Changes”</b>\n“This is a collab with Swedish writers Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir [Madonna, Katy Perry]. It was obvious that this was what was happening with Empire of the Sun after so many moons. We’re literally evolving into a new phase. And it just sounds like an Empire comeback. It’s got to be the first track!”\n\n<b>“Cherry Blossom”</b>\n“I was in Stockholm and we were writing with Fat Max [Gsus, aka Swedish musician Max Grahn], who is one of Max Martin’s writers. The first thing he said to me was, ‘All these damn Christians wanting to get people into Heaven. Why don’t they get Heaven into people?’ It took me back a bit. That’s sort of how the theme of the song came about—it’s about realizing the paradise that lies before our eyes and getting Heaven into people as opposed to spending time trying to get people into Heaven.”\n\n<b>“Music on the Radio”</b>\n“This is just such a hip jam that Nick brought in, and it’s got his quintessential Nick Littlemore cryptic lyricism, which is so cool. It’s kind of like a rave to the underground, and I instantly fell in love with it. I cut the vocal in two days. It’s quite a snappy song.”\n\n<b>“The Feeling You Get”</b>\n“I live in this small fishing town, and I went to an open mic night. Andrew Fagan from [Aotearoa New Zealand band] The Mockers had come in and he was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, and he had a spray bottle filled with water. He’s walking around spraying everyone saying, ‘This is the holy water.’ He got up and performed a few songs. He was just so drunk and would fall over into the amp, but get back up. The next day, I basically wrote ‘The Feeling You Get,’ and it was influenced by that. You don’t know sometimes what you do, why you do things, why you should do something and why you don’t do something, but you do. It’s just the feeling you get.”\n\n<b>“Happy Like You”</b>\n“What a beautiful song. You really value joy after you’ve been through a massive depression. I really value peace now after living in America. When you go through those depressions and you look at someone smiling, your heart just breaks. You’re like, I just want to feel like that without this heavy burden on my shoulders.”\n\n<b>“Revolve”</b>\n“It was when I’d come back to Los Angeles after leaving, and feeling the whole city shake and the ground shake and realizing, ‘I’m not meant to live here anymore.’ It’s quite obvious.”\n\n<b>“Ask That God”</b>\n“One of our best fans on socials would message us on every single post. She went into hospital because she was sick, and then died in hospital. It was a real shock. At the time, we were in the studio writing a song called ‘Eternal.’ But we wrote ‘Ask That God’ pretty much that night.”\n\n<b>“Rhapsodize”</b>\n“We’re always fascinated by the toys of Japan and them sort of [having] a life of their own. The narrator [<i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>’s André Sogliuzzo] is basically telling the robot words and teaching him languages, and then he starts going through the different animals that God’s made, and you slowly hear the robot getting its tongue around them.”\n\n<b>“Friends I Know”</b>\n“‘Friends I Know’ was written from the perspective of sitting in those small Japanese bars late at night. We’ve had that song forever, and I got my son to do that ‘Goodnight, my friend, sweet dreams’ [line at the end].

Here Rite Now (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ghost","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","standard":"As the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, <i>Rite Here Rite Now</i> is the musical portion of a concert film shot over two nights at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum in 2023. Swedish occult-rock titans Ghost deliver a multimedia experience—part concert, part backstage drama. The flick is a hi-def live experience spliced with scenes from frontperson Cardinal Copia’s quest to prolong his tenure as the band’s figurehead and lead vocalist. As the story goes, he’s the only Ghost vocalist to record more than one full-length with the band, and he’s desperate to retain his position. How does it all play out? No spoilers here.\n\nThe soundtrack focuses on material from Ghost’s 2015 album <i>Meliora</i> forward, including the propulsive “Rats,” their Grammy-winning single “Cirice,” their cover of the late Texas troubadour Roky Erickson’s “If You Have Ghosts,” and the sing-along crowd favorite “Spillways” from their 2022 album <i>Impera</i>.\n\nIn true live-album fashion, much of Copia’s onstage banter is here, including his nod to heavy metal heroes Iron Maiden when he asks the crowd to scream during “Absolution.” Through it all, Copia and masked cohorts the Nameless Ghouls deliver a bravura performance steeped in stylish theater, liturgical melodies, and faux-Satanic revelry. <i>Rite Here Rite Now</i> also features the new studio track “The Future Is a Foreign Land,” which conjures the psych-rock guitars and ’60s bounce of Ghost hits “Mary on a Cross” and “Kiss the Go-Goat,” live versions of which are also on the soundtrack.","short":"The appropriately theatrical soundtrack to the

Early on in its creation, as brothers Louis and Oli Leimbach were writing on their farm in the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, there were thoughts of it being a country album. “It just had some of that farm aesthetic and twang,” Oli tells Apple Music. “But then, months on, [we started] writing these ’80s tunes like ‘Love Is Off the Table’ or ‘Cold Treatment,’” adds Louis.\n\nThere was also talk of calling the album <i>À la carte</i> which, says Louis, would have involved setting it out like “your entrées, your mains, and the desserts. But there were a lot of references to food, and I don’t know if that was a strong enough idea for an album.”\n\nEventually, they settled on <i>Enough of the Sweet Talk</i>, a record which loosely explores the timeline of a relationship, from its naive, giddy early days through to its eventual collapse. Though stopping short of calling it a concept album, the brothers draw on their separate romantic experiences and present them in a way that feels like a single relationship.\n\nA more rock and guitar-oriented album than 2020’s <i>14 Steps to a Better You</i>—also a record with a loose concept, based around being a self-help guide—<i>Enough of the Sweet Talk</i> features four spoken word interludes (“cue i,” “cue ii,” “cue iii,” and “cue iv”) which help move the narrative along. Though they sound like excerpts from a classic French film, they’re in fact a recording of a friend talking about their relationship experiences. “We had hours of her talking, and then we just picked apart our favorite moments that worked for the album,” reveals Oli.\n\nHere, Louis and Oli break down the romantic rollercoaster that is <i>Enough of the Sweet Talk</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Pedestal”</b>\nOli: “It’s about kind of idolizing someone from afar and wanting to keep yourself at that distance. If you’re going to get to know each other, everything changes, and it’s not necessarily a good thing. It’s like daydreaming is actually nicer than probably getting to know each other.”\n\n<b>“The Milkman”</b>\nOli: “This one was written up at our farm. You can hear the cows at the end.”\nLouis: “It’s sort of about self-love, in inverted commas. Satisfying one’s own needs.”\nOli: “Again, there is this idolizing side—we just wanted to paint the picture of the ultimate person. These first few songs are the naive and young, dumb love perspective.” \n\n<b>“Facts of Life”</b>\nLouis: “It’s looking back on growing up in Avalon and your first loves. You’d just drive around to pass the time and have a great time together without having to do too much.”\nOli: “We’re two years apart but would have had very similar experiences in a way, growing up on the northern beaches [of Sydney], getting introduced to alcohol and sex and getting your license and that sort of thing.”\n\n<b>“Enough of the Sweet Talk”</b>\nOli: “Written at our farm. The groove feels like you want to line dance to it, so the pedal steel just seemed to work really well. It feels like you want to be spitting in a bucket after you sing the chorus. The main line in this song is ‘my meaning of life’: ‘I don’t want to give up my meaning of life, whatever that means.’ Maybe that should have been the title of this song, but it just felt a bit cliché. ‘Enough of the Sweet Talk’ seemed to wrap up this relationship, really; just tell the story.” \n\n<b>“Happiness Season”</b>\nOli: “It’s kind of like regurgitating this experience to someone—that’s how I see it in my head anyway. I see you kind of telling someone about this whole relationship, and just brain-spewing this whole thing in this selfish way. Then suddenly, at some point realizing that that’s all bullshit and in your head, and the person who you’re talking to is the person that you actually admire and love all along. Like, who you love is right in front of you.”\n\n<b>“Colin”</b>\nOli: “That was inspired by Colin [Hay]. We always loved his acoustic stuff. I was watching him live on Instagram, he was showing how to play one of his songs, and I grabbed my guitar. I was playing along to his video, and then I put the phone down when it finished and came up with that riff at the start of the song. I was like, I can’t use that because it’s exactly like a Colin Hay song. So I asked him and he’s like, ‘No, it doesn’t feel like any of my songs.’ So because it started with Colin—but it’s not about Colin—we wanted to end the song with him singing. So we asked if he wanted to sing on it. It’s incredible.”\n\n<b>“When I’m Losing It”</b>\nLouis: “This song is admitting to myself that I struggle with anxiety pretty hard. Then trying to hide that from someone in a relationship. It’s quite a hard thing to do when you’re with somebody. You want to act like a cool, loving person, but underneath you’re this anxious mess. So that was sort of me admitting to the world and myself that that’s something I do.”\n\n<b>“Imposter Syndrome”</b>\nOli: “One of those ones where it’s a bit of a dark message but a joyous song.” \nLouis: “Impostor syndrome has been a constantly growing thing for us. I used to think that as you’re getting more success and recognition your imposter syndrome would disappear. For me, it feels like it’s getting stronger and stronger.” \nOli: “It’s quite funny that ‘Imposter Syndrome’ took ages to get right, because of the imposter syndrome. This point in the album is like, the doubt in this relationship and yourself—I guess it starts with ‘Colin’ and comes through to ‘Imposter Syndrome.’”\n\n<b>“The Big Reveal; Ou L’Hypocrite”</b>\nOli: “It’s quite theatrical. It’s kind of about a drama queen that just likes to bring the drama into their own life. It’s like, you’re not showing me anything. I’m waiting for that big reveal. So this is definitely another turning point in the album for sure.”\n\n<b>“Country Club”</b>\nOli: “The silly songs like this come so easy to us. Especially when it has a bit of a reggae feel.” \nLouis: “We almost write them as a joke to begin with. It’s just like a fun, silly, drunk jam.” \n\n<b>“Cold Treatment”</b>\nOli: “My girlfriend never ever gets angry at me. But, I think it was even the night before [we wrote this], I was like, ‘Why are you upset?’ She just turned her back on me in bed. I was like, ‘Are you just not talking to me?’ It’s a powerful move. Just full-blown cold treatment. So she had her back to me whilst I was jotting down the lyrics.”\n\n<b>“Love Is Off the Table”</b>\nOli: “The oldest song on the album.”\nLouis: “It’s a real post-breakup song, when you are just falling apart. This song would probably be six years old or something, and we’re repurposing it post-breakup with another person.” \n\n<b>“Strangers”</b>\nOli: “I really like the chorus, it feels pretty simple, but in a classic way. The lyric I really love is ‘People fall out of love/But, no, I never thought it’d be us.’ When every relationship is good you don’t think it’s going to end.”","short":"The duo’s third album charts the birth and death of a relationship."},"artwork":{"width":5193,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ee/be/38/eebe3831-0b0f-bbf1-8a1d-0d89c8e4b3bb/TI152567_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5193,"textColor3":"d7caae","textColor2":"f63500","textColor4":"d02f04","textColor1":"fff7d5","bgColor":"391915","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/enough-of-the-sweet-talk/1746419603","playParams":{"id":"1746419603","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Cmagko6o1A7RXCWkauw2B"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746419603/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"417351118","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/417351118?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1721967364552,"RTCI":0}}},"1746991953":{"id":"1746991953","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746991953?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-26","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2d/30/7a/2d307a01-6f2e-3a67-d448-10a96683d3db/Jobaa8f1577-9f39-4b35-9e7c-0fe60e3e2cca-169431616-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329765764_1792932933-Time1717525365986.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d49e79"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2e261c"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bca690","textColor2":"d49e79","textColor4":"b18464","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e261c","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c2/e2/6d/c2e26df4-0254-cdc1-5b54-291323e38cfb/888c7b8f-e407-401f-9e4a-eae72c2710b0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3d3d3f","textColor2":"292118","textColor4":"4b433c","textColor1":"17191c","bgColor":"d3cccb","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/02/db/f5/02dbf5b1-2784-970d-3e15-4e16274a483e/Job8f010437-b676-4d93-a52a-3d1e636d7b74-169431617-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329765765_1792932934-Time1717528393260.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e1c1a2"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2e261c"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bfb2a0","textColor2":"e1c1a2","textColor4":"bea388","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e261c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6a/e7/3b/6ae73b31-5a94-19a7-8830-54c8b86321d1/1d912f73-35a6-48a3-8fab-0466ce70dcf6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d1c5aa","textColor2":"f6d2aa","textColor4":"d4b694","textColor1":"f3e4c6","bgColor":"4b483b","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/09/58/f2/0958f296-6278-0c69-9d33-7ae175291d89/0d0fdd4d-d18e-4c19-af1f-8a871f7153e6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aca495","textColor2":"c9bda4","textColor4":"a19783","textColor1":"d7cdbb","bgColor":"010001","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-red-clay-strays/1483812664","name":"Made by These Moments","artistName":"The Red Clay Strays","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Red Clay Strays are carrying the torch for Southern rock.

Other highlights include the crackling, downtrodden “Drowning,” which guitarist Drew Nix wrote while struggling to make ends meet earlier in the band’s career, and “On My Knees,” a bona fide foot-stomper with major Allman Brothers vibes, slide guitar and all.","short":"The Alabama band carries the torch for Southern rock."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/02/17/78/021778f3-9c1f-e211-30b6-854109b992ae/196871996808.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9997f","textColor2":"cfa98c","textColor4":"ac8d73","textColor1":"dfb99b","bgColor":"221c0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/made-by-these-moments/1746991953","playParams":{"id":"1746991953","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0UQr4EfIUbii2ufru3mnKe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1746991953/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1483812664","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1483812664?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1721985969587,"RTCI":0}}},"1747917255":{"id":"1747917255","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1747917255?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Opera","Romantic Era"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-26","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/d9/c7/01d9c7c7-66ff-0df6-899c-e6513369577d/206e767f-1263-4025-8ff8-c5527e476da8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e4c1c2","textColor2":"f2cac8","textColor4":"dfa2a1","textColor1":"f9f2f2","bgColor":"910001","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1532250137-672409-528652801","name":"Aigul","artistName":"Aigul Akhmetshina, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra & Daniele Rustioni","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Aigul Akhmetshina is a great storyteller. The mezzo-soprano’s gift registers whenever she sings. It’s equally clear when she recalls her upbringing in a remote village in the Republic of Bashkortostan and her all-too-rare journey from impoverished teenager to star of the world’s leading opera stages. \n\nAigul’s eponymous debut album is built around her landmark roles, famous arias starting with Bizet’s Carmen, then Massenet’s Charlotte, Bellini’s Romeo, and Rossini’s Cenerentola and Rosina. <i>Aigul</i> closes with <i>Nightingale</i>, an enchanting slice of Bashkort folk heritage. “My grandma used to sing it to me,” she tells Apple Music Classical. “It was one of her favorite songs. It needs freedom. Which leads us to Carmen. Carmen needs freedom!”\n\nPropelled by native talent, hard work, and good fortune, the 19-year-old became the youngest ever member of the coveted Jette Parker Young Artists Programme at London’s Royal Opera House. By spring 2024, just eight years later, she had set the record as the youngest Carmen to appear at Covent Garden and New York’s Metropolitan Opera, shown deep understanding of the tragic Charlotte in <i>Werther</i>, made her Salzburg Festival debut in Bellini’s <i>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</i>, and confirmed her place among the front rank of Rossini interpreters.\n\n“I believe everyone has their time,” she comments. “It’s never late and never early. Everyone has, in some way, their own destiny. But you cannot predict how a singer’s career will go. It’s like this game of Russian roulette, when you never know if the bullet will get you.” Aigul admits there were times, not so long ago, when the possibility of singing for a living seemed remote.\n\n“I was always singing as a child. It’s just something I couldn’t control. The music was always there. I'm half Tatar, half Bashkort, so I learned our Bashkort folk songs, which need flexibility like bel canto coloratura.” The village choir trainer introduced Aigul to classical singing. “I knew I would go that way when I was 12, even though I’d never sung or even seen opera.” Two years later, she moved to Ufa, Bashkortostan’s capital, and studied singing there with Neilya Yusupova.\n\nAigul’s progress was arrested after she failed the scholarship audition at Moscow’s Gnessin Academy of Music, then lost her voice in a car crash. “When I opened my mouth to sing after the accident, the first note sounded like a wounded animal. It was horrifying! And you understand that all the work you’ve done has gone.” Her teacher helped repair the damage and paid for Aigul to fly to Moscow for the New Opera World Competition. “I cracked the high note in Rossini’s ‘Una voce poco fa.’ But I still got first prize.”\n\nDavid Gowland, artistic director of the Jette Parker program, heard the teenage sensation and invited her to audition. Aigul’s village helped fund her airfare to London. “There were 365 others auditioning, which was absolutely crazy. I’d never stood on an opera stage before and here I was auditioning at Covent Garden.” She made the Jette Parker shortlist, passed a second audition, and was soon on course for stardom. “My life story is very like Cinderella’s!

A genuine breakout talent in her city’s abundant pool of drill artists, Bronx rap phenom Ice Spice earned the blessing of no less than Nicki Minaj after “Munch (Feelin’ U)” went from delightfully viral to utterly ubiquitous. Collabs with the Queen from Queens like “Princess Diana” put the outer-borough upstart in a rarefied space as she amassed other hits including “Gangsta Boo” and the Taylor Swift team-up “Karma.”\n\nRoughly two years after making such a strong first impression, Ice Spice looks to cement her place in the game with <i>Y2K!</i>. Named in honor of her January 1, 2000, birthdate, her debut album may not be materially that much longer than the preceding <i>Like..?</i> EP. Nonetheless, it augments her sonic world in exciting ways while maintaining the brash authenticity that got her to this point. \n\nThough perennial studio partner RIOTUSA remains at the production helm, the beat choices here skew darker and harder than one might expect. The dissonant rhythmic thump of “BB Belt” and menacing synth stabs of “Plenty Sun” soundtrack pointed and pithy verses intended to cut down the competition. Even though a handful of the titles may verge on the scatological, punchlines like “Spent 150 on some carats/That shit cray like them n****s in Paris” keep songs like “Think U the Shit (Fart)” feeling sharp rather than sophomoric. The exclusive guest list here reflects her elite status, wrangling Travis Scott for the victorious “Oh Shhh…” and then Gunna for the badass team-up “Bitch I’m Packin’.”","short":"The Bronx rap phenom

of a Mustard Seed","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Mustard","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Well before “Not Like Us” became a bona fide phenomenon, Mustard amassed a staggering number of hits. Contrasting with the concurrent rise of trap music, his 2010s work as a producer for the likes of Big Sean, Migos, Rihanna, Tinashe, and YG—to name just a few—all but defined the sound of mainstream hip-hop and R&B that decade. Yet his musical contribution to Kendrick Lamar’s beef with Drake sent him soaring back to the top of the charts, essentially making the 2024 release <i>Faith of a Mustard Seed</i> an inevitability. \n\nSome five years after his last album <i>Perfect Ten</i>, Mustard fully reinserts himself into the proverbial conversation with this 14-track effort. Teaming up with old friends and new collaborators alike, his curatorial approach leads to exciting configurations around the album’s various guest features. He spreads that California love with Vince Staples and ScHoolboy Q on “Pressured Up” and gives Atlanta its props with Young Thug and transplanted resident Lil Durk on “Ghetto.” Elsewhere, he acts against regionality. “Up Now” unites Lil Yachty, BlueBucksClan, and 42 Dugg for an all-American flex, while the sentimental “A Song for Mom” adds Masego's island vibes to the mix with Ty Dolla $ign and the legendary Charlie Wilson.\n\nA few artists get solo showcases, namely Kodak Black on the booming “Yak’s Prayer” and Travis Scott on the shimmering “Parking Lot.” A frequent studio partner, Roddy Ricch, heads up the sinuous “Truth Is” and duets with Ella Mai for the revelatory “One Bad Decision.” And while gospel fixture Kirk Franklin delivers the opening prayer on “Show Me the Way,” it’s Mustard himself who closes with gratitude and grace on the poetic speech “Pray for Me.”","short":"The “Not Like Us” producer returns with old friends and new ones

NO TE ENAMORES","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fuerza Regida","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"After 2023’s <i>Pa las Baby’s y Belikeada</i> proved all but indomitable on the charts, the last thing Fuerza Regida leader Jesús Ortiz Paz (aka JOP) wanted to do was make the same album again. “It got me really thinking, really creative,” he tells Apple Music. “We went to a different country, created different music, and this is what we got.” Fueled by the extraordinary success of their Marshmello team-up “HARLEY QUINN” and further inspired by Drake’s ambitiously divergent <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i>, the group headed in a new direction creatively and set up a writing camp to make it happen. The end result of their electronic experiments, <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i> makes for one of most unique albums not just in the band’s catalog to date, but also in música mexicana history.\n\nBoasting collaborations with dance music heavy hitters AFROJACK and Major Lazer, as well as appearances by Colombian superstar Maluma and Mexico City’s own Bellakath, the 15-track effort merges EDM and other club-centric styles with the group’s signature sound. Disparate genres like drill and Jersey club somehow make sense in this hybrid context, evidenced on “FREESTYLE” and “BELLA.” While fans adjust to this new approach, “JESUS” and the title track largely stick to the familiar format that made the group the veritable juggernaut it is today. “It’s risky, something new, but we still have all our essence and all our lingo,” JOP says. “You’re hearing Fuerza Regida still.” Read on to learn about some of his favorite songs from <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i>—in his own words.\n\n<b>“TUQLO”</b>\n“The vibe is, two years ago we started writing more about females and girls. One of my boys that was looking at the charts, he’s like, ‘Hey, all the songs on the Top 10 are about a girl.’ I was like, ‘What have we been doing all this fucking time?’ So, that’s what we started doing. Now everyone’s writing about a female, right? But in those times, no one was really paying attention in our genre. Reggaetón, they knew what’s up. We sat down and we just mastered it. We know how to talk about it. We got a little bit of rizz, so we just rizzed up the song and that’s it.”\n\n<b>“NEL”</b>\n“We were at the camp right there, and we were making so much music. Armenta, one of my main writers, he showed me the song. I was so fried, I was like, ‘Let’s leave it there; I can’t choose right now.’ Then I just recorded that shit, and we loved it. A lot of people fuck with that song.”\n\n<b>“VALERIA”</b>\n“I wrote it with Armenta and Jorge [Jiménez Sanchez]. Then we left it up to Gordo—the producer Carnage, now Gordo. He came in and killed it, dog. I just gave him my vocal with the guitar. I knew that he knew the songs that I wanted to do. He knows the genre, so he was going to make it sound good.”\n\n<b>“SECRETO VICTORIA”</b>\n“It’s kind of like ‘HARLEY QUINN’; we put the actual Jersey club 808s in there. With this song, we didn’t put no tololoche, no actual instrument base. We left it up to the 808s. We added the rest—the requinto, trombone, the charchetas. We’re calling it ‘Jersey corridos,’ That’s the new shit we’re doing.”\n\n<b>“FRESITA”</b>\n“That was the last song we made. I had all these writers making music, and then some of my boys, just my homies that were with me on the trip, they went to a room, and they put on an instrumental. I went in there and I heard it and I’m like, ‘Damn!’ I laid some bars, too. One of my managers was like, ‘Bellakath has to be on your album.’ We had the song for her.”","short":"JOP and crew reimagine música mexicana: “It’s risky, something
