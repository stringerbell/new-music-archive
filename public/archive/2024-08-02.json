Album","standard":"49 Winchester channels its rural Appalachian roots on <i>Leavin’ This Holler</i>, the follow-up to the band’s 2022 label debut, <i>Fortune Favors the Bold</i>. The small-town Virginia-bred six-piece recorded the album during a particularly arduous stretch of touring, grabbing pockets of time on off days in various cities to pop into a studio and lay down tracks. You can hear that gritty, live energy across the LP, which the band produced with the help of Stewart Myers (Gomez, Jason Mraz). Standout tracks include “Yearnin’ for You,” a vulnerable account of missing loved ones while out on the road, and the record’s title track, which features an appearance from singer-songwriter Maggie Antone. Another highlight is “Fast Asleep,” which singer/guitarist Isaac Gibson wrote when he was 19 and the band was in its infancy. The song seamlessly fits within the broader record as a testament to their creative development.","short":"The small-town Virginia band channels its Appalachian

Album and Interview","standard":"“This album definitely feels like a rebirth,” Empire of the Sun vocalist/guitarist Luke Steele tells Apple Music. It’s an apt description given that the Australian electronic duo—completed by Nick Littlemore—had, for all intents and purposes, quietly called it quits some years earlier. “After the pandemic it was like, everything was abandoned—the Empire is over, it’s finished,” says Steele. “I’m leaving the castle, I don’t care if it becomes overgrown, or bears break in and steal my guitars. I just walked away. That was a great feeling after working together for 20 years to just go, I don’t need it anymore.”\n\nSteele pursued his solo album, 2022’s <i>Listen to the Water</i>, while Littlemore focused on his longstanding dance project PNAU. Somewhere along the way, though, via phone calls and “little breadcrumbs here and there,” the two halves of the duo reconnected. “You just start realizing what was so special about it in the first place and what was so special about your friendship and how you make music, and what it means to the world as well,” says Steele.\n\nThe years apart provided a fresh perspective on their creative goals. “We’re much wiser now. We’ve gone through having the worldwide success and through all that mess of trying to remake what was the hit [‘Walking on a Dream’]. I think all the trials and tribulations and understanding what was happening, how the band was breaking down and getting kind of diffused and distorted before, we’ve gone through that and understand that now. We feel recharged post-pandemic. We’re back.”\n\nThough writing for <i>Ask That God</i> began in 2022, Empire revived some of the songs they’d begun working on following the release of 2016 predecessor <i>Two Vines</i>. Closing tracks “Rhapsodize” and “Friends I Know” reach back to a series of 2017 sessions in Tokyo (“It was going to be this whole techno Tokyo album, which we scrapped”). “Music on the Radio” hails from 2016, while “Revolve” dates back to the <i>Two Vines</i> sessions when they were working with Wendy Melvoin of Prince’s Revolution.\n\nThe end result hues close to the band’s trademark brand of cosmic indie pop, while incorporating elements such as ’80s British synth-pop (“The Feeling You Get”) and disco (“Music on the Radio”). Here, Steele breaks down some of the key tracks on <i>Ask That God</i>, its title a reference to the fact that everyone has a different entity that guides them, spiritual or otherwise.\n\n<b>“Changes”</b>\n“This is a collab with Swedish writers Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir [Madonna, Katy Perry]. It was obvious that this was what was happening with Empire of the Sun after so many moons. We’re literally evolving into a new phase. And it just sounds like an Empire comeback. It’s got to be the first track!”\n\n<b>“Cherry Blossom”</b>\n“I was in Stockholm and we were writing with Fat Max [Gsus, aka Swedish musician Max Grahn], who is one of Max Martin’s writers. The first thing he said to me was, ‘All these damn Christians wanting to get people into Heaven. Why don’t they get Heaven into people?’ It took me back a bit. That’s sort of how the theme of the song came about—it’s about realizing the paradise that lies before our eyes and getting Heaven into people as opposed to spending time trying to get people into Heaven.”\n\n<b>“Music on the Radio”</b>\n“This is just such a hip jam that Nick brought in, and it’s got his quintessential Nick Littlemore cryptic lyricism, which is so cool. It’s kind of like a rave to the underground, and I instantly fell in love with it. I cut the vocal in two days. It’s quite a snappy song.”\n\n<b>“The Feeling You Get”</b>\n“I live in this small fishing town, and I went to an open mic night. Andrew Fagan from [Aotearoa New Zealand band] The Mockers had come in and he was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, and he had a spray bottle filled with water. He’s walking around spraying everyone saying, ‘This is the holy water.’ He got up and performed a few songs. He was just so drunk and would fall over into the amp, but get back up. The next day, I basically wrote ‘The Feeling You Get,’ and it was influenced by that. You don’t know sometimes what you do, why you do things, why you should do something and why you don’t do something, but you do. It’s just the feeling you get.”\n\n<b>“Happy Like You”</b>\n“What a beautiful song. You really value joy after you’ve been through a massive depression. I really value peace now after living in America. When you go through those depressions and you look at someone smiling, your heart just breaks. You’re like, I just want to feel like that without this heavy burden on my shoulders.”\n\n<b>“Revolve”</b>\n“It was when I’d come back to Los Angeles after leaving, and feeling the whole city shake and the ground shake and realizing, ‘I’m not meant to live here anymore.’ It’s quite obvious.”\n\n<b>“Ask That God”</b>\n“One of our best fans on socials would message us on every single post. She went into hospital because she was sick, and then died in hospital. It was a real shock. At the time, we were in the studio writing a song called ‘Eternal.’ But we wrote ‘Ask That God’ pretty much that night.”\n\n<b>“Rhapsodize”</b>\n“We’re always fascinated by the toys of Japan and them sort of [having] a life of their own. The narrator [<i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>’s André Sogliuzzo] is basically telling the robot words and teaching him languages, and then he starts going through the different animals that God’s made, and you slowly hear the robot getting its tongue around them.”\n\n<b>“Friends I Know”</b>\n“‘Friends I Know’ was written from the perspective of sitting in those small Japanese bars late at night. We’ve had that song forever, and I got my son to do that ‘Goodnight, my friend, sweet dreams’ [line at the end]. And it felt like such a beautiful closer, that sentiment, like everyone’s kind of your friend. It touches a little bit on that bent sort of Japanese element that we wanted to bring in with ‘Rhapsodize.’”","short":"Luke Steele: “This album feels like a

Soundtrack","standard":"As the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, <i>Rite Here Rite Now</i> is the musical portion of a concert film shot over two nights at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum in 2023. Swedish occult-rock titans Ghost deliver a multimedia experience—part concert, part backstage drama. The flick is a hi-def live experience spliced with scenes from frontperson Cardinal Copia’s quest to prolong his tenure as the band’s figurehead and lead vocalist. As the story goes, he’s the only Ghost vocalist to record more than one full-length with the band, and he’s desperate to retain his position. How does it all play out? No spoilers here.\n\nThe soundtrack focuses on material from Ghost’s 2015 album <i>Meliora</i> forward, including the propulsive “Rats,” their Grammy-winning single “Cirice,” their cover of the late Texas troubadour Roky Erickson’s “If You Have Ghosts,” and the sing-along crowd favorite “Spillways” from their 2022 album <i>Impera</i>.\n\nIn true live-album fashion, much of Copia’s onstage banter is here, including his nod to heavy metal heroes Iron Maiden when he asks the crowd to scream during “Absolution.” Through it all, Copia and masked cohorts the Nameless Ghouls deliver a bravura performance steeped in stylish theater, liturgical melodies, and faux-Satanic revelry. <i>Rite Here Rite Now</i> also features the new studio track “The Future Is a Foreign Land,” which conjures the psych-rock guitars and ’60s bounce of Ghost hits “Mary on a Cross” and “Kiss the Go-Goat,” live versions of which are also on the soundtrack.","short":"The appropriately theatrical soundtrack to the Swedish metal act’s concert film."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rite-here-rite-now-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1744432897","playParams":{"id":"1744432897","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0EmgzguOzsDNC8yZzxK8Zi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744432897/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"600730426","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/600730426?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722571993923,"RTCI":0}}},"1745181371":{"id":"1745181371","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745181371?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/x/1295432230","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2f/2f/c6/2f2fc65c-d434-8269-cc31-b8a12be0a73f/Joba4754803-7bb9-43ae-8d65-17365e36a173-169795140-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330510705_1800244033-Time1718033293819.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/26/41/62/26416210-529c-37fe-223b-386b0fd71704/db9cdb07-bf3c-4f4b-8b35-de02ea1b4ee2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6a198","textColor2":"f4be96","textColor4":"c99c7e","textColor1":"f1c3b6","bgColor":"1b171f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/65/51/94/6551948a-f993-72c0-90f0-8fe101096a36/Job83883773-7226-42b6-bc21-60b3b2fb9760-169795141-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330510704_1800244032-Time1718036451513.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cccbcb","textColor2":"e6e6e6","textColor4":"b8b8b8","textColor1":"fffffe","bgColor":"010001","hasP3":false}},"name":"Smoke & Fiction","artistName":"X","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/69/5f/e3/695fe3cd-e2b2-a084-95f7-45a8c81d3da0/198391613456.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"d5d5d5","textColor4":"aaaaaa","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/smoke-fiction/1745181371","playParams":{"id":"1745181371","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2flrGhu7n9y0IMlfmqRQ1F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745181371/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1295432230","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1295432230?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722584377417,"RTCI":0}}},"1745188881":{"id":"1745188881","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745188881?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fake-a-smile/1535887059","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"From the Rafters -

Gurge’s <i>Unit</i> opener, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff,” is also echoed in this album’s opening quip about how Dune Rats’ recent releases suck—kicking off the title track’s triumphant sing-along. As always with Dune Rats, these songs are equal parts bratty and catchy, balancing cheeky self-amusement with easy hooks and big vocal harmonies. The mocking commentary of “High Roller Selling Dope” and “Rich Kid Rehab” harks back to the beachy pop punk the band does so well. Other tracks follow through on their mission to mix things up more. “Solar Eyes” detours into softly strummed indie pop more akin to DMA’S before “Cheapskate” flashes back to 1990s radio catnip like Smash Mouth and New Radicals, reminding us just how malleable Dune Rats’ self-aware bubblegum is. Meanwhile, the party-friendly vibe stoked by singer/guitarist Danny Beus, bassist Brett Jansch, and drummer BC Michaels is very much confirmed on closing track, “Beers, Bongs & Bullshit.” Leading one more sing-along, Beus celebrates simply sitting around and doing nothing much at the end of a long day: “I want beers, bongs and bullshit with my friends/And you’re my friend.”","short":"Brisbane’s

Album","standard":"The Red Clay Strays are carrying the torch for Southern rock. The Mobile, Alabama, band find the sweet spot between swampy throwback rock and of-the-moment Americana with <i>Made by These Moments</i>, produced by the beloved Dave Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson). Buoyed by the viral hit “Wondering Why” from the band’s 2022 release <i>Moment of Truth</i>, this follow-up comes as The Red Clay Strays find wider prominence, including an Emerging Artist of the Year nomination at the 2024 Americana Music Honors & Awards.\n\n<i>Made by These Moments</i> opens with “Disaster,” a slow-building apocalypse anthem with echoes of Nathaniel Rateliff and early Kings of Leon. “No One Else Like Me” is a melodic showcase for vocalist Brandon Coleman, who knows when to wail and when to hold back and can wring emotion out of even the quietest note.

On her debut full-length album, Alabama artist Ella Langley explores the kinds of emotional aftermaths that leave behind heartache, not headaches. The record opens with its title track, a soulful and somber account of learning lessons in love the hard way. Fan favorite “nicotine” likens a lover she “want[s] but just don’t need” to the irresistible allure of a cigarette fix. Riley Green joins Langley on the hit duet “you look like you love me,” an old-school honky-tonk jam. Another standout is “paint the town blue,” a clever subversion of a country trope: Finding no solace in painting the town red in the wake of a breakup, Langley opts to “fall to pieces” (one of several classic country references on the record) and indulge her broken heart. Langley wraps the project with acoustic versions of two other new songs, “cowgirl don’t cry” and “broken in.” ","short":"The Alabama singer-songwriter tackles the pain aspirin and water can’t fix."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hungover/1749121114","playParams":{"id":"1749121114","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Fzx4iNVKLcCo7x1yP5q9N"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749121114/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1384373733","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1384373733?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722601068825,"RTCI":0}}},"1749379116":{"id":"1749379116","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749379116?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/orville-peck/1319633580","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a2/9a/a5/a29aa508-5d20-9cf6-5f5f-0739cadccd87/Job8c229d46-ada4-4621-8279-c634ad0aa629-169117596-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329068067_1787601082-Time1717117364012.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cee0ef"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"222025"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c0c6cb","textColor2":"cee0ef","textColor4":"acb9c6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"222025","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/22/28/c9/2228c9bc-20e1-0e0a-44ec-b3f6a474b8e0/4d6353ad-0e41-4f3a-8ba6-fad49168843e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbc2b3","textColor2":"aac9dd","textColor4":"94acb8","textColor1":"dbe4d6","bgColor":"3a3827","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6a/70/35/6a703550-cb0d-0f14-7b8c-4d74dce836d6/Job48e50183-054b-4d5d-b708-534b329e9303-169117595-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_329068056_1787601084-Time1717116462436.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"35343a","textColor2":"302a28","textColor4":"4e4c4d","textColor1":"120c11","bgColor":"c4d3df","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/68/59/52/6859523b-f1aa-197d-7917-6bf3906f0b07/79b59100-0ab0-4f02-9fc2-0244bec9679f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d6d2d1","textColor2":"efcdc4","textColor4":"d0b6b1","textColor1":"f6f0ed","bgColor":"565a64","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/08/70/ff/0870ffc0-bcf5-687a-d42f-f8d42a979c97/48cdf834-ace6-4263-ab85-3677f61a4e4d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfc3c9","textColor2":"c2c5cc","textColor4":"a4a8b0","textColor1":"e4e7eb","bgColor":"2d3241","hasP3":false}},"name":"Stampede","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Orville Peck","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a0/74/e5/a074e530-0afb-aaae-462b-0f4ac246ef70/093624844136.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"343132","textColor2":"29221f","textColor4":"494442","textColor1":"0f0b0b","bgColor":"cacacc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Orville Peck rounds up more than a few of his most talented friends on <i>Stampede</i>, a collaborative collection with one hell of a guest list. The enigmatic, masked country singer opens the record with a Willie Nelson-assisted cover of Ned Sublette’s clever, queer 1981 song “Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other,” which Nelson famously recorded in 2006. Elton John joins Peck for a spirited take on the former’s 1973 hit “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),” with Peck’s Roy Orbison-esque croon a dramatic counterpoint to John’s masterful belt. Peck and Allison Russell make formidable partners on “Chemical Sunset,” with a loose, jazzy arrangement that’s one of the project’s better grooves.\n\nBluegrass virtuoso Molly Tuttle and her band Golden Highway get things loose and rootsy on “Papa Was a Rodeo,” a cover of the winking Magnetic Fields song off the band’s seminal <i>69 Love Songs</i>. Margo Price assists Peck on the impeccably titled “You’re an Asshole, I Can’t Stand You (And I Want a Divorce),” an original song that manages to be both funny and wrenching. And Peck closes the project with an extra-special cover of Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy,” performing the song with three other out, gay country artists: TJ Osborne, Fancy Hagood, and Waylon Payne.","short":"The masked singer duets with Willie, Elton, Margo, Beck, and more."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stampede/1749379116","playParams":{"id":"1749379116","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3vi7hLbbjQBJypfAA2gafE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749379116/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1319633580","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1319633580?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722601708003,"RTCI":0}}},"1749609176":{"id":"1749609176","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749609176?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/elijah-blake/541773549","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c8/07/87/c8078763-156c-1d06-21da-38929ff73ac7/Jobff912349-2823-43d1-8def-1ec45838008d-171338418-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333648521_1825813894-Time1720204451239.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","da945b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"291f17"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c39c4f","textColor2":"da945b","textColor4":"b27a4c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"291f17","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/93/b9/9593b93a-ab15-a39a-0335-ecefeb5b5b74/d5121b21-ac79-4097-bdc7-b924f17b4254.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9ac9e","textColor2":"d2c1b1","textColor4":"a89b8e","textColor1":"e6d6c5","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/f6/f2/a4f6f254-753f-83da-2cb4-1d7c8ab81cde/Jobf3ea4bb6-a19e-43cd-8eb4-f94aa7078b0e-171338419-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_333648520_1825813895-Time1720208227392.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cac9c9","textColor2":"e7a264","textColor4":"bd8553","textColor1":"f8f6f7","bgColor":"141511","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/f3/08/d0f30870-3be4-7a58-5b67-a7c1f7da8fff/2f725fd6-066b-4156-9944-86dd2d9138bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d59e78","textColor2":"f9af72","textColor4":"d69665","textColor1":"f8b989","bgColor":"4b3531","hasP3":false}},"name":"Elijah.","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Elijah Blake","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1e/b8/13/1eb813d6-6d99-c263-598c-a01915bb4e14/23162.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb8053","textColor2":"dc884c","textColor4":"b5713f","textColor1":"e49c65","bgColor":"16130e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Elijah Blake’s illustrious career in the music industry started when he was a teenager, penning hits for Rihanna and Keyshia Cole, and most notably USHER’s 2012 track “Climax.” While songwriting and producing music, Blake was still an artist in his own right, releasing numerous EPs and albums.

Album","standard":"Throughout hip-hop history, New York has produced several of the biggest and most iconic female stars. A genuine breakout talent in her city’s abundant pool of drill artists, Bronx rap phenom Ice Spice earned the blessing of no less than Nicki Minaj after “Munch (Feelin’ U)” went from delightfully viral to utterly ubiquitous. Collabs with the Queen from Queens like “Princess Diana” put the outer-borough upstart in a rarefied space as she amassed other hits including “Gangsta Boo” and the Taylor Swift team-up “Karma.”\n\nRoughly two years after making such a strong first impression, Ice Spice looks to cement her place in the game with <i>Y2K!</i>. Named in honor of her January 1, 2000, birthdate, her debut album may not be materially that much longer than the preceding <i>Like..?</i> EP. Nonetheless, it augments her sonic world in exciting ways while maintaining the brash authenticity that got her to this point. \n\nThough perennial studio partner RIOTUSA remains at the production helm, the beat choices here skew darker and harder than one might expect. The dissonant rhythmic thump of “BB Belt” and menacing synth stabs of “Plenty Sun” soundtrack pointed and pithy verses intended to cut down the competition. Even though a handful of the titles may verge on the scatological, punchlines like “Spent 150 on some carats/That shit cray like them n****s in Paris” keep songs like “Think U the Shit (Fart)” feeling sharp rather than sophomoric. The exclusive guest list here reflects her elite status, wrangling Travis Scott for the victorious “Oh Shhh…” and then Gunna for the badass team-up “Bitch I’m Packin’.”","short":"The Bronx rap phenom drops her much-anticipated debut album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/y2k/1750336533","playParams":{"id":"1750336533","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7kkWu2etRnJCM6HX7JzhuK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750336533/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552372505","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552372505?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722600965331,"RTCI":0}}},"1750786165":{"id":"1750786165","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750786165?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tones-and-i/1488123516","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3f/77/7d/3f777d80-16a6-98de-d6e8-25868f2006dc/Job8553f987-6ab1-41a8-aa42-1b77357ae36b-172795079-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336765810_1848524139-Time1722374635320.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","181a19"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"90533d"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"312c29","textColor2":"181a19","textColor4":"36332f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"90533d","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/28/08/ca/2808ca54-dc99-c97f-d116-113260c8647d/7635b836-36db-4fe0-8e27-4fa31857784b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b2415","textColor2":"3a0b08","textColor4":"5e2919","textColor1":"0f0503","bgColor":"eea15f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f5/59/6c/f5596ca0-0fbe-2f2a-da47-745231714b65/Job292e299b-d682-4a7c-bee4-621e0c0fc835-172795078-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336765811_1848524138-Time1722373481670.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"dfd0b6","textColor2":"e6d6d8","textColor4":"cfbfbd","textColor1":"faebcf","bgColor":"726350","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c6/89/4c/c6894c58-c1eb-645e-4a0d-d2cb273aeb35/dc37057b-5046-4e2a-bc43-2e3d107fe86c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2725","textColor2":"090807","textColor4":"2b2826","textColor1":"0c0706","bgColor":"b4a9a3","hasP3":false}},"name":"Beautifully Ordinary","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tones And I","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6e/80/97/6e80975d-3456-04b9-8aa5-ddf03dee0fa2/075679645814.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"d0cccb","textColor2":"dfd1cf","textColor4":"c5b6b3","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"5e4a43","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I knew I wanted to be vulnerable in this album,” Toni Watson—aka Australian singer-songwriter Tones And I—tells Apple Music. That much becomes clear a few seconds into the devastatingly raw opener “To Be Loved.” With piano and strings swelling around her, Watson offers a heartfelt apology to her sister and brother, before one of an altogether more confronting nature: “And to the guy that hit me, I’m so sorry that I stayed/But I wanted to be loved, but to me that love was pain/I let you break me down so I could build me up again.”\n\nSuch honesty is indicative of a record on which Watson was committed to digging deeper emotionally and musically than ever before. “The last album [2021’s <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i>] I’m not really happy with at all, I wanted to change so much,” she says. “I don’t want to regret this one like I regret the last one. The production was lazy. It was just lazy work. I wasn’t honest and vulnerable about myself, I [just] wrote poppy melodies. As a composer I really wanted to create an album that had more depth to it.”\n\nWhile <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i> came together in a matter of months, <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i> was written in and around touring cycles over a period of a year and a half. Determined to display her versatility, Watson sings in a lower register on the soulful, rootsy “Raise Me Up” and fragile “Lose Someone Like Me,” while musically she oscillates between emotive ballads, attitude-laden indie (“You Don’t Know Me Like That”), and all-out pop (“Call My Name,” co-written with Drake and BTS collaborator Jenna Andrews). The intensely personal family tale “Sorrento,” meanwhile, marks her as a formidable storyteller with a keen eye for detail. The album takes its name from a song Watson deemed unsuitable for the record, though its title resonated with her goals around being vulnerable and open. “I think you can see the beautiful in the ordinary, and I think all of us feel ordinary,” she explains. Here, Watson walks us through <i>Beautifully Ordinary</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“To Be Loved”</b>\n“I brought things up that I’ve never brought up before. I think that’s me opening myself up to keep growing. But genuinely, I gave in that song as much as I could; I probably couldn’t go into much more detail comfortably. I think I need to slowly start edging towards opening up more, and this is kind of my first step into that ocean.”\n\n<b>“Lose Someone Like Me”</b>\n“It’s the biggest heartbreak that a young girl could have, which is with my best friend. It’s still raw. Even though it’s been a few years, I haven’t been able to write about it. And that’s why I almost didn’t release this song. And I know this person will know who it’s about. And this will be my version of reaching out. It’s important that I put it out there so I can move on.”\n\n<b>“I Get High”</b>\n“‘I Get High’ is about those best friends that you have, and you’re not old enough to go to clubs yet, but you get in cars with older boys at night, you sneak out, or you drink in the park, and you get up to mischief. Our feelings are so heightened at that age. As we get older, we have to subdue our emotions a lot more. There are great friendships when you’re that young and you share so much and go through so much together. I really wanted to touch on that.”\n\n<b>“We’ll See Stars”</b>\n“I wanted it to be about giving my sister one night of no worries. I just want her to be happy, and that flows into ‘Wonderful’ as well. This one’s about ‘let’s go out for the night, put all your worries aside, let’s have a sister night. I want you to experience life to its fullest and I want you to let go and have a good time.’ I picture my sister running around the city at night just having a good time.”\n\n<b>“Dance With Me”</b>\n“I wanted this song to feel bassy and ’80s, kind of giving a vibe of Robyn’s ‘Call Your Girlfriend’ or ‘Dancing on My Own.’ But even though sonically you’re moving to it, you’re dancing to it, the lyrics are sad. And I love that. The song doesn’t mean you’re physically dancing. Whatever the thing that you and your partner used to do when you were at your happiest moment, I’m sitting here in that spot waiting for you to come back to me, but you’re nowhere to be seen. So I’m just here on my own.”\n\n<b>“Figure It Out”</b>\n“This is the first track I wrote for the album. I wanted time to grow. I think everyone needs time to grow. People think that your first or biggest thing is just who you are now, and that’s such a defining factor of everything. But I think it’s important that everyone gets that opportunity to grow, and I think I’m asking for it in that chorus.”\n\n<b>“Wonderful”</b>\n“It’s about my sister, or it could be my best friend. There’s times where they’re at their lowest, and you just want to give them your perspective so that they could see how much potential they have, even though their brain isn’t letting them see that. It’s just about trying to help them at their worst.”\n\n<b>“Raise Me Up”</b>\n“Another song about desperation in a relationship, just wanting to be seen and heard. The song is about needing help and asking for it.”\n\n<b>“Dreaming”</b>\n“‘Dreaming’ could be about a friendship or love. For me it’s both. [It’s saying] I don’t know if it’s all in my head, but I think we’re growing apart. It goes into detail in the verses, but then it goes back to ‘but is it all in my head?’ So not really knowing.”\n\n<b>“You Don’t Know Me Like That”</b>\n“This is about a stalker. I have this stalker that comes to my house, leaves random stuff. I’ve got this massive thing they wrote me. I didn’t ever mean to talk about this. But my friend that I wrote it with, we just loved it so much. It’s got a nice vibe to it. But ultimately, it’s about trying to get rid of a stalker.”\n\n<b>“John Doe”</b>\n“‘John Doe’ is about someone that you meet and you have that instant connection, but you don’t want to say anything or do anything. It’s about wanting to go to that person and know more about them and see if there’s something there but [you’re] a bit hesitant.”\n\n<b>“Sorrento”</b>\n“David is my papa. A year before he passed I said, ‘For my wedding present I would love for you to write me your life story.’ And he wrote that for me. I just thought I’d share a little memory of him, and now it will be there forever.”\n\n<b>“Need You to Love Me”</b>\n“It starts a bit more vulnerable. It starts like you’re right there, I’m right there in front of you, singing about a relationship and the struggles of that. And then it turns into a little bit more of an upbeat kind of [song]. This album is the only time I’ve ever written about love. It’s really also about the struggles in relationships. It’s almost like I’m trying to convince myself, ‘Do I deserve better?’ Which is so vulnerable to say.”\n\n<b>“Only One”</b>\n“I was going through such a hard time when I wrote this song—serious heartbreak. And I couldn’t write anything. I was just so sad. I wanted to be so angry, but the chorus is [saying], ‘I still think that you’re the one for me.’ Which is the head fuck about it. ‘I have so much love for you, this is so hard.’”\n\n<b>“Live Without Your Love”</b>\n“This one was written a long time ago. This is about my friend; she is so happy. I realized the friendship that she gives me is so important. It helps me become a better person; it helps me see the brighter sides. If I was running around with another pessimist, then I would be doubling down on myself. And so it ended up being ‘we’re never going to be the same person, but I love you for that. And I can’t live without your love.’”\n\n<b>“Call My Name”</b>\n“I realized I had a lot of vulnerability in the album. So I wanted to have that more four-to-the-floor moment, just to showcase that a little bit more. I haven’t got a big, long story about the lyrics; it’s two professional songwriters [Watson and Jenna Andrews] in a room writing a pop song. And that is what that is.”","short":"Tones reveals all on album no. 2: “I wanted to be vulnerable.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beautifully-ordinary/1750786165","playParams":{"id":"1750786165","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2TLyLOzYh6qo5N0blioQn8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750786165/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1488123516","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1488123516?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722601371048,"RTCI":0}}},"1751358567":{"id":"1751358567","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751358567?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cody-hibbard/1478863167","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e3/b3/64/e3b3643e-9521-40fb-1c78-49395bfa29bb/Job6678e98b-d72b-411b-b205-f1206206f2b9-170927818-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332785778_1819224805-Time1719578234230.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","0e1110"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"d5cdc4"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"383935","textColor2":"0e1110","textColor4":"3b3c39","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"d5cdc4","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/8d/90/0f/8d900fe1-a102-ed78-fd4c-6657b6f76b4a/Jobcfc72dbf-3400-408c-8b28-c57903ec529c-170927819-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332785777_1819224806-Time1719579522895.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","0f1210"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"d5cdc4"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"393a35","textColor2":"0f1210","textColor4":"3c3d39","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"d5cdc4","hasP3":false}},"name":"Long Ride In A Short Bed","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Cody Hibbard","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e1/2c/b6/e12cb682-cd3f-9750-0a51-c613b8935633/198588351444.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"363733","textColor2":"0f110f","textColor4":"3b3c38","textColor1":"080b09","bgColor":"ece8dc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/long-ride-in-a-short-bed/1751358567","playParams":{"id":"1751358567","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1sL3XEro9nzmsMZrLN9aK5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751358567/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1478863167","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1478863167?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722582341797,"RTCI":0}}},"1752010013":{"id":"1752010013","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752010013?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-26","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rakim/97217","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f4/d8/f6/f4d8f65d-8acf-9090-ec04-08547ae3afe0/fc7d661d-ea60-4b04-bb33-b20686db4a10.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4f4948","textColor2":"2c201d","textColor4":"534a48","textColor1":"271f1d","bgColor":"f2f2f3","hasP3":false}},"name":"G.O.Ds NETWORK -

Joined by Julia Michaels, Morris pleads for a break from “put[ting] a hell of a show on” in favor of crying it out and taking a breather. A need for peace is a loose theme on this EP, which comes in the wake of Morris’ split from husband and fellow country artist Ryan Hurd. On “i hope i never fall in love,” she swears off romance entirely, asserting that “forever was a fuckin’ lie” with a deceptively pretty melody. “push me over” brings poppy, Ariana Grande-esque production and also turns up the heat as Morris asks a lover to “come closer.” The track seems to nod to her bisexuality, as she references “perfume” and a new kind of experience: “Don’t know what it is, but I like the flavor.” On “because, of course,” Morris shows her loyalty, reassuring with promises to be “a place to land” when the going gets tough. Morris closes <i>Intermission</i> with “this is how a woman leaves,” a defiant if heartbroken account of picking up the pieces after a relationship ends.","short":"A five-pack of songs searching for peace of mind and new directions."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/intermission-ep/1752568299","playParams":{"id":"1752568299","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752568299/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"262260873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/262260873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722600837348,"RTCI":0}}},"1752864900":{"id":"1752864900","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752864900?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/moses-sumney/843536848","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/79/41/65/794165e5-48ba-58f9-48d5-820d97a095ba/594ed3c4-cc2a-49e2-b501-20baabf14af1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d6d6d6","textColor2":"f6f6f6","textColor4":"d6d6d6","textColor1":"f6f6f6","bgColor":"585858","hasP3":false}},"name":"Sophcore -

Khalid’s unfiltered lyricism and earnest portrayal of adolescent frustrations and anxieties resonated with many and propelled him to stardom. At 21, he released <i>Free Spirit</i>, a soulful meditation that saw the singer-songwriter shedding the naivety of his teenage years and marking his first step into adulthood. Half a decade after <i>Free Spirit</i>, Khalid is back and better than ever and ready to show his fans his growth with the release of his third studio LP, <i>Sincere</i>. “I needed to take that break,” he tells Apple Music. “I needed to stop. And I don’t look at it in a place of being afraid to come back. If I’m going to take this break, when I come back, I’ll come back with more clarity. I’ll come back with a better choice of decisions, more maturity, more knowledge.”\n\nOn <i>Sincere</i>, Khalid proudly shows off that new knowledge, drawing inspiration from life experiences over five years and showcasing his evolution not only as an artist but as a person as well. “It was a very difficult process in naming this album, because I had to find one that summed up what I really felt in this music,” he says. “I thought of it as my most vulnerable in a while, because when I’m thinking of these songs, I’m saving them over the year like, ‘Okay, no, I have to keep this.’ And that’s vulnerable because I’ve known the songs’ impact on me when I was in the studio. I believe that if I trust my intention and I trust my heart, then it’ll have a similar impact to my listener.”\n\nThroughout the album’s 16 tracks, Khalid shares intimate vignettes about the lessons he’s learned, whether it’s about heartbreak (“It’s All Good,” “Broken,” “Tainted”), loneliness (“Who’s There to Pick Me Up,” “Decline”), or falling in love (“Adore U,” “Altitude”). However, not every song on the project is about love lost: Khalid is introspective on the soul-searching and dreamy track “Ground,” where he details his experience with psychedelics due to feeling uncertain within his career. On the Arlo Parks duet “Breathe,” Khalid is transparent as he yearns for freedom from the darkness of his mind. “When I listen to this album, you can see the time that it took,” he says. “You can see the time.”\n","short":"On his third album, the singer-songwriter showcases his

Album and Interview","standard":"“I'm my biggest fan,” Justin Quiles tells Apple Music. “It don't matter what happens. I'm always rooting for myself.” Given the Puerto Rican artist’s decade-long career as a singer, songwriter, rapper, and producer, he has good reason to champion his catalog. Coming off recent hits both with KAROL G and as part of the Latin supergroup The Academy, he knew his next album needed to stay current and progress from the preceding <i>La Última Promesa</i> from three years prior. To this end, he set up two different writing camps, in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and Santa Marta, Colombia. “I like creating my albums close to the ocean,” he says. “This is my passion, so for me it is very important to have a good vibe [and] to be in a place of peace.” \n\nFrom familiar producers like Dímelo Flow to relative newcomers like MvilliW, the resulting <i>PERMANENTE</i> both adheres to and updates Quiles’ sound. “It's very important to use these key people that I always work with, because we have already a formula that works,” he says. “But also I'm trying to find a different feel with these new producers I'm bringing in my projects.” Read on to learn about some of Justin Quiles’ favorite songs from <i>PERMANENTE</i>—in his own words.\n\n<b>“PERMANENTE (INTRO)”</b>\n“The intro is very important for people to connect with me and see the struggles. I describe from the beginning of how I was born, how I grew up. A lot of people don't know that for the first couple of years I lived in a shelter with my mom. I talk about my ups and downs, and how hard it sometimes is. We were poor. We struggled a lot.”\n\n<b>“SU ROPA”</b>\n“‘PERMANENTE’ talks about a little bit my life, but then you’ve got to give people joy. We want to live, we want to be happy, go to the club, experience life. And I feel like ‘SU ROPA’ has that type of vibe where you want go and listen in the car with your friends and scream the song. I feel like it's like old-school with new-school reggaetón. The melodies are a little mix of both worlds.”\n\n<b>“WHITE TEE”</b>\n“I'm looking for different sounds and looking for something refreshing. We wrote the song with MvilliW. He's 19 years old, lives in Puerto Rico, so we got together. It’s like trap R&B, and it goes to reggaetón. The song is a vibe. I got that feel from Puerto Rico, of what is going on right now on the island in the music industry.”\n\n<b>“LIKE YOU”</b>\n“Lately I've been listening to a lot of Afrobeats. It is a new wave that's still catching on in Spanish. I just fell in love with the beat and I started writing from the top of the head. I literally improvised half of the song immediately; I just pulled my headphones on and I started mumbling the melodies and putting words to it. Basically, all the words were there. Whatever came through my mind, I put it on mic. I fixed a couple things and that was the song.”\n\n<b>“PLAY BOY”</b>\n“Dímelo Ninow produced it, and he's usually working with a lot of trap artists and artists that do drill in Puerto Rico. I gave it a feel of R&B. I mixed my melodies in there and made it my own sound. That's very important, not to try to be somebody that I'm not. I always put in my music what I feel, what I want to be, and what I want to portray. Some people don't know that I started my career rapping. I was a rapper before being a singer, so I love rapping. It's part of my DNA. I'm representing something that probably a lot of people haven't heard from me.”\n\n<b>“SE PRESTA”</b>\n“I call it Puerto Rican vibes, because [when] you go to the island, that's what you listen to. You listen to trap mixed with reggaetón. They on that wave heavily right now. I went to Puerto Rico to get all that energy, and ‘SE PRESTA’ came out from the streets. This album is a lot of mixing, a lot of experimental stuff. The song continues the wave of ‘White Tee,’ that type of reggaetón that you want to dance and you want to listen to in the club as well.”\n\n<b>“DIAMANTE”</b>\n“It's very interesting going to different countries and learning what the local artists do over there. My people from Panama love dancehall. They got their own sound, so it's very particular. I feel like Dímelo Flow gave me something different here. It's still danceable; it still feels like reggaetón, but it's not really reggaetón. And it goes back to my roots, the way I write romantic songs. Arcángel one time told me in the studio, 'Diamonds are done with pressure.' I used that in the song like, 'Sorry I'm pressuring you, I just want to see you, but that's how diamonds are built.'”\n","short":"“I’m my biggest fan.” Check out the Puerto Rican star’s latest album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/permanente/1756378135","playParams":{"id":"1756378135","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3iA6lFPydNrgFd6s1Hojii"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756378135/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"875457681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/875457681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722584408076,"RTCI":0}}},"1756386182":{"id":"1756386182","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756386182?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/father-john-misty/514361724","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/34/f0/a9/34f0a94f-2de8-2514-bed0-14d7eb94fa0a/Jobf3fa9c92-1a3a-4a5d-9650-1ba1f307bf07-172803380-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336784570_1848696941-Time1722387127352.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f17224"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"231310"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c9b552","textColor2":"f17224","textColor4":"c46027","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"231310","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ad/66/75/ad6675eb-56a7-f160-4b85-7f6c40113b26/Job3afd98cf-f66e-4240-b82a-46cca9759468-172803381-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336784569_1848696942-Time1722388857040.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c99f55","textColor2":"f9852b","textColor4":"cc702c","textColor1":"f5c05e","bgColor":"181d34","hasP3":false}},"name":"Greatish Hits: I Followed My Dreams and My Dreams Said to Crawl","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Father John Misty","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5e/fb/a6/5efba65e-43e8-d66b-dcd3-14d62fe8da93/098787166064.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"cfb04a","textColor2":"d4914b","textColor4":"af7943","textColor1":"fcd654","bgColor":"1d1822","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/greatish-hits-i-followed-my-dreams-and-my-dreams-said/1756386182","playParams":{"id":"1756386182","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4bxhyHnKlBPEroa0Og8YkS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756386182/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"514361724","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/514361724?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722583688944,"RTCI":0}}},"1756441654":{"id":"1756441654","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756441654?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/conner-smith/1137689286","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Smoky Mountains Sessions -

Contrasting with the concurrent rise of trap music, his 2010s work as a producer for the likes of Big Sean, Migos, Rihanna, Tinashe, and YG—to name just a few—all but defined the sound of mainstream hip-hop and R&B that decade. Yet his musical contribution to Kendrick Lamar’s beef with Drake sent him soaring back to the top of the charts, essentially making the 2024 release <i>Faith of a Mustard Seed</i> an inevitability. \n\nSome five years after his last album <i>Perfect Ten</i>, Mustard fully reinserts himself into the proverbial conversation with this 14-track effort. Teaming up with old friends and new collaborators alike, his curatorial approach leads to exciting configurations around the album’s various guest features. He spreads that California love with Vince Staples and ScHoolboy Q on “Pressured Up” and gives Atlanta its props with Young Thug and transplanted resident Lil Durk on “Ghetto.” Elsewhere, he acts against regionality. “Up Now” unites Lil Yachty, BlueBucksClan, and 42 Dugg for an all-American flex, while the sentimental “A Song for Mom” adds Masego's island vibes to the mix with Ty Dolla $ign and the legendary Charlie Wilson.\n\nA few artists get solo showcases, namely Kodak Black on the booming “Yak’s Prayer” and Travis Scott on the shimmering “Parking Lot.” A frequent studio partner, Roddy Ricch, heads up the sinuous “Truth Is” and duets with Ella Mai for the revelatory “One Bad Decision.” And while gospel fixture Kirk Franklin delivers the opening prayer on “Show Me the Way,” it’s Mustard himself who closes with gratitude and grace on the poetic speech “Pray for Me.”","short":"The “Not Like Us” producer returns with old friends and new ones alike."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/faith-of-a-mustard-seed/1756754566","playParams":{"id":"1756754566","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0WUrlWBRvpGtiPfU7RK46R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756754566/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"304270345","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/304270345?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722601047936,"RTCI":0}}},"1756815018":{"id":"1756815018","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1756815018?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/luisa-almaguer/1373699195","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d6/7b/36/d67b36f0-8910-49cb-5db9-24e7665171e7/2cee7e40-7e05-489c-91c5-7b59653db035.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"aba7a8","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b08263","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cc/6e/4d/cc6e4dd1-3deb-3a46-ac60-b241f386587a/72539a31-93d9-4007-9c8e-aff57d1a1cad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"bb9e8a","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b58c70","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/04/4a/e8/044ae88a-2db5-e886-f264-dab41bb990fe/faf61e14-ca8b-4ef1-89b8-3282deb70b88.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c2ab99","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b69079","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/99/a7/7b/99a77bc7-08df-909e-5f1f-8b94468d7f81/431eef30-619b-45be-ae1a-0907cb1d4a51.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"b4967a","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"af9685","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b4/f9/2e/b4f92ee9-030d-3ceb-9cad-5475c5b7271a/54ab7809-aa6d-401b-bd8f-db430a407bb7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bea393","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"ac8672","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f4/60/7a/f4607a4e-9700-a0ab-7c27-3b042615d6b3/8cfee2a5-d296-41e9-bb5c-1485c05e5a21.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"bea38f","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b69480","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/46/f5/5246f563-23fe-076c-705e-67a9927694f0/e9d350c9-f60d-4520-a3ba-d7e6a0cd48b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"ababab","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"ca9f86","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false}},"name":"Apple Music Sessions: Luisa Almaguer -

Once fans began noticing his unique skill set, he never looked back. While still staying true to his Motor City roots, he invites a diverse set of rappers from across the country to help color his 2024 LP <i>The Coldest</i>.\n\nOn “Richie” he goes bar-for-bar with Memphis mainstay Moneybagg Yo. The dark and minimal beat, highlighted by sparse piano notes and horror-movie-esque synths, is classic Detroit, but Skilla proves chameleonic when he tag-teams with the deep-voiced Bluff City assassin. On “Slimm Shady,” the rapper recruits Sacramento street legend Mozzy to add his perspective. Skilla proves dexterous, narrating a street tale that would make his co-artist proud while still cleverly honoring his home state: “Gun hot but my glovеs on, I’m in the mitten with it.”\n","short":"The Detroit MC pairs himself with stars from across the

Apple Music Session","standard":"“It is really cool to see that, even when you strip away all of the production and bring it back to the bare roots of the songs, they’re so beautiful in their own way,” singer-songwriter Myles Smith tells Apple Music. “And it really lets the lyrics speak.” That’s exactly what you can expect from the rising talent’s Apple Music Session, which features stripped-back takes of his own track “Stargazing” and a cover of Billie Eilish’s 2024 hit “BIRDS OF A FEATHER.” “I think that I chose ‘Stargazing’ because it’s a song that’s really connecting across the world and I wanted to be able to package it in a new light to give people a different experience of the song or maybe to absorb it in a different way,” he says. “With ‘BIRDS OF A FEATHER.’ I think it’s one of the most beautiful songs that was written this year.” \n\nBut there was another reason he chose to cover an Eilish track. “I wanted to bring it back to an acoustic format where she started, but also where I started and where I found synergy in her music,” he says. “I thought it was a cool way to repackage a song that everyone knows and loves.” This session also marked a new way of working for Smith, who made it long-distance alongside his producer and collaborator Peter Fenn. “We actually collaborated a lot of this track over Zoom,” says Smith. “It was pretty cool because we hadn’t worked in that format before. But it meant that we were able to bring ourselves to the track a lot more and have a lot more fun on our own.” Press play on a serene session now.","short":"The rising star covers a 2024 Billie Eilish

Deluxe Edition","standard":"“My Saturn has returned,” the cosmic country singer-songwriter proclaimed to announce her fifth album (apologies to <i>A Very Kacey Christmas</i>), <i>Deeper Well</i>. If you’re reading this, odds are you know what that means: About every 30 years, the sixth planet from the sun comes back to the place in the sky where it was when you were born, and with it, ostensibly, comes growth. At 35, the chill princess of rule-breaking country/pop/what-have-you has caught up with Saturn and taken its lessons to heart. OUT: energy vampires, self-sabotaging habits, surface-level conversations. IN: jade stones, moon baths, long dinners with friends, listening closely to the whispered messages of the cosmos. (As for the wake-and-bake sessions she mentions on the title track—out, but wistfully so.)\n\nMusgraves followed her 2018 breakthrough album, the gently trippy <i>Golden Hour</i>, with 2021’s <i>star-crossed</i>, a divorce album billed as a “tragedy in three parts,” where electronic flourishes added to the drama. On <i>Deeper Well</i>, the songwriter’s feet are firmly planted on the ground, reflected in its warm, wooden, organic instrumentation—fingerpicked acoustic guitar, banjo, pedal steel. Here, Musgraves turns to nature for the answers to her ever-probing questions. “Heart of the Woods,” a campfire sing-along inspired by mycologist Paul Stamets and his <i>Fantastic Fungi</i> documentary, looks to mushroom networks beneath the forest floor for lessons on connectivity. And on “Cardinal,” a gorgeous ode to her late friend and mentor John Prine in the paisley mode of The Mamas & The Papas, potential dispatches from the beyond arrive as a bird outside her window in the morning.\n\nAs Musgraves’ trust in herself and the universe deepens, so do her songwriting chops. On “Dinner With Friends,” a gratitude journal entry given the cosmic country treatment, she honors her roots in perfectly sly Musgravian fashion: “My home state of Texas, the sky there, the horses and dogs, but none of their laws.” And on the simple, searching “The Architect,” she condenses the big mysteries of human nature into one elegant, good-natured question: “Can I pray it away, am I shapeable clay/Or is this as good as it gets?”\n","short":"Kacey adds seven new tracks to her introspective 2024 album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deeper-well-deeper-into-the-well/1758870783","playParams":{"id":"1758870783","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1qkr1AJ7sc8IF2nLmjCBkZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758870783/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466044182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466044182?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722605957488,"RTCI":0}}},"1759009240":{"id":"1759009240","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759009240?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Techno","Music","Dance","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-05-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/acemoma/1468574687","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"AceMoMa at Movement Detroit, 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"AceMoMa","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/31/94/03/319403cc-bbf3-2756-9533-7869ccf81a17/42a982f2-36ff-4f20-abca-b0293f74a287.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9c8c1","textColor2":"ffa628","textColor4":"ce841f","textColor1":"f9faf1","bgColor":"0d0000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/acemoma-at-movement-detroit-2024-dj-mix/1759009240","playParams":{"id":"1759009240","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759009240/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1468574687","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1468574687?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722296837216,"RTCI":0}}},"1759020803":{"id":"1759020803","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759020803?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1660550129-1594490446","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e3/5d/0b/e35d0b5c-0e19-1fcb-6a91-8f094e77f2f0/84014305-4497-4fb2-9f83-ba78c9a9f478.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a89c85","textColor2":"c7c089","textColor4":"a39d71","textColor1":"cebea2","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Disney Jr. Music: SuperKitties Su-Purr Charged Pawesome Edition","artistName":"SuperKitties -

The end result of their electronic experiments, <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i> makes for one of most unique albums not just in the band’s catalog to date, but also in música mexicana history.\n\nBoasting collaborations with dance music heavy hitters AFROJACK and Major Lazer, as well as appearances by Colombian superstar Maluma and Mexico City’s own Bellakath, the 15-track effort merges EDM and other club-centric styles with the group’s signature sound. Disparate genres like drill and Jersey club somehow make sense in this hybrid context, evidenced on “FREESTYLE” and “BELLA.” While fans adjust to this new approach, “JESUS” and the title track largely stick to the familiar format that made the group the veritable juggernaut it is today. “It’s risky, something new, but we still have all our essence and all our lingo,” JOP says. “You’re hearing Fuerza Regida still.” Read on to learn about some of his favorite songs from <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i>—in his own words.\n\n<b>“TUQLO”</b>\n“The vibe is, two years ago we started writing more about females and girls. One of my boys that was looking at the charts, he’s like, ‘Hey, all the songs on the Top 10 are about a girl.’ I was like, ‘What have we been doing all this fucking time?’ So, that’s what we started doing. Now everyone’s writing about a female, right? But in those times, no one was really paying attention in our genre. Reggaetón, they knew what’s up. We sat down and we just mastered it. We know how to talk about it. We got a little bit of rizz, so we just rizzed up the song and that’s it.”\n\n<b>“NEL”</b>\n“We were at the camp right there, and we were making so much music. Armenta, one of my main writers, he showed me the song. I was so fried, I was like, ‘Let’s leave it there; I can’t choose right now.’ Then I just recorded that shit, and we loved it. A lot of people fuck with that song.”\n\n<b>“SOFIA”</b>\n“I wrote it with Armenta and Jorge [Jiménez Sanchez]. Then we left it up to Gordo—the producer Carnage, now Gordo. He came in and killed it, dog. I just gave him my vocal with the guitar. I knew that he knew the songs that I wanted to do. He knows the genre, so he was going to make it sound good.”\n\n<b>“SECRETO VICTORIA”</b>\n“It’s kind of like ‘HARLEY QUINN’; we put the actual Jersey club 808s in there. With this song, we didn’t put no tololoche, no actual instrument base. We left it up to the 808s. We added the rest—the requinto, trombone, the charchetas. We’re calling it ‘Jersey corridos,’ That’s the new shit we’re doing.”\n\n<b>“FRESITA”</b>\n“That was the last song we made. I had all these writers making music, and then some of my boys, just my homies that were with me on the trip, they went to a room, and they put on an instrumental. I went in there and I heard it and I’m like, ‘Damn!’ I laid some bars, too. One of my managers was like, ‘Bellakath has to be on your album.’ We had the song for her.”","short":"JOP and crew reimagine música mexicana: “It’s risky, something

Album","standard":"Even in a career teeming with game-changing records, <i>MICHAEL</i> meant a lot to Killer Mike. The critically acclaimed and award-winning album capped off an already impressive discography rooted in Atlanta artistry and augmented by the raw power of his duo Run The Jewels. Naturally, a project as profound and resonant as that 2023 full-length left many eager to hear more from him in this soulful yet unrestrained mode. Thankfully, roughly a year later comes <i>Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs for Sinners and Saints</i>.\n\nNo matter where one entered Killer Mike fandom, there’s something here for any and all of his listeners (albeit less for those craving RTJ’s signature sonic maximalism). Dungeon Family devotees will catch an immediate blast of that ATL energy within seconds of “BUSSIN BRICKS INTRO,” boasting production by no less than Outkast’s longtime DJ Cutmaster Swiff. Living up to the essence of this titular revival, gospel-infused cuts like “HAD TO GO GET IT” and the deeply reflective “LORD PREPARE ME” harken back to similar moments on his semi-eponymous prior album. Religious themes bleed through the soul-trap rattle of “SLUMMER 4 JUNKIES,” Mike’s confessional verses and Bishop Andrew Potter’s intercessions elevating the 10-minute centerpiece with the awesome power of a Sunday sermon.\n\nWhile the guest list doesn’t specifically mirror the artistic largesse of <i>MICHAEL</i>, the tightly curated feature selection here suits the setting undeniably well. Building on its companion’s “TALK’N THAT SHIT!,” fellow Southerners Key Glock and Project Pat add that Memphis seasoning to the Twhy x DJ Paul blend “STILL TALK’N THAT SHIT.” Blxst and Offset emphasize the gravity of the hustle on “EXIT 9 (SCENIC ROUTE)” while R&B fixture Anthony Hamilton gives a stirring performance on “NOBODY KNOWS.”","short":"Atlanta’s almighty MC testifies on this gospel-infused 10-track set."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/michael-the-mighty-midnight-revival-songs-for-sinners/1759458941","playParams":{"id":"1759458941","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4uusjgOWMeitjvIrSA1HXO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759458941/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1320637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1320637?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722605829951,"RTCI":0}}},"1759510192":{"id":"1759510192","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759510192?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1368665614-1746261261-1044952521","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"KCTAPE, Vol. 2","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"HAON, vangdale & Sik-K","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3e/41/a7/3e41a72a-6b0b-e241-5375-fb681a70c70c/191953379883.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"383735","textColor2":"312f2d","textColor4":"585755","textColor1":"080805","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kctape-vol-2/1759510192","playParams":{"id":"1759510192","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2hFmjRT4DsRquVvV1oQZJ2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759510192/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1368665614","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1368665614?l=en-US"},{"id":"1746261261","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1746261261?l=en-US"},{"id":"1044952521","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1044952521?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722496719617,"RTCI":0}}},"1760057427":{"id":"1760057427","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760057427?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jack-white/826980","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/63/4e/48634e11-2eec-32d8-1025-48f80c73cec8/0369fdd0-8cca-42b3-80e7-fdcb08a40330.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a19d","textColor2":"c9c1c6","textColor4":"a49ea2","textColor1":"d9c5bf","bgColor":"141416","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0c/41/63/0c416303-fd6d-c4aa-ebd3-4701ea4b8f73/ac3d899d-4fb4-4ffc-9605-3a3f58fe12b4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7480df","textColor2":"6c79f9","textColor4":"5764e0","textColor1":"909cf8","bgColor":"05107d","hasP3":false}},"name":"No Name","artistName":"Jack White","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/e2/9e/1ce29ea2-4ceb-e775-9b4f-1191ea6155ab/810074424233.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor4":"b7b7b7","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The White Stripes were nothing if not a formal exercise in exploring the possibilities of self-imposed limitation—in instrumentation, in color scheme, in verifiable biographical information. Since the duo’s dissolution in 2011, Jack White has continued playing with form (and color schemes), from the just-one-of-the-boys-in-the-band vibes of The Raconteurs to 2022’s sonically experimental <i>Fear of the Dawn</i> and its more restrained companion <i>Entering Heaven Alive</i>. Despite—or perhaps <i>to</i> spite—those who longed for a simpler, noisier, more monochromatic time, White tinkered away.\n\nThe rollout for <i>No Name</i>, White’s sixth solo album, was characteristically mischievous: It first appeared as a white-label LP given away at Third Man Records before being posted online without song titles, sparking an excitement that felt fresh, largely because the sound did not. Meg White is not walking through that door anytime soon, but the 13 tracks here channel the unadorned, wild-eyed ferocity of the band that made him famous more efficiently and consistently than anything he’s done since. There’s plenty of swagger from top to bottom, but most of all there’s <i>hooks</i>: big, fat, noisy guitars played in the catchiest combinations possible. \n\n“That’s How I’m Feeling” may not relieve “Seven Nation Army” of its ubiquity anytime soon, but it is a ready-made capital-A anthem with a euphoric jump-scare chorus that sticks on first listen and doesn’t get unstuck. “Bless Yourself,” “Tonight (Was a Long Time Ago),” and “Number One With a Bullet” are just as infectious, while “Bombing Out” may be the fastest, heaviest thing White has ever put out in any of his many guises. The casualness of it all is a flex—as meticulous and exacting as White can be, <i>No Name</i>’s modest arrival is a reminder of how easily he could have kept churning out earworm White Stripes songs. Good for him that he didn’t want to; good for us that he does now.","short":"We think you’re gonna be friends with this casual flex of a throwback."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-name/1760057427","playParams":{"id":"1760057427","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4j6OkbZmVIqJYDLJbiWHbX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760057427/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"826980","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/826980?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1722601013207,"RTCI":0}}},"1760199840":{"id":"1760199840","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760199840?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alt%C3%A9go/1606418899","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/af/d7/19/afd7193d-c2f3-f7d7-9c9d-91534903e9a2/f843ce10-b0dc-44dc-ae72-20ea4f59f587.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"cdb265","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a5a291","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0f0f0f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9a/5c/dc/9a5cdcf6-a940-a007-5a7b-e00744355a19/c68b66a2-3c9f-409e-9a9b-ff8176d83374.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"b4a867","textColor2":"d2bd74","textColor4":"aa995f","textColor1":"ded07e","bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e7/a2/2f/e7a22f55-6193-2a2a-6c0f-aa6e830876a0/9b9ae2ad-0531-4f3a-924a-8628e8e6174d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c1ac6b","textColor2":"d5be77","textColor4":"b09e63","textColor1":"ead181","bgColor":"1e1c15","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/06/e2/eb06e293-fbc5-0160-96ec-da700a149cc4/803fc4db-9977-4dca-a9f4-0216536eb727.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a7a696","textColor2":"c9bc73","textColor4":"a2975d","textColor1":"d0ceba","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/de/97/67/de976795-095d-787c-14b1-eac7e08f22c4/4bf3781e-0a1a-4074-9ec3-7f488755691c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbb167","textColor2":"eccd72","textColor4":"c4ab62","textColor1":"f5d577","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/44/9e/a3/449ea3ce-6841-2074-6cf6-0ea52bb53245/ca0e0863-e47e-4d69-b0d2-88d8b6e15cf3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"b7b5a2","textColor2":"f1d684","textColor4":"c4ae6d","textColor1":"e0dec7","bgColor":"131210","hasP3":false}},"name":"Today's Hits: August 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"ALTÉGO","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4e/1d/b5/4e1db53c-d330-090e-3dc2-5e660474f9c2/74a49ebf-c7dc-4c13-8cfb-1c88fa5371cb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"fcda7a","textColor4":"caaf62","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"040303","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"You already know Today's Hits—the playlist that keeps up with the most popular songs in pop, hip-hop, R&B, and more—but you’ve never heard it like this.
