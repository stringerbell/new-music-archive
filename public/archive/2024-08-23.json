& Ardor","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"For the title of his fourth album under the Zeal & Ardor banner, avant-garde metal musician Manuel Gagneux turned to ancient legend. The greif, or griffin, is a mythological creature—part lion, part eagle—that appears in many of the oldest cultures. In Gagneux’s hometown of Basel, Switzerland, the griffin figures prominently in the annual Vogel Gryff procession. “It’s basically a guy in a big old bird costume that reveals its backside to the rich part of town,” he tells Apple Music. “It’s like an 800-year-old tradition. It’s so endearing, I thought it was worth sharing with the world.”\n\n<i>GREIF</i> is also the first Zeal & Ardor album to feature Gagneux’s live band. “By now, people know us more from our live performances,” he says. “So, it’s more representative of what it is that I associate with Zeal & Ardor. Doing the opposite would’ve been weirder to me at this point. It felt very organic to have them involved. Just like the greif is an amalgam of animals, everyone doing their part on this record is an amalgam of us. And it’s our most eclectic record, I think, so it feels quite fitting.” Below, he comments on each track. \n\n<b>“The Bird, the Lion and the Wildkin”</b>\n“Yeah, wildkin. In all honesty, I might’ve made up that word. But as that procession happens with the greif, it’s accompanied by piccolos and snare drums. So, that’s what I tried to emulate with the whistling and the drums there. Also, it’s a melody that will return later in the record, and I thought it kind of a nice little booming opening to welcome this weird, strange world of <i>GREIF</i>.”\n\n<b>“Fend You Off”</b>\n“It’s the first, or one of the few times, that I use the ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ in a Zeal & Ardor song. It’s quite a personal-struggle song, not in a specific thing that happened to me, but it’s about self-preservation. Sometimes we take steps that hurt ourselves just to make way for others. So, it’s about yielding, basically, and how not good of an idea that sometimes is.”\n\n<b>“Kilonova”</b>\n“The word ‘kilonova’ is a fairly new term about two supernovas colliding, which is objectively cool. It’s also about how our spirits and our weird ideas, or our weird playing, collides on this record. It’s one of the more occult songs on the record, with references to old, old books. And it’s one I hold really dear to my heart. It started as a funk song, and then I started distorting guitars. It kind of has reminiscing factors to another band that were not planned, but they are there. I’m not going to name names, but there’s some utensils at play.”\n\n<b>“are you the only one now?”</b>\n“It was an intentional decision to make the title all lowercase. It’s about these minichapters of the record, and basically these few [lowercase] songs prefacing what is coming after them, in a thematic sense. This is another personal one. It’s about solitude and finding peace in solitude, because there’s a huge difference between loneliness and solitude. It’s about embracing being alone, and that even time perceptively wasted being alone is still time that was spent working on oneself. I’m very much a person that enjoys being alone and kind of revels in solitude. It sounds very, very mopey, but I think I’m quite happy when I’m alone.”\n\n<b>“Go home my friend”</b>\n“This is a callback, musically, to the things we did prior to this record. It’s a taste of, ‘Oh, remember this?’ I think it conveys the idea of what it wants to be quite well, and there’s no need to expand on it. It’s just, ‘OK, this is it.’ It goes exactly where it should go, and then it ends without being ruined. And I quite like that.”\n\n<b>“Clawing Out”</b>\n“I think, in many ways, it’s the most aggressive song we’ve put out, or the most intense. Because it has these mean tempo ramps that just fuel anxiety, I think. And I really love that. It all culminates in these aggressive, hardcore electro kicks, which I find so, so nice. And it kind of blends well with the metal aesthetic in a weird way. I’m very happy with this one. It’s a new flavor of heavy.”\n\n<b>“Disease”</b>\n“That’s basically about how good intentions can have bad results. Because I think I’ve hurt a lot of people just by trying to help them, and I’ve been hurt by people who’ve tried to help me. It’s not about the intent, but sometimes a helping hand is just something in the way. That sounds very cynical, but I think there’s truth to that. It kind of needs to be spoken to.”\n\n<b>“369”</b>\n“This is a reference to a Tom Waits song called ‘Clap Hands,’ which itself is a reference to a Shirley Ellis song called ‘The Clapping [Song],’ which starts out ‘Three, six, nine, the [goose] drank wine.’ So, it’s a cover of a cover. Or a theft of a theft. I kind of wanted to pay my dues, although it’s so obscure no one will ever know unless I explain it. So, I don’t know if my dues are really paid.”\n\n<b>“Thrill”</b>\n“This is basically one of the newer emotions that we try to convey with this record. It’s not imposing, it’s not dark and brooding or ominous. It’s basically still aggressive, but most of all excited. I think that’s an emotion that I’ve always wanted to convey with this band, and I think I finally got to do it on this record. I wouldn’t even say it’s a metal song. I’d say it’s more like a rock song.”\n\n<b>“une ville vide”</b>\n“I go on long walks at night. And the town I live in is quite sleepy, so it’s empty a lot of the time, which I find one of the nicest feelings. I wanted to convey that feeling of being in between these looming buildings, and you kind of feel like a little mouse in a huge, strange world. There’s freedom to that, and that’s what I wanted to convey with this instrumental. Also, it’s kind of a palate cleanser between songs.”\n\n<b>“Sugarcoat”</b>\n“That’s another fun one. It’s such a simple song, and it almost veers into the goofy. There’re no solos, there’s no, ‘What is that rhythm structure?’ It’s kind of just a banger. It’s silly, and it’s supposed to be that. It’s one of those songs, when I wrote it, I giggled to myself and said, ‘This is going to be so much fun live.’ And the times we’ve played it live, by the last part of it, people are just singing that little theme thing. That just makes me almost burst with glee.”\n\n<b>“Solace”</b>\n“In many ways, this is the saddest song I’ve ever written. I honestly wasn’t sure if it would make it onto this record because I thought it was too much of a whiplash moment. But now I think of it as kind of a necessity to balance things out. And it took me a really long time to write this one. I just wanted to get everything right, and I’m really happy with the result. It’s inspired by a lot of Portishead and this song The Book of Knots did with Mike Patton called ‘Planemo.’ I just wanted to replicate that absolute dire, heart-wrenching situation. I’m not sure if I can do that one live because I might cry.”\n\n<b>“Hide in Shade”</b>\n“That’s basically vintage Zeal & Ardor because it’s the only song that’s older. It’s not only a callback—it’s actually from that time. It just never really got a home on an album until this one because I had to arrange it properly. So, it’s been brewing and stewing for a while. It’s just kind of a reminder of where we come from.” \n\n<b>“to my ilk”</b>\n“Another not-so-heavy track. I think this is the softest record we put out thus far, and I’m really happy with it in terms of how the three voices that we have are featured on it. It’s very distinct. It’s not too far from what people expect of us, but it kind of veers in a distinct direction. I mean, we could be blamed for selling out or whatever because it’s such a poppy track. But I think it still has this emotionality that is very much us. That can’t be denied. It’s not the best track to get the party started, but it’s still a good one.”","short":"Manuel Gagneux on the band’s fourth album: “It’s our most eclectic record.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5f/f3/ed/5ff3eddf-73b1-10d7-46f6-15f35ff44a0c/198391197550.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"bfcec6","textColor4":"99a59e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/greif/1736162572","playParams":{"id":"1736162572","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1chw1DFmefTueG1VbNVoGN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736162572/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1130919616","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1130919616?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724402100338}}},"1737990072":{"id":"1737990072","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737990072?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fontaines-d-c/1341828470","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/13/0d/a4/130da49f-ae84-506d-e410-5b3dd008a2a4/Jobd7ce14c9-54dc-45a4-bd51-c01f44f6db9a-166199132-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323009892_1739471124-Time1712945157511.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fdd9fb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172028"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cbdced","textColor2":"fdd9fb","textColor4":"cac0ea","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172028","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a4/f1/75/a4f17541-b6c2-0e9a-e16d-07d601cef952/deed1914-ab01-43af-a0cc-3388e63a69ce.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3a8b5","textColor2":"e3b994","textColor4":"ba997f","textColor1":"dbcbd8","bgColor":"151828","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ba/2d/5c/ba2d5c78-71df-cdf1-1922-bf19f69c862b/Job6c514ef7-0ed3-4c65-83f1-c5dcf4cf8568-166199133-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323009891_1739471125-Time1712951641467.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","96fd41"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172028"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cadbe8","textColor2":"96fd41","textColor4":"78dc55","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172028","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a4/b8/ee/a4b8ee90-90f1-d27d-7d57-25c0cc72ac05/8fc32c79-81d1-432e-b516-27482fbd9187.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d59bcb","textColor2":"ff86d1","textColor4":"d57dbe","textColor1":"ffabe0","bgColor":"315c76","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c0/44/61/c0446175-d2ad-8201-cf20-dc46b1522f96/c969da92-5f3b-4b35-8f35-682790237ebd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7793c8","textColor2":"fe7aaa","textColor4":"cc6c9f","textColor1":"94aadd","bgColor":"033574","hasP3":false}},"name":"Romance","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fontaines D.C.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Perhaps more so than any other Irish band of their generation, Fontaines D.C.’s first three albums were intrinsically linked to their homeland. Their debut, 2019’s <i>Dogrel</i>, was a bolshy, drizzle-soaked love letter to the streets of Dublin, while Brendan Behan-name-checking follow-up <i>A Hero’s Death</i> detailed the group’s on-the-road alienation and estrangement from home. And 2022’s <i>Skinty Fia</i> viewed Ireland from the complicated perspective of no longer actually being there. \n\nOn their fourth album, however, Fontaines D.C. have shifted their attention elsewhere. <i>Romance</i> finds the five-piece wandering in a futuristic dystopia inspired by Japanese manga classic <i>Akira</i>, Paolo Sorrentino’s 2013 film <i>La Grande Bellezza</i>, and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn’s <i>Pusher</i> films. “We didn’t set out to make a trilogy of albums but that’s sort of what happened,” drummer Tom Coll tells Apple Music of those first three records. “They were such a tight world, and this time we wanted to step outside of it and change it up. A big inspiration for this record was going to Tokyo for the first time. It’s such a visual, neon-filled, supermodern city. It was so inspiring. It brought in all these new visual references to the creative process for the first time.”\n\nRecorded with Arctic Monkeys producer James Ford (their previous three albums were all made with Dan Carey), <i>Romance</i> also brings in a whole new palette of sounds and colors to the band’s work. From the clanking apocalyptic dread of the opening title track, hip-hop-inspired first single “Starburster,” and the warped grunge and shoegaze hybrids of “Here’s the Thing” and “Sundowner,” it opens a whole new chapter for Fontaines D.C., while still finding time for classic indie rock anthems such as “Favourite”’s wistful volley of guitars or the Nirvana-like “Death Kink.” “Every album we do feels like a huge step in one direction for us, but <i>Romance</i> is probably a little bit more outside of our previous records,” says Coll. “It’s exciting to surprise people.” Read on as he dissects <i>Romance</i>, one track at a time. \n\n<b>“Romance”</b>\n“This is one that we wrote really late at night in the studio. It just fell out of us. It was one of those real moments of feeling, ‘Right, that’s the first track on the album.’ It’s kind of like a palate cleanser for everything that’s come before. It’s like the opening scene. I feel like every time we’ve done a record there’s been one tune that’s always stuck out like, ‘This is our opening gambit...’”\n\n<b>“Starburster”</b>\n“Grian [Chatten, singer] wrote most of this tune on his laptop, so there were lots of chopped-up strings and stuff—it was quite a hip-hop creative process. It’s probably the song that is furthest away from the old us on this album. This tune was the first single and we always try and shock people a bit. It’s fun to do that.”\n\n<b>“Here’s the Thing”</b>\n“This was written in the last hour of being in the studio. We had maybe 12 or 13 tracks ready to go and just started jamming, and it presented itself in an hour. [Guitarist Conor] Curley had this really gnarly, ’90s, piercing tone, and it just went from there.”\n\n<b>“Desire”</b>\n“This has been knocking around for ages. It was one of those tunes that took so many goes to get to where it was meant to sit. It started as a band setup and then we went really electronic with it. Then in the studio, we took it all back. It took a while for it to sit properly. Grian did 20 or 30 vocal layers on that, he really arranged it in an amazing way. Carlos [O’Connell, guitarist] and Grian were the main string arrangers on this record. This was the first record where we actually got a string quartet in—before, people would just send it over. So being able to sit in the room and watch a string quartet take center stage on a song was amazing.”\n\n<b>“In the Modern World”</b>\n“Grian wrote this song when he was in LA. He was really inspired by Lana Del Rey and stuff like that. Hollywood and the glitz and the glamour, but it’s actually this decrepit place. It’s that whole idea of faded glamour.”\n\n<b>“Bug”</b>\n“This felt like a really easy song for us to write. That kind of buzzy, all-of-us-in-the-same-room tune. I really fought for this one to be on the record. I feel like, with songs like that, trying to skew them and put a spin on them that they don’t need is overwriting. If it feels right then there’s no point in laboring over it. That song is what it is and it’s great. It’s going to be amazing live.”\n\n<b>“Motorcycle Boy”</b>\n“This one is inspired by The Smashing Pumpkins a bit. We actually recorded it six months before the rest of the album. This tune was the real genesis of the record and us finding a path and being like, ‘OK, we can explore down here...’ That was one that really set the wheels in motion for the album. It really informed where we were going.”\n\n<b>“Sundowner”</b>\n“On this album, we were probably coming from more singular points than we have before. A lot of the lads brought in tunes that were pretty much there. I was sharing a room with Curley in London, and he was working on this really shoegaze-inspired tune for ages. I think he always thought that Grian would sing it, but when he put down the guide vocals in the studio it sounded great. We were all like, ‘You are singing this now.’”\n\n<b>“Horseness Is the Whatness”</b>\n“Carlos sent me a demo of that tune ages and ages ago. It was just him on an acoustic, and it was such a powerful lyric. I think it’s amazing. We had to kind of deconstruct it and build it back up again in terms of making it fit for this record. Carlos had made three or four drum loops for me and it was a really fun experience to try and recreate that. I don’t know how we’re going to play it live but we’ll sort it out!”\n\n<b>“Death Kink”</b>\n“Again, this came from one of the jams of us setting up for a studio session. It’s another one of those band-in-a-room-jamming-out kind of tunes. On tour in America, we really honed where everything should sit in the set. This is going to be such a fun tune to play live. We’ve started playing it already and it’s been so sick.”\n\n<b>“Favourite”</b>\n“‘Favourite’ was another one we wrote when we were rehearsing. It happened pretty much as it is now. We were kind of nervous about touching it again for the album because that first recording was so good. That’s the song that hung around in our camp for the longest. When we write songs on tour, often we end up getting bored of them over time but ‘Favourite’ really stuck. We had a lot of conversations about the order on this album and I felt it was really important to move from ‘Romance’ to ‘Favourite.’ It feels like a journey from darkness into light, and finishing on ‘Favourite’ leaves it in a good spot.”","short":"“It’s exciting to surprise people”: Fontaines D.C. unveil album

Artists","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Bryce Dessner has been lead guitarist of acclaimed US rock group The National since it was founded in 1999. Yet, almost in direct parallel, he has forged a reputation as one of classical and film music’s most innovative and imaginative composers. Listening to Dessner’s music, written for a range of ensembles, orchestras, and soloists, is to witness a creative chameleon, an artist whose curiosity helps him constantly to evolve, to experiment—and to surprise. \n\n“I grew up playing Bach and Renaissance music, along with American folk music,” Dessner tells Apple Music Classical. “So I guess I’m a bit of a scavenger. I’m definitely inspired by many different things.” Those inspirations continued to come thick and fast during his years of formal music training at Yale in the late 1990s where he encountered composer Ingram Marshall and, soon after, the likes of Joan Tower, Ned Rorem, Steve Reich, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe (“her music is far more rock ’n’ roll than mine!”). \n\nIn many ways <i>Solos</i>, an album of music for solo instruments performed by a stellar lineup of artists, functions as a manifesto for Bryce Dessner’s musical loves and philosophies. “These pieces add up to something like a self-portrait, in a way,” says Dessner. “It's pretty bare, but I think that there's a lot of me in here, both simple and complex, and physical music, and music that is more architected.”\n\nSo there’s Bach in <i>Song for Ainola</i> and shades of Arvo Pärt in the three-movement <i>Ornament and Crime</i>; and in the rough-hewn, eastern-flavored <i>Delphica</i>, Dessner demonstrates an almost physical relationship with his instruments, “in the way a choreographer works with a dancer,” as he explains. It’s an approach, he continues, that stems from “watching Sonic Youth play electric guitar in clubs when I was 18, standing at the front, sweating.”\n\nBut many of the pieces, such as the <i>Tuusula</i> for cello, or the plaintive piano work <i>Song for Octave</i>, possess elements of improvisation, rooted in the idea that music’s most captivating moments are often never written down. “You find quite sophisticated, complex systems being devised by people who are outside of the notation world,” he says of his experiences in the worlds of pop and rock. “I like that language of feeling the paint is still drying.” \n\nHere, Bryce Dessner acts as our exclusive guide through each piece on <i>Solos</i>.\n\n<b>Lullaby for Jacques et Brune</b>\n“My wife is French and is the godmother of two twins, Jacques and Brune, who our friend had on her own. I wrote this for them before they were born, as a gift. It has a lyrical, lilting style, and the chords and the sense of time signature are very Satie-influenced. It has a kind of effortless feeling. It’s played here by Katia Labèque who’s a close friend and, probably more than anyone else, has done my music for years now. I’m really lucky, because she’s one of the great French pianists.”\n\n<b>Francis</b>\n“<i>Francis</i> is from a score I did for the Fernando Meirelles film <i>The Two Popes</i>, which was a really wonderful experience. At that time, I hadn’t done tons of film music. I was on set with Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins in Rome, and I wrote this piece, which goes back to my classical guitar roots. It feels almost like Barrios or one of Albéniz’s arrangements—it has a Spanish guitar feel, and there’s something very simple, but kind of timeless about it.”\n\n<b>Tuusula</b>\n“In terms of my own compositional language, <i>Tuusula</i> is the closest to my art on this record. I have a long love affair with the cello. If I could have played a different instrument, it would have been the cello.\n\n“Several years ago I was asked by the Finnish violinist Pekka Kuusisto, who’s featured on the album, to do a summer residency in Finland at Sibelius’ house, Ainola, by Lake Tuusula. I was sitting in a cabin on the same lake, staring out during the day, and I wrote this in a week for the German cellist Nicolas Altstaedt who premiered it in the church where Sibelius and his fiancée Aino were married. \n\n“The music has little to do with Sibelius, though. It has these kind of songlike patterns; and then these really ferocious, almost more Bartókian, kind of Kurtág, aggressive celloistic elements. It’s a very physical piece.”\n\n<b>Song for Octave</b>\n“I was asked by pianist Bertrand Chamayou to compose a lullaby for his album several years ago, and I wrote this for my son, Octave, who is now seven. At the time, I think he was two or three, and I had started various pieces and then just happened upon this really sweet, simple theme.”\n\n<b>Tromp Miniature</b>\n“This was a commission from the TROMP Percussion Eindhoven competition—20 percussionists had to learn this piece. It’s a bit of a poem for percussion, with some lyrical elements and, because it was written for a competition, one or two virtuosic passages.”\n\n<b>Ornament and Crime I, II, & III</b>\n“<i>Ornament and Crime</i> was a commission for my friend, Pekka Kuusisto, a violinist I feel a lot of kinship with. The first movement is the most virtuosic—it’s almost as if you took a Bach fugue or gigue and made it more jagged and intense, with sort of sharp edges. The second movement has a very almost kind of mystical, melodic feeling about it, very minimal, almost like a drone on an open string. And the third resembles something that in the past I might have played on guitar. It shares elements with Bach’s solo cello suites, or even a Philip Glass piano piece. It’s quite virtuosic but very fluid.”\n\n<b>A Good Person</b>\n“This was a theme for a film, which then Katia Labèque started playing—I felt that it fitted on this album. It’s got a simple idea that can kind of repeat, and it has an effortless feeling about it.”\n\n<b>On a Wire</b>\n“Lucky me to able to work with some of the world’s greatest musicians! A few years ago harpist Lavinia Meijer recorded a version of <i>Ornament and Crime</i> for her album <i>The Glass Effect</i>. She’s an exceptional Korean-born Dutch harpist, and she asked me to write a piece for harp and electronics.\n\n“For years I had performed Steve Reich’s <i>Electric Counterpoint</i> which features nine pre-recorded parts with one live part, and so I was a little bit inspired by that. In this piece, Lavinia is playing percussion on the harp, and also playing bass lines, melodies, and very fast arpeggio patterns.”\n\n<b>Walls</b>\n“<i>Walls</i> is another solo guitar piece—I thought it was important to include something of me playing on this album. That’s really the point of origin of this whole thing: before anyone would play my music, I was living in Paris in the late ’90s, writing pieces for solo guitar that I could play myself.\n\n“This piece comes from having grown up playing Bach and John Dowland. And then, eventually, Spanish pieces and transcriptions by people like Granados and Albéniz, as well as Villa-Lobos, which I really loved.”\n\n<b>Delphica I & II</b>\n“<i>Delphica</i> is a bit of a nod towards my wife Pauline. Her name is Pauline de Lassus—she’s a folk singer and comes from an old musical family where her great-grandfather was the 19th-century French composer Gounod, but her ancestor is also the Italian Renaissance composer Orlando di Lasso. ‘Delphica’ is the title of one of Lasso’s motets, and this piece has some of that Renaissance music in it as source material.”\n\n<b>Ornament III Piano</b>\n“<i>Ornament and Crime</i> has been adapted and performed a fair amount. A pianist a few years ago did it in concert and it really works well, so for this album I asked Katia to perform a different version of it on solo piano. I think it works really well and quite differently from the violin version.”\n\n<b>Song for Ainola</b>\n“This is a piece that’s related to a moment, a sort of snapshot from inside <i>Tuusula</i>. There’s a moment in that larger cello work, which is almost more like a song that comes back, so I created a kind of separate Bach-like arpeggio, essentially, that could be played on its own by cellist Anastasia Kobekina. The idea was to have a standalone piece, almost like a little vignette—something she could play as an encore.”","short":"Bryce Dessner: “These pieces kind of add up to something like a self-portrait.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4c/62/40/4c624049-e75f-b872-1c87-94f261838726/196871957199.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"90babc","textColor2":"9dd9d1","textColor4":"82b2b5","textColor1":"afe2da","bgColor":"141743","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/solos/1744019634","playParams":{"id":"1744019634","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0G9KyBBCazDJXxFSHhynn3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744019634/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724386432934}}},"1744255381":{"id":"1744255381","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744255381?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lainey-wilson/907166363","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/18/55/37/185537c6-958a-4863-01a6-9e26db05449d/Jobcbbe706b-d58f-4efb-af1c-74dedbe6a33a-168289455-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_327343076_1773463072-Time1715979399187.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d1c6a3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"120f02"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b5ae97","textColor2":"d1c6a3","textColor4":"aea485","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"120f02","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a0/44/98/a0449805-e1ea-9dd7-dd2d-f83d061f484b/70bcae84-0b2f-4aff-b229-24f3ec97e83d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1e1d1a","textColor2":"030301","textColor4":"1e1d1a","textColor1":"030301","bgColor":"8b857d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/68/f7/f8/68f7f8b4-c996-356f-9b4f-fadb88408807/Job71db5d7b-6825-4c3c-8bb7-c80d5028bd6d-168072947-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_326938292_1769095704-Time1715796121952.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2a241a","textColor2":"2c1803","textColor4":"42311b","textColor1":"0d0901","bgColor":"9d937b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/24/ce/8a/24ce8a89-ae06-d60d-0f94-7d81a9cef3d0/e6dcfd30-03b9-4b6c-9dbf-358805b3c7eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"201e1a","textColor2":"24160a","textColor4":"392c20","textColor1":"050503","bgColor":"8c8578","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a1/09/c3/a109c35c-b641-b84d-ad83-56bc6f302386/88091220-4136-43bc-8740-a7530053ee97.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"41403e","textColor2":"2d2f31","textColor4":"4d4c4d","textColor1":"1e1f1f","bgColor":"cdc2bc","hasP3":false}},"name":"Whirlwind","artistName":"Lainey Wilson","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Lainey Wilson couldn’t have chosen a more fitting title for her fifth studio album. The wildly beloved country singer-songwriter’s rise to fame has surely been a whirlwind, catapulting the small-town Louisiana native from relative obscurity to stardom in just a few short years. That success was not earned overnight, though, as Wilson had put in nearly a decade of work before breaking out with <i>Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’</i> in 2021. “I felt like my life was changing at 190 miles an hour and I was just trying to keep one foot on the ground,” Wilson tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But I think those 10 years of nothing happening for me prepared me for my life changing super fast.”\n\n<i>Whirlwind</i> is Wilson at the height of her powers, mixing pop, rock, and soul into her already inimitable brand of traditionally informed country. Highlights include the title track, a light and groovy celebration of reckless love, and “Devil Don’t Go There,” a heartbreak ballad that lets Wilson lean into the emotive side of her versatile voice. The Miranda Lambert duet “Good Horses” connects two generations of country spitfires, with dusky production to emphasize the singers’ undeniable vocal chemistry. Wilson’s band sounds better than ever, too, which she attributes to years spent touring relentlessly and working toward a shared dream. “They are ride or die,” she says. “I mean, these guys are the ones that ate dirt with me. And I think it’s really important to keep the people close that you ate dirt with. They know you, they know how bad you want it. They want it just as bad. They love you for you. They sacrifice so much to be out there on the road with you.” Below, Wilson gives insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Whirlwind”</b>\n“I finally found a guy that gives me a run for my money. And he’s my biggest cheerleader. He’s just a good person. And he knows how important chasing down a dream is, because even when he was a little boy, football was his life. He did it and he tried out for the Steelers and made the team. And so he achieved what he set out to do. And so he knows. We met at a time where he was still playing with them, but then it all changed. So it was weird. It was like his life was changing as my life was changing and we were going different directions. So, yeah, life for us is a whirlwind.”\n\n<b>“Middle of It”</b>\n“We had actually just got nominated for Entertainer of the Year for the CMAs. And I had not been at my house in Nashville, and I didn’t have furniture in my house for months. We don’t need a couch, we’re not here. So my friends The Heart Wranglers came over and they just said, ‘Let’s do a heart check.’ And they’re like, ‘What’s going on? Where are you at? How you feel? Where’s your head?’ I sat on the floor and I just said, ‘I feel like I’m just smack-dab in the middle of it. It’s a blur to me where it started, where it’s going to end up. I just can’t hardly tell.’ And then we just started talking about how that’s really what all this is about anyway. That’s the beauty of it.”\n\n<b>“Whiskey Colored Crayon”</b>\n“That song actually came from a word exercise that my co-writer [Josh Kear] did. I’ll probably get this wrong, but every morning before he writes songs, he writes a list of things. And say the first list that he wrote was ‘things that I hate’ and maybe it’s lettuce or greens or whiskey or whatever. And then he writes a list of random things, things that you can use to create. He mix-mashed these words and he was like, ‘Well, I’ve got this whiskey-colored crayon,’ and we got to thinking about the storyline of this. And we came up with, ‘Okay, let’s think about a young student, the colored crayon part. Okay, and how could we tell a story about a little boy who goes through some things at home that most people don’t know about?’ We created the story. And for me, again, putting myself into the shoes of somebody else takes me out of my mess for a minute and gives me a fresh and new perspective. And I left that songwriting session, after we told this story, just feeling grateful.”","short":"A Nashville star at the height of her powers, processing the

A Woman","artistName":"Thomas Rhett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Seven albums into his career, Thomas Rhett is in a comfortable place. The country superstar has more No. 1 hits than he can count on two hands, and also found happiness offstage with his wife and children, who serve as a primary inspiration for this follow-up to 2022’s <i>Where We Started</i>. Comfort doesn’t mean complacency, though, and on <i>About a Woman</i> Rhett digs more deeply into his personal experiences, sharing intimate stories about marriage, parenthood, and nostalgia for one’s youth.\n\n“What Could Go Right” is a tender portrait of friendship growing into love, inspired by Rhett’s own marriage. “Church” taps into Rhett’s longtime love of fellow singer-songwriter Eric Church, connecting the Chief’s music to youthful romance. “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman” is a slinky groove with twangy flourishes, reminiscent of earlier Rhett tracks like “It Goes Like This” and “Craving You.” Rhett caps the record with “I Could Spend Forever Loving You,” a spare and sincere love song that’s sure to show up on wedding playlists. Below, he talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Overdrive”</b>\n“A song like ‘Overdrive’ would be directly centered towards high school kids—and then people that even, maybe, were high school sweethearts or got back together later in life—to go to reminisce on how innocent that time was. And how just because you’re kind of young, dumb, and reckless at 16 doesn’t mean that you can’t also still be there when you’re 35 or 55.”\n\n<b>“Gone Country”</b>\n“I wish I could say that I had this crazy story of dating this girl that flew in from Chicago and all these things, but I don’t have that story. For me, that song came about, and I’ve shared this story a couple of times, but just being at [Nashville’s] BNA [airport] and realizing how massive our genre has become. For me, it’s always been massive because it’s what I’ve done for a living and what I’ve been so inundated with. Even people that did not grow up country, they’re just like, ‘I really like this way of living.’ You know what I mean? And that’s sort of where the inspiration from that song came from.”\n\n<b>“Church”</b>\n“The first two Eric Church records—I remember getting my first truck at 16, and Eric Church then was [like] listening to Zach Bryan now. It was kind of underground. He was the outlaw. He would sing about words that you couldn’t say on mainstream radio, all this stuff. So, me and all my buddies, that was our favorite. So, the original way this song got pitched to me was, it ended in heartbreak, like the guy and the girl never saw each other again, but he always reminisced over that time that they bonded over Eric Church. And so, I came in on the back half and just rewrote the bridge and the last chorus, because [my story with my wife] ended differently.”\n\n<b>“What Could Go Right”</b>\n“I’ve tried to write that song a million different times, and it has always come out extremely corny and extremely cheesy. And a couple of the guys in the group are dating. One’s married and has kids and all this kind of stuff. And I was telling them about this night that I had with [my wife] Lauren when I was like 21 years old. [We] both were in long relationships with other people, and both kind of ended our relationship with other people at the same time. But there was always, in the back of my mind, this wonder of like, ‘I wonder if we could ever date again.’ You know what I mean? Because we dated a little bit in high school. That whole song, I was telling the guys on the bus this story, and my buddy John is just writing, taking notes, soaking it all in. And I went to go get some food, and I came back, and they had written the verse and the chorus, and they were like, ‘Does this do it for you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s amazing.’”\n\n<b>“I Could Spend Forever Loving You”</b>\n“I think when I dream of what me and Lauren are going to look like and be doing at 70 years old, all I see is a front porch and a river and a cup of coffee. You know what I’m saying? So, I think it’s always good to dream in your marriage. It’s always good to kind of dream about the future. It’s OK to regret the past. Don’t harp on it, but also, it’s fun to reminisce on the past. Your youth doesn’t have to die because you have kids. Your youth doesn’t have to die just because you’ve been married for 10 years. And it really is a testament to knowing how much love can grow if you’ll allow it.”","short":"The country vet gets nostalgic on his seventh

n' Sweet","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Sabrina Carpenter","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Some people kill their nemeses with kindness; Sabrina Carpenter, the breakout pop star of summer 2024, takes the opposite tack, shooting withering one-liners at loser exes via featherlight melodies, a wink and a smile. The former Disney Channel star began her music career at age 15 with her 2014 debut single “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying.” Now 25, the singer-songwriter is making the catchiest, funniest, and most honest music of her career at a moment when all the world’s watching. But on songs like “Please Please Please,” on which she begs her boyfriend not to embarrass her (again), she’s poking fun at herself, too. “A lot of what I really love about this album is the accountability,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I will call myself out just as much as I will call out someone else.”\n\nIt’s not because Carpenter’s “vertically challenged,” as she puts it, that she named her sixth album <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>. “I thought about some of these relationships, how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most,” she tells Lowe. “And I thought about the way that I respond to situations: Sometimes it is very nice, and sometimes it’s not very nice.” Hence songs like “Dumb & Poetic,” a gentle acoustic ballad that’s also a blistering takedown of a guy who masks his sleazy tendencies with therapy buzzwords and a highbrow record collection, or the twangy, hilarious “Slim Pickins,” on which she croons: “Jesus, what’s a girl to do?/This boy doesn’t even know the difference between there, their, and they are/Yet he’s naked in my room.”\n\nWith good humor and good taste (channeling Rilo Kiley here, Kacey Musgraves there, and on “Sharpest Tool,” a bit of The Postal Service), Carpenter reframes heartbreak through the lens of life’s absurdity. “When you’re at this point in your life where you’re almost at your wits’ end, everything is funny,” Carpenter tells Lowe. “So much of this album was made in the moments where there was something that I just couldn’t stop laughing about. And I was like, well, that might as well just be a whole song.” \n\nCarpenter wrote a good deal of the album on an 11-day trip to a tiny town in rural France, where the isolation unlocked her brutally honest side, resulting in unprecedentedly vulnerable music and one song she readily admits shouldn’t work on paper but hits anyway: “Espresso,” the song that catapulted her career with four delightfully strange-sounding words: “That’s that me espresso.” “There really are no rules to the things you say,” she tells Lowe on the songwriting process. “You’re just like, what sounds awesome? What feels awesome? And what gets the story across, whatever story that is?” Still, she’s painted herself in a bit of a corner when it comes to placing an order at coffee shops worldwide: “They’re just waiting for me to say it,” she laughs. “And I’m like, ‘Tea.’”","short":"Please, please, please enjoy the year’s most anticipated pop album."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f6/15/d0/f615d0ab-e0c4-575d-907e-1cc084642357/24UMGIM61704.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"d19c7f","textColor2":"e1b281","textColor4":"b99b84","textColor1":"ffb47b","bgColor":"193f91","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/short-n-sweet/1750307020","playParams":{"id":"1750307020","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3iPSVi54hsacKKl1xIR2eH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750307020/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"390647681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/390647681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724416480572}}},"1750594404":{"id":"1750594404","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750594404?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Classical","Classical Crossover"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laurie-anderson/187152","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Amelia","artistName":"Laurie Anderson","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The art-pop icon unveils a new masterpiece, with help from ANOHNI."},"artwork":{"width":3750,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f2/53/bd/f253bdd4-cd4e-affc-91c9-c8380d403cb2/075597904772.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3750,"textColor3":"c2b469","textColor2":"cecece","textColor4":"a6a6a6","textColor1":"f1df82","bgColor":"070908","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/amelia/1750594404","playParams":{"id":"1750594404","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750594404/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"187152","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/187152?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724398453177}}},"1750627987":{"id":"1750627987","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750627987?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/forest-claudette/1630262755","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"& Stone Between -

Opener “She Looked Like Me!” begins innocently enough, with hushed vocals from Tenenbaum backed by twinkling keys and a buzzing bass synth. Before long, though, massive drum hits give the song an unrelenting pulse, blending the energy of a hyperpop anthem with the rise-and-fall restraint of a classic-rock song.\n\n“Image” is a disco-inspired cut that dances around synths that speed up and slow down according to their own whimsy, as Tenenbaum’s voice floats effortlessly above the fray. “What's the best you’ve got?/I forgot all my common sense/I need all the common sense/Time to start the clock from the top,” she sings, letting the feel-good vibes of the club-ready instrumental imbue her abstract lyrics with visceral meaning. Even when the duo concoct songs that fear the future or suggest wariness at where the world is headed, the jams suggest that the AI apocalypse will still feature plenty of dancing.","short":"The duo’s second album picks up where their debut left off, only bigger."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8f/e3/6c/8fe36c7a-d280-2d0e-8e67-4ee0fd4523cd/810090095448.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cec6ce","textColor2":"6fb1d3","textColor4":"5e93b3","textColor1":"faf1f4","bgColor":"1c1b33","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/imaginal-disk/1751414757","playParams":{"id":"1751414757","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4HTy9WFTYooRjE9giTmzAF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751414757/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1119954914","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1119954914?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724413123344}}},"1751533433":{"id":"1751533433","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751533433?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Folk"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/colby-acuff/1143128371","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/94/1f/ca/941fca95-bdf1-f615-912c-66baf5a6f671/Job263fd131-b289-4a48-b50e-f9dfd098eabf-170088454-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331139221_1805016680-Time1718384321585.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","181512"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"f8f9f8"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"403d3a","textColor2":"181512","textColor4":"43403d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f8f9f8","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/10/28/fd/1028fd2f-9d03-9ede-34cc-b547f9acc6e1/Job3886c855-a3a0-4c51-bf80-adbd18c0dcc0-170088455-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_331139222_1805016679-Time1718388334462.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"393632","textColor2":"171311","textColor4":"423f3c","textColor1":"0c0804","bgColor":"edede8","hasP3":false}},"name":"American Son","artistName":"Colby Acuff","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Heartland honesty and rootsy relatability from the Idaho native."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5a/3d/2a/5a3d2a21-794e-0928-89d7-d7b063ba69eb/196872058109.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"47413d","textColor2":"1d1916","textColor4":"46423f","textColor1":"1e1714","bgColor":"ebe8e3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-son/1751533433","playParams":{"id":"1751533433","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3AbDe8cQYZwtJOmJc6mlXG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751533433/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1143128371","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1143128371?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724389372700}}},"1753022586":{"id":"1753022586","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753022586?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/emily-wurramara/1092994200","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5c/7e/ff/5c7effca-5cc8-d6ed-f050-61614891e7a7/2a14082f-57d0-4689-8fc9-ac977c3d69a1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7a086","textColor2":"d3bf87","textColor4":"ac9c6f","textColor1":"e1c4a3","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/57/77/bd/5777bdcc-31ba-6383-af63-193cf96eba88/86654d81-ec49-4dee-a6e3-aaedcf462e32.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cec3c3","textColor2":"f9b9a3","textColor4":"d19e8e","textColor1":"f5e6e5","bgColor":"30343c","hasP3":false}},"name":"NARA","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Emily Wurramara","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“What’s more important than sharing your story?” sings Emily Wurramara on her second album. Arriving six years after her 2018 debut, it finds the Warnindhilyagwa songwriter in a markedly different place. She’s now a mother and a published author—thanks to her 2024 children’s book <i>Marringa Lullaby</i>, co-written with Sylvia Wurramarrba Tkac—and she lost her Brisbane home in a devastating fire in 2019. Taking its title from the Anindilyakwa word for “nothing,” <i>NARA</i> finds strength in that hard-earned life experience. \n\nIt also branches out from the folk/roots direction heard on 2018’s <i>Milyakburra</i>, making fruitful forays into several other genres. Clubby beats and a disco hook punctuate “DTMN” (shorthand for “Don’t tell me nothin’”), while “Lordy Lordy” sees Gumbaynggirr man Tasman Keith add heavily treated vocals to a soul-searching dance anthem with the affecting refrain “Lordy, Lordy, what do we do now?”\n\nOther guests include Lisa Mitchell on the Pacific Islands-influenced “See Me There,” Wiradjuri man Zeppelin Hamilton (Velvet Trip) on the low-lit ballad “WWGBH” (“When we go back home”), and Wurramara’s younger brother Arringarri, making his musical debut on the duet “STFAFM” (“Stay the fuck away from me”). Other tunes incorporate ska guitar licks (“Boom Biddy Bye”), romantic neo-soul (“It’s You”), and rumbling rock catharsis (“FRIEND”).

Simon: Four Symphonic Works","artistName":"Gianandrea Noseda & National Symphony Orchestra, Kennedy Center","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview ","standard":"Songs of praise and lamentation rang in Carlos Simon’s ears long before he understood their meaning. The American composer was raised to their sounds in the Pentecostal church founded by his father in Atlanta, Georgia. They supplied the foundation for his development as a musician at ease in a multitude of genres, and furnished the faith that sustains his quest for social justice and an end to racial inequity. His art rises from his determination to heal division and challenge hatred. Its language embraces jazz, blues, gospel, and neoromantic classical styles to speak with the immediacy and impact of a great preacher.\n\n“It’s always good to spice things up and see how things can be different,” he tells Apple Music Classical. “That’s where I live, in the diversity of it all.” Simon’s compositions connect with the oppression that has blighted the lives of so many of his fellow African Americans and channel it in ways that, for all the pain of past and present, point to a better future. <i>Carlos Simon: Four Symphonic Works</i> offers a compelling portrait of his work as composer-in-residence at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and collaboration with the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) and its music director, Gianandrea Noseda.\n\n“The album reflects my recent musical growth,” he notes. “It’s also a reflection of the rapport I’ve developed with the NSO and Maestro Noseda, the trust we’ve built together. I really trust the orchestra—they’re family. And the same with Gianandrea, who’s such a phenomenal musician. He understands my music and knows how to get the players to perform it in a way that’s respectful and understanding.”\n\n<i>Carlos Simon: Four Symphonic Works</i> opens with <i>The Block</i>, a joyful orchestral showpiece that revels in bold instrumental colors and textures. <i>Tales: A Folklore Symphony</i> and <i>Songs of Separation</i> shine penetrating light on the African diaspora in the US, their suffering, strength, and seminal contributions to the nation’s culture. Simon’s music communicates powerful messages through its expressive eloquence.\n\n“It’s about delivering a message that people can receive. If you listen to American popular music from the 1960s, let’s say Marvin Gaye’s album <i>What’s Going On</i>, it feels good, it sounds good. But if you really listen to the message, it’s medicine. You inject that message in a way that people will feel good about, but also listen to and hopefully change how they’re thinking, how they’re moving in the world. I understand sometimes people will not receive the message and just receive the music. But if I do my job correctly, I hope it will enter in a subconscious way as part of the DNA, part of the spirit of the work.”\n\n<i>Wake Up!</i>, the album’s most recent composition, is a finely crafted concerto for orchestra. Simon drew inspiration for the piece from “Awake, asleep” by Nepali-language poet Rajendra Bhandari, a call for the “slumbering public” to embrace wakefulness and recognize the despot’s soothing message of peace for what it is—a lie. “<i>Wake Up!</i> may not be virtuosic,” says Simon, “but there’s a moment for each family of instruments to shine. It serves two purposes: to wake up the hall during the performance and to wake them up in terms of societal matters. It’s important, I think, for us to be awake to what’s happening in the world and aware of our power to change things.”","short":"Carlos Simon: “It’s important to be aware of our power to change things.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/61/f6/89/61f68953-69a3-e21d-6bbc-f8ba8f2b9cd1/0810038861852_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a3b3f","textColor2":"242334","textColor4":"504f5c","textColor1":"090a10","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/carlos-simon-four-symphonic-works/1754357250","playParams":{"id":"1754357250","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754357250/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1055154","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1055154?l=en-US"},{"id":"4346870","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4346870?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724397656501}}},"1754488939":{"id":"1754488939","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754488939?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/teenage-dads/1275699952","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a2/7d/b4/a27db46d-bdc1-4b02-24b5-ce2b47dd9456/dbff37f6-c3d9-47e6-ac1d-187ee166812b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c3630","textColor2":"2b211a","textColor4":"463e37","textColor1":"1f1711","bgColor":"b4b4ac","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/62/f2/d0/62f2d009-f450-1f23-d77e-5db405f979ad/edb5e674-b818-4e71-ad89-9ac43bfbc99a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"262326","textColor2":"090808","textColor4":"252527","textColor1":"0a0606","bgColor":"9597a5","hasP3":false}},"name":"Majordomo","artistName":"Teenage Dads","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Teenage Dads typically sling feel-good guitar pop that’s all too bright and breezy, an approach that’s won them fans around the world as well as the 2023 ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist of the Year. The Australian quartet continues that reliability on <i>Majordomo</i>, while also roughing up their sound in novel ways. Tunes like “Boyfriend” and “Boarding Pass” echo classic Phoenix in the best way, while “Speedracer” broadcasts romantic sincerity with the festival-ready chorus “You’re my, you’re my speedracer.”\n\nBut singer, guitarist, and keyboardist Jordan Finlay comes off bratty and insouciant on “Spiders,” mingling nursery rhyme lyrics with spacey synth flourishes and a palpable psych edge. He adopts a faux macho air on “The Commander” to underscore the album’s themes of taking control and seizing the day, before encouraging boisterous playacting on the quirky closer “A Day in the Life of a No Good Pirate.” Especially punchy is “Weaponz,” which channels the band’s longtime fondness for The Strokes into a darker, more propulsive attack. As with Teenage Dads’ past work, these songs are instantly catchy and yet stick around for quite a while, offering nuanced dimensions that might not reveal themselves on the first pass.","short":"The

Zeiders","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Relapse” has been a huge hit for Warren Zeiders, a college athlete turned country singer-songwriter whose 2023 album <i>Pretty Little Poison</i> announced a formidable new presence in the outsider-esque subgenre occupied by artists like Koe Wetzel, Cody Jinks, and Bailey Zimmerman. The song, which found viral streaming success and also titles this follow-up, blends ’90s-inspired alternative with gritty Southern rock, lyrically likening a tough-to-shake ex-flame to an addictive drug. \n\nThat kind of hardscrabble, hard-partying imagery permeates the record, like on the sludgy power ballad “Intoxicated,” on which Zeiders is a “fiend” for love, and “Addictions,” a plaintive ode to coping mechanisms.

Anna Clyne, however, is the exception who proves the rule. <i>Shorthand</i>, her new release for Sony Classical, is the fourth all-Clyne album to be released, and is boosted by the all-star soloist lineup appearing on it.\n\nCellist Yo-Yo Ma, mandolinist Avi Avital, and violinists Pekka Kuusisto and Colin Jacobsen all have solo spots, working alongside cutting-edge New York orchestra The Knights. It speaks volumes of Clyne’s reputation as a composer that the cream of today’s instrumental crop are keen to play her music. “It’s such a joy and honor to work with these extraordinary soloists,” she tells Apple Music Classical.\n\nAll four pieces on the album are written for strings, a medium close to Clyne’s heart. “I love writing for strings—the cello is my main instrument, so it’s something that I’m very comfortable doing,” she explains. Knowing in advance which soloist will premiere a particular piece is another major factor in how Clyne sets about writing it.\n\n“I’m a very collaborative composer, and I can’t help but be informed by the person I’m writing for. It’s a part of the process I really love,” she reveals. “When I was writing <i>Three Sisters</i> for Avi Avital, he showed me some of the techniques that are idiosyncratic to the mandolin. Once I had written it, I sent it to him and received feedback.” The symbiosis between Clyne and Avital is clearly audible in the concluding movement of <i>Three Sisters</i>, where nimble dance rhythms ricochet from soloist to orchestra and back again.\n\nPekka Kuusisto and Colin Jacobsen are the featured soloists for <i>Prince of Clouds</i>, a piece dating from 2012. “I love folk music, and when I was writing <i>Prince of Clouds</i> I put in a lot of double-stops and syncopated rhythms,” says Clyne. “And while Pekka and Colin are extraordinary virtuoso classical violinists, they also have a background in folk. I love that they brought to the recording that folk quality that I’d always imagined with this piece.”\n\n<i>Within Her Arms</i> has a very different emotional trajectory. Clyne wrote it in the aftermath of her mother’s unexpected passing in 2008, with the aim of finding “a closeness and peacefulness with her.” Scored for 15 individual string parts, Clyne stipulates that in live performance the players should occupy specific positions on stage, “so that the musical motifs move around the listener.”\n\nThis posed particular problems for the technical crew recording The Knights’ performance, but Clyne is delighted with how the spatial elements of the music have been rendered. “Jody Elff was our recording engineer, and we’ve worked together for 20 years on various projects,” she says. “He’s brought a really unusual recording technique for classical music to this album; we close-miked everything and really had control during the editing process.” \n\nClyne is especially enthusiastic about how <i>Within Her Arms</i>, and indeed the whole album, sounds in Spatial Audio. “We’re thrilled with the mixes,” she says. “I worked hard with Jody to get melodic gestures really moving and dancing around the ensemble. That’s something which has really been captured in what I think is a very special recording.”","short":"Composer Anna Clyne on the \"joy and honor\" of working with musical

lazy. Rather, when the Florida rapper released his 2024 album <i>Mr. Skii</i>, he was still only 18 years old. Tyler hasn’t known anything outside of rap, having dropped his first singles in 2022 and immediately finding success. On his debut album, he aims to show that the early hype wasn’t a fluke, blending whispered flows, earworm melodies, and clever punch lines into a sturdy effort that touches upon a number of rap subgenres.\n\nTake “Met Gala,” which cruises along with the warm synths and offbeat flow of plugg music. “7 AM in Munich” twinkles with vintage keyboard chords and artificial strings that bring to mind the ominous trap music prevalent in Tyler’s home state. It’s no mistake that he invites his fellow Floridian Kodak Black onto the track, showcasing the ways in which these Gators do things differently. The album is anchored by pre-release single “2 Slippery,” which features Bossman Dlow and finds the two MCs bouncing off each other like two of their own fans getting rowdy in a mosh pit.","short":"The 18-year-old Florida MC’s debut proves that the early hype was no fluke."},"artwork":{"width":1608,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4c/e1/b5/4ce1b536-0a5c-3e23-82f8-75e7e123a0d1/075679636904.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1608,"textColor3":"81c4c5","textColor2":"7bcddc","textColor4":"64a8b5","textColor1":"a0f0ef","bgColor":"05131b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mr-skii/1757938886","playParams":{"id":"1757938886","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/16m0Bonzn2KIGJv83V6Dvk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757938886/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1638445286","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1638445286?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724405987728}}},"1758172030":{"id":"1758172030","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758172030?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-mccall/728150300","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Porch Sessions - EP","artistName":"Taylor McCall","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/dc/e4/90/dce49023-ece6-773e-dce3-e159191a64c0/198588691007.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c65225","textColor2":"ec612c","textColor4":"be4e23","textColor1":"f6662e","bgColor":"070302","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-porch-sessions-ep/1758172030","playParams":{"id":"1758172030","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758172030/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"728150300","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/728150300?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724388991594}}},"1758696265":{"id":"1758696265","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758696265?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Romantic Era","Orchestral"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=411143268-1077566842","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Liszt: Faust Symphony","artistName":"Orchestre Philharmonique Royal de Liège & Gergely Madaras","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/18/7f/f9/187ff98c-ef34-7cde-ff24-f7bd97b09b9a/7318599925103.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cececd","textColor2":"ece7db","textColor4":"bfbbb0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0d0c07","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/liszt-faust-symphony/1758696265","playParams":{"id":"1758696265","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758696265/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"411143268","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/411143268?l=en-US"},{"id":"1077566842","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1077566842?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724375493051}}},"1759228376":{"id":"1759228376","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759228376?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stand-atlantic/981210694","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/64/38/a86438f5-da2b-0177-a747-7ebbf0a841e7/0d48614c-7f9c-4b16-a5d1-996037a98bb1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"adb3b5","textColor2":"d9b7ac","textColor4":"b39990","textColor1":"d2d8db","bgColor":"1d2021","hasP3":false}},"name":"WAS HERE","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Stand Atlantic","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“We are capable of doing whatever we want,” Stand Atlantic vocalist Bonnie Fraser tells Apple Music. “So that’s what we’re doing.” This shouldn’t come as a surprise to long-term fans of the Sydney outfit—they are, after all, a band that’s evolved from their pop-punk roots into one of rock’s most forward-thinking acts. On 2022’s <i>f.e.a.r.</i>, they embraced collaborations with artists outside of their scene such as emo rapper nothing,nowhere. and MC Tom The Mail Man, while incorporating a grab bag of styles including electronica and hip-hop. So it continues with their fourth album, <i>WAS HERE</i>, which further embellishes their sound with elements of reggae (“ROCKSTAR”), metal (“CRIMINAL”), and electropop (“GIRL$”).\n\n“We’ve never wanted to be put in a box, but this record was defining in that scenario,” says Fraser. “We were just like, ‘If this song is sounding pop as hell, let’s roll with it. If it’s sounding really heavy, let’s roll with it.’”\n\nThough the album’s name was inspired by the dressing room walls on which the band members have scrawled “Stand Atlantic Was Here,” it also has a deeper meaning that alludes to the diversity of the LP. “I knew going into this record we were going to push ourselves a lot more than we ever have,” admits Fraser. “So I wanted it to set the theme of like, ‘Just forget everything you know about our band.’ It’s almost as if we’ve died and been reborn, in a way.” \n\nLyrically, the record finds Fraser in typically unflinching form, working through issues such as sexual abuse (“17,” “17 // REPRIZE [ONE TAKE]”) and a crisis of confidence in her reason for being. “This album really helped me get back to how I was feeling and realize who I am again,” she offers. “It was really cathartic and therapeutic for me.” Here, the singer talks Apple Music through <i>WAS HERE</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“WAKE UP-SIT DOWN-SHUT UP”</b>\n“The song was written when I was living in Manchester. I was feeling very numb. I was questioning everything about who we are, why we are here. Like, ‘Is this my life?’ I was getting super existential.”\n\n<b>“FRENEMIES”</b>\n“I had this friend, and I didn’t know where the hell I stood with them. For some reason, they just weren’t interested in being my friend anymore. I did everything I could and extended every olive branch and still didn’t get anything back. I was like, ‘Is this what it feels like to have an enemy? I don’t know what I did wrong.’ It was a sad moment.”\n\n<b>“GIRL$” (with PVRIS and Bruses)</b>\n“I’ve wanted to have Lynn [Gunn, PVRIS vocalist] on a song for a while. Someone at the label sent her the track and I got a text from her and she was like, ‘Oh, my God, “GIRL$” is so good!’ She loved the track and jumped on. I really wanted a third person on the track too, and having another queer woman [Mexican artist Bruses] is awesome. I don’t think we ever really got into depth about the song’s meaning specifically, but I know that at least me and Lynn have talked about growing up as a woman in the music industry, or in society in general. But I didn’t want it to be too heavy, it’s supposed to be fun and uplifting and like, the girls are the best.”\n\n<b>“FREAKIN’ OUT”</b>\n“It’s one of my favorite tracks on the record. Lyrically, it just goes back to a dark spot that I was in—I was numbing myself subconsciously and in my behavior. I was partying and doing drugs and drinking without realizing that I was trying to cover up my feelings and not deal with the stuff that I was going through. Kind of heavy, I guess. But the song’s super fun, so that’s how we balance that out.”\n\n<b>“NOSE BLEED” (with Sueco)</b>\n“I don’t know why this reminds me of Quentin Tarantino, but there’s this little organ thing that’s going on. And I’m like, ‘If Quentin Tarantino was a fucking song, that’s what it would sound like.’ So I was thinking a lot about that and that’s where all the visuals lyrically came in—of ‘nosebleed’ and ‘twist the knife’ and basically dying over someone and doing everything that they want and being stuck in this toxic cycle that you cannot get out of. And you’re like, ‘Well, just leave me to die. I surrender to the cycle, and I’m never getting out of here.’”\n\n<b>“LOVE U ANYWAY”</b>\n“The relationship I was in, it felt like make-or-break at the time and I was like, ‘I’m gonna write a love song for the first time in my life.’ I don’t know if I was trying to trick myself into thinking everything is going to be OK or not. We ended up breaking up soon after I wrote it, which is awesome karma. So I’m never writing another love song in my life!”\n\n<b>“KISSIN’ KILLER COBRAS”</b>\n“I have a fair share of experience in toxic relationships. Sometimes when you’re in a toxic relationship, because that’s your normal, you lean into that and you think that’s normal to fight back or participate and perpetuate other toxic interactions. It kind of made me feel like I was becoming the monster that I was being presented with, if that makes sense. So I was trying to write this little urban legend of someone getting attacked by a snake and then becoming the fucking snake.”\n\n<b>“WARZ0NE”</b>\n“It’s basically me being like, ‘Fuck you’ to the keyboard warriors—people on the internet who have nothing better to do than send hate for no reason. They don’t know you personally, but they’ll judge everything about you based on stuff they see online or your songs. You can tell yourself that it doesn’t matter and not to read into it, but when you see it, it does hurt a little. It makes you so angry because you want to respond and roast the fuck out of them, but you have to just not. So the only way I could do that was write a song and be like, ‘Fuck you guys.’” \n\n<b>“CRIMINAL” (with Polaris)</b>\n“The way I write and the style of writing that I participate in is like, I need to feel something and then get it out. I feel like you can get caught in this cycle mentally of like, ‘Oh, I guess I need to fuck my life up a little bit to write these songs.’ And the people that are selling them don’t care about what you’ve gone through to get there as long as you get the song. And it feels a little weird. You’re making other people money based off the pain that you put yourself through. Then you also make money off it. It does feel a little bit criminal.”\n\n<b>“17”</b>\n“It’s something I’ve barely spoken about. And I’ve definitely never written about it. It’s about sexual assault; it was something that happened to me a few years ago. I thought I’d processed the whole thing properly, but one night on tour, I woke up in my bunk and I’d had a dream about this person, who I hadn’t thought about in a long time. I hadn’t thought about the situation in a long time. I woke up and I was so angry, and I was punching the bunk above me. After that I was like, ‘I think there’s some residual shit here that I need to process, or at least stop burying and actually talk about.’ The only way for me to do that is writing a song about it.” \n\n<b>“17 // REPRIZE [ONE TAKE]”</b>\n“The original song is where I was at the time and getting all that emotion out. Then the reprise is like, ‘This is where I’m at now. It’s not fine, all that stuff that you did, because I have to live with that for the rest of my life. But I’m doing OK, and you’re not clouding up my mind every day. And I’m not fucking my life up because of what you did.’ The interesting thing about that song was that we did that in one take. The lyrics just kind of came out in one go.”\n\n<b>“G.A.G.”</b>\n“It stands for ‘Girl’s a Gun’ but I didn’t want to have the word ‘girl’ in two titles! That again is just back to a toxic relationship situation. Just feeling like you have to surrender to it to make it get better when it doesn’t. But you’re also questioning like, ‘Is this right? Are we doing something stupid here? Like, maybe we need to look at this a little further.’ But essentially it’s kind of just surrendering to it all, unfortunately.”\n\n<b>“ROCKSTAR”</b>\n“It’s about a specific person. I thought we were cool with each other, and then I found out he was talking so much shit on my friends, on my band, my friends’ bands. It just pissed me off so much. I was like, ‘You literally think you’re the coolest dude. And all you do is talk shit on other people because you’re friggin’ insecure. Fuck you.’ It’s just a huge middle finger to this person. There’s lots of Easter eggs, so if people know the story and know the person, they’ll be able to figure out who it’s about.”\n\n<b>“SEX ON THE BEACH”</b>\n“It was inspired by one of the first times I went to LA. I was in this club and it was full of douchebags wearing their sunglasses inside at 3 am and purposely being dicks. I was like, ‘This is so gross. I’m just gonna sit here and drink myself to death, I guess.’ Then, people at the same time were blowing smoke up my arse and trying to be a friend. I know exactly what you’re trying to do here, you’re trying to network. It just feels superficial. I did not like that at all.”\n\n<b>“KILL[H]ER”</b>\n“Lyrically, it’s when you’re in a situation that you feel like you can’t get out of and you are compromising who you are constantly. It feels like you’re killing off a version of yourself. It’s kind of like wishing to get that old you back but realizing that that person doesn’t exist anymore, and you’re left with this shell of whatever the hell you used to be. You’ve killed yourself off, basically.”","short":"“We’ve never wanted to be put in a box,” says singer Bonnie Fraser."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cc/9f/d3/cc9fd317-d9c6-c686-2042-ee61ece1bb47/2176.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f2f30","textColor2":"370000","textColor4":"5c3030","textColor1":"130000","bgColor":"efefef","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/was-here/1759228376","playParams":{"id":"1759228376","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/57NMtVBwhchO8RyFm0LAfG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759228376/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"981210694","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/981210694?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1724400715997}}},"1759365544":{"id":"1759365544","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759365544?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Cantata","Baroque Era"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=510916167-1474241375-1230704260-252199178-271125147-291421413-291286163","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"J.S.

Stepping fully out of the shadows, his songwriting partner and real-life cousin showcases his artistry firsthand on <i>INCÓMODO</i>. A demonstration of his collaborative wizardry, these 21 tracks showcase his studio magic with a plethora of esteemed guests, including the high-profile likes of Natanael Cano and Eslabon Armado. His distinctively gruff voice serves him well when paired with sad-boy lifer Junior H on “5-7” or Gabito Ballesteros on the brisk corrido “DETONA,” but also on the album’s rarer solo moments like “EL LOKERÓN” or the embittered kiss-off “FARANDULITAS.” Diverging from genre expectations, he pleasantly surprises with the ranchera-infused Grupo Frontera team-up “AY MAMÁ.” Naturally, Peso Pluma shows up to support as well, present for the hard truths of “DOS DÍAS” and the sentimental send-off “LOS CUADROS.” ","short":"The songwriter steps into the spotlight with a distinctive

CASH COBAIN (Apple Music Edition)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Cash Cobain","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Sampling is a part of me, because I grew up on these songs,” Cash Cobain tells Apple Music. “I just take everything, throw it in a bowl and mix it up, and make my own Slizzy sauce.” Raised in the Bronx and Jamaica, Queens, two of the most hallowed locales in hip-hop history, he came up as a leader in the city’s vibrant sample-drill and sexy-drill waves before breaking big nationally as a sought-after producer for Drake, Trippie Redd, and Lil Yachty, to name but a few. Even while he scored hits and built his movement with locals such as B-Lovee and Chow Lee, he didn’t get as much credit for his rapping until his single “Fisherrr” with Bay Swag and its corresponding Ice Spice remix made him inescapably ubiquitous. “Two years ago, I thought I made it,” he says, adding, “but now I’m like, ‘You going somewhere.’” \n\nAfter linking on both sides of the booth as a featured artist opposite the likes of Don Toliver and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, his proper album debut <i>PLAY CASH COBAIN</i> puts him fully front and center. The raw sexual energy of “act like” and “rump punch” exemplify the sumptuous sound he pioneered and its correspondingly raunchy lyrical direction. Elsewhere, though, he demonstrates a softer, more romantic side on “message to u” and “wassup wya,” actively conjuring his dream girl fantasies into sincere realities. (“The album is sexual healing,” he quips.) Whether he’s creatively interpolating R&B classics on “all i wanna hear” and “cantsleep/drunkinluv” or flirting with other sources like on the Afrobeats-inflected “luv it,” his cutting-edge approach makes nearly every track feel momentous and of the moment.\n\nAs if his own verses and hooks weren’t enough, the diverse guest list on <i>PLAY CASH COBAIN</i> nods to Cobain’s elevated status in the rap game. Quavo and the aforementioned Toliver help set the tone on opener “slizzyhunchodon,” their respective waves uniting for one irrestible vibe. For the show-stopping “problem,” he gathers a breathtaking and unexpected array of compounding features by everyone from Big Sean and Fabolous to Flo Milli and YN Jay. “It's like everyone is doing their own freestyle to it,” he says of the multigenerational posse cut built around Brooklyn singer Laila!’s single “Not My Problem.” For the most part, Cobain does what he does best without high-profile help, reflecting his humble rise from a South Jamaica basement. “I’m just trying to bring positivity and fun,” he says. “I want my people or my peers around me to do the same.

Hours (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Jon Hopkins","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"Early Hours can mean a few different things: Are you winding down after being up all night, or are you just rising to meet the sun? For Jon Hopkins, the electronic producer and composer behind this edition of Apple Music’s Early Hours DJ mix, the goal was to soundtrack both settings. “I gave it a kind of arc that starts and ends peacefully, with some more trance-like energizing stuff in the middle,” he says. “The Oliver Coates track ‘Prairie’ that opens the set is an amazing thing to set the course of your day with, but it would also act as a bit of a reset, like a moment of clarity after getting home with the noise of a night out still in your ears.” \n\nHopkins says he went above his typical level of creativity with this mix. “I improvised live piano on top of some tracks. I asked Sofia Kourtesis and Mano Le Tough for stems so I could weave in their tracks in a more interesting way. I even field-recorded birdsong for one section that, for some reason, felt like it needed it.” Hopkins says he didn’t think much about headspace or philosophy—these songs were all intuition. “The creativity was figuring out how to blend them together into one hour-long piece,” he says.\n","short":"Trance spells, field recordings, and live piano.

Those unable to recall particulars of his ascent should find his beginnings on <i>DAYS BEFORE RODEO</i> as illuminating and intriguing as they were at the time. Only his second official mixtape after the preceding <i>Owl Pharaoh</i>, this 2014 effort succinctly revealed the hip-hop showstopper he would soon become. No longer behind the scenes, he brought what he’d learned from sessions with T.I. and Ye to the proverbial table, exuding rock star energy on “Drugs You Should Try It” and indulging in EDM edginess on “Basement Freestyle.”\n\nWith beats co-produced by the likes of FKi 1st and Metro Boomin, Atlanta’s tremendous influence further manifests amid the melodically eerie “Sloppy Toppy” with Migos and Peewee Longway and the machine-gun trap of “Mamacita” with Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug, the latter returning for the cinematic “Skyfall.” Honing his signature vocals and ad-libs in apparent reverence to his hallowed Houston origins, Scott goes beyond mere FX playtime on “Zombies,” hurtling towards the transformative approach that would come to define him.","short":"Ten years on, the
