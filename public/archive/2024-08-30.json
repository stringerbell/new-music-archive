Album and Interview","standard":"It can be dangerous, Nick Cave says, to look back on one’s body of work and seek meaning in the music you’ve made. “Most records, I couldn't really tell you by listening what was going on in my life at the time,” he tells Apple Music. “But the last three, they're very clear impressions of what life has actually been like. I was in a very strange place.”\n\nIn the years following the 2015 death of his son Arthur, Cave’s work—in song; in the warm counsel of his newsletter, The Red Hand Files; in the extended conversation-turned-book he wrote with journalist Seán O’Hagan, <i>Faith, Hope and Carnage</i>—has been marked by grief, meeting unimaginable loss with more imagination still. It’s made for some of the most remarkable and moving music of his nearly 50-year career, perhaps most notably the feverish minimalism of 2019’s <i>Ghosteen</i>, which he intended to act as a kind of communique to his dead son, wherever he might be. \n\nThough Cave would lose another son, Jethro, in 2022, <i>Wild God</i> finds the 66-year-old singer-songwriter someplace new, marveling at the beauty all around him, reuniting with The Bad Seeds, who—with the exception of multi-instrumentalist songwriting foil Warren Ellis—had slowly receded from view. Once a symbol of post-punk antipathy, he is now open to the world like never before. “Maybe there is a feeling like things don't matter in the same way as perhaps they did before,” he says. “These terrible things happened, the world has done its worst. I feel released in some way from those sorts of feelings. <i>Wild God</i> is much more playful, joyous, vibrant. Because life is good. Life is better.”\n\nIt’s an album that feels like an embrace. That much you can hear in the first seconds of “Song of the Lake,” a swirl of ascendant synths and thick, chewy bass (compliments of Radiohead’s Colin Greenwood) upon which Cave tells a tale of brokenness that never quite resolves, as though to fully heal or be put back together again has never really been the point of all this, of being human. The mood is largely improvisational and loose, Cave leaning into moments of catharsis like a man who’d been waiting for them. He offers levity (the colossal, delirious title track) and light (“Frogs,” “Final Rescue Attempt”). On “O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is),” a tribute to the late Anita Lane, his former creative and romantic partner, he conjures a sense of play that would have seemed impossible a few years ago. “I think that it's just an immense enjoyment in playing,” he says of the band's influence on the album. “I think the songs just have these delirious, ecstatic surges of energy, which was a feeling in the studio when we recorded it. We're not taking it too seriously in a way, although it's a serious record. We were having a good time. I was having a really good time.”\n\nThere is no shortage of heartbreak or darkness to be found here. But “Joy,” the album’s finest moment (and original namesake), is a monument to optimism, a radical thought. For six minutes, he sounds suspended in twilight, pulling words out of thin air, synths fluttering and humming and flickering around him, peals of piano and French horn coming and going like comets. “We’ve all had too much sorrow, now is the time for joy,” he sings, quoting a ghost who’s come to his bedside, a “flaming boy” in sneakers. “Joy doesn't necessarily mean happiness,” Cave says upon reflection. “Joy in a way is a form of suffering, in the sense that it understands the notion of suffering, and it's these momentary ecstatic leaps we are capable of that help us rise out of that suffering for a moment of time. It is sort of an explosion of positive feeling, and I think the record's full of that, full of these moments. In fact, the record itself is that.”\n\nWhile that may sound like a complete departure from its most recent predecessors, <i>Wild God</i> shares a similar intention, an urge to communicate with his late children, from this world to theirs. That may never fade. “If there's one impulse I have, it’s that I would like my kids who are no longer with us to know that we are okay, that [wife] Susie and I are okay,” Cave says. “I think that's why when I listened to the record back, I just listened to it with a great big smile on my face. Because it's just full of life and it's full of reasons to be happy. I think this record can definitely improve the condition of my children. All of the things that I create these days are an attempt to do that.” Read on as Cave takes us inside a few highlights from the album: \n\n<b>“Wild God”</b>\n“I was actually going to call the record <i>Joy</i>, but chose <i>Wild God</i> in the end because I thought the word ‘joy’ may be misunderstood in a way. ‘Wild God’ is just two pieces of music chopped together—an edit. That song didn't really work quite right. So we thought, ‘Well, let's get someone else to mix it.’ And me and Warren thought about that for a while. I personally really loved the sound of [producer Dave Fridmann’s work with] MGMT, and The Flaming Lips, stuff—it had this immediacy about it that I really liked. So we went to Buffalo with the recordings and Dave did a song each day, disappeared into the control room and mixed it without inviting us in. It was the strangest thing. And then he emerges from the studio and says, ‘Come in and tell me what you think.’ When we came in it sounded so different. We were shocked. And then after we played it again, we heard that he traded in all the intricacies and stateliness of The Bad Seeds for just pure unambiguous emotion.”\n\n<b>“Frogs”</b>\n“Improvising and ad-libbing is still very much the way we go about making music. ‘Frogs’ is essentially a song that I had some words to, but I just walked in and started singing over the top of this piece of music that we'd constructed without any real understanding of the song itself. There's no formal construction—it just keeps going, very randomly. There's a sort of freedom and mystery to that stuff that I find really compelling. I sang it as a guide, but listening to it back was like, ‘Wow, I don't know how to go and repeat that in any way, but it feels like it's talking about something way beyond what the song initially had to offer.’”\n\n<b>“Joy”</b>\n“‘Joy’ is a wholly improvised one-take without me having any real understanding of what Warren is doing musically. It’s written in that same questing way of first takes. I'm just singing stuff over a kind of chord pattern that he's got. I sort of intuit it in some way that it’s a blues form to it, so I’m attempting to sing a blues vocal over the top, rhyming in a blues tradition.”\n\n<b>“Final Rescue Attempt”</b>\n“That was a song that we weren't putting on the record. It was a late addition, just hanging around. And I think Dave Fridmann actually said, ‘Look, I've mixed this song. It doesn't seem to be on the record. What the fuck?’ It feels a little different in a way to me. But it's a very beautiful song, very beautiful. And I guess it was just so simple in its way, or at least the first verse literally describes the situation that I think is actually in the book, <i>Faith, Hope and Carnage</i>, where Susie decided to come back to me after eight months or so, and rode back to my house where I was living, on a bicycle. It’s a depiction of that scene, so maybe I shied away from it for that reason. I don't know. But I'm really glad.”\n\n<b>“O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is)”</b>\n“That song is an attempt to encapsulate what Anita Lane was like, and we all loved her very much and were all shocked to the core by her death. In her early days when we were together, she was this bright, shiny, happy, laughing, flaming thing, and we were the dark, drug-addicted men that circled around her. And I wanted to just write a song that had that. She was a laughing creature, and I wanted to work out a way of expressing that. It's such a beautifully innocent song in a way.”","short":"After a decade of grief and tragedy, a radical theme emerges: “Life is good.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wild-god/1733028849","playParams":{"id":"1733028849","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0TRr4JGEPJ4eAb5QKRaunf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1733028849/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1698460","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1698460?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015480807,"RTCI":0}}},"1736162572":{"id":"1736162572","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736162572?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zeal-ardor/1130919616","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4f/92/98/4f929844-7423-e9ff-7b13-209229b1f22b/e63104cd-f7bb-4170-9a03-0d4a41b656c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2e2d","textColor2":"3a2b1e","textColor4":"5c4f43","textColor1":"020102","bgColor":"e3e2d8","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/af/54/30/af5430ad-19b1-bedf-ba19-378c137fd1a1/db60bf4e-ad31-4292-989b-ebb37fa19c84.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cacaca","textColor2":"efe9d4","textColor4":"c8c4b3","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"303030","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ca/66/c9/ca66c9c8-6083-c964-ae41-b2caabd9424d/9c6788c8-69e9-4c1b-8026-d7536092ba62.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"35302b","textColor2":"262524","textColor4":"474542","textColor1":"0f0a08","bgColor":"cdc5b8","hasP3":false}},"name":"GREIF","artistName":"Zeal & Ardor","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5f/f3/ed/5ff3eddf-73b1-10d7-46f6-15f35ff44a0c/198391197550.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"bfcec6","textColor4":"99a59e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"For the title of his fourth album under the Zeal & Ardor banner, avant-garde metal musician Manuel Gagneux turned to ancient legend. The greif, or griffin, is a mythological creature—part lion, part eagle—that appears in many of the oldest cultures. In Gagneux’s hometown of Basel, Switzerland, the griffin figures prominently in the annual Vogel Gryff procession. “It’s basically a guy in a big old bird costume that reveals its backside to the rich part of town,” he tells Apple Music. “It’s like an 800-year-old tradition. It’s so endearing, I thought it was worth sharing with the world.”\n\n<i>GREIF</i> is also the first Zeal & Ardor album to feature Gagneux’s live band. “By now, people know us more from our live performances,” he says. “So, it’s more representative of what it is that I associate with Zeal & Ardor. Doing the opposite would’ve been weirder to me at this point. It felt very organic to have them involved. Just like the greif is an amalgam of animals, everyone doing their part on this record is an amalgam of us. And it’s our most eclectic record, I think, so it feels quite fitting.” Below, he comments on each track. \n\n<b>“The Bird, the Lion and the Wildkin”</b>\n“Yeah, wildkin. In all honesty, I might’ve made up that word. But as that procession happens with the greif, it’s accompanied by piccolos and snare drums. So, that’s what I tried to emulate with the whistling and the drums there. Also, it’s a melody that will return later in the record, and I thought it kind of a nice little booming opening to welcome this weird, strange world of <i>GREIF</i>.”\n\n<b>“Fend You Off”</b>\n“It’s the first, or one of the few times, that I use the ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ in a Zeal & Ardor song. It’s quite a personal-struggle song, not in a specific thing that happened to me, but it’s about self-preservation. Sometimes we take steps that hurt ourselves just to make way for others. So, it’s about yielding, basically, and how not good of an idea that sometimes is.”\n\n<b>“Kilonova”</b>\n“The word ‘kilonova’ is a fairly new term about two supernovas colliding, which is objectively cool. It’s also about how our spirits and our weird ideas, or our weird playing, collides on this record. It’s one of the more occult songs on the record, with references to old, old books. And it’s one I hold really dear to my heart. It started as a funk song, and then I started distorting guitars. It kind of has reminiscing factors to another band that were not planned, but they are there. I’m not going to name names, but there’s some utensils at play.”\n\n<b>“are you the only one now?”</b>\n“It was an intentional decision to make the title all lowercase. It’s about these minichapters of the record, and basically these few [lowercase] songs prefacing what is coming after them, in a thematic sense. This is another personal one. It’s about solitude and finding peace in solitude, because there’s a huge difference between loneliness and solitude. It’s about embracing being alone, and that even time perceptively wasted being alone is still time that was spent working on oneself. I’m very much a person that enjoys being alone and kind of revels in solitude. It sounds very, very mopey, but I think I’m quite happy when I’m alone.”\n\n<b>“Go home my friend”</b>\n“This is a callback, musically, to the things we did prior to this record. It’s a taste of, ‘Oh, remember this?’ I think it conveys the idea of what it wants to be quite well, and there’s no need to expand on it. It’s just, ‘OK, this is it.’ It goes exactly where it should go, and then it ends without being ruined. And I quite like that.”\n\n<b>“Clawing Out”</b>\n“I think, in many ways, it’s the most aggressive song we’ve put out, or the most intense. Because it has these mean tempo ramps that just fuel anxiety, I think. And I really love that. It all culminates in these aggressive, hardcore electro kicks, which I find so, so nice. And it kind of blends well with the metal aesthetic in a weird way. I’m very happy with this one. It’s a new flavor of heavy.”\n\n<b>“Disease”</b>\n“That’s basically about how good intentions can have bad results. Because I think I’ve hurt a lot of people just by trying to help them, and I’ve been hurt by people who’ve tried to help me. It’s not about the intent, but sometimes a helping hand is just something in the way. That sounds very cynical, but I think there’s truth to that. It kind of needs to be spoken to.”\n\n<b>“369”</b>\n“This is a reference to a Tom Waits song called ‘Clap Hands,’ which itself is a reference to a Shirley Ellis song called ‘The Clapping [Song],’ which starts out ‘Three, six, nine, the [goose] drank wine.’ So, it’s a cover of a cover. Or a theft of a theft. I kind of wanted to pay my dues, although it’s so obscure no one will ever know unless I explain it. So, I don’t know if my dues are really paid.”\n\n<b>“Thrill”</b>\n“This is basically one of the newer emotions that we try to convey with this record. It’s not imposing, it’s not dark and brooding or ominous. It’s basically still aggressive, but most of all excited. I think that’s an emotion that I’ve always wanted to convey with this band, and I think I finally got to do it on this record. I wouldn’t even say it’s a metal song. I’d say it’s more like a rock song.”\n\n<b>“une ville vide”</b>\n“I go on long walks at night. And the town I live in is quite sleepy, so it’s empty a lot of the time, which I find one of the nicest feelings. I wanted to convey that feeling of being in between these looming buildings, and you kind of feel like a little mouse in a huge, strange world. There’s freedom to that, and that’s what I wanted to convey with this instrumental. Also, it’s kind of a palate cleanser between songs.”\n\n<b>“Sugarcoat”</b>\n“That’s another fun one. It’s such a simple song, and it almost veers into the goofy. There’re no solos, there’s no, ‘What is that rhythm structure?’ It’s kind of just a banger. It’s silly, and it’s supposed to be that. It’s one of those songs, when I wrote it, I giggled to myself and said, ‘This is going to be so much fun live.’ And the times we’ve played it live, by the last part of it, people are just singing that little theme thing. That just makes me almost burst with glee.”\n\n<b>“Solace”</b>\n“In many ways, this is the saddest song I’ve ever written. I honestly wasn’t sure if it would make it onto this record because I thought it was too much of a whiplash moment. But now I think of it as kind of a necessity to balance things out. And it took me a really long time to write this one. I just wanted to get everything right, and I’m really happy with the result. It’s inspired by a lot of Portishead and this song The Book of Knots did with Mike Patton called ‘Planemo.’ I just wanted to replicate that absolute dire, heart-wrenching situation. I’m not sure if I can do that one live because I might cry.”\n\n<b>“Hide in Shade”</b>\n“That’s basically vintage Zeal & Ardor because it’s the only song that’s older. It’s not only a callback—it’s actually from that time. It just never really got a home on an album until this one because I had to arrange it properly. So, it’s been brewing and stewing for a while. It’s just kind of a reminder of where we come from.” \n\n<b>“to my ilk”</b>\n“Another not-so-heavy track. I think this is the softest record we put out thus far, and I’m really happy with it in terms of how the three voices that we have are featured on it. It’s very distinct. It’s not too far from what people expect of us, but it kind of veers in a distinct direction. I mean, we could be blamed for selling out or whatever because it’s such a poppy track. But I think it still has this emotionality that is very much us. That can’t be denied. It’s not the best track to get the party started, but it’s still a good one.”","short":"Manuel Gagneux on the band’s fourth album: “It’s our most eclectic record.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/greif/1736162572","playParams":{"id":"1736162572","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1chw1DFmefTueG1VbNVoGN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1736162572/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1130919616","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1130919616?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015986074,"RTCI":0}}},"1737990072":{"id":"1737990072","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1737990072?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fontaines-d-c/1341828470","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/13/0d/a4/130da49f-ae84-506d-e410-5b3dd008a2a4/Jobd7ce14c9-54dc-45a4-bd51-c01f44f6db9a-166199132-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323009892_1739471124-Time1712945157511.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fdd9fb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172028"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cbdced","textColor2":"fdd9fb","textColor4":"cac0ea","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172028","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a4/f1/75/a4f17541-b6c2-0e9a-e16d-07d601cef952/deed1914-ab01-43af-a0cc-3388e63a69ce.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3a8b5","textColor2":"e3b994","textColor4":"ba997f","textColor1":"dbcbd8","bgColor":"151828","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ba/2d/5c/ba2d5c78-71df-cdf1-1922-bf19f69c862b/Job6c514ef7-0ed3-4c65-83f1-c5dcf4cf8568-166199133-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_323009891_1739471125-Time1712951641467.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","96fd41"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172028"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cadbe8","textColor2":"96fd41","textColor4":"78dc55","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172028","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a4/b8/ee/a4b8ee90-90f1-d27d-7d57-25c0cc72ac05/8fc32c79-81d1-432e-b516-27482fbd9187.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d59bcb","textColor2":"ff86d1","textColor4":"d57dbe","textColor1":"ffabe0","bgColor":"315c76","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c0/44/61/c0446175-d2ad-8201-cf20-dc46b1522f96/c969da92-5f3b-4b35-8f35-682790237ebd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7793c8","textColor2":"fe7aaa","textColor4":"cc6c9f","textColor1":"94aadd","bgColor":"033574","hasP3":false}},"name":"Romance","artistName":"Fontaines D.C.","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4d/3a/76/4d3a7621-8b56-56a3-829f-545dde0b2b6a/191404143674.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"431f29","textColor2":"2e0e12","textColor4":"582534","textColor1":"140704","bgColor":"ff7fbc","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Perhaps more so than any other Irish band of their generation, Fontaines D.C.’s first three albums were intrinsically linked to their homeland. Their debut, 2019’s <i>Dogrel</i>, was a bolshy, drizzle-soaked love letter to the streets of Dublin, while Brendan Behan-name-checking follow-up <i>A Hero’s Death</i> detailed the group’s on-the-road alienation and estrangement from home. And 2022’s <i>Skinty Fia</i> viewed Ireland from the complicated perspective of no longer actually being there. \n\nOn their fourth album, however, Fontaines D.C. have shifted their attention elsewhere. <i>Romance</i> finds the five-piece wandering in a futuristic dystopia inspired by Japanese manga classic <i>Akira</i>, Paolo Sorrentino’s 2013 film <i>La Grande Bellezza</i>, and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn’s <i>Pusher</i> films. “We didn’t set out to make a trilogy of albums but that’s sort of what happened,” drummer Tom Coll tells Apple Music of those first three records. “They were such a tight world, and this time we wanted to step outside of it and change it up. A big inspiration for this record was going to Tokyo for the first time. It’s such a visual, neon-filled, supermodern city. It was so inspiring. It brought in all these new visual references to the creative process for the first time.”\n\nRecorded with Arctic Monkeys producer James Ford (their previous three albums were all made with Dan Carey), <i>Romance</i> also brings in a whole new palette of sounds and colors to the band’s work. From the clanking apocalyptic dread of the opening title track, hip-hop-inspired first single “Starburster,” and the warped grunge and shoegaze hybrids of “Here’s the Thing” and “Sundowner,” it opens a whole new chapter for Fontaines D.C., while still finding time for classic indie rock anthems such as “Favourite”’s wistful volley of guitars or the Nirvana-like “Death Kink.” “Every album we do feels like a huge step in one direction for us, but <i>Romance</i> is probably a little bit more outside of our previous records,” says Coll. “It’s exciting to surprise people.” Read on as he dissects <i>Romance</i>, one track at a time. \n\n<b>“Romance”</b>\n“This is one that we wrote really late at night in the studio. It just fell out of us. It was one of those real moments of feeling, ‘Right, that’s the first track on the album.’ It’s kind of like a palate cleanser for everything that’s come before. It’s like the opening scene. I feel like every time we’ve done a record there’s been one tune that’s always stuck out like, ‘This is our opening gambit...’”\n\n<b>“Starburster”</b>\n“Grian [Chatten, singer] wrote most of this tune on his laptop, so there were lots of chopped-up strings and stuff—it was quite a hip-hop creative process. It’s probably the song that is furthest away from the old us on this album. This tune was the first single and we always try and shock people a bit. It’s fun to do that.”\n\n<b>“Here’s the Thing”</b>\n“This was written in the last hour of being in the studio. We had maybe 12 or 13 tracks ready to go and just started jamming, and it presented itself in an hour. [Guitarist Conor] Curley had this really gnarly, ’90s, piercing tone, and it just went from there.”\n\n<b>“Desire”</b>\n“This has been knocking around for ages. It was one of those tunes that took so many goes to get to where it was meant to sit. It started as a band setup and then we went really electronic with it. Then in the studio, we took it all back. It took a while for it to sit properly. Grian did 20 or 30 vocal layers on that, he really arranged it in an amazing way. Carlos [O’Connell, guitarist] and Grian were the main string arrangers on this record. This was the first record where we actually got a string quartet in—before, people would just send it over. So being able to sit in the room and watch a string quartet take center stage on a song was amazing.”\n\n<b>“In the Modern World”</b>\n“Grian wrote this song when he was in LA. He was really inspired by Lana Del Rey and stuff like that. Hollywood and the glitz and the glamour, but it’s actually this decrepit place. It’s that whole idea of faded glamour.”\n\n<b>“Bug”</b>\n“This felt like a really easy song for us to write. That kind of buzzy, all-of-us-in-the-same-room tune. I really fought for this one to be on the record. I feel like, with songs like that, trying to skew them and put a spin on them that they don’t need is overwriting. If it feels right then there’s no point in laboring over it. That song is what it is and it’s great. It’s going to be amazing live.”\n\n<b>“Motorcycle Boy”</b>\n“This one is inspired by The Smashing Pumpkins a bit. We actually recorded it six months before the rest of the album. This tune was the real genesis of the record and us finding a path and being like, ‘OK, we can explore down here...’ That was one that really set the wheels in motion for the album. It really informed where we were going.”\n\n<b>“Sundowner”</b>\n“On this album, we were probably coming from more singular points than we have before. A lot of the lads brought in tunes that were pretty much there. I was sharing a room with Curley in London, and he was working on this really shoegaze-inspired tune for ages. I think he always thought that Grian would sing it, but when he put down the guide vocals in the studio it sounded great. We were all like, ‘You are singing this now.’”\n\n<b>“Horseness Is the Whatness”</b>\n“Carlos sent me a demo of that tune ages and ages ago. It was just him on an acoustic, and it was such a powerful lyric. I think it’s amazing. We had to kind of deconstruct it and build it back up again in terms of making it fit for this record. Carlos had made three or four drum loops for me and it was a really fun experience to try and recreate that. I don’t know how we’re going to play it live but we’ll sort it out!”\n\n<b>“Death Kink”</b>\n“Again, this came from one of the jams of us setting up for a studio session. It’s another one of those band-in-a-room-jamming-out kind of tunes. On tour in America, we really honed where everything should sit in the set. This is going to be such a fun tune to play live. We’ve started playing it already and it’s been so sick.”\n\n<b>“Favourite”</b>\n“‘Favourite’ was another one we wrote when we were rehearsing. It happened pretty much as it is now. We were kind of nervous about touching it again for the album because that first recording was so good. That’s the song that hung around in our camp for the longest. When we write songs on tour, often we end up getting bored of them over time but ‘Favourite’ really stuck.

Not long after making it, Hopkins was commissioned to compose an audio piece for an art exhibit involving a Dreamachine—a stroboscopic light machine that, when experienced with eyes closed, had the potential to trigger a psychedelic response (or the occasional convulsion, but enough about that!) in its user.\n\nThat soundtrack sowed the seeds for <i>RITUAL</i>, which serves as a partner of sorts to the gauzy, ethereal <i>Music for Psychedelic Therapy</i>. But while it keeps in a similar vein of music to facilitate forms of transcendence, <i>RITUAL</i> is decidedly more active. Produced with an icier sound palette, a slightly darker edge, and some percussive, rhythmic elements that were absent in the previous album, these connected pieces build and contract as they move over peaks and into valleys.\n\nTracks such as “palace / illusion” and “transcend / lament,” both produced with musician and healing-arts practitioner Vylana, offer moments of sunny daybreak, but they’re always counterbalanced with almost sneaky, minor-key undercurrents. The latter suitably segues into “the veil”—a gothy, weighty piece that could alternately soundtrack a spiritual experience or a cinematic one—before moving toward the climactic “solar goddess return.” Electronic musicians often speak of their compositions or DJ mixes as sonic journeys. Without explicitly doing so himself, Hopkins’ albums actually are.","short":"Hopkins’ icier, more active counterpart to Music for Psychedelic

Album and Interview","standard":"Lainey Wilson couldn’t have chosen a more fitting title for her fifth studio album. The wildly beloved country singer-songwriter’s rise to fame has surely been a whirlwind, catapulting the small-town Louisiana native from relative obscurity to stardom in just a few short years. That success was not earned overnight, though, as Wilson had put in nearly a decade of work before breaking out with <i>Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’</i> in 2021. “I felt like my life was changing at 190 miles an hour and I was just trying to keep one foot on the ground,” Wilson tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But I think those 10 years of nothing happening for me prepared me for my life changing super fast.”\n\n<i>Whirlwind</i> is Wilson at the height of her powers, mixing pop, rock, and soul into her already inimitable brand of traditionally informed country. Highlights include the title track, a light and groovy celebration of reckless love, and “Devil Don’t Go There,” a heartbreak ballad that lets Wilson lean into the emotive side of her versatile voice. The Miranda Lambert duet “Good Horses” connects two generations of country spitfires, with dusky production to emphasize the singers’ undeniable vocal chemistry. Wilson’s band sounds better than ever, too, which she attributes to years spent touring relentlessly and working toward a shared dream. “They are ride or die,” she says. “I mean, these guys are the ones that ate dirt with me. And I think it’s really important to keep the people close that you ate dirt with. They know you, they know how bad you want it. They want it just as bad. They love you for you. They sacrifice so much to be out there on the road with you.” Below, Wilson gives insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Whirlwind”</b>\n“I finally found a guy that gives me a run for my money. And he’s my biggest cheerleader. He’s just a good person. And he knows how important chasing down a dream is, because even when he was a little boy, football was his life. He did it and he tried out for the Steelers and made the team. And so he achieved what he set out to do. And so he knows. We met at a time where he was still playing with them, but then it all changed. So it was weird. It was like his life was changing as my life was changing and we were going different directions. So, yeah, life for us is a whirlwind.”\n\n<b>“Middle of It”</b>\n“We had actually just got nominated for Entertainer of the Year for the CMAs. And I had not been at my house in Nashville, and I didn’t have furniture in my house for months. We don’t need a couch, we’re not here. So my friends The Heart Wranglers came over and they just said, ‘Let’s do a heart check.’ And they’re like, ‘What’s going on? Where are you at? How you feel? Where’s your head?’ I sat on the floor and I just said, ‘I feel like I’m just smack-dab in the middle of it. It’s a blur to me where it started, where it’s going to end up. I just can’t hardly tell.’ And then we just started talking about how that’s really what all this is about anyway. That’s the beauty of it.”\n\n<b>“Whiskey Colored Crayon”</b>\n“That song actually came from a word exercise that my co-writer [Josh Kear] did. I’ll probably get this wrong, but every morning before he writes songs, he writes a list of things. And say the first list that he wrote was ‘things that I hate’ and maybe it’s lettuce or greens or whiskey or whatever. And then he writes a list of random things, things that you can use to create. He mix-mashed these words and he was like, ‘Well, I’ve got this whiskey-colored crayon,’ and we got to thinking about the storyline of this. And we came up with, ‘Okay, let’s think about a young student, the colored crayon part. Okay, and how could we tell a story about a little boy who goes through some things at home that most people don’t know about?’ We created the story. And for me, again, putting myself into the shoes of somebody else takes me out of my mess for a minute and gives me a fresh and new perspective. And I left that songwriting session, after we told this story, just feeling grateful.”","short":"A Nashville star at the height of her powers, processing the chaos."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whirlwind/1744255381","playParams":{"id":"1744255381","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YJeGDPwWmpqxm5xlIqjO8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744255381/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"907166363","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/907166363?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725024386674,"RTCI":0}}},"1744418624":{"id":"1744418624","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744418624?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Adult Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"1994-08-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/oasis/512633","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a4/18/78/a41878dc-38e6-0ff9-f217-029cceac85b3/Job0a0f5332-2c9a-4ea2-b45a-3e8a8670ab07-174127869-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339595102_1870041340-Time1724332214675.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","162226"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"383838"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2d2c2e","textColor2":"162226","textColor4":"3c4549","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"383838","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/68/d5/7c/68d57c66-2f00-9fa4-e8d5-8aa3549cccc3/Jobe21c7f42-5582-4f87-8dea-494f69be2413-174127870-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339595103_1870041339-Time1724334122137.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"342922","textColor2":"172129","textColor4":"423f3e","textColor1":"060506","bgColor":"ebb793","hasP3":false}},"name":"Definitely Maybe (30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)","artistName":"Oasis","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3626,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/44/ee/e4/44eee4b6-32b2-2886-771c-707aae428448/5051961125108.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3626,"textColor3":"31271e","textColor2":"19252f","textColor4":"454444","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f6c396","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"After a trying birth, this modern classic swaggered in to upend British pop.","standard":"Oasis never did anything the easy way. Across a career stretching just short of two decades, the Manchester quintet was constantly teetering on the edge; chaos and calamity a crucial ingredient to what made them tick. It was no different with the creation of their debut <i>Definitely Maybe</i> but, for once, their problems had nothing to do with the turbulent relationship between Liam and Noel Gallagher. Despite possessing a collection of songs everyone within earshot could recognize as generational, here the formative Oasis suffered from the humdrum issue faced by many a new band lacking in studio experience: how to replicate their thrilling live alchemy on tape.\n\nNot that you’d ever know it from listening. <i>Definitely Maybe</i> seemed to arrive as a fully-formed modern classic, its swagger so effortless, its brilliance so unrelenting that it felt like it could have been knocked out in an afternoon. “Yes,” it seemed to say, “this album is here to change the game, what of it?” But behind the record lay a series of false starts that could have derailed Oasis long before the fateful final punch-up backstage in Paris in 2009.\n\nOasis had already established themselves as a ferocious live proposition when they entered Monnow Valley Studio in Wales in January 1994 with the aim of knocking their debut out the park. Sensing correctly that the key lay in capturing the inexorable rush of their live performance, Noel had enlisted experienced soundman David Batchelor as producer, but the decision had backfired. Batchelor’s process of getting band members to lay down their parts separately had removed the abrasive edge from their sound, leaving the songs sounding inexplicably feeble when they should’ve been leaving you in a daze.\n\nIn a sign of confidence at what should have been, the band’s label Creation sanctioned a new round of recording, binning off the original sessions at a cost of £50,000. This time, they had to make it work. At Sawmills Studio in Cornwall, the band’s live sound engineer Mark Coyle was tasked with getting the best out of them. Coyle treated it like an intimate gig, positioning the group in close proximity in one room to nail down the basic tracks, with Noel adding swathes of guitar overdubs afterwards. The resultant recordings were spiky and bristling—but not quite there yet. The big breakthrough came with the involvement of Owen Morris, who’d engineered on records by New Order, Billy Bragg, and Electronic. His daring mixes added an imposing dynamism to Oasis’ songs and he brought Liam back in to re-record some of his vocals, coaxing performances out of the singer that would establish him as the most intoxicating rock ’n’ roll voice of his generation.\n\nAfter all the hurdles, Oasis had got there. One of the most vital rock ’n’ roll records of all time was complete. From the barbed riffs of “Rock ‘n’ Roll Star” to the chiming, widescreen sing-along “Live Forever,” the T. Rex-y glam-punk of “Cigarettes & Alcohol” and the epic longing of “Slide Away,” <i>Definitely Maybe</i> was an album that blended ’60s yearning with a Sex Pistols sneer, pairing fervent anthems about escape and breaking out of mundanity with songs that sounded like you’d crash-landed right in the middle of a fevered, frantic night out. You didn’t want to go home.\n\nReleased in August 1994, it reshaped the UK’s musical landscape, helping to usher in an era when indie rock dominated mainstream culture and Britpop ruled supreme. At the time, it became Britain’s fastest-selling debut album in history, and made Oasis superstars. Noel and Liam would never have an argument in private again. This is where it all began, an album that still sounds as unbridled and exhilarating as it did on first listen. It took a few attempts, but they cracked it in the end."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/definitely-maybe-30th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/1744418624","playParams":{"id":"1744418624","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744418624/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"512633","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/512633?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725006202222,"RTCI":0}}},"1745180219":{"id":"1745180219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1745180219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carlile/1443170710","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Human

Album and Interview","standard":"Seven albums into his career, Thomas Rhett is in a comfortable place. The country superstar has more No. 1 hits than he can count on two hands, and also found happiness offstage with his wife and children, who serve as a primary inspiration for this follow-up to 2022’s <i>Where We Started</i>. Comfort doesn’t mean complacency, though, and on <i>About a Woman</i> Rhett digs more deeply into his personal experiences, sharing intimate stories about marriage, parenthood, and nostalgia for one’s youth.\n\n“What Could Go Right” is a tender portrait of friendship growing into love, inspired by Rhett’s own marriage. “Church” taps into Rhett’s longtime love of fellow singer-songwriter Eric Church, connecting the Chief’s music to youthful romance. “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman” is a slinky groove with twangy flourishes, reminiscent of earlier Rhett tracks like “It Goes Like This” and “Craving You.” Rhett caps the record with “I Could Spend Forever Loving You,” a spare and sincere love song that’s sure to show up on wedding playlists. Below, he talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Overdrive”</b>\n“A song like ‘Overdrive’ would be directly centered towards high school kids—and then people that even, maybe, were high school sweethearts or got back together later in life—to go to reminisce on how innocent that time was. And how just because you’re kind of young, dumb, and reckless at 16 doesn’t mean that you can’t also still be there when you’re 35 or 55.”\n\n<b>“Gone Country”</b>\n“I wish I could say that I had this crazy story of dating this girl that flew in from Chicago and all these things, but I don’t have that story. For me, that song came about, and I’ve shared this story a couple of times, but just being at [Nashville’s] BNA [airport] and realizing how massive our genre has become. For me, it’s always been massive because it’s what I’ve done for a living and what I’ve been so inundated with. Even people that did not grow up country, they’re just like, ‘I really like this way of living.’ You know what I mean? And that’s sort of where the inspiration from that song came from.”\n\n<b>“Church”</b>\n“The first two Eric Church records—I remember getting my first truck at 16, and Eric Church then was [like] listening to Zach Bryan now. It was kind of underground. He was the outlaw. He would sing about words that you couldn’t say on mainstream radio, all this stuff. So, me and all my buddies, that was our favorite. So, the original way this song got pitched to me was, it ended in heartbreak, like the guy and the girl never saw each other again, but he always reminisced over that time that they bonded over Eric Church. And so, I came in on the back half and just rewrote the bridge and the last chorus, because [my story with my wife] ended differently.”\n\n<b>“What Could Go Right”</b>\n“I’ve tried to write that song a million different times, and it has always come out extremely corny and extremely cheesy. And a couple of the guys in the group are dating. One’s married and has kids and all this kind of stuff. And I was telling them about this night that I had with [my wife] Lauren when I was like 21 years old. [We] both were in long relationships with other people, and both kind of ended our relationship with other people at the same time. But there was always, in the back of my mind, this wonder of like, ‘I wonder if we could ever date again.’ You know what I mean? Because we dated a little bit in high school. That whole song, I was telling the guys on the bus this story, and my buddy John is just writing, taking notes, soaking it all in. And I went to go get some food, and I came back, and they had written the verse and the chorus, and they were like, ‘Does this do it for you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s amazing.’”\n\n<b>“I Could Spend Forever Loving You”</b>\n“I think when I dream of what me and Lauren are going to look like and be doing at 70 years old, all I see is a front porch and a river and a cup of coffee. You know what I’m saying? So, I think it’s always good to dream in your marriage. It’s always good to kind of dream about the future. It’s OK to regret the past. Don’t harp on it, but also, it’s fun to reminisce on the past. Your youth doesn’t have to die because you have kids. Your youth doesn’t have to die just because you’ve been married for 10 years. And it really is a testament to knowing how much love can grow if you’ll allow it.”","short":"The country vet gets nostalgic on his seventh album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/about-a-woman/1748830649","playParams":{"id":"1748830649","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6tDerbhPTlX8pa0hyRStZG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1748830649/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"502541718","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/502541718?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725024422899,"RTCI":0}}},"1749138538":{"id":"1749138538","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749138538?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/teeth/1482426739","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Will of Hate","artistName":"Teeth","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/17/18/2e/17182e77-be92-0aac-7adf-2d3997d60b03/198588240786.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d6d6d6","textColor2":"d9d9d9","textColor4":"b8b8b8","textColor1":"fefefe","bgColor":"383838","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-will-of-hate/1749138538","playParams":{"id":"1749138538","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2WqB6oY6EQ6oU32stHAUYU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749138538/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1482426739","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1482426739?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1724991290552,"RTCI":0}}},"1749340898":{"id":"1749340898","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749340898?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Hard Rock","Death Metal/Black Metal"],"releaseDate":"2004-08-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lamb-of-god/18758452","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ec/4f/e6/ec4fe613-dc97-f3f0-0c65-b91538fffc25/Job8f9a458d-ebf7-4bce-b812-a99b279536e1-169677435-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330264263_1798491233-Time1717784320382.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"ac9c6e","textColor2":"c9c18d","textColor4":"a09b71","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000100","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dd/06/98/dd069817-f1f7-ca99-b415-49ac61eceb7c/1d8a66d8-f259-4ffd-885b-227862f46abc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"98adb6","textColor2":"87cdc8","textColor4":"6fa8a3","textColor1":"bad4e0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e4/07/02/e4070219-c86d-20e1-486e-bb978fa2eb6e/Jobc52d1702-cf6c-46a8-943e-e0e38930111b-169677436-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_330264504_1798491232-Time1717788437545.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ac9a6c","textColor2":"00c993","textColor4":"00a075","textColor1":"d7c187","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Ashes of the Wake (20th Anniversary Edition)","artistName":"Lamb of God","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8e/79/c7/8e79c7c4-5c25-42d0-9cd3-ee1ed8df9643/196872141535.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"01a16e","textColor2":"e7a255","textColor4":"b98144","textColor1":"01ca89","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition and Interview","standard":"Originally released in 2004, <i>Ashes of the Wake</i> was Lamb of God’s breakthrough album. Their first for a major label after three indie releases (two as Lamb of God; one under their original name, Burn the Priest), <i>Ashes</i> propelled the Richmond, Virginia-based metal band to the forefront of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement on the strength of aggressive crowd-pleasers “Laid to Rest,” “Omerta,” and “Now You’ve Got Something to Die For.” Certified gold in the US, it’s become their best-selling album to date. Not that any of the band members—vocalist Randy Blythe, guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler, bassist John Campbell, or then-drummer Chris Adler—had any sense of its significance at the time. \n \n“We had no idea that it would have the kind of impact and legacy that it’s had for us,” Morton tells Apple Music. “That wasn't really a notion or consideration at all. Being our first major-label record, I didn’t really know what that meant in terms of expectations, creatively or commercially. We had some conversations with label people about that stuff, and it was a very steep learning curve for me in terms of what it meant to be on a major label and what kind of things would change with that situation being in place.”\n\nThe band felt added pressure to deliver because they had only recently written their previous album, <i>As the Palaces Burn</i>. “As a songwriter, I personally felt pretty tapped at that point,” Morton recalls. “I had been so accustomed to just collecting music as the ideas came and not really dedicating myself to sitting down and writing songs as an activity. But with this album, we had a time window. The new label wanted their new record, so we had to abbreviate the touring we would’ve normally done so we could write a new record—essentially right after we had just written one.”\n\nDespite the time crunch, LOG delivered what became their most popular album. “I understand why it’s the record that most people go to,” Morton says. “But I don’t revere this record any more than some of our other ones. For me, I think we’ve made better albums. I think we’ve probably made worse albums. There’s some really cool songs on here, and there’s some I wouldn’t write today. The cliché is that it’s just a snapshot of where we were at the time, but it’s true. And I love the record for what it is.”\n\nThe 20th Anniversary Edition of <i>Ashes of the Wake</i> includes preproduction demos, special guest remixes, live tracks, and a reimagined version of “Another Nail for Your Coffin,” which originally appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album. Below, Morton comments on the 11 original album tracks. \n\n<b>“Laid to Rest”</b>\n“I don't recall us feeling like we had written one of the biggest songs of our career, but it’s a cool song. I've been on record saying this before, but I didn't realize how derivative from Testament it was at time. But that makes total sense, because I've been a huge Testament fan my whole life. Lyrically, I think it was loosely rooted in some personal relationship conflict stuff and just a general kind of dismissive song about isolating oneself from conflict—just kind of a fuck-you song. Nothing super profound there, but definitely rooted in some real-life experience at the time. I think more than anything, it’s got a fire in it that really connects with people. We play it every night, and it’s still a blast.” \n\n<b>“Hourglass”</b>\n“‘Hourglass’ is a really good example of the interplay and the dynamic between me and Willie, guitar-wise. I think it's a really exciting guitar song. Lyrically, I think it’s an example of us touching on the doomsday feeling of the war in the Middle East at the time, and just kind of this real post-9/11 feeling of a scary new world that we were in.” \n\n<b>“Now You've Got Something to Die For”</b>\n“This is a good example of our different perspectives on how to put a song together. Listen to the second riff, where the drum part picks up really fast. If you take that riff away from the drum part, it's very reminiscent of ‘Cowboys From Hell’ by Pantera, a Dimebag [Darrell] kind of riff. But when Chris Adler put his uptempo, fast, sort of European-style death metal drumbeat on top of it, it became this amalgamation of Pantera meets At The Gates. And that was a unique sound within the context of heavy metal, these different angles of influence coming together.” \n\n<b>“The Faded Line”</b>\n“This is another pretty acrobatic guitar song. On this album, I think Willie and I were still coming from the earlier albums where we were very often trying to one-up each other in terms of guitar technique, and ‘The Faded Line’ is rooted in that. It's a pretty exciting guitar song with some difficult parts, but there's also chord progressions that are less abstract than some of our earlier work. So you can really see us kind of developing a songwriting technique within this guitar-centric landscape. I wrote most of the lyrics for this one, and it’s just about this bleak feeling of disconnection and disassociation from one's peers or from what's really going on around one.” \n\n<b>“Omerta”</b>\n“Randy wrote the lyrics for ‘Omerta,’ and I would imagine he was just intrigued by the idea of a code of silence. I don’t want to speak for him, and I’m not going to attribute it directly to any group or organization at all, but I do know it was a reference to a code of silence. Musically, this song started out at probably three times the tempo that it is. It was the same riff but played really fast when Willie brought it in. I think it was probably our producer that suggested we slow it way, way down. So we did, and we really liked how that felt completely different than everything else in the batch of songs that we were putting together.” \n\n<b>“Blood of the Scribe”</b>\n“This is one that I didn't personally have a whole lot to do with. I may have a riff or two in there, but it's a great example of Willie Adler's very unique and very adept guitar riffing. I’ve always assumed the lyrics were Randy’s commentary on what I was talking about earlier, where we felt like we were running on fumes creatively. We were digging deep inside ourselves to come up with something inspired and to find a way to trust our own artistry.” \n\n<b>“One Gun”</b>\n“I was inspired by the rapper Nas for this one. He has a song called ‘One Mic,’ and in that song, he's talking about how one mic can change the world. I sort of twisted that into a very dark, sinister version: If one mic can change the world, so can one gun. It's a pretty bold creative statement, I guess. I don't think I would write that song today, but that's where the idea came from. These days, I’m much more intentional and deliberate about the energy that I put out through my lyrics. I don’t think I’m as reckless with ideas, and I don’t want that kind of energy attached to me.” \n\n<b>“Break You”</b>\n“I didn't have a whole lot to do with this one, creatively. It’s a Willie Adler composition and Randy wrote the lyrics. We're playing it now on tour and it's a blast. Willie's songs are always tricky for me because his style is so different. I've played with him now for about 25 years, so I'm used to it, but it's still sometimes challenging to play some of Willie's riffs. I don't know who Randy was writing about in the lyrics, but it was obviously someone he was very unhappy with.” \n\n<b>“What I've Become”</b>\n“This was an attempt to infuse a more traditional kind of punk rock element into what we were doing. We would continue to tinker with that on albums after <i>Ashes of the Wake</i>, and I think probably to more developed results. But ‘What I've Become’ is an early version of us weaving a punk rock thread through what we were doing. Lyrically, I was writing about the sort of resentments and discontent that build up within a touring band when you've been elbow to elbow, shoulder to shoulder for a thousand miles and way too many months.”\n\n<b>“Ashes of the Wake”</b>\n“That was a song that Willie brought in. For whatever reason, it was really difficult to figure out how to put vocals on it. Nothing really repeated, and it had a cadence that just wasn't really locked into where we were feeling vocal matches at the time. It wasn't a huge stretch for us to consider putting an instrumental on the album. We started out as an instrumental band, so that wasn't some novel idea for us. And it was a cool opportunity to reach out to some of our heroes and influences—Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland in particular—to hop on. We were really excited that they were interested in doing that.” \n\n<b>“Remorse Is for the Dead”</b>\n“This is an early example of doing a kind of ballad-y, soft intro for a heavy track. We’d done it on ‘Vigil’ for the album before, and ‘Remorse Is for the Dead’ is running with that idea. We would continue to do it on other songs—'September Song’ most recently. But ‘Remorse Is for the Dead’ has been a sleeper, because as we've gotten these songs back up and running for the 20th anniversary tour, that's one that just connects so well and it's really great to play live.”","short":"Guitarist Mark Morton reminisces about the band’s breakthrough 20 years on."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ashes-of-the-wake-20th-anniversary-edition/1749340898","playParams":{"id":"1749340898","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749340898/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"18758452","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/18758452?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725004225713,"RTCI":0}}},"1749365053":{"id":"1749365053","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749365053?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/katie-pearlman/1511004436","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Fumbling Towards Glory - EP","artistName":"Katie Pearlman","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/3b/8f/393b8f85-793a-23d7-696e-c1baa3ea0e0c/8721093125365.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b5c3c8","textColor2":"d1d78e","textColor4":"adb277","textColor1":"dbecf3","bgColor":"1e1e1d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fumbling-towards-glory-ep/1749365053","playParams":{"id":"1749365053","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1749365053/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1511004436","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1511004436?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725011152866,"RTCI":0}}},"1750307020":{"id":"1750307020","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750307020?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sabrina-carpenter/390647681","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f8/14/d3/f814d302-6565-85d5-3de2-2d2a456f6d84/Joba1018e00-49fd-418b-804b-0d559d54b9fa-173952611-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339198780_1867067516-Time1724114366378.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e0b694"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1a0904"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cca482","textColor2":"e0b694","textColor4":"b99f94","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1a0904","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/cd/19/3e/cd193e36-5b9c-6423-72d4-a7e62e8a7406/9a650bc2-eaad-47e3-9781-bd7769cfcf6b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c8c8","textColor2":"e3cdbf","textColor4":"b8a79e","textColor1":"f3f6f4","bgColor":"100f17","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4c/4e/e6/4c4ee6d0-7323-ac01-7fe5-bca86f390c03/Job1e81e53f-9d41-4c01-ae92-350e7aef2b4d-173952612-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339198779_1867067517-Time1724115821356.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f0ab70"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1a0904"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"d1a68b","textColor2":"f0ab70","textColor4":"c79879","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1a0904","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b9/e5/f9/b9e5f9f3-d30d-8128-b696-d31d8bd92057/f7f02cf6-82c1-496b-9b5a-005b799346cd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d6a281","textColor2":"fda25e","textColor4":"d59166","textColor1":"feb781","bgColor":"374d83","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/7a/b5/387ab572-633c-639d-98c7-d00f3a0c9a2b/619d8c24-12e1-448a-83be-9ca157e8bc49.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b6a0a3","textColor2":"dd8a58","textColor4":"b47861","textColor1":"dfbdab","bgColor":"132d83","hasP3":false}},"name":"Short n' Sweet","artistName":"Sabrina Carpenter","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f6/15/d0/f615d0ab-e0c4-575d-907e-1cc084642357/24UMGIM61704.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"d19c7f","textColor2":"e1b281","textColor4":"b99b84","textColor1":"ffb47b","bgColor":"193f91","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Some people kill their nemeses with kindness; Sabrina Carpenter, the breakout pop star of summer 2024, takes the opposite tack, shooting withering one-liners at loser exes via featherlight melodies, a wink and a smile. The former Disney Channel star began her music career at age 15 with her 2014 debut single “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying.” Now 25, the singer-songwriter is making the catchiest, funniest, and most honest music of her career at a moment when all the world’s watching. But on songs like “Please Please Please,” on which she begs her boyfriend not to embarrass her (again), she’s poking fun at herself, too. “A lot of what I really love about this album is the accountability,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I will call myself out just as much as I will call out someone else.”\n\nIt’s not because Carpenter’s “vertically challenged,” as she puts it, that she named her sixth album <i>Short n’ Sweet</i>. “I thought about some of these relationships, how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most,” she tells Lowe. “And I thought about the way that I respond to situations: Sometimes it is very nice, and sometimes it’s not very nice.” Hence songs like “Dumb & Poetic,” a gentle acoustic ballad that’s also a blistering takedown of a guy who masks his sleazy tendencies with therapy buzzwords and a highbrow record collection, or the twangy, hilarious “Slim Pickins,” on which she croons: “Jesus, what’s a girl to do?/This boy doesn’t even know the difference between there, their, and they are/Yet he’s naked in my room.”\n\nWith good humor and good taste (channeling Rilo Kiley here, Kacey Musgraves there, and on “Sharpest Tool,” a bit of The Postal Service), Carpenter reframes heartbreak through the lens of life’s absurdity. “When you’re at this point in your life where you’re almost at your wits’ end, everything is funny,” Carpenter tells Lowe. “So much of this album was made in the moments where there was something that I just couldn’t stop laughing about. And I was like, well, that might as well just be a whole song.” \n\nCarpenter wrote a good deal of the album on an 11-day trip to a tiny town in rural France, where the isolation unlocked her brutally honest side, resulting in unprecedentedly vulnerable music and one song she readily admits shouldn’t work on paper but hits anyway: “Espresso,” the song that catapulted her career with four delightfully strange-sounding words: “That’s that me espresso.” “There really are no rules to the things you say,” she tells Lowe on the songwriting process. “You’re just like, what sounds awesome? What feels awesome? And what gets the story across, whatever story that is?” Still, she’s painted herself in a bit of a corner when it comes to placing an order at coffee shops worldwide: “They’re just waiting for me to say it,” she laughs. “And I’m like, ‘Tea.’”","short":"Please, please, please enjoy the year’s most anticipated pop

Album and Interview","standard":"When artists say they’re taking their time to make a new album, they usually give it a year or two. For Zedd, whose last full-length was released in 2015, things took a bit longer. “It can definitely be a disadvantage to take too much time,” the producer tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of the nine-year gap between <i>True Colors</i> and <i>Telos</i>, his third LP. “But it really depends on what you’re trying to do. At some point I had to decide what this album was about. In 2020 or so, I started working on an album, but I had no idea of what I was actually doing. It was like, ‘Well, there’s a pandemic. When am I going to get another chance to sit down and make music?’ But I didn’t have real genuine inspiration, and I was aimlessly trying to make music without any context or real reason.”\n\nOnly one track remained from those sessions, but it was enough to give shape to what would eventually become <i>Telos</i> (that’s Aristotelian for the end or the completion of a goal). “Dream Brother,” which centers around late singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley’s vocal stems from his 1994 track of the same name, “was the one song that to me was giving me that emotion that I wanted,” Zedd says. “[Buckley’s] ‘Dream Brother’ has always been inspirational to me. I’ve always thought that there’s a side of it that could live in a different context. I just thought I could make this into an incredible respectful dance-ish song.”\n\n“Dance-ish” is pretty key to understanding <i>Telos</i>, and Zedd’s entire approach to music after nearly a decade between albums. “There was this moment where I had to decide that this is an album for me,” he says. “That put everything in place. All the songs that I had started, where I was like, ‘How am I going to make [a] 7/8 [time signature] work in dance music?’ Well, it doesn’t matter. It’s no longer dance music. I’m making this for myself—not for the fans, not for the label, not for anybody. It’s just for me.”\n\nUnlike the beat-driven <i>True Colors</i>, here the drums are used for color, tone, and dynamics, flickering in for a few bars and fading out, trading places with synth, piano riffs, and Bea Miller’s vocals on the opening “Out of Time” and adding a punchy rhythmic component to the vaguely South Asian “Shanti.” Tracks such as “Sona,” his 7/8-time collaboration with Irish American trio the olllam, showcase an even greater commitment to writing songs, and make <i>Telos</i> a cohesive whole that asks its listeners to take their time, just like he did making it.\n\n“I can make a good song,” Zedd admits, “but 10 of them aren’t going to make a good album.

The song, which found viral streaming success and also titles this follow-up, blends ’90s-inspired alternative with gritty Southern rock, lyrically likening a tough-to-shake ex-flame to an addictive drug. \n\nThat kind of hardscrabble, hard-partying imagery permeates the record, like on the sludgy power ballad “Intoxicated,” on which Zeiders is a “fiend” for love, and “Addictions,” a plaintive ode to coping mechanisms. Other highlights include the guttural love song “Death of a Cowboy” and closer “Love on the Line,” an anthem of regret. Zeiders recorded the record with producer Mike Elizondo, known for his genre-blurring work with a wide range of artists including Brothers Osborne, Nickel Creek, and Dr. Dre.

Album","standard":"When Luh Tyler raps on “Been Working” that he’s never had a job, it’s not because he’s lazy. Rather, when the Florida rapper released his 2024 album <i>Mr. Skii</i>, he was still only 18 years old. Tyler hasn’t known anything outside of rap, having dropped his first singles in 2022 and immediately finding success. On his debut album, he aims to show that the early hype wasn’t a fluke, blending whispered flows, earworm melodies, and clever punch lines into a sturdy effort that touches upon a number of rap subgenres.\n\nTake “Met Gala,” which cruises along with the warm synths and offbeat flow of plugg music. “7 AM in Munich” twinkles with vintage keyboard chords and artificial strings that bring to mind the ominous trap music prevalent in Tyler’s home state. It’s no mistake that he invites his fellow Floridian Kodak Black onto the track, showcasing the ways in which these Gators do things differently. The album is anchored by pre-release single “2 Slippery,” which features Bossman Dlow and finds the two MCs bouncing off each other like two of their own fans getting rowdy in a mosh pit.","short":"The 18-year-old Florida MC’s debut proves that the early hype was no fluke."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mr-skii/1757938886","playParams":{"id":"1757938886","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/16m0Bonzn2KIGJv83V6Dvk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757938886/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1638445286","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1638445286?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015975336,"RTCI":0}}},"1758357281":{"id":"1758357281","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758357281?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/craig-campbell/305121513","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Almost Greatest Hits","artistName":"Craig Campbell","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a1/72/4a/a1724a1f-9fc3-a073-59d1-44e49ffc4ad6/193436392440_AlmostGreatestHits.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1cfce","textColor2":"c7c4c6","textColor4":"a5a0a0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1c110b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/almost-greatest-hits/1758357281","playParams":{"id":"1758357281","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1vQ76dimVpL1k2MhNu7fVR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758357281/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"305121513","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/305121513?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1724994073035,"RTCI":0}}},"1759059306":{"id":"1759059306","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759059306?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Classical","Music","Orchestral","Contemporary Era"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=261106237-29769512-1149927238","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4a/c7/f4/4ac7f46f-ce3f-0275-8d70-0b9de24e14ab/Job508186cf-4c9f-43f8-827f-fe79c0476d07-172738914-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336648739_1847636397-Time1722296219629.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"3c3339","textColor2":"231d14","textColor4":"4c453a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2e6d1","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0c/a4/e4/0ca4e44c-1ec4-eedf-7511-47bc36d09c5f/82511521-3b66-456d-9817-a4d31cfa8f43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1a1b1c","textColor2":"040202","textColor4":"1c1b1c","textColor1":"010202","bgColor":"7c7f82","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9e/a9/b0/9ea9b0e7-60d3-7729-60f2-84cbf3b27171/Job29020f50-d475-45dc-9cfd-2bc0e1a391d0-172738915-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_336648738_1847636396-Time1722298161955.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"413b3d","textColor2":"28241e","textColor4":"534f45","textColor1":"120c14","bgColor":"fdf8e2","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/74/fc/e3/74fce3cd-96fe-aed0-9886-a5f9f1e65b8c/eb3982bb-16a4-46d7-9c24-9d0105bbd862.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"3a3530","textColor2":"252023","textColor4":"443f3f","textColor1":"191411","bgColor":"bebaad","hasP3":false}},"name":"A Ballet Through Mud","artistName":"RZA, Colorado Symphony & Christopher Dragon","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/45/b0/ba/45b0ba66-0445-b44c-8e22-20026370c244/5059449382777.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f3c35","textColor2":"27221d","textColor4":"524c44","textColor1":"100d0b","bgColor":"fef6df","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Many a ballet before RZA’s was born from a piece of writing. Adolphe Adam’s <i>Giselle</i> is based on the work of 19th-century poets Heinrich Heine and Victor Hugo. Ludwig Minkus’ <i>Don Quixote</i> takes its name from the classic Miguel de Cervantes book. Tchaikovsky’s <i>The Nutcracker</i> is based on a children’s story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, adapted by Alexandre Dumas. You’d be hard-pressed, however, to find a production outside of this one with origins in the noble art of MCing. \n\n“I found my old lyric books during the pandemic that cover my life from the age of about 14 to 19,” RZA says of <i>A Ballet Through Mud</i>’s humble beginnings. “And I started reading through those stories, the ideas, the youthful exploration—all of that made me want to find a way to put music to those lyrics. Then, eventually, the lyrics went away and the music just did all the talking for me.”\n\nThe man also known as The Abbot has done plenty of talking himself over the years, initially as an MC and founding member of iconic hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan, then as published author, actor, and film score composer. Yet, it was another medium altogether that pushed him to diversify his creative bonds once again. “I saw the [dancer, director, choreographer, and activist] Alvin Ailey documentary during that period of time, and I caught the understanding of ‘Let the body language talk, let the music talk,’” he says. “A picture could paint a thousand words, type of thing.”\n\nThe song titles within <i>A Ballet Through Mud</i>—“Clear Sky After Storm,” “Soft Footsteps,” and “The Night Dances When You Least Expect It,” to name a few—set scenes in and of themselves, but RZA has crafted an altogether empowering listening experience, one he’s had verified by someone who couldn’t be closer to his practice: his wife. “If you play it, it’s going to make your mind move,” RZA says. “You’re going to start thinking about shit. You’re going to start seeing shit. One day, we was headed out to Vegas, and my wife was rolling with me. It was playing and she was just looking out the window. By the time we got to the third song, she had a whole movie in her head. She pitched me a movie, yo.” \n\nMusically, <i>A Ballet Through Mud</i> is the result of collaboration with Australian conductor Christopher Dragon and the Colorado Symphony. Notably, RZA worked with Dragon on <i>A Wu-Tang Experience: Live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre</i>, a one-off concert experience featuring orchestra arrangements of Wu-Tang Clan classics. He has, of course, also had experience directing eight of the most impossibly talented MCs in hip-hop history, but his time behind the boards for all-timers such as Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Ol’ Dirty Bastard is likely the least relevant of his experience here. \n\n“I change from the normal way that I would produce a hip-hop album or produce a song because now I’m not dealing with just my own creativity or just my own equipment,” he says. “I need 60 musicians to understand what we are doing. It was a lot, but I was blessed with years of scoring movies and working in that field. So my knowledge of songwriting, my knowledge of emotional expression, my knowledge of composing films, all of that just came at this moment in time to say, ‘RZA, do something that you haven’t done before.’ And bong, bong.”","short":"The result of RZA telling himself, “Do something you haven’t done before.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-ballet-through-mud/1759059306","playParams":{"id":"1759059306","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52JbblOmGbKWmQkJWMKe6Y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759059306/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"261106237","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/261106237?l=en-US"},{"id":"29769512","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29769512?l=en-US"},{"id":"1149927238","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1149927238?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725018405466,"RTCI":0}}},"1759220698":{"id":"1759220698","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759220698?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/internet-girl/1476186420","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"ROLE MODEL (DELUXE VERSION)","artistName":"Internet Girl","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/43/80/ce/4380cec3-da31-b481-346f-a530891829dc/198588700396.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8da8b6","textColor2":"8ac5f1","textColor4":"709fc3","textColor1":"aed0e0","bgColor":"090a0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/role-model-deluxe-version/1759220698","playParams":{"id":"1759220698","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ui6fqKeQrsxVVArV6mkr1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759220698/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1476186420","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1476186420?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725003967684,"RTCI":0}}},"1759375216":{"id":"1759375216","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759375216?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Jungle/Drum'n'bass","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/reeko/164566046","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Urmah","artistName":"Reeko","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/ae/fa/39aefa1d-2db8-d7e2-e8bb-9db931cd6c64/5056467386855_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c3c3c6","textColor2":"ccccce","textColor4":"a8a8aa","textColor1":"ededf1","bgColor":"1a1a1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/urmah/1759375216","playParams":{"id":"1759375216","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/50icP3HHEH569847ddT645"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759375216/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"164566046","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/164566046?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725010871664,"RTCI":0}}},"1759815143":{"id":"1759815143","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759815143?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kasbo/739932137","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Learning of Urgency Remixes -

Yet those who saw the Puerto Rican phenom’s prolonged rise through trap and, subsequently, reggaetón assuredly remember his streetwise roots. “My approach to making music remains the same regardless of my previous hits,” he tells Apple Music. “I am continuously making music and perfecting my craft.”\n\nWith the full benefit of his experiences, Towers engineered this informed return to form, resulting in one of the most gratifying projects of his career. Working closely with top producers like Full Harmony and Ovy On the Drums, and collaborating with a handful of esteemed vocal talents, he reinforces his strengths as both rapper and singer while still hinting at his expanding range. “It showcases an elevated version of my previous released music and sounds,” he says, a sentiment immediately felt on the hard-hitting opener “COMPETENCIA” and the immediately following “OTRA OPORTUNIDAD.” “This album portrays the best version of me as an artist.”\n\nBuilding with others in Latin music has been core to Towers’ career, and some of his guests here speak to that aspect of his ascent. The slow-and-steady “AUNQUE LLEGUE OTRO” reunites him with his “La Curiosidad” cohort Jay Wheeler, while Bad Bunny’s unmistakable presence on the shape-shifting “ADIVINO” echoes their previous collabs like “Estamos Arriba.” Relative newcomers like música mexicana sensation Peso Pluma and rising Bronx rapper NTG add to the auspicious nature behind <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>, the former soaring with him on “SE TE NOTA” and the latter helping him take it back to the block with swagger for “LA PRIMERA VEZ.” \n","short":"The Puerto Rican phenom expresses his stylistic range on this new

Album","standard":"As Peso Pluma ascended within—and beyond—música mexicana, the name Tito Double P proved all but unavoidable alongside his. Stepping fully out of the shadows, his songwriting partner and real-life cousin showcases his artistry firsthand on <i>INCÓMODO</i>. A demonstration of his collaborative wizardry, these 21 tracks showcase his studio magic with a plethora of esteemed guests, including the high-profile likes of Natanael Cano and Eslabon Armado. His distinctively gruff voice serves him well when paired with sad-boy lifer Junior H on “5-7” or Gabito Ballesteros on the brisk corrido “DETONA,” but also on the album’s rarer solo moments like “EL LOKERÓN” or the embittered kiss-off “FARANDULITAS.” Diverging from genre expectations, he pleasantly surprises with the ranchera-infused Grupo Frontera team-up “AY MAMÁ.” Naturally, Peso Pluma shows up to support as well, present for the hard truths of “DOS DÍAS” and the sentimental send-off “LOS CUADROS.” ","short":"The songwriter steps into the spotlight with a distinctive debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inc%C3%B3modo/1761411580","playParams":{"id":"1761411580","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27GWSFRITD8JJcSGMgEfTN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761411580/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1690905306","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1690905306?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725001751835,"RTCI":0}}},"1761456252":{"id":"1761456252","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761456252?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Nature","Music","New Age"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1742095500-283149484","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f3/7e/29/f37e294b-4cfa-4d14-fa8a-3e588d109ed0/Job656303e5-808e-4dad-820d-8bb734a1bc50-174261206-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339902220_1872374142-Time1724492153371.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f2b852"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"acc6c4","textColor2":"f2b852","textColor4":"c29341","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3a/aa/6f/3aaa6fd3-6d2b-4d3a-0450-499c22afa3f7/28b890ae-adaf-4f3d-bd55-1ea3b5ce081b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9da45a","textColor2":"d5b86b","textColor4":"ae9759","textColor1":"c1c96d","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/18/59/0c/18590c6f-18d5-eaec-3da8-132e9785cd6c/Jobfa7dd9aa-ab23-49d8-8655-1c8f9be7d88b-174261205-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339902221_1872374146-Time1724490853291.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c5af29","textColor2":"d7d4b0","textColor4":"acaa8d","textColor1":"f6da34","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"WE ARE BIOPHONICA (feat.

In his second project of 2024, the Apple Music exclusive <i>Code Derivation</i>, he delivers the glutton’s rejoinder: Why not both? \n\nGlasper, who’s only ever had to focus his efforts on one or the other in the interest of time, made an album that splits the difference between the two, emphasizing their shared genetics. <i>Code Derivation</i> is largely made up of two versions of the same tracks—one played live in studio by Glasper’s band and a version “flipped” by a producer of his choosing. “Jazz is literally in the beginning bones of hip-hop,” Glasper says. “That's why I even used the word ‘derivation,’ because it’s a derivative of jazz. I’ve played with the masters of both of these genres, so I wanted to do a project where it’s like, ‘Hey, I’m going to do jazz songs that I wrote with my band—with my friends—and I’m going to get dope producers that are my friends to sample me.”\n\nOn the band side of things, that includes names like Walter Smith III, Mike Moreno, Kendrick Scott, Keyon Harrold, and Vicente Archer—the majority of whom the pianist has known since long before his turn as a multiple-Grammy-winning artist and composer. “The beginnings of me is not only straight-ahead jazz, but it’s also particular players,” Glasper says. “I went to high school with Walter and Mike Moreno and Kendrick Scott. We literally grew up together and learned how to play jazz together. Keyon, we met in jazz camp in 11th grade.” \n\nOn the production side, he’s enlisted friends and collaborators like Hi-Tek, Black Milk, Karriem Riggins, Taylor McFerrin, and the one guest Glasper would be hard-pressed to deny as his favorite of the bunch: his son Riley. “When I have guests, it’s always the best of the best,” Glasper says. “That’s my thing. People that I’ve wanted to work with or people that I’m just big fans of and the world are fans of. But at the same time, now that I’ve established myself and I have a certain platform, you’re going to see more and more of me using people [my fans] don’t necessarily know as much.” \n\nOn the MC front, Glasper’s called on less established acts like Beaumont, Texas-hailing Jamari (a frequent collaborator of his son), Minneapolis’ MMYYKK, and Brooklyn-born Oswin Benjamin—young rhymers who Glasper says became the project’s pièce de résistance. “I almost didn’t have any guests at all, really,” he says. “I was just like, it could be the jazz tune and then the beats and that’s it. But then, at the last minute, I was like, ‘I could use some rap on here. I think that’ll really bring [us] to the hip-hop shit.’”\n\n\nThe project is indeed delightfully guest-heavy, assembling the perfect collective of contributors to help convey a personal investment in two of Black music’s most revered genres. Which, to let Glasper tell it, wasn’t very much work at all. “I trusted who I picked,” he says. “The beauty of my collaboration is that I don’t try to take over and overproduce. The fact that I picked you <i>is</i> the production. I know what you’re going to do and I know it’s going to be dope.”","short":"“I’m going to get dope producers that are my friends to sample me.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/code-derivation/1762504924","playParams":{"id":"1762504924","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762504924/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4643652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4643652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725010076673,"RTCI":0}}},"1762512786":{"id":"1762512786","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762512786?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joya-mooi/364002603","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Open Hearts - EP","artistName":"Joya Mooi","artwork":{"width":5269,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d6/7d/a8/d67da83f-21f0-86e9-53f2-74946e3e89c3/8721093577065.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5269,"textColor3":"c9dd87","textColor2":"c8f4fd","textColor4":"add7db","textColor1":"ecfb93","bgColor":"406655","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-hearts-ep/1762512786","playParams":{"id":"1762512786","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762512786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"364002603","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/364002603?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725003729619,"RTCI":0}}},"1762513725":{"id":"1762513725","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762513725?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cash-cobain/953108105","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ac/8b/92/ac8b926a-0a69-0a22-31fa-187aabad6414/Job19097cf5-acec-4aac-b37d-6a5f5e564b52-173575316-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_338365145_1860508575-Time1723502570557.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e79643"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"090a10"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c0a0c0","textColor2":"e79643","textColor4":"c07c38","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"090a10","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d6/98/fd/d698fdc0-3702-5f84-9824-441e5f1bc788/3a007e59-37f6-4746-9a90-335c8b6ef8c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c09aab","textColor2":"e5b7ca","textColor4":"ca95ac","textColor1":"d9bdc8","bgColor":"5e0e35","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9a/50/a0/9a50a0f3-12be-2ef7-0c08-a5641df33ac7/Job9efef6f0-d187-45ea-beed-01833cad92e5-173575557-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_338365140_1860508569-Time1723503940948.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c7bbba"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"090a10"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c6adc7","textColor2":"c7bbba","textColor4":"a59896","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"090a10","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2c/f8/e7/2cf8e7b9-1b6d-25a0-e6b6-eaab9a462c74/fe69c78b-f738-4d06-b704-ade1f1ce4014.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfb1cd","textColor2":"d8b9db","textColor4":"c1a1b8","textColor1":"ebcdf5","bgColor":"63402f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d7/de/ea/d7deeaae-fa16-e045-d576-e79e33a35e7d/397a25aa-835d-419f-bbb7-5b53a11d9858.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aba845","textColor2":"c3c334","textColor4":"9c9c29","textColor1":"d6d356","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"PLAY CASH COBAIN (Apple Music Edition)","artistName":"Cash Cobain","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d4/48/c3/d448c31a-6eda-10bf-2f34-2f900a148665/8721093243410.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2000,"textColor3":"bb7536","textColor2":"d98332","textColor4":"b36b2a","textColor1":"e38f41","bgColor":"1d0c0a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Sampling is a part of me, because I grew up on these songs,” Cash Cobain tells Apple Music. “I just take everything, throw it in a bowl and mix it up, and make my own Slizzy sauce.” Raised in the Bronx and Jamaica, Queens, two of the most hallowed locales in hip-hop history, he came up as a leader in the city’s vibrant sample-drill and sexy-drill waves before breaking big nationally as a sought-after producer for Drake, Trippie Redd, and Lil Yachty, to name but a few. Even while he scored hits and built his movement with locals such as B-Lovee and Chow Lee, he didn’t get as much credit for his rapping until his single “Fisherrr” with Bay Swag and its corresponding Ice Spice remix made him inescapably ubiquitous. “Two years ago, I thought I made it,” he says, adding, “but now I’m like, ‘You going somewhere.’” \n\nAfter linking on both sides of the booth as a featured artist opposite the likes of Don Toliver and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, his proper album debut <i>PLAY CASH COBAIN</i> puts him fully front and center. The raw sexual energy of “act like” and “rump punch” exemplify the sumptuous sound he pioneered and its correspondingly raunchy lyrical direction. Elsewhere, though, he demonstrates a softer, more romantic side on “message to u” and “wassup wya,” actively conjuring his dream girl fantasies into sincere realities. (“The album is sexual healing,” he quips.) Whether he’s creatively interpolating R&B classics on “all i wanna hear” and “cantsleep/drunkinluv” or flirting with other sources like on the Afrobeats-inflected “luv it,” his cutting-edge approach makes nearly every track feel momentous and of the moment.\n\nAs if his own verses and hooks weren’t enough, the diverse guest list on <i>PLAY CASH COBAIN</i> nods to Cobain’s elevated status in the rap game. Quavo and the aforementioned Toliver help set the tone on opener “slizzyhunchodon,” their respective waves uniting for one irrestible vibe. For the show-stopping “problem,” he gathers a breathtaking and unexpected array of compounding features by everyone from Big Sean and Fabolous to Flo Milli and YN Jay. “It's like everyone is doing their own freestyle to it,” he says of the multigenerational posse cut built around Brooklyn singer Laila!’s single “Not My Problem.” For the most part, Cobain does what he does best without high-profile help, reflecting his humble rise from a South Jamaica basement. “I’m just trying to bring positivity and fun,” he says. “I want my people or my peers around me to do the same. I want everybody to win.”","short":"Cash Cobain: “I’m just trying to bring positivity and fun.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/play-cash-cobain-apple-music-edition/1762513725","playParams":{"id":"1762513725","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762513725/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"953108105","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/953108105?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015730544,"RTCI":0}}},"1762674813":{"id":"1762674813","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762674813?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ti%C3%ABsto/4091218","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Tomorrowland 2024: Tiësto at Mainstage, Weekend 2 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Tiësto","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/c3/e1/71c3e19a-4c68-7a20-7324-ad35595aefb1/9c6a0aac-8f8c-4db2-a5ba-ba54cbe89d04.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdc0c0","textColor2":"8af2d8","textColor4":"6ec3ae","textColor1":"eceeed","bgColor":"00070a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tomorrowland-2024-ti%C3%ABsto-at-mainstage-weekend-2-dj-mix/1762674813","playParams":{"id":"1762674813","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762674813/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4091218","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4091218?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1724976038773,"RTCI":0}}},"1762699870":{"id":"1762699870","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762699870?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":26,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1046759940-78011850","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Tomorrowland 2024: REZZMAU5 at Freedom, Weekend 1 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Rezz & deadmau5","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f8/c8/ac/f8c8ac7d-a68d-c861-d1bb-245588f4adbb/3037392f-6f9d-49d9-a1f0-baa465d569fe.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdc0c0","textColor2":"8af2d8","textColor4":"6ec3ae","textColor1":"eceeed","bgColor":"00070a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tomorrowland-2024-rezzmau5-at-freedom-weekend-1-dj-mix/1762699870","playParams":{"id":"1762699870","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762699870/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1046759940","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1046759940?l=en-US"},{"id":"78011850","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/78011850?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1724976705011,"RTCI":0}}},"1762732031":{"id":"1762732031","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762732031?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-23","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-poppa/1454571030","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/0e/29/72/0e29723e-cfce-a15f-0f98-ba1a5d10aa7c/Jobba938b82-7dc2-4aab-a717-c156a62c74eb-174153432-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339650612_1870500482-Time1724355524950.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f3c51f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b3b3b3","textColor2":"f3c51f","textColor4":"c7a21e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8e/70/a7/8e70a76a-1b58-640d-c9c1-5a3bee4c5bf1/Job8a6eb97b-e673-4257-a3aa-675606caac9e-174153433-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_339650613_1870500483-Time1724357570538.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ceb419","textColor2":"dbdbdb","textColor4":"b3b3b3","textColor1":"fddc1b","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false}},"name":"WEE ARE WHO WE ARE","artistName":"Lil Poppa","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5b/7b/a5/5b7ba555-966e-1d80-3bf2-3f223dba8f49/24UMGIM80500.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"9e9e9e","textColor2":"f7a900","textColor4":"c88902","textColor1":"c3c3c3","bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Though Jacksonville MC Lil Poppa has been one of the most consistent voices in Southern rap since he emerged in 2017, he felt the need for a refresher on the opener to his 2024 album <i>WEE ARE WHO WE ARE</i>. The emotional intro, “Reintroduction,” finds the rapper reflecting on being a father—“I do this shit for my lil’ boy, he deserves everythin’”—and his mortality as an MC. He puts himself in lofty company, spitting, “Pac died at 25, Biggie died at 24/And it made me nervous/I just turned the same age a couple of days ago.” It’s this blend of anxiety and charisma that informs <i>WEE ARE WHO WE ARE</i>, which showcases Poppa as a young dad, clearly feeling his success but wary of all the distractions that come with wins in the rap game.\n\nPoppa stays true to his Southern roots on the project, recruiting Louisiana legends Boosie Badazz and Webbie for “Untamed,” a cut that finds the young MC going bar for bar with two of rap’s sturdiest lyricists. Despite the sterling guest features and momentary breaks of relaxation, Poppa infuses <i>WEE ARE WHO WE ARE</i> with the stressors of being a new papa and star in the spotlight. On “Stop Grieving,” he hopes things will get better but knows such aspirations are a long shot. “Feel like I’m all out of breath/Runnin’ from problems/Dealin’ with pain/Thinkin’ a dollar can solve it/This shit ain’t the same,” he raps.","short":"The Jacksonville MC shows off a blend of anxiety and charisma."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wee-are-who-we-are/1762732031","playParams":{"id":"1762732031","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2oeZwMMRmBnpjmkYGCQE2w"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762732031/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1454571030","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1454571030?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1724993079497,"RTCI":0}}},"1762764557":{"id":"1762764557","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762764557?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gene-richards-jr/1502769897","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Thug's Prayer - EP","artistName":"Gene Richards Jr","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/09/03/96/09039691-9479-5af2-baee-143a48b94e9b/8718723265683.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfbaba","textColor2":"1cebe6","textColor4":"17bdb8","textColor1":"efe8e8","bgColor":"030301","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thugs-prayer-ep/1762764557","playParams":{"id":"1762764557","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3gq7Hv23HkAsrnMiRswS5E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762764557/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1502769897","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1502769897?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725008824417,"RTCI":0}}},"1763092498":{"id":"1763092498","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763092498?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yo-gabba-gabba/433108373","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/3f/ba/55/3fba5574-2379-c492-ecf5-6d6980c36aa1/96e8bcdb-9885-4991-8641-9de0443a71a1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"49402a","textColor2":"2f2620","textColor4":"51462f","textColor1":"251f19","bgColor":"dac46c","hasP3":false}},"name":"Yo Gabba GabbaLand!

artist like a big diary entry on her second album, <i>Revenge</i>. \n\nThe title, to Muni Long, represents a powerful concept: “The best revenge is success.” The album’s 14 tracks detail the highs and lows of various relationships in her life, serving as a therapeutic outlet for her thoughts and feelings, no matter whether it’s about the pressure to find a life partner before a certain age (“30s”), a powerful connection she shares with her lover (“Superpowers”), or being in love with someone who isn’t good for her (“Make Me Forget”). \n\nOn the title track, Long ruminates on the aftermath of a relationship’s end, rejecting any vindictive impulses even though she’s hurt after finding out about her partner’s betrayal. “Not lookin’ for revenge/Especially on someone I once considered a friend/I’d rather make amends,” she sings on the chorus. “Maybe five years ago, Priscilla, I would’ve been trying to burn this whole shit down,” Long says. “I’m knocking everything over, but I’m not doing that now.” \n","short":"Muni Long on her latest album: “Because the best revenge is

Mini Album","standard":"“During production, as we concentrated more and more on the songs, it occurred to me that ‘CRAZY’ is a word that perfectly suits the music,” K-pop idol KAZUHA tells Apple Music about the lead single from LE SSERAFIM’s fourth mini album, also titled <i>CRAZY</i>. Phonky and upbeat, the song is a part of an eclectic five-track album from the Korean girl group, who debuted in 2022. In an effort to explore the various meanings of the title word, <i>CRAZY</i> moves from the EDM-fueled spoken-word track “Chasing Lightning” to the hip-hop hype song “Pierrot” (sampling Kim Wan Sun’s 1990 hit “Pierrot Laughs at Us”) to the Coachella-debuted dance-pop number “1-800-hot-n-fun.” It all culminates in the tender ballad “Crazier,” titled something closer to “the reason I can’t go crazy” in its original Korean. “Having this as the last track on the album is like us posing a question to you,” shares YUNJIN. “What does CRAZY mean to you?” Here’s what the five members of LE SSERAFIM—SAKURA, KIM CHAEWON, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA, and HONG EUNCHAE—had to say about each track.\n\n<b>“Chasing Lightning”</b> \nSAKURA: “This is the five of us sharing thoughts about things we’re into, stuff that we’re crazy about. And it has a message: ‘Listen to your own heart and change this moment!’ Unlike the intro tracks from our previous albums, we switched things up here by opening with everyday conversation.”\n\n<b>“CRAZY”</b> \nKAZUHA: “‘CRAZY’ is the title track of the album. It’s about moments when you discover something that you can go crazy about. When I first saw the title I was like, ‘Wow, that’s pretty intense!’ [laughs] During production, as we concentrated more and more on the songs, it occurred to me that ‘CRAZY’ is a word that perfectly suits the music. The melody on this track has a great hook that gets you humming along to it, anytime and anywhere. It’s perfect for when you need a burst of excitement or a boost in self-esteem.”\n\n<b>“Pierrot”</b>\nKIM CHAEWON: “The sample here is from ‘Pierrot Laughs at Us’ by Kim Wan Sun. Personally, I’m a fan of the hip-hop style. I was really glad to do ‘Pierrot’ because it's in my favored style and also showcases a fresh new side to us as a group.”\n\n<b>“1-800-hot-n-fun”</b>\nHONG EUNCHAE: “I like how the title is in the form of an American toll-free number. The track is all about the message: ‘Call us at “1-800-hot-n-fun”! Let’s have a hot and wild time together!’ It’s filled with fun little details, too. My favorite lyric from this is ‘Where the heck is SAKI?’—‘SAKI’ being our nickname for SAKURA. The track is brimming with a rock feel, so please enjoy.”\n\n<b>“Crazier”</b>\nHUH YUNJIN: “I think the word ‘crazy’ means different things to different people. The members before me talked about four songs that each have their own take on ‘crazy.’ But this last track, ‘Crazier,’ is different. It’s about the absence of ‘crazy.’ The message of the song is that youthful life can be beautiful, even if lacking in crazy, which we wanted to convey with sincerity and empathy. Having this as the last track on the album is like us posing a question to you: ‘What does CRAZY mean to you?’”","short":"The K-pop group talks through each of the tracks on their fourth mini album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crazy-ep/1763658157","playParams":{"id":"1763658157","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763658157/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1616740364","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1616740364?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725020821457,"RTCI":0}}},"1763704551":{"id":"1763704551","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763704551?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yfg-fatso/1531662818","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ac/aa/88/acaa8815-b6a8-cd34-b1dd-ec12079894a8/Job1baecf5c-2ffb-4af8-b0b8-bb8e46bb3ece-174499315-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_340391181_1876498558-Time1724878381301.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fbefd3"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0e0d0e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cacdc6","textColor2":"fbefd3","textColor4":"cbc1ab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0d0e","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/16/e9/80/16e98057-8599-e14a-ad47-ef402331af71/Jobdf905b14-0dd6-4799-884f-1487b154da8f-174499316-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_340391182_1876498559-Time1724950038738.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d1c6b5","textColor2":"ddca9f","textColor4":"b8a884","textColor1":"fcf0dd","bgColor":"241d16","hasP3":false}},"name":"A Reaper's Ceremony","artistName":"YFG FATSO","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ea/dd/7c/eadd7cdf-4edd-7c7d-dfbc-dfcf032a72d3/43931.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfc6bb","textColor2":"fff4cd","textColor4":"d0c5a3","textColor1":"fdf5ea","bgColor":"190d00","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","short":"The Chicago rapper seizes the spotlight on this street-level project."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-reapers-ceremony/1763704551","playParams":{"id":"1763704551","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5zU9ruLdGdOm3Iip94ItGw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763704551/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1531662818","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1531662818?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725004015987,"RTCI":0}}},"1763856757":{"id":"1763856757","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763856757?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/confidence-man/1159016830","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I CAN'T LOSE YOU (THE REMIXES) -

Those unable to recall particulars of his ascent should find his beginnings on <i>DAYS BEFORE RODEO</i> as illuminating and intriguing as they were at the time. Only his second official mixtape after the preceding <i>Owl Pharaoh</i>, this 2014 effort succinctly revealed the hip-hop showstopper he would soon become. No longer behind the scenes, he brought what he’d learned from sessions with T.I. and Ye to the proverbial table, exuding rock star energy on “Drugs You Should Try It” and indulging in EDM edginess on “Basement Freestyle.”\n\nWith beats co-produced by the likes of FKi 1st and Metro Boomin, Atlanta’s tremendous influence further manifests amid the melodically eerie “Sloppy Toppy” with Migos and Peewee Longway and the machine-gun trap of “Mamacita” with Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug, the latter returning for the cinematic “Skyfall.” Honing his signature vocals and ad-libs in apparent reverence to his hallowed Houston origins, Scott goes beyond mere FX playtime on “Zombies,” hurtling towards the transformative approach that would come to define him.","short":"Ten years on, the Houston superstar salutes his seminal mixtape."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/days-before-rodeo/1763919907","playParams":{"id":"1763919907","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/54Y471E7GNBSOXjZtqONId"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763919907/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"549236696","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/549236696?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725005941084,"RTCI":0}}},"1763934442":{"id":"1763934442","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763934442?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/doechii/1437641643","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cb/cb/9a/cbcb9a26-247b-cb97-7cad-05ac205a8c37/138249a4-8c0a-44f2-92be-3d7469677fe9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"abc2b7","textColor2":"f4b482","textColor4":"c69268","textColor1":"d3f0e4","bgColor":"0c0904","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b8/19/6b/b8196ba1-abe7-3bab-833a-3f584c49c41b/8bb188cd-682a-4c3a-9ba9-f73868caf9a9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2b68e","textColor2":"d2b690","textColor4":"a89274","textColor1":"f3e3b1","bgColor":"020203","hasP3":false}},"name":"Alligator Bites Never Heal","artistName":"Doechii","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c8/14/6e/c8146e5b-854a-dcc2-5afa-e8a6f10154ba/24UMGIM88643.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9c1ba","textColor2":"e6b48d","textColor4":"b89471","textColor1":"e7ede8","bgColor":"001600","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"On Doechii’s 2024 release, the Tampa-born rapper showcases the blend of clever rhymes with deep, philosophical musings that have punctuated early releases like 2020’s <i>Oh the Places You'll Go</i> mixtape and 2022’s <i>she / her / black bitch</i> EP. Lead cut “STANKA POOH” finds the Top Dawg Entertainment artist wrestling with her artistic mortality and role as a Black woman in music. She raps: “Let’s start the story backwards/I’m dead, she’s dead, just another Black Lives Mattered/And if I die today I die a bastard/TikTok rapper, part-time YouTube actor.”\n\nObviously, Doechii aims to be bigger than viral clips and TV shows so small they can fit on your computer screen. On <i>Alligator Bites Never Heal</i>, Doechii asserts herself as one of rap’s most impressive bar-for-bar MCs. “DENIAL IS A RIVER” is a classic narrative cut in the style of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” while “NISSAN ALTIMA” is an electro-rap thriller designed to keep the dance floor hot and heart rates up. She sums it up simply enough when she raps: “All beef gets smoked/I’m a real fly bitch, you in coach.”","short":"The TDE artist asserts herself as one of rap’s most impressive bar-for-bar MCs."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alligator-bites-never-heal/1763934442","playParams":{"id":"1763934442","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/60UzB8mOCMpc7xkuJE6Bwc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763934442/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1437641643","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1437641643?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015741407,"RTCI":0}}},"1764110608":{"id":"1764110608","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764110608?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-29","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/christian-nodal/1079597775","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/74/fc/33/74fc330b-33f4-9330-d880-43656a2eca92/720692f9-f1a4-4ef6-ad5b-922c63f41cd6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dadada","textColor2":"fbe8dd","textColor4":"dacbc2","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"595858","hasP3":false}},"name":"PA'L CORA . 01 - EP","artistName":"Christian Nodal","artwork":{"width":5464,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2b/e4/d7/2be4d797-39b5-73a5-600e-4cc267691916/196872401530.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5464,"textColor3":"b9a595","textColor2":"dc8c29","textColor4":"b17022","textColor1":"e7cfb9","bgColor":"050007","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Since giving mariachi a life-affirming infusion of new blood on his 2017 album <i>Me Dejé Llevar</i>, Christian Nodal continues to bring his invigorating artistry to música mexicana. Coming after a string of solid 2024 singles, as well as collaborations with Grupo Frontera and Residente, this EP collects three recent favorites and pairs them with another four tracks. Leading with the bold Peso Pluma-infused hit “La Intención,” the Sonoran singer-songwriter swiftly shifts gears for “Kbron y Medio,” a cleverly constructed breakup song that addresses hedonistic tendencies and deep pain of love lost. “No Me 100to Bien” tugs more earnestly at the heartstrings, while the riveting Estevie duet “Un Besito Más” soundtracks bad decisions made for all the right reasons. Recalling his feature on Romeo Santos’ <i>Fórmula, Vol. 3</i>, the impassioned closer “La Bachatita” furthers his artistic interest in the thriving tropical sound.

But for a native New Englander, no moment was more special than his two-night stand at Boston’s most iconic venue in July 2024. “If I had enough words, I would tell you what this meant to me,” Kahan says on this live-album document of the events, “but I’m just going to play my sad, depressing music.”\n\nAnd that he does, treating his adoring faithful to a set list that essentially plays like <i>Stick Season</i> on shuffle, albeit delivered with the added stadium-rock gusto he’s acquired on his journey from bedroom troubadour to main-stage fixture. Even the most unspeakably tender songs in his canon—like “Forever” and “Maine”—are bolstered by the ultimate special effect: the sound of 38,000 fans shouting out every single lyric, transforming Kahan’s private mental-health mantras into communal catharsis. And once he starts strumming out <i>Stick Season</i>’s anthemic title track to close the show, the crowd unleashes a gale-force sing-along that’s powerful enough to topple the Green Monster.","short":"An ecstatic Boston crowd turns his folk hymns into communal therapy."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/noah-kahan-live-from-fenway-park/1764435065","playParams":{"id":"1764435065","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5yzUfYKDBOpwNYbIdvVqfp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764435065/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"328583953","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/328583953?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725015770907,"RTCI":0}}},"1764578373":{"id":"1764578373","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764578373?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jazlyn-martin/1745892459","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/81/e1/67/81e16766-ee32-dc60-e010-b2d85c229b73/32e16f44-4b09-4693-b129-7ecdddb6b918.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ddd9c8","textColor2":"f2eee8","textColor4":"dad0c1","textColor1":"f5f9f2","bgColor":"7d5822","hasP3":false}},"name":"Identity Crisis","artistName":"Jazlyn Martin","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/03/05/86/03058643-a24e-4778-fab0-6fb22784b14d/Jazlyn_Cover13-copy-df236265.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8ae7a","textColor2":"d79841","textColor4":"b57e36","textColor1":"efd496","bgColor":"2c1a0a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/identity-crisis/1764578373","playParams":{"id":"1764578373","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6SVpFDmV4FZhviaJclIg5s"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764578373/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1745892459","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1745892459?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725003891253,"RTCI":0}}},"1764590509":{"id":"1764590509","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764590509?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Children's Music","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-08-30","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=445615128-1720074368","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Nick Jr. Mix it Up!

Album","standard":"“I'm at a point in my life where I just let things happen when they're supposed to happen,” Big Sean tells Apple Music about the decision to drop <i>Better Me Than You</i>. “So I just felt like it was time.” Originally thwarted by an online leak, the hitmaking rapper waited a few beats before moving forward with his first album in four years. Yet where 2020’s <i>Detroit 2</i> made for a love letter to his hometown, its follow-up surges beyond the sentimental to embody something altogether more meaningful regarding the man behind the mic. “I was inspired to have fun, first and foremost,” he says, “but I was also inspired by just the events that were going on in my life.”\n\nThe terminally online will no doubt scour its contents for details and disses after his departure from G.O.O.D. Music, where he proved one of its most commercially successful and visible acts for over a decade. But even if one wanted to read deeply into the unrelenting and accusatory “Apologize,” his album is so much more than mere hip-hop gossip fodder. There’s a clear sense throughout the album that the accomplished punchline craftsman has grown since the days of <i>Finally Famous</i>, personally as well as artistically. In addition to the interlude monologue “Clarity,” he expresses the impact of first-time fatherhood on cuts like “On Up,” his maturity made increasingly evident. “It’s not that I'm trying to prove myself,” he says. “I'm really trying to <i>improve</i> myself.”\n\nTo this end, Sean Don ensures that his guests, like Larry June and Charlie Wilson, enhance his own performances rather than pull focus. Formerly of The Internet, Syd maintains an ethereal vocal presence throughout the teachable moments of “Something,” while Thundercat and Eryn Allen Kane add a certain musicality to the cathartic “Black Void.” Still, he hasn’t lost his edge in the process, letting loose with sexy-drill mastermind Cash Cobain on the reckless “Get You Back” and defensively dismissing haters with Gunna on “It Is What It Is.” By the time the Three 6 Mafia-reminiscent “Precision” rolls around, his victory feels nothing short of palpable. “What is really important to me is the progression of myself and passing that on to my family and to my audience or to whoever I can,” he says.","short":"The Detroit 2 follow-up aims higher: “I'm really trying to improve myself.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/better-me-than-you/1765430262","playParams":{"id":"1765430262","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Re8JSuo0lUxYCMjDnafvd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765430262/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"302533564","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/302533564?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1725017596531,"RTCI":0}}}},"artists":{"179903":{"id":"179903","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/179903?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["R&B/Soul"],"name":"Tyrese","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features115/v4/99/3b/e6/993be643-24da-314d-2bb1-8c44f393ced9/mzm.gaayxmqm.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"b7bfb6","textColor2":"daccb8","textColor4":"bab09e","textColor1":"d5dfd7","bgColor":"3d4136","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyrese/179903"}},"187152":{"id":"187152","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/187152?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["Rock"],"name":"Laurie
