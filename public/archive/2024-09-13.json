Greatest Love","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"London Grammar","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"London Grammar’s Dan Rothman thinks the band’s fourth album might mark the death of their youth. “There was a naivety about our process sometimes that we maybe have left in this record,” the guitarist and keyboardist tells Apple Music. “There were moments where we were testing a slightly more elevated process.” The grandly titled <i>The Greatest Love</i> signals the end of one era for the electronic-pop trio and the beginning of another. Eleven years since Rothman, vocalist Hannah Reid, and drummer and programmer Dot Major emerged with their debut <i>If You Wait</i>, <i>The Greatest Love</i> is the sound of a band with miles in their legs and hard-won wisdom in their heads. It’s a rich, sumptuous listen, taking in minimalist dance bangers, contemplative folktronica, plaintive piano ballads, and mellow, melodious indie pop.\n\nKey to its creation was the band coming by their own studio to operate from, setting up base in a room at Damon Albarn’s Studio 13 complex and working to their own timescale. “You could take some time away and come back to it,” explains Major. “Before, we were always booking a big block of time in a big commercial studio but this time we had a freedom we didn’t have before. You could spend all day setting up a weird sound in a way that you just would never do in a studio because it would be costing you.” Rothman said the new approach brought an element of unpredictability, where the three-piece could mix up how they tackled each song, sometimes working alone, sometimes as pairs, sometimes all three of them contributing at the same time. It has resulted in London Grammar’s most expansive record yet. Let Rothman and Major guide you through <i>The Greatest Love</i>, track by track…\n\n<b>“House”</b>\nDan Rothman: “This one has been around for quite a while as a piece of music but it took a long time to get right. There was an original demo that I’d made with Hannah and then Dot elevated it from there, and we also worked with George FitzGerald, who elevated it further, and Tim [Bran, producer] also got involved. We had a few different producers come into the fray to finish it. Hannah’s top line was so obviously hooky that it was one of those songs that stuck around. It always seemed like it would be the starting point of the record.”\n\n<b>“Fakest Bitch”</b>\nDot Major: “Hannah’s lyrics are as dark as they are on the whole album on this. It almost sounds like it’s a song that she could have written with a songwriter in LA, but it wasn’t. It sounds further away.”\nDR: “We came together in one moment in the studio and it literally was written and almost recorded as it is. A lot of people commented to me about the lyrics, they think that the lyric is unlike Hannah because it’s not so esoteric.”\n\n<b>“You and I”</b>\nDM: “We went around a million different versions of it. In the end, we recorded that with a live rhythm section where a friend of ours, Seth Tackaberry, played bass live and I’m playing drums live, and then we underpinned the whole structure of it from that.”\nDR: “The feeling we were trying to tap into ended up being this kind of Michael Jackson, ‘Heal the World’ thing, which we probably have fucked up. Dot used lots of FM synthesis, those kind of sparkly ’80s sounds—which ironically is actually quite of the moment now. The turning point was when we were in rehearsals to go on tour with Coldplay and I had become obsessed with the idea of the rhythm section being a live rhythm section. We set up our rehearsal room as a recording studio environment and recorded Dot and Seth playing this rhythm section together. It had more like a Steely Dan thing going on and then everything could be tightened up and made drier, it suddenly sounded more like those records we were referencing.”\n\n<b>“LA”</b>\nDR: “It’s been quite a fragmented process because the album was recorded in all sorts of different studios. We came to Studio 13 to finish this particular track and did a couple of songs. That was a turning point and from there we found our studio, which is in Studio 13. It became a very symbolic moment of finishing this record because when we finished ‘LA,’ we found the new home for ourselves here and that’s where we finished the record.”\n\n<b>“Ordinary Life”</b>\nDR: “Again, this was originally a demo that I made with Hannah a long, long time ago. I heard ‘Mood’ by 24kGoldn and then I went to the studio and wrote this riff and piano part, Hannah added a top line and then Dot took it, reproduced it, elevated it. It’s very much a Dot production in its entirety this track.”\nDM: “It was the first one that felt finished. We could have put that out two years ago.”\n\n<b>“Santa Fe”</b>\nDR: “The lyric and melody was from a dream Hannah had. Me and Dot did one day with a songwriter called Pablo Bowman. He heard the demo of ‘Santa Fe’ and was like, ‘Oh, I really like it,’ and he helped us restructure it and added another hook. He’s since had an enormous hit record—he co-wrote ‘Miracle’ by Ellie Goulding and Calvin Harris. But at the time, he hadn’t written that song. They always seem to write hits with other people!”\n\n<b>“Kind of Man”</b>\nDR: “I feel really content with how this is and where it landed. I wrote the original loop, the original idea, maybe six years ago or something. It lived on a computer and whilst we were on tour with Coldplay, Hannah heard it and she was like, ‘I really like this guitar loop.’ Seth then wrote this bass part to it which informed another melodic part and inferred this rhythmic thing which Dot developed on. We also got a guy called Jon Hoskins involved, who, again, since working with us has had the biggest hit in the world. I’m not joking, he wrote and produced the Post Malone track ‘I Had Some Help’—and ‘Kind of Man’ was released on the same day!”\n\n<b>“Rescue”</b>\nDM: “George FitzGerald literally did rescue this one. I really struggled to figure out how it should sound. When I first had a go at it, I kind of made it like Kelis’ ‘Millionaire,’ that’s just how I heard it. I kept speaking to Hannah about it and she thought it should sound like ‘Paradise’ by Coldplay—there was a miscommunication! I was like, ‘I just can’t see that.’ We gave it to George and we were like, ‘Can you try and figure it out?’ He made the piano melody the main thing at the start of the track and it completely changed the feeling of it, and it was like, ‘This is it!’ George was hugely instrumental on the production of this track. He had the most prominent role of any of us.”\n\n<b>“Into Gold”</b>\nDR: “We were desperate for one more song and I was flicking through my laptop, playing shit demo after shit demo and Dot was like, ‘What’s that one? I like that one.’” \nDM: “Dan couldn’t even find the original stems to it, so I’ve actually AI-ed the vocal out from the original record. Hannah’s voice is from six years ago or whatever. I love Hannah’s lyrics on this and it was just worth exploring. Me and Dan did a day together where we recorded at my home studio, we had a great day in there, and this was done start to finish.”\n\n<b>“The Greatest Love”</b>\nDR: “This is very much Hannah’s song, it was really born completely out of her. She almost dreamt this song. Sometimes Hannah does that. She’ll literally write a song almost entirely in her head and then me and Dot have to try and somehow create the palette that she’s imagining.”\nDM: “You can hear the influence on this where Hannah listens to a lot of classic songs, even a kind of Disney-like element, like ‘Colors of the Wind’ from <i>Pocahontas</i>, things like that.”\nDR: “It seemed like an obvious album closer because it’s just so epic. The lyrical direction all stems from Hannah and she just had in her mind that <i>The Greatest Love</i> was the name of the album and it seemed like an obvious choice to close the record with this song.”","short":"“We had a new freedom”: The trio unveil their most expansive album

They can make a stumbling noise riff sound like a broken music box (“Hide & Seek”) and a man ranting about giving birth to a perfectly trained dog feel like a secret wish (“Swan the Dog”)—strange, private moods rendered in noisy, explosive music. Like “Louie, Louie,” The Stooges, and Nirvana (whose Kurt Cobain was a vocal and devoted fan), they are both caveman-simple and savant-smart, or at least in touch with a force beyond our earthly realm.

Method Actor","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Nilüfer Yanya","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The idea of method acting is that you “become” the character you’re playing and the lines between self and acting dissolve. On Nilüfer Yanya’s third album, she’s been considering how that relates to her own work. “There’s a parallel between not acting anymore and my relationship with music and writing and performing,” the London singer-songwriter says. “I don’t really feel like I do a performance, so I don’t really feel like I’m trying to be someone else. That’s why I find performing quite challenging sometimes because I just have to be myself on stage; there’s no costume or masks that I put on.”\n\nMaybe that’s why on <i>My Method Actor</i> things are getting a bit existential. The excitement of her debut—2019’s <i>Miss Universe</i>—and the desire to push against it by doing something totally different with 2022 follow-up <i>PAINLESS</i> had left her in a jarring place when she and her collaborator, producer Wilma Archer, got into the studio. Writing music was not glamorous, it was simply her job and her life. “It’s a weird one making a third album, because it’s like: ‘What is pushing me to do this?’” she says. “Where is that desire coming from? Where am I going with this? Where am I going to be on the other side of this?” \n\nBut this is an album that revels in ruminating on these heavy questions, and we hear an artist—and a person—growing as a result. Teeming with beautiful, accomplished melodies, the album waxes and wanes between scuzzier sounds of frustration and something far more polished and freeing. “It’s a journey, but you don’t really know where it’s going,” she says. “But it’s about not worrying too much about the outcome; it’s learning to trust myself, to really listen to myself.” \n\nAcross <i>My Method Actor</i>, Yanya dredges through all the feelings and upheavals, realizing that there might not be a linear, clear-cut happy ending. “Maybe it’s about letting go. Maybe there’ll never be a point where I feel totally comfortable on stage—or even being a person,” she says, laughing. “These transformations and realizations will happen so often you can’t let it upturn your whole world every time. You have to take it as it comes.” Read on as she guides us through that journey, track by track.\n\n<b>“Keep on Dancing”</b>\n“It feels like an introduction. It nearly didn’t make it to the album—it was going really well but it kind of hit a wall towards the end where it wasn’t leveling up the way some of the other songs were, so we restructured it. It starts by asking lots of questions, it sets up the tone of the record. There’s a bit of anger, a bit of resentment. It doesn’t feel like it’s trying too hard to be clever, it’s more like a natural flow of ideas. It’s an energy.”\n\n<b>“Like I Say (I runaway)”</b>\n“I had a really fun time writing over the initial idea that Will [Archer] had sent me, making all the bits fall in the right place, picking up on the instinctive harmonies and the rhythm of it. The chorus took us both by surprise—it took a while, it felt like it was gonna be really instant but it kept falling on its face. It’s quite a simple structure but the phrasing of it makes it interesting.”\n\n<b>“Method Actor”</b>\n“I felt like I was definitely constructing a character in my head, imagining I was in someone else’s life. It was like you’re a flower on the wall, but you’re the narrator at the same time. Feelings of anxiety, social anxiety…it also feels a bit violent to me. There’s a lot of violent imagery and it sounds a bit aggressive. It’s kind of like a dance in the first verse and then the chorus hits you, the guitar wakes you up. It’s quite visceral. There’s always a kind of release that comes with writing something a bit more aggressive. I try not to be an aggressive person, so maybe this is a nice way of letting it out. It feels a bit cathartic.”\n\n<b>“Binding”</b>\n“It started with the guitar loop which you hear first. ‘Binding’ was actually the demo name for this, but it really stuck with us because it sounds like a constant loop, constant binding, something twisting and turning. It was really instantly very pretty, and it was enjoyable trying to come up with melodies. It feels like you’re needing something more, wanting something more—something strong to numb the pain, or something stronger to feel. Like you’re numbing yourself on this weird journey. I always imagine it like you’re in a car, and the road’s going on and on and on—and it’s not necessarily an enjoyable journey.”\n\n<b>“Mutations”</b>\n“This one, I always imagine a siren—there’s kind of a warning going out. You’re being told to take cover or escape. There’s an urgency in the music and the message. Before the sunset, before the end of the day, before the lights, you need to find a way to disappear or to hide. It’s dark, but in the song you’re either receiving or sending the message—so you’re trying to help somebody, or they’re trying to help you. So there’s something nice about that. But there’s something sinister about the reality the song is set in—it’s very rhythmic, there’s not very many breaks, it’s tight and enclosed.” \n\n<b>“Ready for Sun (touch)”</b>\n“The song itself is quite cinematic—it’s sonically quite different to what’s come before, it’s a bit more modern, less grungy. It’s about being ready to step outside again, ready to be less concealed, more exposed. You wanna feel sun on your skin when you’ve been in the shade too long. I say ‘exposed,’ but also it’s about feeling safe enough to come out into the open. It’s wanting to feel touch again, wanting to feel things again. It’s raw feeling, raw emotion.”\n\n<b>“Call It Love”</b>\n“I was thinking about a phoenix bursting into flames. Metamorphosis. There’s a lot of talk about flames and fire in this album, but this one definitely fits with the journey themes of the record too. There’s a deep knowing that it’s OK to trust yourself and what you know to be true. It’s being your own guide. You have a sense of self and, even if it’s blurry, you have a center. The overlap of desire and shame, too—how we sometimes feel ashamed of acting on our desires. So the phoenix comes to mind because it’s about allowing your calling to guide you somewhere, to let that consume you and destroy you so you are born out from the ashes. It’s a bit dramatic. But sonically, it’s a lot more chilled out, there’s a groove to the way the guitars intertwine.”\n\n<b>“Faith’s Late”</b>\n“I feel like a lot of the questions I ask are quite intense, so I almost want to avoid it. This one is talking about identity. Even the word ‘faith’ feels quite loaded. It’s about belonging, or not belonging, to somewhere—never feeling like you belong somewhere. Always feeling like you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s also about being disappointed in the state of the world, and sort of wanting to give up. But the string arrangement at the end is particularly beautiful, I think. In contrast to the themes, you’re trying to make something beautiful out of something you’d prefer to avoid. And so there’s still life, there’s still beauty, even continuing out of the mess.”\n\n<b>“Made Out of Memory”</b>\n“This has a lighter touch. It has an ’80s pop kind of feel production-wise, but the core lyric is based off someone saying how humans are just made up of memories of other people. So when you’re trying to leave somebody behind or breaking up with somebody, if you’re not seeing someone anymore—even a friend or a family member—it’s kind of hacking off a piece of yourself each time. How do you break up with somebody without breaking up with yourself? There’s an art to that.”\n\n<b>“Just a Western”</b>\n“I remember Will sent me the guitar ages ago and I really liked it, but nothing was automatically clicking. But I liked the unusual chord pattern. I was thinking of the old Western movies that would come on daytime TV when I was younger. They’d be black-and-white films, cowboys riding off into the sunset. This song has that imagery in it for me; the sunset, something ending. One of the lyrics that jumps out for me is ‘I won’t call in a favour/Won’t do it for free anymore.’ It’s saying you’re not going to do somebody else’s dirty work for them, you’re stating your own new boundaries.”\n\n<b>“Wingspan”</b>\n“We were originally trying to make a full song, and it wasn’t really working in a long-form way. Realizing that the song was maybe a condensed version makes it more impactful. I don’t really write short songs like this. A lot of the lyrics are based on this poetry attempt from a couple years ago—so it was like a puzzle coming together, finally having a place for these words to go. It’s about realizing that you’ve ended up somewhere but it’s a port for another place to take off—are arrivals and departures the same thing?”","short":"“It’s a journey—learning to really listen to

Forest Is The Path","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Snow Patrol","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody says the band’s new record was a process of two extremes. The first was the group’s initial attempt at making an eighth album, an undertaking that hit a dead end and left the indie-rock trio from Northern Ireland wondering where to go next. “It was genuinely nobody’s fault,” Lightbody tells Apple Music. “It was a constellation of things but it was a chaotic mess and we were very stressed. We were also on a deadline—technically, the record should’ve come out a year earlier. We now know never to work to a deadline again, because that’s no way to make art.” \n\nLightbody and bandmates Nathan Connolly and Johnny McDaid regrouped and gave it another go. In Stormzy and Adele producer Fraser T. Smith, they found a collaborator who made the creation of <i>The Forest Is the Path</i> feel like a comparative walk in the park. “The second time we made it was so calm and it all filtered down from the way Fraser not just works in the studio, but lives his life—calm and chill, sweet and funny,” Lightbody says. “There was so much laughter and silliness. It took five months the first time and five weeks the second time.”\n\nYou can almost hear the relief lighting up <i>The Forest Is the Path</i>, a record of space and breadth, where the band’s long-established melodic knack has room to recline over expansive, atmospheric instrumentation. All the Snow Patrol hallmarks are present and correct—stirring pop-rock sing-alongs, poignant balladry, and uplifting contemplatives delivered by a band that sounds like it has a new lease of life. “I firmly believe this is the start of something,” states Lightbody. “We’re 30 years into a career. We’ve never been here before, we’re in uncharted territory no matter what we do.” Read on as Lightbody guides us through Snow Patrol’s new dawn, track by track.\n\n<b>“All”</b>\n“Fraser and I went in together for the first time to write in October, November 2022 and we’d never met. He was the first outside person I’d written a song with for Snow Patrol. It’s a kind of blind date. You arrive in a room, and the intention is to write a song in a day. I walked in and Fraser had the guitar around him and was like, ‘Hi, nice to meet you. What do you think of this?’ I hadn’t taken off my coat yet and we were already in it. I was like, ‘Oh, that sounds great!’ I started singing something, took my coat off and started writing words down and we had the song in an hour.”\n\n<b>“The Beginning”</b>\n“When Johnny and I got together in earnest to write the record, it was ‘The Beginning’ that we started with. I had been writing a lot of lyrics over the last three or four months, in notepads and notes on my phone. I had that line ‘I wanna be in love/Without being loved in return.’ It just sprung up from there. Johnny came up with the piano part and I started singing the melody over that and working on the lyrics. He worked more on the music, him and his team. Will Reynolds is credited on this song and one or two others on the record, he’s one of Johnny’s guys and he came up with that incredible wonky, woozy guitar part in the chorus.”\n\n<b>“Everything’s Here and Nothing’s Lost”</b>\n“‘The Beginning’ was done on the first day we were writing in Somerset and this was done the second day. Johnny and I were just sparking off each other. I came up with a little melody and it happened pretty quickly. I wandered around the garden, writing the lyrics, and it was beautiful sunny day. When I came back in, Johnny had that really massive chorus. It was even bigger originally but it was so big that people’s ears would’ve been blown off because they’d be turning up the quiet bit of the song and then we would pulverize them with a loud bit.”\n\n<b>“Your Heart Home”</b>\n“This was recorded by me at home on GarageBand, and then I sent it to Fraser and Scott, who engineered the record, and they brought it into glorious Technicolor. I’m half-decent at GarageBand, but I’m not a producer. My production is more about the ideas of what the song needs than the actual technical ability of manifesting that. When we all got together in the studio on this one, it really started to shift and move and grow. It was not what I was expecting it to be and I love that.”\n\n<b>“This Is the Sound of Your Voice”</b>\n“It’s a slightly strange melody for us. The first time I played this to someone I really trust and love and work with quite a lot, he went, ‘It’s just like a West End musical melody.’ I hadn’t even thought of that. Johnny put in so much intricate detail into this song. There were 200 strands of audio on it. Johnny does it so beautifully where everything is played, everything is real, everything is an authentic sound—he does an awful lot of found sounds. I think that’s why it doesn’t overload everything and everything finds its place in the song and some things come in and out. Johnny did a beautiful job, as did Nathan. The guitars are so beautiful and incredible all the way through.”\n\n<b>“Hold Me in the Fire”</b>\n“Johnny and I wrote it in his house. Right from day one, it sounded like a rock song that was going to expand outwards and we’d just have to get out of its way and let the balloon inflate. But when we got in to record it the first time, it didn’t do that. It felt like we were adding and nothing was happening. It’s a hard puzzle to fix because you’ve got to keep taking it apart and putting it back together again, and sometimes it just doesn’t ever fit together right. This is the thing about going in with Fraser: Everything we put on [with him], it felt like it was expanding, it felt like it was inflating in a very good way. Everything was floating up into the sky and it started to make a lot of sense. Fraser helped an awful lot. And Nathan’s guitars on it are just absolutely scorching.”\n\n<b>“Years That Fall”</b>\n“This was me in the house in Bangor. I wrote it on GarageBand and it actually was an unusual little thing to begin with, not the rock song that it turned into. There was a lot of that version we drew from, but in the studio, this absolute monster appeared. This small, rock, chuggy, indie-ish thing just went off somewhere else. It was really exciting.”\n\n<b>“Never Really Tire”</b>\n“Jesus Christ, the work that Johnny McDaid put into this—again, another 200-plus pieces of the song. And the way things come in and out, you can just play any section of the song and there’ll be something different happening. Right from the start, I had this vision of an eagle flying over a forest canopy. It can see the tree line rise and fall and undulate like waves in the deep ocean and that’s what I wanted this drum part to be. I was explaining it to Ash [Soan, drummer], thinking, ‘He’s going to think I’m fucking insane,’ and he went, ‘Yep, got it.’ We were like, ‘We’ll play this whole thing live as a spontaneous thing, see what happens.’ It was one of the most extraordinary experiences I’ve had in the studio. That vision that I’d had for this song just came to life.”\n\n<b>“These Lies”</b>\n“I’d been numb for the year since my dad died. This was late 2020. I didn’t cry or I couldn’t feel anything. I thought I was broken. I thought that was it, forever. It was a couple of days before the anniversary, and I read a Rumi poem and burst into tears. The tears came like a torrent. A year’s worth of tears were just pouring onto the floor. And then, the next day I was exhausted. I went to sleep. The next day, I woke up and I was like, ‘I feel connected to something.’ I felt like, ‘I need a pen and a piece of paper right now,’ and I wrote a song about my dad. And then a song that followed about 10 minutes after that was ‘These Lies,’ which obviously wasn’t about him, and that came out in a flow state as well. It was just like all these things were trapped in there behind the tears that wouldn’t release.”\n\n<b>“What If Nothing Breaks?”</b>\n“This is all Johnny’s production. It went through many different forms. It started as a Motown song with a Motown beat, and it had a different chorus. It wasn’t quite working, something felt wrong about it. Johnny was playing around the chords of it and I was singing it in a different way and it felt like, ‘Oh, this is the place for this song, feels like it needs to be here.’ Then I came in one day and he was like, ‘What about these for the chords for the chorus?’ and I started singing the chorus as it became, and the song just came to life.”\n\n<b>“Talking About Hope”</b>\n“I’m proud of the lyrics on this record. I’ve allowed myself to be open to whatever happens rather than trying to force my way to the words, which sometimes has to happen if you’re staring at a blank page for months on end. This time around, there was no writer’s block. This song came from a true place, especially the verses. I love the lyrics and the verses. I don’t really say that about my own lyrics very often.”\n\n<b>“The Forest Is the Path”</b>\n“Michael Keeney deserves a big mention on this record. He produced Foy Vance’s <i>Joy of Nothing</i>, which for me is the greatest album by a Northern Irish artist, and produced many other things besides. He wrote and produced some of the strings on this record. We were in his studio and Nathan was playing that lead line. I recorded it on my phone and took it home and built the song around it on GarageBand. I sent that to Fraser and the thing that goes the whole way through the song, Nathan’s guitar, that’s the recording on my phone. I find that a quite nice way to finish a record—the spontaneity captured in one moment without having to go, ‘OK, well let’s go and set up the microphones.’ It was just like, ‘Oh, I love that, can I use that?’”","short":"“We’re in uncharted territory”: A new dawn breaks for Gary Lightbody’s

<i>Daisy Jones & The Six</i>, Suki Waterhouse regularly rehearsed with her co-stars in the same Los Angeles studio where Fleetwood Mac worked on <i>Rumours</i>. The English multi-hyphenate (a distinction she winks at knowingly on “Model, Actress, Whatever”) had been quietly releasing hazy indie pop since 2016, but the role gave Waterhouse the spark to throw herself into music head-on. On her second studio album, named for a species of spider that’s cute but twisted when it comes to mating, the singer-songwriter connects the dots between mid-century girl groups, Laurel Canyon psychedelia, mid-’90s Mazzy Star (particularly on “To Get You,” a cosmic country wallower co-written by Cigarettes After Sex’s Greg Gonzalez), and Lana Del Rey circa <i>Chemtrails Over the Country Club</i>. Between messy, honest songs like “Supersad” and “Blackout Drunk” emerges a nostalgic portrait of the last of the old-fashioned It girls, cool but not too cool to get her hands a little dirty.","short":"A nostalgic portrait of the last of the old-fashioned It

Points","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Sam Shepherd’s not-quite-techno is the 21st-century equivalent of good progressive rock or jazz fusion: sophisticated, intelligent music whose outward sense of exploration mirrors an almost psychedelic journey within. Inspired by his teenage epiphanies with techno in Manchester in the late ’90s and early 2000s, <i>Cascade</i> is easily his most immediate album: “club bangers” (“Key103”), acid bass (“Afflecks Palace”), even a little Giorgio Moroder-style Eurodisco for good historical measure (“Birth4000”). The beats are nakedly 4/4 and the surrounding ambience the kind of moody, infinitely cascading synth tapestries you might find on a psytrance mix, rendered with a grace that makes them feel paradoxically subtle. Having done complicated, Shepherd makes it simple.","short":"A techno sophisticate captures the adolescent rush that got him

From Texas","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Miranda Lambert","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Miranda Lambert may have hit it big in Nashville, but Texas will always be the country icon’s greatest muse. Like she did on the collaborative 2021 project <i>The Marfa Tapes</i> (joined by fellow Texans Jon Randall and Jack Ingram), Lambert shares sketches and vignettes of the Lone Star State, filtered through her equally introspective and humorous perspective. <i>Postcards From Texas</i> is Lambert’s ninth studio album, and the first solo LP she recorded in her home state of Texas since she was a teenager. Accordingly, the record feels homey and lived-in, like on the reflective and playful “Looking Back on Luckenbach” and the laidback love song “January Heart.” “Bitch on the Sauce (Just Drunk)” is more than just a cheeky title, teasing out the complications of a situationship. And opening track “Armadillo” is a barn-burning knee-slapper, with the unforgettable image of an armadillo with a “doobie.”\n\nLambert tells Apple Music that <i>Postcards From Texas</i> is a product of recent life changes as well as her career as a whole. “With turning 40 and [signing to] a new record label, I felt new freedom,” she says. “And with that freedom, all I wanted to do was go home to reset so I could get strong to take on a whole new journey. And so I think this record is a snapshot of more like two decades versus the last two years. There's emotions that I've felt for the last two decades as a woman [and] as an artist in this album. The only thing I haven't done is pick up a high armadillo in my car yet, but I want to.”Below, Lambert shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Armadillo”</b>\n“Aaron Raitiere sent me that, the first song he sent me, and I was in Austria, actually, going down the road, because I played a show in Switzerland and [my husband] Brendan and I went to Austria. And we were driving through the mountains in Austria and I'm putting on my earbuds, and I just turned on Aaron's like, ‘Here's one.’ And it said, ‘I met an armadillo out in Amarillo and he asked me for a ride.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, yes, 100 percent yes, I'm cutting this.’ And I didn't even hear anymore. I handed Brendan an earbud and he was like, ‘Yes, 100 percent.’ I was like, ‘This should be the first song on the record.’ Just because it's fun and funny… If you're going to have an album full of songs and there's going to be so much emotion, you've got to make sure you have the fun.”\n\n<b>“Dammit Randy”</b>\n“I've definitely dragged it out too long in certain situations in my life. And I don't know if that's also, as you go through things in your life and as you get a little bit older, you're like, ‘Oh, well, now I've seen what happens if you let it fester.’ So you just learn to cut it off.”\n\n<b>“Run”</b>\n“I think the reason that I love horses and I love Airstreams and I love the [tour] bus is because it is a way to run to something, not necessarily away from something. I think that's why I've always been obsessed with trailers. I don't know if it's growing up on a tour bus or whatever, but I just feel like I can chase my dream but also have a piece of home.”\n\n<b>“Alimony”</b>\n“Shane [McAnally] walked into the barn, because we did one last push for writing for the record, and I'm like, ‘I'm making a record in Texas. I need to shuffle. Dang it, I need a shuffle. I have to.’ He was like, ‘Well, I got a title.’ And I was like, ‘What?’ And he was like, ‘If you're going to leave me in San Antonio, remember the alimony.’ And I was like, ‘I could literally punch you in the face right now.’ Dang it, why didn't I think of that? We got to use all of our little Texas puns, and it was fun.”\n\n<b>“I Hate Love Songs”</b>\n“It gives me chills, that song. It does. I wrote that in Marfa with [Jon Randall] and Jack [Ingram], and it's older. It's about six or seven years old, I think. That is sitting in the pain.”\n\n<b>“No Man’s Land”</b>\n“I don't think I could have written a song like this till now, because this is one of the newest on the album. Luke Dick had the idea, and I just love him because he gets girls. He's just such a man, but he's such a sensitive guy. He understands the wiring. He's a girl dad, too, so I think that probably helped. We never talked about that, and I want to talk to him about it and celebrate because I love this song so much, but it had to be done and it didn't need to be a ‘I'm in no man's land with your finger in the air.’ That's not what this is. I want to be in your space. I want you to be in my space... I want you to know that I want you here, but I need to be me. And that's the song. I think we really made sure to get that point across that it's not a warning.”","short":"The Texas star hits a milestone and heads home: “I felt new

TINES & The Truth","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"America’s Congress for Cultural Freedom spent mountains of US federal cash to ensure that American culture remained free from communism. The organization, launched in 1950 under the wing of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), fed a climate of anti-Soviet paranoia that did lasting harm to countless left-leaning creative artists, performers, and intellectuals. \n\nPaul Robeson was among those caught in the crosshairs of the Cold War culture wars. The undying power of his achievements as singer, scholar, stage and film actor, and campaigner for Black and minority rights surge through <i>ROBESOИ</i>, an all-encompassing artwork from bass-baritone Davóne Tines and his aptly titled band The Truth. \n\n<i>ROBESOИ</i> confronts the dark heart of America’s contemporary politics. It opens with a harrowing recollection of Robeson’s suicide attempt, undertaken in a Moscow hotel room in 1961. Davóne Tines is convinced that Robeson experienced a breakdown after being poisoned with the psychedelic drug LSD, among the CIA’s preferred substances for upending the minds of perceived enemies. \n\nAlthough Robeson survived, his mental and physical health were severely compromised by his encounter with psychosis. <i>ROBESOИ</i> weaves strands of the singer’s biography together with memories of what Tines calls his own “lowest personal low,” reverberant echoes of African American defiance against oppression and endemic prejudice, and thunderous condemnation of those determined to stand in the way of racial and socio-economic equality.\n\n“Ever since I was a young bass-baritone, people would say, ‘You sound like Paul Robeson,’ and ask if I sang ‘Old Man River,’” Davóne Tines tells Apple Music Classical. “I didn’t know what ‘Old Man River’ was then. I’d heard of Paul Robeson but didn’t know much about who he really was. I knew he was a great singer, that he was in <i>Showboat</i> and there was activism involved, just the most basic idea.” \n\nHis first studio album evolved from a discussion about the singer with his close friend, the opera and theatre director Zack Winokur. The story of Robeson’s role in the long, painful journey of African Americans out of slavery and segregation resonated with Tines, himself a dedicated smasher of stereotypes, an opera singer at home in a multitude of other genres, gospel, R&B, jazz, and art song among them.\n\nTines’ knowledge of Robeson deepened with help from Winokur and the playwright and producer Ed Wasserman, who jointly shaped the album’s theatrical structure; percussionist and dramaturg Ian Askew, meanwhile, proved invaluable in developing its musical content. <i>ROBESOИ</i> takes the imaginary form of the poisoned singer’s fever dream, populated by ghosts of America’s past and present and filled with the songs he brought to the masses. \n\nThere’s room in the tracklist for “Some Enchanted Evening” from <i>South Pacific</i>; J.S. Bach’s chorale <i>Christ lag in Todesbanden</i>, which Robeson sang in recital at New York’s Carnegie Hall; “Lift Every Voice,” America’s Black national anthem; and an impassioned version of the spiritual “Scandalize My Name,” propelled by a fizzing tambourine rhythm taken from Julius Eastman’s <i>Stay On It</i>. The album also includes “Fly Away,” a wild one-take improvisation for voice, piano, and percussion, built around “Le gibet” from Ravel’s <i>Gaspard de la nuit</i>, and closes with “Old Man River” as it’s never sounded before.\n\n“Making this album gave a chance for me to do what I really wanted to do on my own terms,” Davóne Tines recalls. “It became a space where I could plumb my imagination and find things I’ve been wanting to say, but haven’t had spaces to say them, and pull on parts of myself that I know personally have always been there, but which I’d never had the opportunity to show all together. And then it was about realizing the breadth of worlds and aesthetics and histories that are all woven up. So it was deeply exhilarating and liberating to have the space to be every single inch of myself in one project, which leads to some crazy things!”","short":"Davóne Tines on his “exhilarating and

understated postscript to Angie McMahon’s soaring second album. They also showcase how her work shines in different ways during collaborations with assorted players and producers in America and Australia. The opening “Beginner” is a co-write and duet with Cairns songwriter Emma Louise that’s delivered with whispery closeness, while the quietly dramatic “Just Like North” grew from a group writing session led by US multi-hyphenate Courtney Marie Andrews. \n\nMcMahon doesn’t try to replicate the climactic highs of her earlier release, and yet there’s some shared DNA on display. The centerpiece “Untangling” hints most closely at the album’s empowering combination of heartland synths and overlapping vocal mantras. “Interstate” celebrates the arrival of epiphanies during long highway drives early into a relationship, and “Take Up Space” adds fleeting cloudbursts of atmosphere to an otherwise sparse piano ballad as McMahon asserts her desire (and right) to do just what the title says. Similar to how 2020’s <i>Piano Salt</i> EP added fresh context to her 2019 debut <i>Salt</i>, this companion piece adds another profound passage to an ongoing conversation.","short":"A quietly

Corleone","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When Chencho Corleone formed Plan B with Maldy back in 1999, reggaetón was still a relatively emerging genre. The Puerto Rican duo experienced the music’s explosive growth firsthand up until their 2018 breakup. Yet while many perreo pioneers faded into the background as new entrants rose, Chencho enjoyed a 2020s resurgence. His high-profile collaborations with Bad Bunny and Ozuna, to name but a few, transported him from a respectable legacy artist’s fate to a place in Latin music’s modern vanguard. \n\nA debut album some 25 years in the making, <i>SOLO</i> at last puts the veteran reggaetonero center stage for a victory lap that feels fresh. Though his guest list includes hitmakers Rauw Alejandro and Peso Pluma, the 18-song effort is considerably lighter on features than one might have expected. Instead, he showcases his talents largely on his own over a tight mix of styles, including the dancehall-infused “Tremenda Ansiedad” and the clubby coda “Himalaya.” Naturally, his preferred mode favors the dembow-driven rhythms that defined his career, reflected on the sleek “Maldad,” the throwback “Hora De Salir,” and the poppy Jay Wheeler team-up “Cinco Estrellas.”","short":"A grand reggaetón debut, 25 years in the making."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bf/81/de/bf81de98-e325-3ae0-5eb5-6725276e5dce/196872360400.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d1ce","textColor2":"f9e5bf","textColor4":"cecab3","textColor1":"ffeee0","bgColor":"246287","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/solo/1762920638","playParams":{"id":"1762920638","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6bZ3w99gJilo45OwKsMBd0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762920638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1055034875","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1055034875?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1726237021583}}},"1763128423":{"id":"1763128423","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763128423?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/terrace-martin/27522754","name":"Nintindo Soul","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Terrace Martin","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/4b/8b/844b8bff-24d5-ad3d-fb3f-329f531200c9/723277740362.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"8ea996","textColor2":"d2b9b1","textColor4":"b09b94","textColor1":"a7cab3","bgColor":"282222","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nintindo-soul/1763128423","playParams":{"id":"1763128423","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1HaSycwssAOYNRmcdr1MXR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763128423/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"27522754","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/27522754?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1726229459080}}},"1763236956":{"id":"1763236956","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1763236956?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/young-rising-sons/602846599","name":"Suckers -

He’s been a star in his hometown for over a decade, but his 2022 debut album, <i>Face</i>, catapulted him to a new level of stardom. This doesn’t mean the stoic rapper has switched his style up since then: He’s a realist, not an entertainer, and his sweet spot counters opulence and drama with cold, hard facts. It’s the subtle details about what success really looks like that brings his fourth studio album, <i>The Kid That Did</i>, to life.\n\n“The more money that you got, the more you lose your peace,” he rasps on “Groupies & Goofies” between bars about firing the babysitters because his chain went missing and finding fans rifling through his trash. On “Shy Kid,” the former introvert lives large, balling out in London and paying the smoking fee upfront for the hotel’s swankiest corner suite. Ray’s international now, but it’s still Detroit versus everybody on highlights like Peezy collab “Ghetto Boyz” and “Wavy Navy University,” where he recruits Veeze for a clinic in understated opulence.","short":"The Detroit vet counters opulence with cold, hard facts."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6c/31/8a/6c318a47-6bea-9275-b501-c0e9763a3065/197342617628_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b2af9e","textColor2":"d0cbbc","textColor4":"aaa79d","textColor1":"dbd5bd","bgColor":"101a21","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-kid-that-did/1764180325","playParams":{"id":"1764180325","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/584NttnQ3jTv0yoCArM0yx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764180325/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"689177365","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/689177365?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1726216845350}}},"1764373158":{"id":"1764373158","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764373158?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-13","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2b/6e/c7/2b6ec772-d6e6-f19c-4922-5d8c11c2cccc/c11879da-326a-4ea9-a44d-48743a79426f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1aca9","textColor2":"d8a17c","textColor4":"b18567","textColor1":"d8d2cf","bgColor":"131411","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/raye/261686","name":"Live at Montreux Jazz Festival","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"RAYE","editorialNotes":{"short":"The vocal powerhouse hits a legendary stage for a live pop-R&B masterclass."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/80/8b/9c/808b9c11-a939-169a-c5ca-ee0d50638e02/198846062716.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ebbbb1","textColor2":"fae1e2","textColor4":"eab6ba","textColor1":"fae7d7","bgColor":"ad0d1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-at-montreux-jazz-festival/1764373158","playParams":{"id":"1764373158","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0uqyhvc8HEyztLSTE8RKmx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764373158/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"261686","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/261686?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1726208866693}}},"1764426659":{"id":"1764426659","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764426659?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bastille/420203509","name":"“&” (Ampersand), Part Two -

But on their sixth album, MCs Young D and Yung Trybez seek to transcend trauma by imagining the better world the next generation could inherit. While <i>RED FUTURE</i> is dripping with the duo’s signature swag, it fuels a vision of Indigenous futurism that makes space for fellow creators from all nations and disciplines. \n\nOn “FREE,” Chief Rueben George of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation delivers an inspirational sermon to tee up an anti-colonialist trap anthem infused with a gospel grandeur and a soulful chorus hook from alt-folk crooner Aysanabee. And on the towering title track, SNRK team up with Aboriginal Australian dance-pop duo Electric Fields to outfit their Indigenous utopia with a ready-made national anthem of its own. But the elevated conceptual ambitions of <i>RED FUTURE</i> never come out at the expense of the duo’s eccentric personality: On “FUTURE ANCESTORS,” they masterfully weave icy 808s, dramatic string arrangements, and otherworldly harmonies from avant-rock luminary Jeremy Dutcher, while still slipping in a <i>Shoresy</i> shout-out.

His discography regularly documents a struggle between the Detroit-bred rap superstar’s two outspoken personas, an artistic battle followed closely by his most ardent and attentive fans, while pitchfork-wielding outsiders and his more casual listeners never bothered to discern the difference. The willfully profane Slim and the comparatively less sacrilegious Marshall compose a dramaturgical dyad that makes each of his album releases feel like blockbusters. That said, the stakes feel dramatically high on <i>The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce)</i>, its title the most thematically loaded of his two-and-a-half-decade career.\n\nIf this does end up the genuine final curtain call for Eminem’s most notorious alter ego, he makes it a point to execute it on his own controversy-baiting terms, whether people like it or not. Addressing his detractors head-on, “Habits” defensively dismantles criticisms both internal and external, taking personal inventory while decrying political correctness. Cancel culture and wokeness as existential threats stay front of mind throughout, looming particularly large over the combative “Antichrist” and the Dr. Dre co-produced “Lucifer.” Repeated references to Caitlyn Jenner won’t quell the perpetual transphobia accusations Eminem has long faced, but on songs like “Evil” and “Road Rage” he at least aims to clarify his positions amid his characteristically clever wordplay.\n\nNaturally, Slim isn’t about to go out quietly. Ever the eager pugilist, he exploits his upper hand with Fight Club panache on “Brand New Dance” and “Trouble.” The character’s antagonism vacillates between self-destructive outbursts and strategic gaslighting, gleefully poking at touchy topics on “Houdini” and assigning we’re-in-this-together complicity to Marshall on the surprise sequel “Guilty Conscience 2.” Yet even as the tragicomically intertwined foes grapple with one another, the album still makes room for something as personal as “Temporary,” a heartfelt message to his daughter for after he’s gone. With the added benefit of a few unexpected cameos, including Michigan-repping cut “Tobey” with Big Sean and BabyTron, the over-the-top theatricality driving <i>The Death of…</i> feels like fan service, giving his longtime patrons the Eminem show they’ve come to expect from him.\n","short":"Marshall Mathers grapples with his infamous alter ego one more
