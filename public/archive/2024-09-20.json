Album","standard":"Jamie Smith’s 2015 debut solo album <i>In Colour</i> set the tone for an entire decade of left-of-center electronic music, but his long-awaited follow-up harbors zero pretension when it comes to trend-watching. Nine years later, <i>In Waves</i> sets its sights on the dance floor with glorious aplomb, the perfect complement to a string of body-moving singles that the iconic British producer has released in the preceding year and a half. “The collaboration element was helping me push things forward without having to think too much about myself on my own,” Smith tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.\n\nFrom there, the rest of <i>In Waves</i> came together in quick succession—and, suitably, the record’s rowdy and in-a-crowd feel was largely inspired by the solitude of the lockdown era, as well as dreams of how it would feel to play big tunes for huge audiences again. “I was starting to get excited about the idea of playing shows again,” Smith says.\n\nThe guest list for this party is overflowing: Along with a practical reunion of his main outfit The xx on the dreamy “Waited All Night,” house music auteur and recent Beyoncé collaborator Honey Dijon lends her distinctive incantations to the squelch of “Baddy on the Floor,” while experimental-leaning vocalists Kelsey Lu and Panda Bear throw in on the soul-streaked and woozy “Dafodil.” But at the center of <i>In Waves</i> is a truly assured sense of confidence from Smith, who’s returned here with a set of club-ready cuts that’s truly crowd-pleasing—all without losing the distinctive touch that’s brought him so much deserved

Album and Interview","standard":"Expansive, cinematic, adventurous: These are the intentions saxophonist and composer Nubya Garcia decided to channel when it came to creating <i>Odyssey</i>. “I wanted to make a record that felt bigger, something that delivers unexpected emotions,” she tells Apple Music. Bursting onto the London jazz scene in 2017 with the release of her debut EP, <i>Nubya’s 5ive</i>, Garcia became a key proponent of a new group of young improvisers who were drawing on jazz traditions as much as their diaspora heritages in their music. Following 2020’s full-length debut <i>SOURCE</i>, Garcia now develops her Afrobeat- and dub-influenced sound further to encompass everything from the sweeping string arrangements of “Clarity” to the weighty soundsystem basslines of “Triumphance” and the ’90s R&B references of “Set It Free.”\n\nLargely written during extended trips to Brazil, away from her typically hectic touring schedule, <i>Odyssey</i> is Garcia soaking up new atmospheres to create an instinctual and intricately articulate music. “This is me growing through joy and practice,” she says. “It’s the fullest, freest vision of myself.” Read on for her in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Dawn” (feat. Esperanza Spalding)</b>\n“I wrote this track when I was in Brazil for six weeks at the end of 2022. I was staying right by the ocean and would wake up for the sunrise every day. It was such a beautiful, poignant way to start the day and this melody just came to me in that environment. I’ve always loved Esperanza’s work and she felt like the perfect addition to the song—I was so happy when she agreed to it. I only gave her the title and let her run free otherwise with these beautiful lyrics drawing on the Icarus myth.”\n\n<b>“Odyssey”</b>\n“‘Odyssey’ is the epic adventure of the record. I didn’t know the album would center on this composition but I had a feeling that it was going to be cinematic and journeying. Every section of this tune keeps building and turning in unexpected ways, from the keys to the string section producing a huge range of light to darkness. The melody wanders and feels like a beautiful marriage between my love of modal jazz and my love of classical textures. It all flowed really quickly since I had so many ideas for it, all sparking on from one another.”\n\n<b>“Solstice”</b>\n“This is one of the oldest tracks on the album. I wanted it to have a busy, erratic beat with a slower melody sauntering and winding over it. It’s about the fast and slow being in conversation. It’s called ‘Solstice’ because the first time I played it with the band was on the summer solstice in 2023. We’d all been away and not done a gig for a while but it just felt right and went down really well.”\n\n<b>“Set It Free” (feat. Richie)</b>\n“As soon as I began trying out ideas for this track, I knew I wanted it to have a chill but energetic backbeat, one you could walk down the street to. Richie’s vocals add a stunning sound and lyricism and establish the theme of the song being about promoting confidence in women who are so often raised in society to continually apologize for themselves. It also features a cheeky nine-bar loop, rather than the usual eight, which always surprises me when it comes around!”\n\n<b>“The Seer”</b>\n“‘The Seer’ is about wishing you could catch a glimpse of yourself in the future to know you’re on the right track and be confident about your choices. Sonically, it’s a nod to modal jazz with classic voicings and then shifts into my love of broken beats and energetic drums. That switch feels a bit like the ’90s R&B interludes where you hear a snippet of another section or song coming in.”\n\n<b>“Odyssey (Outerlude)”</b>\n“I wanted outerludes on the album to give the listener a reprieve and remind them of what they have just listened to before, as well as melting into a different energy for the rest of the record. This switches it from a very high-energy beginning to something much softer and quieter for the halfway point. I love it because it has an eerie vibe full of shimmering strings.”\n\n<b>“We Walk in Gold” (feat. Georgia Anne Muldrow)</b>\n“The melody for this composition feels like a lament but the intentions of the tune are joyous. It’s full of energies of hope, purpose, and direction, all informed by the color gold, which represents a light that releases darkness for me. I’ve always loved Georgia Anne Muldrow’s work and was elated when she agreed to feature on this track with me—she fully embodied the track’s uplifting intentions.”\n\n<b>“Water’s Path”</b>\n“This was the only tune on the album written in one go with no edits, which is something I haven’t done before. It’s one of my favorites because I’ve never written for strings before this album and I’m really proud of how this song embodies both happiness and sadness, as well as the qualities of water always finding its way through, which is reflected in the ostinato that just keeps ticking along. It’s super melodic and romantic.”\n\n<b>“Clarity”</b>\n“The vision for this song became clearer—no pun intended—as I wrote it and it became really enjoyable seeing it morph into the final version where the harmony is upward-reaching and always building. The intention behind the song is about the importance of clarity and transparency in relationships and how freeing that can be when we have it.”\n\n<b>“In Other Words, Living”</b>\n“Like ‘Clarity,’ this song always feels like it’s reaching upwards, pushing for peace and excitement in life. It’s a song about being intentionally present and living the balancing act between happiness and sadness that so often constitutes our existence as humans. That’s living as I know it, anyway.”\n\n<b>“Clarity (Outerlude)”</b>\n“I wanted one more reprise before we end, something to shift the listeners’ energy back to what’s been before and to show how far we’ve come over the course of the record. It’s a small offering to the journey we’ve traveled on together.”\n\n<b>“Triumphance”</b>\n“We’ve been playing this track for a few years to close the live shows and it always leaves people with such joy, since they can’t help but move when it drops. I wasn’t going to record it for the album but it ultimately felt like the only way we could end. I wanted a speech over the dub while the band cooked, something to sum up the triumphant themes of the record and to leave people feeling self-confident as they go out into the world. Except, the person I wanted to do the speech couldn’t and we were running out of time, so I ended up recording it myself, which was a first! I guess I had to find my own self-confidence here to say my piece.”","short":"The saxophonist on her second album: “It’s the fullest, freest vision of

Album and Interview","standard":"Blossoms’ long-term producer James Skelly has always encouraged the band to try working with someone else and, on their fifth album, the UK quintet finally took him up on the suggestion. With Skelly, himself no stranger to adventurous explorations as leader of The Coral, still involved in an overarching production role, <i>Gary</i> sees Blossoms triumphantly expand their gang. “This time round we were more open-minded and wanted to try to collaborate with other people,” singer/guitarist Tom Ogden tells Apple Music.\n\nThe first port of call was reaching out to soul-dance duo Jungle. “I’d realized they produced themselves and loved the way their records sounded,” says Ogden. “We booked some time on New Year’s Day 2023 to start recording and did ‘Nightclub’ and ‘What Can I Say After I’m Sorry?’ They were great but, in hindsight, we didn’t have enough songs to go and start recording the album.” The tone had been set, though, for a celebratory record with a swagger about it. After the filmic introspection of 2022’s <i>Ribbon Around the Bomb</i>, <i>Gary</i> is Blossoms back at their ebullient, anthemic best. “We always knew we wanted it to be great live and a bit of a party,” says Ogden. “That was the only blueprint.”\n\nThe recording process was characterized by a series of breakthrough moments. The first was working with Jungle. The second was the emergence of the title track, bringing the live alchemy of the band back to the fore (and almost certainly the only song you will hear this year about the theft of a fiberglass gorilla called Gary). The third essential ingredient was a songwriting collaboration with Irish country-pop star CMAT. “Working with CMAT gave me the final push to be a writer and be inspired, and that seamed the album together,” says Ogden. Let the singer and bandmates Josh Dewhurst (guitar), Joe Donovan (drums), and Charlie Salt (bass) guide you through <i>Gary</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Big Star”</b>\nTom Ogden: “I wrote this after being in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. This guy walked in [the lobby] and was having a meeting about this magazine. I Googled him while I was sat there, and it turns out he’s this big writer in America who’s got this music magazine and has done since the early ’90s. And I was like, ‘Should I go over to him and be like, “I’m in a band”?’ But then I bottled it. I like the playfulness of the lyrics. I think that was after working with CMAT, it influenced me to be like, ‘You can write something that’s really direct.’ I was literally sat there thinking it and then I just turned it into a song. Not going over to him is kind of very us and very me.”\n\n<b>“What Can I Say After I’m Sorry?”</b>\nTO: “This was the song that made me think, ‘Oh, we could work with Jungle.’ The sonic was influenced by Jungle really. I wrote it on the piano, it was a bit more R&B when I wrote it, maybe like Outkast or something. The title was from an old Nat King Cole record but what the song is about is when I’m in a bit of a rut and my emotions are bleeding into my relationship. I imagine it’s probably quite challenging to be with someone who’s in a rut. There’s not that much that the other person can do to snap you out of it. It’s me saying, ‘What can I say after I’m sorry?’, in terms of, ‘I wish I wasn’t like this sometimes.’”\n\n<b>“Gary”</b>\nTO: “I was driving home and the news came on: ‘A giant fiberglass gorilla has been stolen from a garden center in Carluke, Scotland. The hunt is on for Gary the Gorilla.’ I went home and started reading about it and then wrote the song in half an hour on the acoustic guitar. It was as if the song always existed, I just had to wait for that moment of inspiration to come over me.”\nCharlie Salt: “Tom does this really clever thing where he’ll take something quite daft and it’ll be juxtaposed with this lovely arrangement and melody underneath. It immediately [sounded] like a classic Blossoms tune and it’s got this strange emotion…and you’re always thinking about the gorilla itself.”\nJosh Dewhurst: “We bought our own Gary and he lives at the studio. Every day, when you get to work, you see him and you’re like, ‘How are you doing, Gary? You all right?’”\n\n<b>“I Like Your Look”</b>\nTO: “This was written with CMAT in Anglesey, Wales. The plan was for me and the lads to go away just for some time on our own. CMAT was going to come and write with me in Stockport but the dates didn’t work, so she was like, ‘I’ll just come to Wales with you.’ One night, we’d been trying something else and it wasn’t really working so Ciara [Mary-Alice Thompson, aka CMAT] was like, ‘Right, everyone get a book and start shouting things out from the book that you think could be song titles.’ Joe went, ‘I like your look,’ and I was like, ‘That’s good, it should be a song about fashion, it should be a bit like “Pop Muzik” by M.’ Ciara was like, ‘Yeah, you should do ’80s rapping like “Time Rag” by Joan Baez or Blondie’s “Rapture.”’ It was a really fast burst of creativity. We’d never written like that before, it was really fun and inspiring. Everyone brought something to the table. I think you can hear that on the record.”\n\n<b>“Nightclub”</b> \nTO: “This was written after reading a blog about a guy who was in love with his friend’s girlfriend. I had the title and I started reading about people trying to blag their way into nightclubs. It was inspired by my own personal experience of going to nightclubs growing up and also reading online about other people’s experiences. Working with Jungle definitely brought the best out of this song. Josh Lloyd-Watson put his thing on it. He was like, ‘Imagine you’re female backing singers in the ’60s,’ and we’d be doing all this stuff. He’d chop it up and flip the song on its head.”\n\n<b>“Perfect Me”</b>\nTO: “Again, this was written as us five in the room very, very fast. I came into the rehearsal room one morning and Josh was messing around on a Moog sequencer. He pressed a button, and it had a bit of that Who, ‘Baba O’Riley’ thing about it. Immediately, I was like, ‘I can hear these chords underneath this.’”\nCS: “It might have been the first one we recorded for the album and we were sat on it for so long. It became a little bit stale. James Skelly always stood by it and considered it a single.”\nTO: “Yeah, it had the energy but we shunned it a little bit. We came back with fresh ears six months later and we were like, ‘Hang on a minute, this is really good.’”\n\n<b>“Mothers”</b>\nTO: “I wanted to have our version of ‘Bros’ by Wolf Alice, a song about friendship. Me and Joe have been best mates since we were 12. Our mothers were actually friends in the ’80s, and I had a line about that in another song, so when I started writing this verse idea about me and Joe growing up, I was like, ‘Oh, what about the lyrics that I wrote about our mothers in the ’80s?’ I probably refined it over a month and a half and went back and tweaked this lyric, changed the verse melody, pulled the words from a different song I’d written.”\nJosh Dewhurst: “When we recorded it, we kept on the family theme. My dad’s a pianist. Oftentimes, when we’re in the studio properly recording, he’ll just come down for the craic because he’s a genius and also he’s funny as hell.” \nTO: “Josh’s dad suggested these insane chords that we would’ve never come across ourselves. It was a nice, full-circle thing, a song about me and Joe references our mothers, and then Josh’s dad played on it. It’s very wholesome.”\n\n<b>“Cinnamon”</b>\nTO: “This was written out of a jam in the room. This is the most collaborative record we’ve done in terms of writing, we were just jamming in there. It started off with me, Josh, and Chaz and I was hearing it [as] more Vampire Weekend but, when we came back and worked on it the next day, Joe made it more us, helped it become more of an anthem.” \nJoe Donovan: “I imagined it in a field at a festival, that big, euphoric vibe.”\n\n<b>“Slow Down”</b>\nTO: “‘Slow Down’ is only one of three personal songs about my relationship on this album. It usually makes up the bulk of records whereas, this time, I’ve made an effort to write about other stuff. This is saying, in a relationship, we needed to take a moment and slow down and appreciate each other a bit more. We took our eye off the ball in terms of looking after each other a little bit.”\n\n<b>“Why Do I Give You the Worst of Me?”</b>\nTO: “Often, I can put too much weight on stuff with the band being my source of happiness. I don’t think it’s necessarily a healthy way to live your life. It’s that thing where your partner always sees the worst of you, warts and all. I was speaking to Ciara about it because we were writing songs and trying to be very open. I was just explaining what was going on and I think my wife Katie had said, ‘Oh, why do I always get the worst of you?’ because it was like I’d gone away and come to life writing. At home, I’d been struggling writing, basically. She wanted that from me at home as well, and then Ciara just started writing it from things I was saying. It’s quite a personal song. It was quite intense.”","short":"Singer Tom Ogden: “We wanted it to be great live and a bit of a

Album","standard":"As one of dance music’s modern disco ambassadors, Purple Disco Machine has added his nostalgic touch to some of the early 2020s’ big cultural moments, remixing “I’m Just Ken” from the blockbuster film <i>Barbie</i> and Lizzo’s ubiquitous hit “About Damn Time,” for which he earned his first Grammy. But the German producer’s mission is wider than that. He’s long viewed his music as a funky vessel for feel-good vibes and escapism, where, true to the genre’s roots, everyone can express themselves without judgment. Purple Disco Machine builds that world on his third studio album, exploring the many ways people experience “paradise,” whether that’s by getting lost in heavy grooves or acting with reckless abandon. As “W.T.P,” the album’s opening track, winks: “Don’t need no good advice in paradise.”\n\nTo make the album, Purple Disco Machine collected vintage gear to emulate the warmth of classic records. He also embraced a more collaborative approach, working closely with songwriters and live musicians to capture the energy of in-person sessions. Diverse collaborators like disco icon Nile Rodgers, rapper/singer TOBi, synth-pop artist Roosevelt, and British rock band Nothing But Thieves help shape <i>Paradise</i>’s rich sound, which dips into Italo-disco, ’70s glam rock, and ’80s Hi-NRG.\n\nWith these retro dance floor sounds, Purple Disco Machine crafts pop-influenced tracks you can’t help but sing along to. On “Beat of Your Heart,” lust is intense and consuming, while the title track is a declaration of self-liberation under the club spotlight. The hook for “Honey Boy” is simple yet hypnotizing, helped by Nile Rodgers’ iconic funk bassline, and “All My Life” is a soaring, heart-filling festival anthem. “Die Maschine” is the album’s most thought-provoking track, as German artist Friedrich Liechtenstein delivers spoken word about humankind’s impact on the planet. The album closes on a reflective note, reminding us that paradise is something to enjoy but also something we must protect.","short":"The German producer’s escapist vibes blend nostalgia and pop

Album","standard":"United by a theme of living in the moment, the songs on Keith Urban’s 11th studio album—and first in four years—certainly make a convincing case for spontaneity. The romantic anthem “STRAIGHT LINE” sees Urban announce his intention to drive “straight into forever with you” before the first in a series of skyward guitar solos on this record. “That song’s about breaking out of monotony that sometimes is our own making,” the Australian country icon tells Apple Music. “And somewhere along the line, life loses a bit of its color and you feel like you’ve lost a bit of your spirit.” Recurring domestic cycles also inform “LOVE IS HARD,” a song about sticking with someone even when times are tough. “It’s like you can throw all this stuff at me and scream and yell and all the rest of it,” says Urban, “but I’m just, ‘I’m going to stay the course with you.’”\n\nGuest vocalist Lainey Wilson channels Dolly Parton for “GO HOME W U,” an impressively assured duet about leaving the bar together at closing time. Elsewhere, Urban finds ripe symbolism for love and perseverance in everything from sneakers hanging on a power line (“CHUCK TAYLORS”) to beach views in Florida (“DAYTONA”). Especially cheeky are “MESSED UP AS ME”—on which Urban brags that no one else leaves his lover’s bed as disheveled as he does—and “LAUGHIN’ ALL THE WAY TO THE DRANK,” a rollicking ode to catapulting straight from the work week into the weekend that packs banjo, fiddle, and even record scratching into its surprise breakdown. These songs share a bright, poppy pep for the most part, although “DODGE IN A SILVERADO” leans more closely toward traditional country and a few ballads strip things right back.\n\nThat includes the closing “BREAK THE CHAIN,” which delivers an affecting reminder that it’s never too late to enact change. As someone who grew up with an alcoholic father, Urban knows full well the value of halting a damaging streak that could potentially stretch across generations of a family. “I really wanted to try hard to take a different road,” he says. “That was definitely the biggest chain to try and break.”","short":"The Australian country icon celebrates spontaneity in love and

an unorthodox roster of guest artists, including the gentle pop-rocker Colbie Caillat and the post-hardcore rock band Underoath. Produced by Jordan Schmidt (Kane Brown, Cole Swindell), <i>The 3rd</i> opens with its title track, a poppy and soulful tune that nods to Tenpenny’s familial lineage: “They could’ve named me anything/But I’m James Mitchell Tenpenny, the third.” Highlights include the Caillat duet “Guess We’ll Never Know,” which makes good use of both singers’ versatile voices, and a faithful cover of the 1998 Goo Goo Dolls smash “Iris.” Tenpenny closes out the record with “Tennessee in Me,” a heartfelt ode to his home state.","short":"An eclectic and ambitious third album’s the

Album and Interview","standard":"When she skyrocketed to stardom at the tail end of the 2000s, Katy Perry was a girl-next-door gone wild: dancing on tables, kissing cherry-Chapstick-ed strangers, and shooting whipped cream out of her sparkly bustier. Her trademark hits represented pop as pure escapism—fun and frivolous, with production from the era’s biggest hitmakers (Max Martin, Stargate, Dr. Luke). Sixteen years after her breakthrough with 2008’s “I Kissed a Girl,” the era from which Perry emerged has cycled back into fashion as a nostalgic trend. But on her sixth album (not including her contemporary Christian record as Katy Hudson), named for her angel number—and for how people typed “I love you” back in the pager era—the 39-year-old singer is focused on the present.\n\n“When I was going through [2008 debut album] <i>One of the Boys</i>, it was like, ‘Oh my god, hold on to this ride!’” Perry tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, tracing the arc of her career as it pertains to her emotional life. She describes <i>Teenage Dream</i> and <i>PRISM</i> as periods of professional highs and personal turmoil. With 2017’s <i>Witness</i>, her world began to balance; that stability solidified on 2020’s <i>Smile</i>. “And now, <i>143</i> is the celebration of that wholeness, which is a space I’ve never written a record from,” she continues. “I’ve always written a record from defense, or not feeling enough, or trying to transmute my trauma. The biggest lie I think artists have ever been sold is that they have to stay in pain in order to create. That’s absolutely not true.”\n\nFour years after her last album, <i>143</i> arrives as a full-on dance record, sampling liberally from Crystal Waters’ 1991 classic “Gypsy Woman” on the Doechii collab “I’M HIS, HE’S MINE” and venturing deeper into piano house on the euphoric “LIFETIMES.” As for whether songs like “WOMAN’S WORLD” are works of high camp or the remains of a bygone era, your mileage may vary. “I just wanted to explore other territories; I didn’t want to keep repeating myself,” Perry says of her pivot to the dance floor. “The energy I’m hoping to create is freedom to be yourself—freedom to be sweaty, freedom to dance with a stranger.”\n","short":"“The energy I’m hoping to create is freedom to be

Album","standard":"The title <i>Barely Blue</i> captures Midland’s essence: down and out, to be sure, but too much of a good time to be really, truly blue. The Texas-bred band serves up its signature blend of heartache and hangovers on this follow-up to 2022’s <i>The Last Resort: Greetings From</i>, but does so with a sense of expansiveness likely brought by the trio’s decision to record the album outside of the Lone Star State. Midland tapped superproducer Dave Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson) to helm <i>Barely Blue</i>, decamping to Georgia Mae Studios in Savannah, Georgia, to record its eight new tracks. \n\n<i>Barely Blue</i> is a gentler album than previous releases, with rootsy, often acoustic production taking the place of the band’s more muscular earlier efforts. Opening track “Lucky Sometimes” is airy and open, with playful and memorable lyrical images like “a string of green lights on the way to work” and a “Cracker Barrel waitress ... giving me eyes.” The title track uses wisps of pedal steel to underscore a story of moving past heartbreak. And even though the record wasn’t recorded in Texas, the state still leaves its imprint, as the record closes with “Lone Star State of Mind,” a spare and melodic ballad that offers plenty of room for the trio’s bigger-than-Texas harmonies.","short":"The Texas band expands its sound and takes some gentler

Album and Interview","standard":"“Right now in Puerto Rico, the younger artists stopped delving into reggaetón,” Omar Courtz tells Apple Music. “I’d love to reignite the flame of the Puerto Rican reggaetón that lost ground in the past couple of years.” This statement, both personal and ambitious, underscores the fact that for the man born in Carolina, his origins and the desire to represent them are everything. Courtz is part of the new wave of boricua artists who first gained notoriety in the local underground, then stood side by side with the genre’s established stars.\n\nYears of perseverance paid off, and Courtz is finally enjoying the fruits of his labor on <i>PRIMERA MUSA</i>. The album’s inspiration and conceptual through line are unmistakable: the music of his formative years in Puerto Rico. “As I was selecting the tracks, I thought of my muses—the artists that I listened to when I was a kid,” he explains. The album’s 17 tracks are deeply boricua in spirit, filled with unexpected collaborations and disparate moods. “This album speaks to the nightclub, the streets, my fans—anyone who would like to join in and listen to my stories.” Here, he guides us through some of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“UNA NOTi”</b>\n“I was high, literally, when I made this song. I went to the studio after a show and recorded it using a different beat. It started with the melody, and we developed the rest with Haze producing. I improvised the bars, and then rerecorded the whole thing with a new backing track. But I didn’t like the voices, so I returned to the original session, which sounded really intense. People think the title refers to a notification, but it’s actually about <i>la nota</i> [Puerto Rican slang for being high].”\n\n<b>“MUSA ELEVA”</b>\n“I’ve been listening to Rihanna since my school days—this rhythmic pattern probably stayed in my subconscious. Bassy, the producer of this and other tracks on the album, also grew up listening to those artists, and we share the same influences. When I told him I was looking for something closer to Afrobeat, he got it right away. We still wanted it to have a Puerto Rican touch, and this came to mind.”\n\n<b>“DRIPPEO KBRON”</b>\n“This project is special because it showcases different sides of my personality. Besides singing about women and making music for the nightclub, I also like to record trap songs with the artists I respect. I called Dei V for this track. He’s very talented, and I had the opportunity to tell him about my project. We ended up recording a number of songs together, and this is one of them. I wanted the album to have some heavy-duty sounds for the street. This record spans the different facets of my life.”\n\n<b>“A L O C A - T”</b>\n“It starts with a reference to ‘Alócate’ by Zion. Zion & Lennox have always been one of my greatest influences. <i>Motivando a la Yal</i> was the first album I bought with my own money. There was a CD player at my grandmother’s house, and I got a few albums as a present, but this was the first one that I bought on my own. I played it so much that it stayed in my mind and inspired my own music. Zion & Lennox are of great importance to me.”\n\n<b>“SERIO CON ESE Q”</b>\n“Working with Anuel AA was amazing. He was the one who got in touch with us. He wanted to do a remix of ‘LUCES DE COLORES,’ but I suggested doing something new instead. We showed him a couple of tracks, and ‘SERIO CON ESE Q’ was one of them. We recorded in Miami. Bassy and I had a part of it worked out already. I laid down the melody, and we wrote the lyrics together. We locked ourselves in the studio and finished the track right away. We had worked together on another record, but this one was really good, too.”\n\n<b>“LUCES DE COLORES”</b>\n“I collaborated with Bassy, who also did the tracks with Anuel AA and Rauw Alejandro. We love reggaetón but treasure lots of other genres—as kids, we listened to trap and R&B. Even though we try to preserve the essence of reggaetón, we also tried to incorporate the other sounds that inspire us into the melodies or lyrics. This is one of the tracks where we fused reggaetón with different colors.”","short":"The Puerto Rican artist adds a new spark to

On his 2024 solo album <i>Wanted?</i>, the singer-songwriter tries to shed his band’s shadow and establish himself as a unique entity. “Shoot It Straight” is a bare-bones anthem that features his voice front and center, crooning over jazzy guitar chords and shuffling drums. Pitched vocals give his melody some bite, but it’s his wandering thoughts about a long-distance relationship that make the song so relatable: “Missin’ memories we used to make/Distance only thing that’s in the way/My heart is already fond of you/I made up my mind, I love you,” he sings.\n\nThroughout the project, Rutherford strives to show his whole and true self. On the anthemic “Spirit,” he sings over a spare landscape highlighted by a buzzing bassline. He reckons with his talent and flaws, ultimately OK that both exist together.

Album","standard":"It feels fairly remarkable that Lil Tecca is now five full-length projects deep into his rap career. After all, it seems like only yesterday that the Queens, New York, phenom broke out in a big way with the 2019 smash “Ransom” and the corresponding <i>We Love You Tecca</i> mixtape. Over the next half-decade, he regularly logged chart hits, including the 2023 standout “500lbs.” For his fourth album in as many years, he continues to mine a sound built on swirling synths, post-trap percussion, and melodic vocals. Preceded by booming singles like “BAD TIME” and “NEVER LAST,” <i>PLAN A</i> shows an artist living in—and sounding like—this specific moment in time.\n\nHaving come into stardom as a teen, Tecca’s youthful energy ensures his delivery neither slackens nor wanes across these 18 tracks. He documents his endurance on the shimmering “24HRS” and brags about the type of baddies he pulls on “HOMEBODY.” Even when the tempo noticeably drops, as on the drill-adjacent “SELF2SELF” or the steal-your-girl warning “NUMBER 2,” he stays engaging and engaged. There appears to be no limits to his sex life, a topic he expounds upon at length throughout the album’s runtime. Whether calculatingly limiting his communications with an eager lover on “4U” or pondering whether a taken woman is worth the pursuit (“COLD GIRLS”), he seems exceedingly comfortable in his young-lothario niche. A rare exception to these predominantly solo cuts, the bass-heavy “I CAN’T LET GO” brings Don Toliver into the studio to extoll the virtues of their hip-hop celebrity vices.","short":"The Queens

Mixtape","standard":"Over the course of his decade-plus in the spotlight, Future has allowed his many alter egos a turn at center stage. There’s Future Hendrix, the soulful hippie for whom 2017’s <i>HNDRXX</i> is named, and <i>The WIZRD</i>, a nickname given by his uncle and the namesake of 2019’s <i>Future Hndrxx Presents: The WIZRD</i>. Super Future represents him at his catchiest, where Fire Marshal Future shows the rapper at his most lit (as in, the fire marshals are going to have to shut the club down). But it’s been a while since we’ve seen Pluto, the character associated with his earliest projects, including 2012’s <i>Pluto</i>, the debut studio album that revealed him as a secret romantic and unexpected hitmaker.\n\nThat eerie, pink-lit house on the cover of <i>MIXTAPE PLUTO</i>, Future’s first solo release of 2024, is none other than the Dungeon, the Georgia studio from which some of history’s most vital and inventive rap music emerged, from Goodie Mob to Outkast to Future himself. The basement studio was owned by Rico Wade, Organized Noize producer and Future’s older cousin. When Wade died at 52, Future posted a poignant message to Instagram: “This life wouldn’t b possible if it wasn’t for my cousin. Love u forever.”\n\nAcross the album’s 17 featureless tracks, Future pays tribute not only to his uncle and mentor, but also to the era from which he emerged. “SKI,” “MJ,” and “READY TO COOK UP” deliver elevated updates on his narcotized rasp circa 2011’s <i>Dirty Sprite</i>, 2012’s <i>Astronaut Status</i>, and 2013’s underrated <i>F.B.G.: the Movie</i>. (“READY TO COOK UP,” in particular, feels like a high-end sequel to <i>Dirty Sprite</i>’s haunting title track: He might pull up in a helicopter, but he still knows how to use a Pyrex.)\n\nBut it’s his soulful side that shines on tracks like “SURFING A TSUNAMI,” a shimmering hallucination of mermaids and giant waves, or on “OCEAN” when he croons, “So many tears, I could fill up an ocean.” And on
