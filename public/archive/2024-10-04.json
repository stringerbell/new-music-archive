But <i>Moon Music</i>’s title track upends expectations quickly, dissolving into a simple piano melody that refracts and folds in on itself until lead vocalist Chris Martin breaks the spell.\n\n“Once upon a time I tried to get myself together/Be more like the sky and welcome every kind of weather,” Martin muses in a singsong cadence, picking apart his insecurities and foibles until he finally asks, “Is anyone out there? I just need a friend,” as the instruments backing him melt into a puddle. The show of vulnerability is a startling opening, but being so open felt right for the multi-hyphenate Martin. “With ‘MOON MUSiC,’” Martin tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, “I felt like, ‘Well, what if I just really told how I feel every day?’”\n\nAt this point in their career, closer to the end of their run than not (more on that in a moment), Coldplay has broken up the cycle by touring continuously while making and releasing new music rather than subjecting themselves to predictable album-tour cycles. The band considers <i>Moon Music</i> to be of a piece with 2021’s <i>Music of the Spheres</i> rather than another era. “I quite like this way of working where you don’t have to attach albums to tours and they don’t have to be these things that start and stop,” says bassist Guy Berryman. “It’s quite nice having the fluidity of what we are doing.”\n\n<i>Moon Music</i>, like the satellite it’s named after, dips in and out of different phases while still holding fast to Coldplay’s hooky, thoughtful core—appropriate for an album that’s largely about remaining true to oneself. “JUPiTER” is a tale of self-acceptance that opens with Martin in folkie mode, with more voices and instruments coming in as the titular character begins to feel comfortable in her own skin: “I love who I love,” Martin and a choir sing in call-and-response mode on the chorus, and the music grows more ecstatic as Jupiter’s story grows more jubilant. The gorgeously assembled “🌈,” meanwhile, incorporates the late Maya Angelou singing the spiritual “God Put a Rainbow in the Clouds.” “You have to accept all your colors and all the colors of other people—literally and metaphorically,” says Martin. “Once you accept all those colors, then you can be yourself, and then you can let everyone else be themselves.”\n\nColdplay’s and Martin’s flirtations with the dance floor over the years have resulted in some of their biggest hits, and <i>Moon Music</i> finds salvation in different eras of clubbing. “AETERNA” brings the band back to the rave, its stretched-out guitars and galloping rhythms framing Martin’s exhortations to “feel it flow.” The duet with Nigerian upstart Ayra Starr “GOOD FEELiNGS” drops by the disco, while “feelslikeimfallinginlove” hearkens back to Coldplay’s grandest pop triumphs, its fist-pumping chorus getting energy from the romantic sentiments Martin’s singing about.\n\nMuch has been made of Martin’s insisting that Coldplay is going to call it quits after album 12. (“Having that limit means that the quality control is so high right now that for a song to make it is almost impossible, which is great,” he explains.) But Martin wants Coldplay’s listeners to experience <i>Moon Music</i> as a representation of where he and his bandmates are in this dizzying moment. “It’s our manifesto, or my way of looking at things right now,” says Martin. “In terms of how to continue, how to not give up, how to accept reality, not run away from it, not hate anybody—even in the midst of always being filled with so many difficult emotions. And it’s with Max Martin: He made sure that it’s really good.”","short":"Chris Martin and co. defy expectations on their 10th LP: “This is our manifesto.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/moon-music/1751728791","playParams":{"id":"1751728791","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5SGtrmYbIo0Dsg4kJ4qjM6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751728791/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"471744","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/471744?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728051390735,"RTCI":0}}},"1752573745":{"id":"1752573745","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752573745?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trash-boat/902978464","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Heaven Can Wait","artistName":"Trash Boat","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":2598,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2b/6e/d7/2b6ed75c-6ecb-d7e9-8446-d4147ef23a79/2137.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2598,"textColor3":"342f28","textColor2":"232323","textColor4":"47443e","textColor1":"0a0907","bgColor":"dbcaac","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heaven-can-wait/1752573745","playParams":{"id":"1752573745","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6dweyz4Y0Uyo3fVrz0vgsD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752573745/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"902978464","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/902978464?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728015293520,"RTCI":0}}},"1752690473":{"id":"1752690473","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752690473?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wind-rose/553156044","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Trollslayer","artistName":"Wind Rose","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/56/45/8d/56458dda-6749-612d-8900-70cd8de8fae3/810157922304.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c2cbcd","textColor2":"b5dbdf","textColor4":"97b9bf","textColor1":"ebf1ef","bgColor":"1f3042","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/trollslayer/1752690473","playParams":{"id":"1752690473","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yNf57m6EUvvnJhDBTmULq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752690473/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"553156044","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/553156044?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728028117407,"RTCI":0}}},"1753967753":{"id":"1753967753","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753967753?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/memorials/1456280733","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Memorial Waterslides","artistName":"MEMORIALS","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/aa/05/05aa05d7-a9d4-58ff-6972-ed8e98075cf9/809236176608_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"371d24","textColor2":"071523","textColor4":"2f2938","textColor1":"12060b","bgColor":"cf7b8b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Electrelane’s Verity Susman returns with fuzzy noise-pop confections."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/memorial-waterslides/1753967753","playParams":{"id":"1753967753","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5ydP50mCKo42Gmx7q7lDC4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1753967753/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1456280733","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1456280733?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728021354280,"RTCI":0}}},"1754272228":{"id":"1754272228","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1754272228?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rat-boy/981610998","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"SUBURBIA CALLING","artistName":"RAT BOY","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b0/32/8b/b0328be3-f204-8b07-ef4c-b922f5588782/0045778055265.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"733f3c","textColor2":"521913","textColor4":"754742","textColor1":"50100b","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The Essex band chronicles smalltown living on a cheeky ode to its roots.

For Bay, though, fourth album <i>Changes All the Time</i> is the fullest, and truest, representation of who he is as a musician. “Guitar playing has always been a central part of who I am as an artist,” he tells Apple Music. “I had a go at standing up on stage without a guitar, but I felt too naked. I’ve come a bit of a long way round to the making of this album to say to myself that, more than ever before, I want the songs to come first, and I want my guitar playing to be the center of those songs. I wanted the art and the musicianship to really come across and be elevated from what it had been before.”\n\n<i>Changes All the Time</i> journeys from the soulful, front-porch stomp-along of “Up All Night,” featuring Noah Kahan and The Lumineers, and “Hope”’s gospel-inspired soul-searching to the widescreen rock ’n’ roll drama of “Easy Distraction,” co-written by The Killers’ Brandon Flowers, and the glowing Muscle Shoals spirit burning within “Speed Limit.” It’s a record with all the integrity and searing musicianship of the classic albums Bay has drawn from across his career. But, thanks to the confidence which comes with knowing exactly who he is, he’s revealed more of himself than ever before. “I hope I can keep unearthing and discovering new layers to who I am as an artist as time goes by, but I’m less self-conscious about how it comes across,” he says. “I’m more like, ‘Well, this record is me. This who I am right now.’” Discover more as he takes us through the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“Up All Night” (feat. The Lumineers & Noah Kahan)</b>\n“Mark Broughton, who engineered the album, played piano on most of the tracks. We’d finished a take of something else and he was just mucking around, playing some notes, and I picked up a guitar and played the same thing back, added a couple other chords and the song started to be born. We spent the next two hours writing it and recorded it that evening. It sounded like such a party and I thought, ‘Who shall we share this with?’ I’ve known The Lumineers and Noah [Kahan] for years, he used to open for me, and they were kind enough to come onto it after we’d recorded it. There are no drums on that song at all. It’s all stomps and claps.” \n\n<b>“Everburn”</b>\n“My relationship plays a part in so many of the songs that I write. We’ve been together for a very long time, navigated so much and continue to, and that is always something to explore and express in my writing. So many of my songs are centered around matters of the heart. I don’t know what my life looks like from the outside, but it’s as real as anybody else’s and full of obstacles like anybody else’s. ‘Everburn’ looks at the reality that perhaps sometimes things can get heavy, but one way or another, love can conquer all and keep you strong.”\n\n<b>“Hope”</b>\n“I’ve always been really moved by gospel music. Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles came from a gospel background and they’re two artists who massively inspired me growing up. It’s always been something I’ve adored but this was the first time I really felt like I had a song that suits me as an artist that also lets me stretch those gospel-inspired limbs of mine. I enjoyed pairing that with telling a story in the song. It’s quite a broad notion, having hope. But boy, is it relatable. I can be quite a pessimistic type and I wrote this song as a battle against that, because it’ll kill you if you don’t.”\n\n<b>“Easy Distraction”</b>\n“Bruce Springsteen has been a thing for me pretty much since I was born. My dad loves Springsteen so much and passed him on to me and my brother. I wrote this song with Brandon Flowers who I’m a huge fan of as well, but boy, is that man a massive fan of Bruce Springsteen! It really shows on this in the most glorious way. It was really special to be in those musical waters, and it was such a wonderful experience. It’s every bit as Killers-influenced as it is <i>Born to Run</i>-era Springsteen.”\n\n<b>“Speed Limit”</b>\n“I wrote this in Nashville with the fantastic Natalie Hemby [singer-songwriter and member of The Highwomen], who was raised on that sort of Southern soul sound and writes on a lot of gospel and country types of music. She does this sort of song very naturally, and so do I because a lot of my influences are American: country, blues, gospel, and folk. I’d been driving a little bit too fast to that session, and I was thinking about my daughter and everybody at home. I had this line without a melody to it: ‘I broke the speed limit to get to you...’ Once I walked into Natalie’s house, I said, ‘Can I just grab a guitar and sing this into my phone and see how it comes out?’ I’m really proud of my collaboration with Natalie, there’s something effortless about it.”\n\n<b>“Talk”</b>\n“I find it difficult to say the things I do in songs in real life. I’ve learned to be a performer to avoid vulnerable encounters. I love performing, I don’t just do it to hide, but sharing personal things in personal scenarios doesn’t come as easily to me as writing a song. For all the angst and emotion of that song lyrically, it’s so fun to play. Like, ‘Yellow’ by Coldplay is quite an angsty song, but you know they’re having a fucking blast every time they play it.”\n\n<b>“Hopeless Heart”</b>\n“I wrote this song a couple of years ago in the gap between the last album and this one. It’s a bit dumb in the most beautiful way. I remember being inspired by Fleetwood Mac. I just wanted to open my chest and my heart and belt it out. It was a fun, brilliant thing to say: ‘You tore out my hopeless heart, I never want it back.’ I’m trying to get some shit off my chest and those are the words I chose to express it. It’s nice to get things off your chest sometimes. Something difficult happened to me, but actually, in the grand scheme things, that was OK.”\n\n<b>“Some People”</b>\n“It was the last thing we recorded. We ran all of these cables out into the stairwell and plugged some mics in. It was a bit of Led Zeppelin-inspired move, because they’re famous for putting the drum kit in the stairwell and getting that giant sound. It was a place where we could stack these harmonies and get an ethereal feel like Fleet Foxes or Crosby, Stills & Nash, all those stunning harmony groups. It pares everything right back and goes vulnerable and intimate. It felt so good at the end of such a busy and noisy recording experience to do that. It’s like taking that last breath before we shut the book on the making of the album. It could easily have been the last song on the album, but it’s nice to drop it in the middle and have this whisper moment while there’s so much of a hurricane going on.”\n\n<b>“Go On”</b>\n“The meaning of this song is very particular. I lost a family member very suddenly just as the pandemic was starting. It wasn’t because of the pandemic, he had a horrible cancer that just whipped through him and took him away. It left a hole, as it does in any family. I wanted to send him off. I wanted to salute him and say, ‘Go safe, go on, get out of here. You’ve been fucking awesome. Thank you. We love you. All the best.’ It was a very moving thing to write and record.”\n\n<b>“Crystal Clear”</b>\n“This is me trying to do that thing that a painter or a photographer does when they capture a subject in the present moment and then it’s set in time, so every time you go back to that painting, or that photograph, you see that moment. I was on tour when I wrote this song. I’d just become a parent, and life gets so difficult and can feel uneasy and unsettled when you’re trying to be present for such a giant shift, but also maintain a career that involves you going away all the time. I tried to speak to those emotions and speak to that reality in the song. It’s a snapshot of life at that time.”\n\n<b>“Dogfight”</b>\n“I wrote this with Phil Plested [who’s written with Lewis Capaldi, Mimi Webb, Bastille, and Niall Horan] and Holly Humberstone. Holly is brilliant and already has this timelessness to her sound and her approach, but she’s a newbie otherwise. The anxieties of being a performer exist for both of us, regardless of one person having so much experience and the other one still being in that initial shock of this new, exciting limelight. I wanted to talk about how hard it can feel to just be myself and she said, ‘I know about that. It can feel like a fucking dogfight.’ As soon as she said that we were off. We tried a few productions on that one. It started out a bit synth-y, but as soon as we started trying it this way it just felt like it would end the album. I really lost myself emotionally in the outro of that song, the way the band play in the final moments of it is just incredible.”","short":"The singer-songwriter’s never felt more himself: “This is

Album","standard":"An outgrowth of writing her 2024 memoir, <i>Just Don’t Be a D**khead</i>, Kasey Chambers’ self-produced 13th studio album finds the ARIA Hall of Fame country artist reflecting on the past, present and future alike. “The Divorce Song” reunites her with her ex-husband, Shane Nicholson, for a duet that opens with laughter and maintains that streak of good humor throughout. Inspired by their two children, “Silverado Girl” and “Arlo” both touch upon just how quickly time passes for a parent. Those aren’t the only knowing forays into childhood: With its soothing cadences and reference to counting sheep, “For Better or Worse” plays like a loving lullaby while “Little Red Riding Hood” riffs on that classic tale for a dark and jazzy vibe. \n\nAccompanied by her usual players—her guitarist father, Bill Chambers, guitarist Brandon Dodd, and bassist Jeff McCormack—along with new faces in guitarist Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) and drummer Brady Blade (Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle), Chambers knows exactly when and how to let the instruments hang back for the most profound impact. Whether that’s on the two-part a cappella opening of “Dart n Feather” or a hymn-like duet with Kenyan American songwriter Ondara, she’s always centering words and vocals. That’s also apparent on the Dolly-esque bluegrass ballad “Backbone (The Desert Child)” and the tender “A Love Like Springsteen,” which nods to several of the inspiration’s songs. And on the slow-burn opener “A New Day Has Come,” Chambers looks brightly ahead until she’s repeating “Everything’s gonna be alright” over and over with resounding sense of self-belief.","short":"The Australian country veteran gazes deeply across her personal life."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/backbone/1757772517","playParams":{"id":"1757772517","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02ZOJK7R6cfdXHJV3aRqRU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1757772517/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"148174","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/148174?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728015620432,"RTCI":0}}},"1758065392":{"id":"1758065392","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758065392?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-smile/1603491177","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d5/41/8c/d5418c04-5365-953f-f794-da2c36162ce3/Job792f4be5-1ec3-4145-ade1-8c531f4b788c-174628023-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_340647009_1878466202-Time1725038435053.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1ad551"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"172b19"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2eb050","textColor2":"1ad551","textColor4":"1baf4b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"172b19","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/31/95/cc/3195cc5e-1dfa-852c-f83a-794d370c4b43/22a9996a-789f-4e06-a670-0e0e6b89565a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8ec1c1","textColor2":"8eefdb","textColor4":"75c3b3","textColor1":"adeded","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ab/18/99/ab18990d-9700-3623-4913-cfb87128ba6f/Job74897941-becc-4a7c-8708-daaaebb3ee43-175375323-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_342211900_1889937147-Time1726051855082.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ba9b8e","textColor2":"25d244","textColor4":"22ad3c","textColor1":"e3bdaa","bgColor":"17161d","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c0/bb/e3/c0bbe35e-f85c-2c27-2dda-cc4e8243fabe/f5e11415-1950-4c64-a92e-e44eb0006f40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"79cf71","textColor2":"fd883b","textColor4":"d4783e","textColor1":"8bf57a","bgColor":"34364b","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a8/e2/83/a8e28371-6c10-55d5-9e8a-3dc2fc37eed2/92c42bcc-c5d4-4beb-bdd6-77d35d38dc6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9bab6","textColor2":"c3c5d8","textColor4":"a0a2b0","textColor1":"e3e3df","bgColor":"151612","hasP3":false}},"name":"Cutouts","artistName":"The Smile","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/50/b7/0e/50b70e97-8168-5362-a00b-12b94da9a809/191404144572.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"bba397","textColor2":"47cd55","textColor4":"3fa649","textColor1":"e3cab6","bgColor":"1f0a1a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Given that it evolved from an urge to do something—anything—creative during the pandemic, The Smile has turned out to be one of the most liberating and fruitful projects of Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood’s latter-day career. <i>Cutouts</i> is the third record in little more than two years from the trio, which also includes Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner, and follows just 10 months after their captivating second album <i>Wall of Eyes</i>.\n\nIts creation mirrors the cross-pollination that occurred between a pair of classic Radiohead albums. In much the same way that 2000’s <i>Kid A</i> and 2001’s <i>Amnesiac</i> were made during the same recording sessions but inhabited different sonic spaces and textures, <i>Cutouts</i> contains songs committed to tape at the same time as <i>Wall of Eyes</i> in Oxford and London’s Abbey Road Studios with producer Sam Petts-Davies. Whereas <i>Wall of Eyes</i> mesmerized with a tightly wound, autumnal restraint, there’s an unfurling expanse at work on <i>Cutouts</i>’ 10 tracks. With its cascading riffs, soulful piano chords, and yearning vocals, “Eyes & Mouth” is the epic center around which everything else revolves. The record never settles in one spot for too long: “Instant Psalm,” featuring beatific strings from the London Contemporary Orchestra, is a hazy folk gem, and “The Slip” is a synth-laden banger, while the frantic punk-funk grooves of “Zero Sum” sound like they’re trying to wriggle out of themselves.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether anything can be read into the trio clearing the decks with this collection of songs, some of which were played live around the time of their 2022 debut <i>A Light for Attracting Attention</i> (or in some cases, even deeper into the past—the title of contemplative closer “Bodies Laughing” can be traced back to Radiohead rehearsals in the mid-2000s). But if <i>Cutouts</i> is the end of an era for The Smile, it caps off a prolific, potent period for Yorke, Greenwood, and Skinner.\n","short":"A satisfyingly restless third album from the Radiohead side project."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cutouts/1758065392","playParams":{"id":"1758065392","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1wOiuWSlK5pQdpQP8VgH6F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758065392/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1603491177","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1603491177?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728016308046,"RTCI":0}}},"1758806146":{"id":"1758806146","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758806146?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/palomino-blond/1353971807","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"You Feel It Too","artistName":"Palomino Blond","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c4/4f/53/c44f53be-d551-07f2-7c15-f4b6cd931304/47464.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b9b7b2","textColor2":"d7d2c3","textColor4":"afae9d","textColor1":"e4dddd","bgColor":"0c1e06","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-feel-it-too/1758806146","playParams":{"id":"1758806146","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2drcPxzUUCH4LFYxJaWYIZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1758806146/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1353971807","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1353971807?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728015330820,"RTCI":0}}},"1759341996":{"id":"1759341996","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759341996?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/maul/1626326890","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"In the Jaws of Bereavement","artistName":"Maul","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/3d/be/1c3dbea6-6115-1a97-77b8-540410f2b04e/810079501816.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"caab49","textColor2":"c79eda","textColor4":"9f7fae","textColor1":"fdd55b","bgColor":"000200","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"A second album of ferocious death metal from the Fargo, ND, band."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-the-jaws-of-bereavement/1759341996","playParams":{"id":"1759341996","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ipaPP4xVxcByIOYOqFlvC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1759341996/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1626326890","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1626326890?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728004497477,"RTCI":0}}},"1760041859":{"id":"1760041859","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760041859?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2005-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tony-iommi/462585","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Fused (feat.

Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"When Leon Bridges made his debut in 2015 with <i>Coming Home</i>, critics and peers alike were amazed by his velvety retro-soul stylings reminiscent of Sam Cooke and Otis Redding. Widening his horizons, his third album <i>Gold-Diggers Sound</i> showcased a different side of the Texas crooner, leaving behind the ’50s and ’60s vibe that helped propel him to stardom for a mix of ’80s and ’90s R&B mixed with lush, jazz-inspired live instrumentation. “I kind of always felt like a lone wolf in the industry, and yes, my music is under the umbrella of R&B, but I’ve always felt like I was never fully embraced in that community,” Bridges tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And so it was kind of a thought that ‘Leon’ is the genre, and as far as the whole album is kind of like a window into who I am.” Now, with his self-titled album, Leon Bridges is ready to reintroduce himself and invite his fans into his world.\n\n<i>Leon</i> is an intimate and revealing love letter to the singer-songwriter’s hometown, his upbringing, and the stories that helped shape him into the artist he is now. “Prior to this one, I’ve definitely scratched the surface of it,” he says. “This one digs into a lot of my experiences as a kid growing up in Fort Worth, and it really talks about the things that I’ve valued most in this life, which are family and home.” Bridges is vulnerable as he faces his fears on the smooth and serene album opener “When a Man Cries,” while on the breezy, guitar-laced track “Panther City,” he is nostalgic, reminiscing on hazy summer days growing up, with references to Nintendo 64 and going down to the local community center. \n\nBridges pays homage on the downtempo and rocksteady track “Laredo,” which details a fleeting night in the border town that left a memorable and lasting impression on him. “That’s What I Love” highlights some of the things and moments that Bridges holds near and dear to his heart: “Bourbon, Cadillacs, blue denim, makin’ love on the beach in the mornin’/Springtime on the Trinity River, gold jewelry, all-black penny loafers,” he croons on the opening verse. His favorite things aren’t only material and sensual in nature, but he also mixes in romance while singing about his partner. “Peaceful Place” finds the singer confident in this version of himself and his music, while reassuring himself that he’s exactly where he needs to be: “I’m in a peaceful place/I’ve found something no one can take away.”\n","short":"Leon Bridges: “The whole album is kind of like a window into who I am.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/leon/1760811064","playParams":{"id":"1760811064","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6mHNMtHrXIdUWWuZD9njsG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1760811064/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"961252454","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/961252454?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728030260699,"RTCI":0}}},"1761248769":{"id":"1761248769","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761248769?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/finneas/1138790033","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1e/f3/5a/1ef35a16-07ff-e04f-4d95-a4ff54334ba3/49e86532-526e-4a99-a3c3-49a4d14698f6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b88b71","textColor2":"d0a996","textColor4":"a78878","textColor1":"e5ad8e","bgColor":"060200","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ab/88/f5/ab88f51c-c5f0-5896-c915-fa89837a2241/6a7cba07-d062-4b43-b256-dd8eea16554a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2622","textColor2":"1b1714","textColor4":"352f29","textColor1":"100c0b","bgColor":"9d907f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e7/a0/61/e7a061dd-bb51-0a53-5734-0846afc24c7e/e08585d3-d174-4448-a631-677364bd9e7e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2afb4","textColor2":"dbaa91","textColor4":"b08874","textColor1":"dcdae1","bgColor":"080200","hasP3":false}},"name":"For Cryin' Out Loud!","artistName":"FINNEAS","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/f6/6a/1ef66a49-98ed-b22d-eb90-56e5640e09dd/24UMGIM79281.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"38322d","textColor2":"2c262e","textColor4":"4f474a","textColor1":"0f0c09","bgColor":"ddccba","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I think I am a songwriter first, which is always how I’ve felt about myself,” FINNEAS tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. The 27-year-old has already made his name as a producer through his chart-dominating, award-accruing work with his sister Billie Eilish. But when he was finished with his workload for 2023, which included working on Eilish’s blockbuster album <i>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</i> and scoring the Apple TV+ show <i>Disclaimer</i>, he wanted to, as he put it, “dive back into my stuff.” \n\nSo he went to work in a new space—a studio outside his home laboratory—surrounded by musicians with whom he felt comfortable feeling out new material, flexing his muscles as a producer while also testing out his songwriting chops. That collaborative ease is audible on <i>For Cryin’ Out Loud!</i>, an inviting album that combines soft rock’s slickness and indie’s choppy guitars with unexpected twists like the jittery epilogue to the chilled-out sophisti-pop flirtation “Sweet Cherries” or the brass that rises up at the end of the hooky, longing title track. FINNEAS’ songwriting strengths shine throughout, with his keen knowledge of how pop songs work shining alongside modern touches, as well as lyrics that channel their strong sentiments through fleeting imagery. \n\nThe album’s emotional peak arrives on “Family Feud,” a story told through snapshots of moments when a brother-sister link grew stronger. Written 10 days after Eilish and FINNEAS won their second Academy Award for the <i>Barbie</i> ballad “What Was I Made For?,” “Family Feud” came from FINNEAS winding down from the siblings’ high-energy 2024 awards season by, he says, “thinking about my relationship with her, devoid of all of the other stuff.” It’s delicately put together, allowing for FINNEAS’ quiet rumination on how his bond with his sister feels as unbreakable as it did before fame swooped in to be gently placed at the forefront. \n","short":"Stepping outside his work with Billie to showcase his songwriting chops."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-cryin-out-loud/1761248769","playParams":{"id":"1761248769","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7swV2ssDdlKc89h1DxUNh7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761248769/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1138790033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1138790033?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728045860092,"RTCI":0}}},"1761271497":{"id":"1761271497","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761271497?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe/284113","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4e/69/c6/4e69c629-842e-0c86-656f-10697437b25d/0670d499-a11c-4cf7-b547-2bd46d02b483.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"f3f3f3","textColor4":"cecece","textColor1":"f3f3f3","bgColor":"3b3b3b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Cancelled -

In typical Smith fashion, he throws a few curveballs in the mix, too, like the Avril Lavigne duet “Can You Die From a Broken Heart” and closing track “I Like It,” a collaboration with EDM artist Alesso that’s far better suited to a nightclub than a honky-tonk. Smith tells Apple Music that at the end of the day, he cares most about connecting with listeners and staying true to himself in his music, even when it deviates from the norm. “Every single song has a different purpose,” he says. “I feel like they’re almost vitamins or something, for different things that you need.”\n\n<b>“Want Me Back”</b>\n“I think sometimes in relationships, you become somebody else or you want to compromise to make a relationship work. And it probably came from an insecure place where I wanted the relationship so bad that I was willing to give up parts of myself and things, and parts that maybe they're important to me and not other people. But I like to drink and I like to have fun, and maybe that wouldn't work for somebody. You know what I mean? I hold back the party side of me, which, I think that’s a fun side of me… And you realize, too, after you break up, after a while, ‘Oh my gosh, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm not doing this.’ And you're like, ‘I just want who I am back. I want that person.’ That was one of the last songs we wrote, too, for the album.”\n\n<b>“What Alone Looks Like”</b>\n“‘What Alone Looks Like’ is this rocking song. It's the one I play the most, probably. But it's so visceral and it can mean two things. It can mean I'm losing you or I don't ever want to lose you, but it has this ‘ah.’”\n \n<b>“Can You Die From a Broken Heart” (feat. Avril Lavigne)</b>\n“I don't ever want to say that it's 2.0 of [Avril Lavigne’s] ‘I'm With You,’ because that song's just so special and everything, but it's certainly a nod and it definitely has those melodies. When you hear it, you go, ‘That's the Avril I've missed. That's the Avril I've wanted to hear.’ This song was designed for her.”\n\n<b>“Not of This Earth”</b>\n“If you're in the mood to just be loving with your person, ‘Not of This Earth,’ you put that on and the two of you are just like, ‘Man, your love is something I've never experienced. It doesn't even seem like it's on planet Earth.’”\n\n<b>“California Gold”</b>\n“It was the last song we wrote. Me and Ashley Gorley and John Byron and Lindsay Rimes, we were walking out of the writing room and we're like, ‘Oh, crap. We didn't write the title track. We forgot to write “California Gold.” How did we do this?’ We were sitting there and we were like, ‘Well, let's just try. Let's just bust it out.’ We started talking about things I grew up with, so there's Easter eggs in there. Honey Run River was the river in Paradise, Chico, that we would jump in and hang out at. I smoked Prime Times—they are these little flavored cigars, little miniature cigars, black cherry and all that stuff. A lot of Easter eggs in that song.”","short":"Sunny West Coast country-pop songs: “I feel like they’re almost

Deluxe Album","standard":"Victoria Monét is known throughout the industry for her songwriting skills, the brains behind hits for Ariana Grande, BLACKPINK, Chloe x Halle, and many more. “I moved to LA to pursue artistry and just all of the things that I dreamed for myself, and life takes you in different turns, so I ended up songwriting a lot more than recording my own music,” she tells Apple Music. Although the Sacramento native spent most of her career writing, she still released music independently with her 2014 and 2018 EP series <i>Nightmares & Lullabies</i> and <i>Life After Love</i>, but it wasn’t until 2020’s <i>JAGUAR</i> that Monét came into her own as an artist of the same stature as the ones she’d worked for. Named after the fierce jungle cat—known for lurking undetected until they’re ready to pounce—the project introduced a motif that Monét created to show her transition from illustrious songwriter to full-fledged R&B star.\n\n“<i>JAGUAR I</i> and <i>II</i> are relatives, but you see, <i>JAGUAR II</i> is an older, more developed, voluptuous older sister,” she says. “I just really wanted to make it in my eyes better than <i>JAGUAR I</i>, which I feel like I’ve done.” Co-produced by longtime collaborator D’Mile, <i>JAGUAR II</i> is a seamless continuation enlisting live musicians and delving further into the psychedelic sounds of the 1970s—an era that influenced and inspired both albums. Still, Monét takes it further by guiding listeners through different soundscapes of funk, pop, R&B, and reggae while capturing the different moods she wanted to create. \n\nInstead of songs about her experiences as a new mom and being in love, Monét decided to showcase the full spectrum of emotions that women feel, whether she’s singing about her affinity for cannabis on the Lucky Daye-assisted “Smoke,” being outside on the flirty party anthem “Party Girls,” or women’s empowerment on “Cadillac (A Pimp’s Anthem).” “I'm trying to listen to it from a fan's perspective, and I would think that people would be like, oh, she's going to talk about just being completely in love and wanting to get married and having kids, this white-picket-fence life,” she says. “And it's not that I feel like even making the album with my relationship, I had the freedom to discuss things that I may not feel currently, but they came up in the making of this album, even though I'm not necessarily in that mindset right now.”\n\nOn the swaggering “On My Mama,” Monét adds some Southern twang, interpolating Texas rapper Chalie Boy's 2009 track “I Look Good” for an infectious hook that makes it a soundtrack to positive affirmations about not just looking good but feeling good as well, while the follow-up “I'm the One” continues that cocky persona over a pop-leaning track. Monét reflects on her stardom on the retro track “Hollywood,” which features legendary funk group Earth, Wind & Fire and her daughter Hazel. “Philip Bailey came in and did his vocals, but then Verdine came in on a different day to play the bass,” she explains. “Just knowing that I'm inspired by them so much from the inception of <i>JAGUAR</i> to have them on it as an exclamation point for <i>JAGUAR II</i>, it just means so much.”\n\nFollowing the monumental success of <i>JAGUAR II</i>—which earned her three Grammy Awards—Victoria Monét adds 10 tracks for the deluxe version. Serving as a disc two, <i>JAGUAR II : Deluxe</i> shows the singer-songwriter’s sensual side, offering different vignettes of love and sex, whether she’s on the prowl for her next conquest on “DickAtNight,” surrendering to her desires on the USHER duet “SOS (Sex on Sight),” or exploring forgiveness within her relationship on “Love Is Stronger Than Pride”—a cover of the 1988 Sade classic. The final two tracks on the deluxe, “The Greatest” and “The Greatest (Lovenotes Outro),” are a victory lap for Monét as she concludes her JAGUAR era, highlighting the eventful year she’s had since the release of this project, her artistic evolution, and the realization that she’s finally made it.

Wetmore co-wrote six of the EP’s eight tracks, with co-writers including Dan Wilson, Josh Thompson, and Tucker Beathard. Other highlights on the EP include opening track “Silverado Blue,” a laidback and groovy tailgate tune that makes great use of Wetmore’s soulful and textured voice, and “Break First,” an infectious, uptempo will-they-won’t-they love song with bright guitar and a toe-tapping beat.

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Lizzy McAlpine’s third full-length began as a classic breakup album—which is to say, “tunnel vision,” she tells Apple Music. “Everything was about that.” It wasn’t until she wrote the runaway hit “Older” that she realized what the project was <i>really</i> about: personal growth, trusting your instincts, seeing the bigger picture. “That song recontextualized everything,” she said. “Suddenly I saw what those three years had really been for.” <i>Older</i> is a portrait of an artist in her early twenties, falling out of love and stepping into her power; <i>Older Wiser</i>, released five months later, adds five moving, intimate new tracks to that story. \n\nCreating it required her to get out of her comfort zone. After making the tough decision to part ways with her producer, she surrounded herself with a full band, rerecorded most of the songs and assembled a project that confronts a breakup’s gray areas (on “Drunk, Running,” she wonders if she’s partly to blame for an ex’s struggles with sobriety). McAlpine ordered the songs on the album to trace the arc of the relationship, culminating in four tracks that illustrate the perspective she gained. Read on to discover the story behind each song.\n\n<b>“The Elevator”</b>\n“When I decided to remake the album with a band, I knew I wanted it to have a proper, cool intro. This song was the first one we recorded together. We didn’t even have a drummer yet. But it felt right. And it was proof of concept, like, ‘OK, we’re going to be able to do this.’” \n\n<b>“Come Down Soon”</b>\n“This was one of the first songs that I wrote for the album in 2021. It’s gone through a lot of different iterations, and only when I brought it to the band did it begin to make sense. Prior to that, we were just putting pieces together one by one, and it wasn’t working. Finally, I realized this music needs a band behind it. A collective force.” \n\n<b>“Like It Tends To Do”</b>\n“This was the first song I wrote for this project, back when I was finishing up <i>five seconds flat</i>. Immediately it was my favorite song I’d ever written. It felt like some of my best songwriting. I knew it deserved its own place on a different project.” \n\n<b>“Movie Star”</b>\n“I wrote this with my friend Olivia Barton who opened for me on my last tour. We initially had a wild outro that was full of electric guitars and big drums. But when we got into the studio with the band, we realized that ‘Elevator’ had a similar arc and sound. So we cut the whole outro out of this one and now it’s just a short, simple little song. I think it’s so much better this way.” \n\n<b>“All Falls Down”</b>\n“I wrote this one when I was on tour, which is weird. I never write songs on the road because I hate touring, so I’m usually pretty miserable and uninspired. But I guess this was different because I was writing it about <i>that feeling</i>. Originally, it was slow and ballad-y because that’s what the lyrics feel like, but it evolved into this fun, upbeat number. I love that juxtaposition.” \n\n<b>“Staying”</b>\n“This was supposed to be a really short interlude, and it had this outro section that I had written that my old producer suggested we cut. But later, when I took it to the band and they jammed on it, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m actually going to add the outro back in. I think it could be cool.’ And now it’s my favorite part of the song. I’m so glad I decided to do that, and that I didn’t let that producer’s opinion sway me.” \n\n<b>“I Guess”</b>\n“Most of the time, in my revisions with the band, we were taking a lot of stuff out. It didn’t feel like the original recordings had enough space, had room to breathe. This one was sort of the opposite. It had a lot we wanted to keep—strings, drums, horns. Instead, we just layered in some additional elements—guitar, piano, and bass chords—to try to make it cooler.” \n\n<b>“Drunk, Running”</b>\n“I wrote this song after I was out of the relationship [that this album is about] and pretty far removed from it. I went out with my friends one night and my ex was there; we were at a bar and he was ignoring me and just looked really miserable. I was like, ‘Damn, this is hard to watch.’ This song is about that experience, and our time together before that. I ordered the tracks in a very specific way to carry you from the beginning of the relationship into the second half, where things start to devolve and get really toxic. ‘Drunk, Running’ is the beginning of that toxic chapter. The bridge is kind of like, ‘Oh God, what if I did this to you? What if I made you this way? I’m so sorry for staying when I should have left.’ It’s me realizing my part that I played.” \n\n<b>“Broken Glass”</b>\n“I played this one on my last tour. The original version was done. I love this song so much and think it fits perfectly in this spot on the album. It’s just really dark.” \n\n<b>“You Forced Me To”</b>\n“I wrote this song during a recording session when I stepped outside to take a break. I went home that night and recorded it on my laptop, and that’s what you hear. We didn’t re-record anything. When I went to the band and I played them this demo, they were like, ‘That’s it. We don’t need to do anything.’ And Mason [Stoops] in particular—he’s our guitar player, and kind of the leader of the band—he was adamant about me being the only person credited.” \n\n<b>“Older”</b>\n“This song changed everything for me. I had the first verse and chorus written in a voice memo that I’d kind of forgotten about because my first producer thought it might be too Disney. But when I played it for Mason and Taylor [Mackall], they were immediately like, ‘No, this is amazing.’ The only issue was that I didn’t know how to finish it, since by the time we revisited it, I was so far removed from the intensity of that breakup. They suggested I write about where I am now. Doing that tied the whole song together for me, and cemented the album’s entire concept. It unlocked everything. We finished the song in 20 minutes, did three takes, used the third one, and never looked back.” \n\n<b>“Better Than This”</b>\n“I knew I wanted to update this song from the original version, so the band and I did a bunch of live takes. That was generally our process throughout. We’d do a bunch of live takes, pick one, and then pepper stuff on top of it. I loved that the core of the album was live recordings—everyone huddled in a room. It felt like that was the only way to approach this project, and this song in particular.”\n\n<b>“March”</b>\n“This song is about my dad, who passed away in 2020. Every 13th track on all of my albums is about him. He passed away on the 13th of March, and my first album came out on the 13th, and there were 13 tracks, and the 13th track was about him. I didn’t really plan that, but it created a tradition. I don’t really write about my dad with anyone because it’s just really heavy and personal, but I wrote this song with [songwriter/composer] Ethan [Gruska] who made me feel safe and open. Recording it was amazing. It feels so warm when the band comes in. It’s a hug for your ears.” \n\n<b>“Vortex”</b>\n“This song was supposed to be the title of the album for so long, but again, it felt like tunnel vision. This album is, ultimately, about so much more than a breakup. But I still thought it was a perfect way to end the project. I love that the lyrics are forward-facing and hopeful, like, ‘Someday I will be strong enough to say no to you,’ or ‘Someday I’ll be strong enough to let this go.’ The gist is: I may not be there yet, but I know I will be.”","short":"The folk-pop star adds five new tracks to her coming-of-age third

I’m proud of them. And if it’s not your cup of tea, then good thing there’s a million artists out there.”\n\nThat said, <i>Am I Okay?</i> shows no signs of a sophomore slump. Like its predecessor, the 2023 breakout <i>Lucky</i>, the collection pulls together feisty kiss-offs and aching ballads—the latter a product of Moroney’s winking, self-professed “emo cowgirl” persona. Highlights on the album include the sweet and optimistic title track, on which Moroney falls for “a 6'2\" dream,” and the swaggering rock anthem “Indifferent.” More serious moments show a weightier side to Moroney’s songwriting, like the heartbreaking, grief-stricken “Heaven by Noon” and the vulnerable closer “Hell of a Show.” Below, Moroney shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Am I Okay?”</b>\n“People are probably going to think it’s going to be a heart-wrenching song, but it’s just not. It’s like you’re actually happy for once and you’re asking yourself, ‘Oh my God. Am I OK?’ That’s how I felt at one time. I think that when I had hope in a relationship with this guy, it lasted for a month or two until he showed his true colors. But we live and we learn. We got a good song out of it, and then we moved on.”\n\n<b>“No Caller ID”</b>\n“I was playing it at the <i>Lucky</i> shows. I was kind of giving them that treat, like an unreleased song [where] the only place you could hear it was at the live shows. But then, of course, it got posted on TikTok, and several TikToks of that song blew up. So, I thought that people cared about the song, but I didn’t know it was going to take off the way it did, obviously.”\n\n<b>“Indifferent”</b>\n“A song like ‘Indifferent,’ it was just kind of what I was going through at the time. But I think in the studio…I’m like, ‘OK, because this song turned into what it is, we need to make this rock. We need to make it punch really hard, because this is going to be crazy at live shows.’ So, it’s kind of like after the song was written, just making sure in the studio it was executed the way that we wanted it to be.”\n\n<b>“Miss Universe”</b>\n“‘Miss Universe’ is basically just a story about when you want your ex to downgrade and then they don’t, and you’re like, ‘Oh.’ So, that’s kind of just that feeling. I’m like, ‘How did you pull her?’ So, yeah, that is just kind of a story about how you want them to downgrade and then they don’t. They very much upgrade.”\n\n<b>“Heaven by Noon”</b>\nI had a title, ‘Heaven by Noon,’ and I brought it to Jessie Jo Dillon and Matt Jenkins. We wrote ‘Girl in the Mirror’ together, which is also a heart-wrenching song. So, I knew if we were going to write a heart-wrencher that I needed to have those two help me out with it. And we kind of used our own experiences in our own lives to write this song, but it was just the idea of when you lose someone, you don’t know it’s going to be the last time. A lot of people don’t know this, but my uncle died on 9/11, so I thought about my aunt when I was writing that song because the last thing they talked about was an oil change. And that’s probably not what she would’ve wanted to say to him if she knew it was going to be the last time.”\n\n<b>“Hell of a Show”</b>\n“It was a situation that I was in for a while, and it was—I knew it was toxic. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it got to a point where I wrote it as a poem in the back of my bus right after a show, and then I picked up my guitar because my guitar was still onstage or whatever, so I didn’t have it. But then I picked up a guitar and put a melody to it after. It was just one of those situations where I’m like, ‘I have a sold-out tour. It’s my debut album, sold out. People are showing up at 10 am. They’ve got shirts on. It’s like everything I’ve ever wanted, and I am crying before I go onstage because of an asshole.’ And it’s like, ‘You are ruining good moments for me.’”\n","short":"Three new tracks help answer her second album’s central question."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/am-i-okay-ill-be-fine/1769716112","playParams":{"id":"1769716112","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0AqurYcKg73g81nADrFcyY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769716112/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552469569","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552469569?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728027055184,"RTCI":0}}},"1770123579":{"id":"1770123579","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770123579?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chromeo/5523592","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Adult Contemporary (Deluxe)","artistName":"Chromeo","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9e/d4/8e/9ed48efe-b07f-36de-c940-5ba30abdb8e0/4099964126631.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"c7c6cc","textColor2":"fdb677","textColor4":"d09768","textColor1":"f2f0f6","bgColor":"1a1b29","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/adult-contemporary-deluxe/1770123579","playParams":{"id":"1770123579","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/29j75DpDX2eiFEIK8Jc3Y8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770123579/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5523592","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5523592?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728050540708,"RTCI":0}}},"1770340621":{"id":"1770340621","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770340621?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eslabon-armado/1482429034","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c7/b0/42/c7b042b7-2c0e-7a66-b499-c1ad41472e68/c67a9f06-64c4-4a36-b68c-ef0b52e2406b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"272420","textColor2":"121213","textColor4":"34302c","textColor1":"020305","bgColor":"bda88f","hasP3":false}},"name":"Amor Perdido","artistName":"Eslabon Armado","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/08/c0/c0/08c0c0dd-3798-e004-b53c-6f3f24860e56/474.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e1cb7e","textColor2":"f4d488","textColor4":"d9be78","textColor1":"fee490","bgColor":"6e6536","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"Eslabon Armado fans are used to a reliable flow of annual projects from the música mexicana stars. After a relatively muted year and a half, <i>Amor Perdido</i> arrives just in time for cuffing season. Following 2023’s guest-heavy <i>DESVELADO</i> and its corresponding smash hit “Ella Baila Sola,” this demonstrably more concise and intimate effort largely puts leader Pedro Tovar back into the spotlight to shine on his own. Beyond impressive appearances by Gabito Ballesteros on the empowering single “La Fresa” and ERRE on the far gloomier “Bandolera,” <i>Amor Perdido</i> returns focus to the band’s central voice over a series of covers and originals. Opener “Faldita” provocatively propositions a night of unbridled passion, while “Tú Me Encantas” offers romantic sentiments in place of merely lustful ones. Reinventing a Banda El Recodo de Cruz Lizárraga signature, they strip down “Me Gusta Todo de Ti” to its heartfelt core. That method similarly serves “Cinco Minutos,” a Gloria Trevi single transformed from a sleek pop-rock bop into something more muted and earnest.","short":"Matters of the heart drive the música

beats she has been spinning for her eager crowds. “This month’s mix casts a spell right from the start with a hypnotic track from Lucinee’s latest EP, ‘Drift,’” she says. “From there, it’s pure energy, with A*S*Y*S delivering a powerful rework of the iconic ‘Acid Phase,’ one of my all-time favorite French techno anthems from the ’90s. That ’90s vibe pops up throughout, especially on tracks from KI/KI and SWART. Bringing things right up to date, I’ve featured ‘Croton,’ the latest release from fellow Belgian producer Milo Spykers, and one of the biggest tracks I’m playing this month. To close out the hour, I’ve dropped in something fresh from me called ‘Falling for You.’ If you’ve caught me live recently, you’ll recognize it—so many of you have been asking for the ID, and now here it is.”","short":"Plug into the “pure energy” of the Belgian DJ’s thumping techno

Album","standard":"Ariana Grande is used to being in the spotlight, but over time, she’s gotten savvy at playing it. The pop star’s seventh studio album <i>eternal sunshine</i>—a lightly conceptual riff on the head-spinning 2004 film starring Jim Carrey, of whom Grande has said she’s a lifelong fan—feels like a mind game itself, blurring the lines between real-life references and theatrical bits. It arrives in the middle of a whirlwind tabloid-packed stretch—Grande married, divorced, and scored a starring role in Hollywood’s big-screen adaptation of <i>Wicked</i>—and she knows fans have questions. What’s true? What’s real? Ari gives a lot of things on this album, but answers aren’t one of them, a cunning reminder of how little transparency celebrities actually owe us. \n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Grande leans into the project’s thematic murkiness. “true story,” she says, is “an untrue story based on all untrue events,” and when asked about her own experience with the Saturn return, an astrology milestone referenced in the album’s only interlude, she shrugs. “It was chill. Nothing changed. Pretty uneventful.” She says she finds freedom in art because “you can really pull from anywhere,” and she describes the film as another “lovely costume” to wear. Her answers have flickers of defiance that feel like power. Whoever said albums had to be tidy, or true? “It doesn’t have to be an everlasting love story,” she tells Lowe. “Love is complicated. Showcasing both sides of it is what I tried to [do].” \n\nIf there’s one thing these tracks make clear, it’s that she’s still Ari on the mic—she’s still hitting those high highs (“eternal sunshine”); still finding release on the dance floor (“yes, and?”); still sifting gold out of ’90s R&B (“the boy is mine”), a sequel to the leaked 2023 track “fantasize.” Her favorite? “imperfect for you,” a tribute to the friends who make up her inner circle. “We’re so lucky to have loved ones who are accepting and real with us no matter what,” she says. “We live in a time where everything is boiled down, but that song demands room for nuance, humanness, and complexity.”\n","short":"A conceptual hat tip to the 2004 film about consuming, complicated love."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eternal-sunshine-slightly-deluxe-and-also-live/1771037153","playParams":{"id":"1771037153","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3L2iweH45rVdTBPldbY6dp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771037153/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"412778295","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/412778295?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728044416577,"RTCI":0}}},"1771071408":{"id":"1771071408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771071408?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-19","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/prospa/962366708","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Keinemusik Radio: Prospa (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Prospa","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e5/d0/60/e5d06086-6388-4a1d-0942-3cd922fea064/093c5ebc-d1c5-4865-9815-b12ba2c6eaf7.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"644539","textColor2":"462416","textColor4":"674b3f","textColor1":"421c0f","bgColor":"efe6e0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/keinemusik-radio-prospa-dj-mix/1771071408","playParams":{"id":"1771071408","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771071408/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"962366708","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/962366708?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728017567589,"RTCI":0}}},"1771105978":{"id":"1771105978","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771105978?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tee-grizzley/1177271472","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bc/56/8f/bc568f34-a414-2956-16be-d878519e2a54/c1efdb15-9afe-4a4b-8069-01842610bb21.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8b5af","textColor2":"f6b984","textColor4":"cb976d","textColor1":"f2ded6","bgColor":"1f1111","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/be/7d/ca/be7dca6a-02ca-e17c-83c8-bee9207cb2d5/702c8369-df97-4a39-bf16-cf48fbae4966.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afb8c9","textColor2":"b8c9ef","textColor4":"96a4c6","textColor1":"d7e2f4","bgColor":"0e1220","hasP3":false}},"name":"Post Traumatic","artistName":"Tee Grizzley","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fd/c8/da/fdc8da62-c337-3d66-b95e-f94a285508f8/075679629272.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d1d5","textColor2":"ffff05","textColor4":"d0d10d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"161d31","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After 2023’s <i>Tee’s Coney Island</i> scored him his second Billboard Hot 100 career hit in the R&B-infused “IDGAF,” Tee Grizzley was once again primed for big moves. So, it makes sense that the Detroit rapper would subsequently lean into high-profile collaborations with J. Cole on “Blow for Blow\" and Future on “Swear to God” in the lead-up to <i>Post Traumatic</i>. Spanning two dozen tracks, the sonically diverse album finds him comfortable yet resolute over homegrown Michigan beats while thriving across styles from rugged trap to even poppier hybrids.\n\nStarting with an intro that recalls the energy of his original breakthrough “First Day Out,” <i>Post Traumatic</i> projects his potent blend of genuine lyricism and authentic street themes at nearly every turn. He approaches the game from a heightened vantage point on “Deposits Crazy” and flexes with a vengeance over the Wheezy-helmed “We Dem.” Forever tied to the trenches, he adds two more installments to his fan-favorite “Robbery” series. With the benefit of his status, he drops the sort of wisdom that comes only from experience on “Blueprint,” its buoyant groove a reprieve from the record’s predominantly dark sound.\n\nBefitting the wide range of instrumentals, Grizzley similarly casts a national net for the album’s features. He goes in with West Memphis’ own YTB Fatt on the menacingly boastful “You Hear Me,” elsewhere adding to the thug-love canon with Chicago mainstay Tink on “Ride or Die.” Though many of the guest
