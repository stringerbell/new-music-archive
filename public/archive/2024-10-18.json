Epilogue","artistName":"Dean Lewis","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Eight years after his first single and five after his debut album, <i>The Epilogue</i> marks the end of Dean Lewis’ first era as an artist as well as a significant revelation: “My whole philosophy changed when I realized I spent the last eight years chasing success,” the Sydney-born singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “I attached my self-worth to the numbers. How the songs are doing, if the shows are selling out, how my TikToks are doing. I fell into that trap. So this album is me saying goodbye to that whole period of my life.” \n\n“Waves” and “Be Alright” were multiplatinum, chart-topping singles that appeared in TV shows and advertisements, got remixed and covered, and earned Lewis a global fanbase, but that isn't the kind of success he's looking for with his third album. “I don’t need a song to go viral, and viral doesn't necessarily even mean it's good,” he says. “Social media gave me a second chance, so, as much as I appreciate it and I’m used to it, I just want to release great songs. Instead of focusing on constantly selling myself, I'm more interested in the stories, the world of the songs.”\n\nIt's those songs and stories that resonate most on <i>The Epilogue</i>. Some are about specific people, like old friends and past lovers. Elsewhere, he draws personal experiences together to tell something broader, but no less meaningful. “I'm writing songs that I want people to hear about my life in the most specific ways,” he says. “People won’t connect to music if it’s just for them, because you can’t only write for other people. It’s got to be about you.” Read on for more insight into select tracks on Lewis’ third album.\n\n<b>“Empire”</b>\n“I wanted it to feel like you're in a cabin on a hill and the wind is hitting it hard. I started with the percussion, the knee tapping. The song is actually about my best friend who I lost my relationship with. She supported me through everything, helping me with my vision, my photos, the TikToks, what song I should release, what style. She gave up so much of her life, and she eventually wanted to go and pursue her own dreams, and I think she felt a bit trapped. So the song is me saying, ‘Go and achieve your dreams on your own, and if the wind ever breaks down your windows, I'll be here to help if you need me.’” \n\n<b>“All Your Lies”</b>\n“It’s about fake friends, about realizing that not everyone has the best intentions, being a little bit too trusting. It's about wanting to just get away and drive into the hills. You don't always realize that not everyone has the best intentions. It’s about a few things—two-faced friends, people that you think are your friends and they're not really. Business things as well. You get taken advantage of, people want to make money from you. It's about a lot of different things in life and wanting to go, ‘I just want to make songs, man. I don't care.’ I'm not a flashy guy. I don't go to events, I don't care about anything like that. I just want to get away and write songs.”\n\n<b>“Memories”</b>\n“It’s also about losing my relationship with my best friend, but it was at a different sort of stage. When you just know it’s kind of done, but you can also look back and say, ‘Wow, we had a great time and these memories are going to stay with me forever. We've gone our separate ways, but I appreciate all that time that we had together.’ It’s a really special one for me.”\n\n<b>“Trust Me Mate”</b>\n“It’s another one of those songs where I combined a bunch of things, including some stuff that had happened to me and one of my brothers. You know that feeling of telling a friend to not give up? With my career, there’s been so many times where you go up and down, go up and down. You don't stay hot forever and you don't stay at the bottom forever. And it's really good to have friends who will say, ‘Hey, it's going to be okay.’ Sometimes that's all you need. For me, so many times in my life, you think negatively about something and then someone will go, ‘Here's the brighter side,’ and I’ll feel better. So that song is really about friendship, hope, and not giving up on yourself or your friends.” \n\n<b>“Clélia's Song\"</b>\n“Clélia was like a sister to my brothers and me. She passed away and I wanted to write a song for her. In the lyrics, I say, ‘You're driving the long way around, I'll see you again sometime.... Pick up, pick up, pick up.’ It’s like, how do you feel? You're lonely. It's just a beautiful song I wanted to write about her and let her know that we're all thinking about her.”\n\n<b>“The Last Bit of Us”</b>\n“I wrote my whole second album about one girl. I think it's hilarious and embarrassing, but it’s the truth. This is me saying, ‘This is the last song I'm going to write about you and about us.’ It was interesting, because I knew it was the last one, and it was a choice. It’s also about the very last time you hug someone and you say goodbye, so I tried to describe that feeling. I’m really proud of the songwriting in this one, especially the way that it builds in the end with this big instrumental crescendo.”\n","short":"“I just want to release great songs,” says Lewis on his next era."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0e/7e/82/0e7e82bc-1174-62d6-0d0f-902e62ddad1d/24UMGIM61314.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ddceb8","textColor2":"e4d2b7","textColor4":"ccbaa1","textColor1":"faebd3","bgColor":"6c594a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-epilogue/1750233540","playParams":{"id":"1750233540","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5PaINdUpmQ34V0zbg26xlj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1750233540/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"779085108","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/779085108?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729252142237,"RTCI":0}}},"1751042421":{"id":"1751042421","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751042421?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lp-giobbi/1370207121","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/2b/a3/de/2ba3de7d-490a-6b4e-791d-d7921b9d4896/Jobf5632042-ca8b-4dc8-9fa5-96886a5fb28a-170860784-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332640750_1817980542-Time1719491093679.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","1f1c12"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"17160e"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"464316","textColor2":"1f1c12","textColor4":"464319","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"17160e","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/20/af/ed/20afed9c-7a2a-bf92-1500-a7ec23446c02/7e2bfe49-dae0-4b21-9b58-2d810582af7b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4f4437","textColor2":"372c1d","textColor4":"584e41","textColor1":"2c1f11","bgColor":"ded8d1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/66/04/ea/6604ea0b-c752-94eb-9593-6a652eee4afc/Jobd2f59e7b-3f9b-4c53-a9d2-55f83bd78c05-170860785-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_332640751_1817980541-Time1719493092303.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f08e30"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"17160e"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cacf34","textColor2":"f08e30","textColor4":"ce7e2d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"17160e","hasP3":false}},"name":"Dotr","artistName":"LP Giobbi","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/61/eb/fa/61ebfacf-de41-2be5-078a-69b8b69c1c3e/5054429195736.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"3c3409","textColor2":"161100","textColor4":"403a06","textColor1":"100903","bgColor":"ebe020","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dotr/1751042421","playParams":{"id":"1751042421","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4XyaObpQDL61LtLerqAeHx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1751042421/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1370207121","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1370207121?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258106429,"RTCI":0}}},"1752182297":{"id":"1752182297","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752182297?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical","Violin","Orchestral"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=372544258-672409-1075191751","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/33/0a/3f/330a3f9f-5ec1-5ebd-af22-5630a5078d19/6e6068f0-24a1-4dd2-8bf8-4363db8025ec.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e7d2ca","textColor2":"f5ece9","textColor4":"e4cbc1","textColor1":"faf5f4","bgColor":"9f4625","hasP3":false}},"name":"Player 1","artistName":"Ray Chen, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra & Cristian Măcelaru","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Ray Chen articulates many emotions on his eclectic album of themes from film, television, and video games, but one feeling that binds them all is a sense of nostalgia. “Everything here is something that I’ve loved since I was a kid,” the Taiwanese Australian violinist tells Apple Music Classical. “That influence on me has been huge and has shaped me into the person that I am today.”\n\nThe yearningly reflective track “Sadness & Sorrow” reflects his memories of the Japanese anime TV series <i>Naruto</i>. Then there’s his fondness for the console video game <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i>, the theme of which rubs shoulders here with the music from Pokémon. And at the centre of the album is Erich Korngold’s cinematic Violin Concerto, which Chen studied with the great Aaron Rosand at the prestigious Curtis Institute: based on the composer’s own film scores of the 1930s, it is an orchestral masterpiece rich with Romanticism and an air of longing.\n\n“Korngold was the, one could say, ‘Original Gangster’ film score composer, who brought the tradition from Europe to Hollywood,” says Chen. “He has influenced so many others, like John Williams, and across different genres too, including animation, anime, and gaming.” As with the anime and film scores, Chen embraces a narrative approach to the Korngold, imagining scenes for each movement in his interpretation of the Concerto. The first, he says, is incredibly romantic: “it’s a lush environment, and you’re there and nature is blooming,” he says. \n\nThe second movement is “looking up at the stars—it’s very wistful, a sense of yearning for someone far away. It’s like that long-distance relationship type ‘Are you thinking of me as I’m thinking of you?’” The third movement, he says, reminds him of cowboys, “but then there’s some sort of space element, probably because I always associate it with John Williams’ score for <i>Star Wars</i>. It’s like <i>Indiana Jones</i> meets <i>Star Wars</i>.” \n\nAlso featured on the album is the wistful <i>Serenade</i>, an original work by LA-based composer Eunike Tanzil, whom Chen first contacted after watching her “Hum Me A Melody” series on Instagram, in which she asks people on the street to sing a melody that she then transforms in her studio into a fully orchestrated short score. When it came to the <i>Serenade</i>, explains Chen, he approached the music the same way that he approaches online content creation. “The first five seconds had to grab people’s attention,” he explains, “and we wanted to imagine how people will use this audio on social media. But instead of simply coming up with a melody, we thought, ‘OK, let’s imagine something romantic. People are having a dinner date—they’re in Europe, something like that.’ That’s how we arrived at this waltz.”\n\nFor a concert violinist who has won the prestigious Yehudi Menuhin and Queen Elisabeth music competitions, these shorter pieces hold little technical challenge for Chen (“being a classical musician prepares you for the worst!”). But the melancholic theme tune from the TV series <i>Squid Game</i> was a late addition to the album, leaving Chen with little time to prepare. “Once you get in that mode and you stop taking a whole year to learn one concerto, you start to be able to do it on the fly,” he says—helped, no doubt, by his online practice challenge: to learn and record a piece of music in 30 minutes…\n\nIt’s just one of the ways in which Chen has matured and adapted to the digital age as a violinist. “As classical musicians we always start at the traditional point,” he says. “You learn the tradition, you learn through the most conservative approach. But then as the years go by you see how you fit in.”","short":"Ray Chen: “Everything here is something I’ve loved since I was a kid.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ec/ef/2e/ecef2e30-aaa3-0791-7cc6-1ba6ea1ac3d4/24UMGIM60171.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"241522","textColor2":"100a11","textColor4":"2d1c2f","textColor1":"040000","bgColor":"a467aa","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/player-1/1752182297","playParams":{"id":"1752182297","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wdjgUrGbKbMOCx7SkPdgl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752182297/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"372544258","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/372544258?l=en-US"},{"id":"672409","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/672409?l=en-US"},{"id":"1075191751","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1075191751?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729242148209,"RTCI":0}}},"1752717854":{"id":"1752717854","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752717854?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-malombo-jazz-men/1752717518","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Castle Lager Jazz Festival, 1964 - EP","artistName":"The Malombo Jazz Men","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/93/d3/a9/93d3a99b-c237-47f9-b174-2052af8ba1e2/4062548085730.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ab956a","textColor2":"d4924c","textColor4":"ab7a42","textColor1":"d5b47e","bgColor":"071b1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/castle-lager-jazz-festival-1964-ep/1752717854","playParams":{"id":"1752717854","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752717854/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1752717518","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1752717518?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729224922641,"RTCI":0}}},"1752949407":{"id":"1752949407","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1752949407?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-linda-lindas/1525944355","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/22/f3/88/22f388ab-cebf-8d32-7b58-2ff94da626d3/ff4dc536-16d8-4589-bb8a-94a6e01b242f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac6f59","textColor2":"e85242","textColor4":"ba4236","textColor1":"d68b6e","bgColor":"050203","hasP3":false}},"name":"No Obligation","artistName":"The Linda Lindas","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The feted family band expands its rock sound on a raw, alive second album.

After spending time as the bassist of the noisy British indie-pop outfit The History of Apple Pie, she took an abrupt left turn into electronic territory with 2017’s self-titled debut album, which melded brainy production with melodic pop gewgaws delivered straight from the Welsh singer-songwriter’s pipes. 2020’s <i>Inner Song</i> and the 2022 follow-up <i>LP.8</i> ventured further into strange territory, the former featuring a cover of Radiohead’s “Arpeggi” and a feature from art-pop luminary John Cale—but nothing she’s done previously can prepare you for the total rush of her fourth album <i>Dreamstate</i>. Owens’ music has always been body-moving even at its most abstract, but on her inaugural bow for the 1975 production impresario George Daniel’s dh2 imprint, she heads full-on into big-room territory—think miles of pulsing synths, dewy rhythmic stretches lovingly ripped from trance’s fabric, and a distinct psychedelic flavor.\n\n<i>Dreamstate</i> is, in its essence, a capital-B big-sounding record, with guest turns from the type of folks—The Chemical Brothers, Bicep, and Daniel himself all pitch in on programming and production—who know how to play to massive crowds looking to feel something. But the sound of this record retains the trademark wispy intimacy that Owens has proven so good at, launching her to the forefront of electronic pop alongside fellow sneaky-smart dance-pop alchemists like Jamie xx, Caribou, Floating Points, and HAAi. \n\nThe lush, soaring build of “Higher” dissolves into the type of pulsing synth line that you can practically feel in your bloodstream, while “Air” packs a four-to-the-floor punch as her vocals aerate the neon house-music surroundings. Owens’ pop sensibilities, which she’s cloaked in mysterious left-field sonic shapes in the past, are more present than ever before: Witness the arpeggiated ascent of “Rise,” which features a lovely vocal sigh reminiscent of Kate Bush’s “This Woman’s Work,” or the bell-clear sincerity of “Ballad (In the End),” the most straightforwardly vocal pop cut of the bunch.\n","short":"Her fourth album

high school dropout, hustling mixtapes at raves in Midwestern warehouses and cornfields. She broke through as a DJ in Chicago, the birthplace of house music, before skyrocketing to global fame with a deep-rooted sound that stood in welcome contrast to the bro-y, commercialized EDM of the early 2010s. <i>Godspeed</i>, her debut album, is the long-awaited product of nearly a decade of work (though it’s preceded by <i>Club Future Nostalgia</i>, her 2020 remix album with Dua Lipa). Its 24 tracks play out like a raw, euphoric crash course in house music history, from the Uffie-led “Tom’s Diner” riff “Serotonin Moonbeams” to the propulsive Kylie Minogue collab “Edge of Saturday Night” to the triumphant “We Still Believe,” which recruits Chicago house pioneer Jamie Principle for an acid-tinged homage to Frankie Knuckles’ Warehouse.","short":"The DJ’s debut LP is the

Each track works as a stand-alone statement of Joy’s talent, but also as part of a greater whole that honors the jazz tradition.\n\nOn opener “You Stepped Out of a Dream,” best-known from the 1941 film <i>Ziegfeld Girl</i>, Joy steals the show with her scale-hopping vocal performance, showcasing her deepest registers and heavens-reaching falsetto alike. It’s a stunning display, but throughout <i>Portrait</i>, Samara Joy is more interested in honoring these compositions with thoughtful, inventive arrangements than showing off her voice—which speaks for itself.","short":"Contemporary jazz’s breakout star lives up to the hype."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0a/c8/a6/0ac8a6e3-bdf0-76dc-3f18-3839d27e2e73/24UMGIM79187.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2f27","textColor2":"0f1115","textColor4":"30342e","textColor1":"0c0a0b","bgColor":"b5c096","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/portrait/1761436800","playParams":{"id":"1761436800","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7sH4icMotSET9zBcbR5Gz4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1761436800/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1538636625","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1538636625?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258023399,"RTCI":0}}},"1762067288":{"id":"1762067288","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762067288?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["New Age","Music","Electronic","Ambient"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=81033834-794271843","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"earthly","artistName":"Peter Phippen & Ivar Lunde, Jr.","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/27/f5/f5/27f5f5a8-8938-7397-b3e1-762ab045526c/24925.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfd8d4","textColor2":"e8dcc7","textColor4":"c0bcb4","textColor1":"fbfff0","bgColor":"204066","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/earthly/1762067288","playParams":{"id":"1762067288","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1jBA8QCjHyosdzj0C2ljP3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762067288/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"81033834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/81033834?l=en-US"},{"id":"794271843","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/794271843?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729185670192,"RTCI":0}}},"1762862368":{"id":"1762862368","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1762862368?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Crossover Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eyolf-dale/307984532","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Space Between Two Notes (feat.

On “That’s a Mistake,” a warm and tender track with ’90s Tim McGraw vibes, Green runs through a laundry list of minor miscalculations—forgetting to get an oil change, perpetually running late—before revealing the kind of misstep that leaves a lasting impression: a romantic one. It’s an understated opening to Green’s boldest release yet, one that finds the Alabama-born star pushing himself as both a songwriter and a vocalist. Standout tracks on the record, which follows 2023’s <i>Ain’t My Last Rodeo</i>, include “Turnin’ Dirt,” a laidback ode to blue-collar life, and “Don’t Mind If I Do,” an emotional duet with country singer-songwriter Ella Langley. The record wraps with the hit song “Worst Way,” a soulful solo write that shows off Green’s sultry side.\n\nGreen wrote four of the album’s 18 tracks by himself, telling Apple Music that he’s unlocked a new level of artistry since reframing his approach to his songwriting process. “When I was a kid, I always thought [writing a song] was a lucky thing,” Green says. “You had those one-hit wonders, and to write a hit song seemed like, ‘Well, sometimes you just get lucky, or you get in the right room, or have the right idea.’ And when I started thinking about songwriting as something that you could get better at, like a skill, it really changed my whole mindset on it. It just motivated me to write better songs and write songs that people connect with.” Below, Green shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“That’s a Mistake”</b>\n“I grew up listening to a CD from front to back. I don't know that everybody does that anymore, but it's certainly a way I like to do it. And I always try to schedule my songs on my album for that reason. But it's just such an easy listen. I can remember when the song—it sounds like it ends. I didn't want it to end, and then it keeps going. And the whole time I was just into it. And it's tough, with a song that's kind of down or midtempo like that, to keep somebody's ear that whole time. But I just love that song and the vibe of it. And I thought that was a cool way to start the record off, and then, we bring it back down at the end.”\n\n<b>“Turnin’ Dirt”</b>\n“It's a strange thing when you cut outside songs, for me, because I haven't really done that a lot. I write so much of my own music. But I cut songs that sound like something I would write, that I just didn't write. ‘Turnin’ Dirt’ is one of those. It sounded like I wrote that song. People would argue with you that I wrote it, probably.”\n\n<b>“Chip Off the Ol’ Block”</b>\n“I love writing songs that are common sayings, especially Southern country sayings. So ‘Chip Off the Ol' Block’ is writing a song about my dad and the ways that we're similar, writing in a fun, lighthearted way. But I wanted to do it like The Band, Levon Helm, something kind of swampy. There's a song Lynyrd Skynyrd had called ‘Made in the Shade,’ and it is that kind of thing. So, I'm glad it came out that way and it's got a different feel than a lot of stuff I have, too.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Mind If I Do” (feat. Ella Langley)</b>\n“All the duets that I really loved growing up, you always wondered, ‘Is there something going on?’ or whatever. And I think, as a fan, you like for stuff to be true. When you hear a song, it's a love song, and that's what made George [Jones] and Tammy [Wynette] so big, I think, is that all their songs were about what was really going on. And then, when they split, George is still writing these lovesick heartbreak songs. So for me and Ella to have two songs we do that are doing that much, I'm sure there's a lot of rumors and speculation, but it's cool, man. It's cool to see people react and have emotion to something that you write. More than anything, that's what's enjoyable about it.”\n","short":"The Alabama songwriter brings a fresh touch to classic country

To The Plains (Apple Music Edition)","artistName":"Wyatt Flores","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Wyatt Flores has a complicated relationship with his home state of Oklahoma. On his debut full-length album, the Stillwater-born singer-songwriter contends with the complex and often violent legacy of his birthplace—detailing his feelings with clear-eyed vulnerability on the opening title track: “Tumbleweeds were free like the Choctaw and Cherokee/Before they had to call this land their home.” It’s a simple but evocative lyric, and the song’s production underscores the darkness at the heart of the track with big, thick electric guitar riffs and whining fiddle. Flores tells Apple Music that one of his main goals on this record was to write with a sense of simplicity, to stop overthinking things so much and commit his ideas to tape. “It’s really just taking a step back from trying to be a perfectionist and just be like, ‘No, this is just art and this is where it is. Say what you want to say and then get out,’” he says. “‘Get out of your own way.’”\n\nThe rest of the record—produced by The Texas Gentlemen’s Beau Bedford and recorded in short bursts in Asheville, Nashville, and Los Angeles—similarly pulls no punches, whether Flores tackles heartache (the crunchy heartland rocker “The Truth”) or youthful abandon (“Stillwater,” which gives Flores a chance to indulge his grungier side through sneering vocals and moody production). Like he did on the album’s predecessor, 2024’s <i>Half Life</i>, Flores also confronts his own mental health on <i>Welcome to the Plains</i>, like admitting to an ex-love on the loose and jangly “Oh Susannah” that he “was a problem only tryna be the cure.” Flores balances out some of that heaviness with moments of levity, though, like the winking “When I Die” line “When I’m in the ground/If I hear you talking shit/I hope I get the chance to be a ghost and scare your kids.” That juxtaposition between darkness and light epitomizes the tension that makes Flores’ songs so compelling. “Most of these songs still have double meanings to them,” Flores adds. “Which is the fun part for me, just because they’re so simple but there’s so much meaning behind them.”","short":"Wyatt Flores: “Most of these songs still have double meanings to them.”"},"artwork":{"width":3711,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/9d/bb/3b9dbbda-ba3b-44da-89fc-67b9a803e735/24UMGIM88096.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3711,"textColor3":"afadb3","textColor2":"f25c26","textColor4":"c44b20","textColor1":"d8d7de","bgColor":"0c0807","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-the-plains-apple-music-edition/1764589150","playParams":{"id":"1764589150","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1764589150/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1563146833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1563146833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729246333380,"RTCI":0}}},"1765019010":{"id":"1765019010","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765019010?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/becky-g/550411604","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3a/be/11/3abe110c-865f-2319-cbba-5cee1b1dbb7e/10bc6c42-f524-48a1-8d45-09c665f1ce95.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b1927b","textColor2":"daa57b","textColor4":"b48a67","textColor1":"d6af94","bgColor":"1d2018","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6f/8f/26/6f8f2660-9094-4121-ff65-84efdb33a443/3b8eced9-9853-4117-91d1-432ab346c024.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cdc5be","textColor2":"d7cbc7","textColor4":"beb0aa","textColor1":"ebe5e0","bgColor":"58453a","hasP3":false}},"name":"ENCUENTROS","artistName":"Becky G","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Becky G’s love for música mexicana used to be one she kept to herself. Prior to 2023’s ambitious <i>ESQUINAS</i>, the Mexican American superstar had largely limited her Spanish-language work to the pop and reggaetón spaces. Yet as corridos and other related styles surged into the mainstream as part of a genuine, youth-driven movement, her ultimately perfectly timed album transcended the trends to reveal not merely a devotion to this music but a proficiency within it. Triumphant after the warm reception the project received, she returns roughly one year later with the like-minded <i>ENCUENTROS</i>. Less a follow-up than a companion to its predecessor, the 16-song effort finds her eagerly exploring cultural heritage while making history of her own. \n\nThroughout <i>ENCUENTROS</i>, Becky G expresses herself over themes familiar to música mexicana listeners across generations. The unresolved heartache of “COMO DIABLOS” and the jilted lover’s one-upmanship of “DESIERTO” each contribute to a wider romantic canon full of passion and pathos alike. Hardly limited to one particular format, she demonstrates diversity without losing credibility, as authentically herself over the cumbia throwback “OTRO CAPÍTULO” as on the sad sierreño cut “XLAS NUBES.” Analogous to the corridos tumbados scene, her “VISTO CARO” name-drops luxury brands with the added authenticity of having plenty of firsthand experience with them. When she’s singing from the bottom of a bottle on “OJALÁ” or the more pensive “ULTIMA VEZ,” her sincerity always shines through. Along the way, she recruits genre hitmakers like Tito Double P and Óscar Maydon, who bring their specific strengths to “CRISIS” and “MERCEDES,” respectively. \n","short":"The bilingual superstar continues her música mexicana journey."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1e/41/90/1e4190e8-db11-0471-3c59-2758ff8e2d37/196872411256.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"373939","textColor2":"223642","textColor4":"475a63","textColor1":"0e0e0e","bgColor":"dce8e6","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/encuentros/1765019010","playParams":{"id":"1765019010","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Q2RSXigUcxzMKHzVYiyHw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765019010/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"550411604","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/550411604?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258436028,"RTCI":0}}},"1765216142":{"id":"1765216142","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765216142?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joy-oladokun/699636664","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/23/be/7d/23be7df6-02ec-5856-42c4-04175a85d9c5/5ec83dab-1cd6-4f88-9a82-2407e7fbf318.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfbdbf","textColor2":"d2d0d0","textColor4":"abaaaa","textColor1":"eae8ea","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d7/bf/26/d7bf26b0-7511-4db6-73a0-382a711f5dd3/3b51c283-c0fa-4b17-bf07-fa66fe82c421.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c9c9c9","textColor2":"f4f4f4","textColor4":"c9c9c9","textColor1":"f4f4f4","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/34/6c/b7/346cb7b2-abea-ebb7-0187-c54fc8f42345/47b5fc81-3c22-4007-97be-7469af63af42.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"e3e3e3","textColor4":"b5b5b5","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"OBSERVATIONS FROM A CROWDED ROOM","artistName":"Joy Oladokun","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Few artists have as keen an eye for human complexities as Joy Oladokun. The Arizona-born singer-songwriter has shown her incisive side on songs like the 2023 Noah Kahan-featuring <i>Proof of Life</i> favorite “We’re All Gonna Die” and the inspiring 2021 <i>in defense of my own happiness</i> cut “look up,” doing so with compassion and self-awareness. On this outing, which she produced herself, Oladokun turns that sharp intuition inward, pondering her place in a world that feels increasingly inscrutable. \n\nThat introspection can sound confused and adrift, like on the breezy but questioning “AM I?,” or determined and purposeful, as on the sweetly defiant “flowers.” “I’D MISS THE BIRDS” feels like a thesis statement for the record, with Oladokun admitting she’d like to ditch the “Proud Boys and their women” and a “world on fire” in favor of peace, quiet, and acceptance in nature. Oladokun wraps the record with “GOODBYE,” a quietly epic ballad with soulful, old-school production and wrenchingly emotional vocals.

He’d become famous enough to watch his backstory become a punchline and his likeness parodied by Justin Timberlake on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. (Timberlake would attempt to borrow the same mystique for his 2018 album, <i>Man of the Woods</i>.) You can understand why Vernon would want to change the subject for a time.\n\nFor nearly a decade, he’s obscured some part of himself, hidden behind symbols and numbers, bandannas and bandmates, vocoders and vast collages of bleep and bloop—not to mention a still astonishing list of celebrity collaborators to whom he’s been more than happy to cede the limelight, Taylor Swift chief among them. The three-song <i>SABLE,</i> EP is immediately notable because it finds Vernon running it back, returning to the sound and feel that launched his career, singing in the first person. It’s a deliberate move away from the maximalist collage of 2019’s <i>i, i</i>.\n\n“When I made this song, I was feeling a lot of guilt,” he told an Eras Tour audience of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in 2022, before playing “S P E Y S I D E,” a song that sounds here as though it could have been lifted from the <i>For Emma</i> sessions—just him and his guitar and his hurt, his falsetto slicing through a layer of strings. “I know that I can’t make good,” he sings. “How I wish I could.” On “AWARDS SEASON,” all you hear for its first and final minutes is Vernon’s voice amid a mist of ambient synth. There is nowhere to hide. “What was pain now’s gained,” he sings. “You know what is great? Nothing stays the same.”","short":"Justin Vernon goes back into the woods."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/65/71/5a/65715a12-957f-00fd-7eb0-1333dd915af5/48091.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cf806f","textColor2":"ff8d74","textColor4":"cf735e","textColor1":"ff9d8a","bgColor":"110d04","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sable-ep/1765298404","playParams":{"id":"1765298404","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765298404/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"273428126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/273428126?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258008019,"RTCI":0}}},"1765330470":{"id":"1765330470","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765330470?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yonathan-avishai/386882075","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Shapes and Sounds (feat.

/ Exhale","artistName":"RÜFÜS DU SOL","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After releasing their fourth album <i>Surrender</i> in 2021, RÜFÜS DU SOL declared it “the end of a chapter for us as a unit.” After years of living in their adopted hometown of LA, its members (Tyrone Lindqvist, Jon George, and James Hunt) relocated to Encinitas and Miami. As the group crafted <i>Inhale / Exhale</i> over the next two years, the physical separation required them to carve out time for joint writing sessions, where they reconvened in places such as LA, Austin, and Ibiza. “We really made the most of those two-week stints,” George tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “We were in a really good creative flow. We were reconnecting and particularly reconnecting in the studio more than ever.“ \n\nWhen “Music Is Better,” the album’s lead single, arrived in June 2024, it marked RÜFÜS DU SOL’s triumphant return. Its joyful chorus—“Music is better when we’re together”—seems as much a love song as it is a celebration of the creative magic they find when sharing a physical space. Those feelings of joy, love, and gratitude run throughout <i>Inhale / Exhale</i>, a lighter turn from its predecessor’s darker and more introspective themes. A new relationship sparks promise “burning as bright as the sun” on opening track “Inhale,” while love’s stars align on “In the Moment” and the mood slinks towards carnal on “Levitating.”\n\nMirroring their nomadic creative process, RÜFÜS DU SOL covers more sonic ground outside of soaring melodic house. “The Life” transports them to colder climes through rumbling bass and crisp percussion, followed by the fuzzing rock edge of “Pressure,” and “Edge of the Earth” pulls from driving trance. There are quiet moments, too, on the reflective “New York,” where the sparse drums resemble a heartbeat, and the ambient “Exhale,” where digitized vocal harmonies offer the album’s serene exit. “We’ve been pushing the boundaries of what the expressions of our music looks like, trying different tempos, trying different beat expressions, things that are beatless,” Hunt says. “And so I feel like this album that we’ve created is way more dynamic and it reflects that we’re more liberated.”\n","short":"The trio returns with a lighter tone and a more nomadic creative process."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ec/84/37/ec843709-82ed-c6db-a635-ffafc79b0456/093624842989.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"261d20","textColor2":"050405","textColor4":"261e21","textColor1":"040304","bgColor":"ad8690","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/inhale-exhale/1766410595","playParams":{"id":"1766410595","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Fda4vhPP0Clk3EQNVipUP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766410595/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"799587823","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/799587823?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258049432,"RTCI":0}}},"1766751997":{"id":"1766751997","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766751997?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Vocal Jazz","Music","Jazz","Contemporary Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jane-monheit/1931881","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c1/b1/30/c1b130a7-8415-5c93-229b-35eb1f2b6b80/Jobd0cea475-7b5f-42dc-90f7-ae5ed8b5ec45-175611764-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_342741957_1893713484-Time1726300610618.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b0b7cd"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c2bcbb","textColor2":"b0b7cd","textColor4":"8d92a4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/79/a6/ad/79a6ad8d-c2b6-4824-95ec-1e349873bc85/Job0faba36e-4c0d-4d5e-8826-68151ecdc14f-175611765-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_342741956_1893713485-Time1726301737647.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cea08d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"9197a3","textColor2":"cea08d","textColor4":"a68072","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Jane Monheit","artistName":"Jane Monheit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7a/d9/0d/7ad90d49-ba55-51fe-ffc1-61315d98abc7/643157454144.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"baa18e","textColor2":"dcb59b","textColor4":"b1927d","textColor1":"e8c8b0","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jane-monheit/1766751997","playParams":{"id":"1766751997","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4EDzxNlpd2K2lbfdGW1rSU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766751997/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1931881","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1931881?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729233437116,"RTCI":0}}},"1766920942":{"id":"1766920942","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766920942?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lojay/1151631485","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Falling/Unleash -

The Princess of Pop’s 2023 record—her 16th—met the moment and set the mood, captured best by “Padam Padam,” the unexpectedly viral hit that ruled over summer ’23 in what will always be known as the “Padamic.” Released just over a year on from that record, this sequel is a celebration of that career high—and a collection that feels primed to get the party started again ahead of 2025’s global <i>Tension</i> tour. \n\n<i>Tension II</i> lives in the same world as its predecessor, but here, things feel darker, clubbier, later-night. And as for all the original’s sexual tension? It <i>still</i> hasn’t been broken. Across these tracks, Kylie’s overpowered by “electric energy” (on the disco-laced, ABBA-recalling “Taboo”) and “raw emotion” (“Kiss Bang Bang”); by 4am, she’s even standing outside someone’s door on the rushing “Hello,” unable to stay away. If on <i>Tension</i> Kylie felt ultra-confident, here she feels liberated, throwing off an ex on the dance floor (“Who would think that losing you would be so much fun?” she muses on “Good as Gone”) and declaring her desires outright. “Do you have someone for me?/To be the one/To turn me on/That’s what I need,” she demands on “Someone for Me,” a moment so evocative you can almost see her hiding in a dark club corner, waiting for that wish to be fulfilled. \n\nAt last, nine tracks in, she finally dials things down, with the end-of-the-night almost-ballad “Shoulda Left Ya,” on which she realizes things have become a little less no-strings-attached with someone she’s met on the dance floor. Still, she’s not hanging around. Next, she brings new partners into the <i>Tension</i> world: the artists—including The Blessed Madonna, Orville Peck, and Sia—who she worked with on a series of genre-hopping collabs in 2024. Their inclusion serves as a reminder of Kylie’s continuing pop power in an era that confirms that, 37 years into her music career, there’s still nothing this pop princess can’t do.

Major chart moments like “La Diabla” and “La Victima” at the end of 2023 set in motion a momentous rise for the Mexican American singer, his tumbados románticos style resonating for obvious reasons. Several—though conspicuously not all—of his accumulating 2024 hits and fan favorites appear alongside brand-new tracks on <i>NEXT</i>, an album that serves as a snapshot of his success so far. With seemingly autobiographical corridos like “La Diosa” and “Peak” in the mix, he mirrors the attitude found on the previously released “Corazón de Piedra” or “Poco A Poco.” Proving ever adaptable to whatever the situation may require, he approaches matters of the heart with doe-eyed tenderness on “La Luna X Mi” and brusque desire on “Que Hay Que Hacer.”","short":"A snapshot of the música mexicana rising star’s success so far."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a0/c1/94/a0c19462-1ce2-b932-c4d8-1a16f2eea5b6/198704160332_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"e2cacd","textColor2":"fccdae","textColor4":"e6a78e","textColor1":"f7f8fd","bgColor":"8e110f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/next/1769098029","playParams":{"id":"1769098029","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1bWcE0tKOJgn4kgpNKSHU0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769098029/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1525566726","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1525566726?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729240895103,"RTCI":0}}},"1769454777":{"id":"1769454777","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769454777?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/glorilla/1441017729","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/09/f4/92/09f492e5-231e-8c24-6a28-2cece98d321a/Job0dbaa573-6f54-4739-a43e-8fcc41f44689-176361584-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_344441459_1905762717-Time1727401569855.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e57f4f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c27148","textColor2":"e57f4f","textColor4":"ba6741","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/91/3a/af/913aaf29-872a-1698-bfff-6ec59c33cba3/0a5b4a67-8039-493f-868e-8b04b87b8010.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e59471","textColor2":"f7ad85","textColor4":"e38e6d","textColor1":"f9b48a","bgColor":"931410","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d1/62/4d/d1624d6b-96b4-2bcf-c6bf-f1a4af411cc9/Job47fb7bed-063d-43d3-8f62-d271dea9b272-176361585-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_344441460_1905762718-Time1727403089255.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e4894d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c6794e","textColor2":"e4894d","textColor4":"b97040","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cc/ee/c9/cceec9df-048b-2b35-6bbd-890a3a228074/db6b1fbf-9a5d-4bfe-835d-fc21927beb3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dfb895","textColor2":"fdb581","textColor4":"e2a073","textColor1":"fad4ac","bgColor":"734a3a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/20/c9/aa/20c9aa90-f250-7bae-68b8-1cb0e89afd2f/f4a0ddb2-4527-45ad-ba21-346c6a98019d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dc8f8b","textColor2":"f39b94","textColor4":"db7f7a","textColor1":"f5afa9","bgColor":"7a1010","hasP3":false}},"name":"GLORIOUS","artistName":"GloRilla","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The scrappy Memphis rapper has been on a two-year victory lap since her 2022 breakthrough hit “F.N.F.

The glow-up is real on <i>GLORIOUS</i>, her official debut album, but let it be known that the reigning queen of crunk is still hanging out the window with her ratchet-ass friends when the opportunity arises. \n\n“It’s 7 pm Friday/It’s 95 degrees/I ain’t got no n***a and no n***a ain’t got me,” she declares in the opening bars of “TGIF,” a worthy “F.N.F.” follow-up made for blasting at max volume. There’s plenty of the rowdy girl-power anthems fans have come to expect from Big Glo, among them the bad-bitch motivational “PROCEDURE” with Latto and “WHATCHU KNO ABOUT ME,” a Sexyy Red collab that riffs on the Trill Entertainment classic “Wipe Me Down.” Less expected is “RAIN DOWN ON ME,” a gospel number with a blessing from Kirk Franklin, though it’s really only fitting for a rapper born

To The City Volume One","artistName":"Robert Glasper","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Only on Apple Music","standard":"When acclaimed pianist and composer Robert Glasper began amassing recordings from his now five-years-strong “Robtober” residency at New York City’s famed Blue Note jazz club, there was no plan beyond keeping a record of the magic that’s sure to unfold whenever Glasper’s friends and collaborators join him onstage. Had he been more prescient about curating a selection of these performances for a project like <i>Keys to the City Volume One</i>, he might have realized the treasure trove of material he was sitting on.\n\n“It’s like five years [of recordings],” he tells Apple Music. “You got to think, it’s two sets each night for a whole month. And when I first started, I only had one day off, so I was doing six days a week the first few years. And so many people come in. I looked up the scheduling of who I had on the bill that the audience knew of—that’s one thing—but there were so many people that just popped up on us. So many of those kinds of moments.” In the end, Glasper chose nine standouts.\n\nThe set list runs the gamut of what audiences might encounter on a given night, with Glasper having selected performances of songs you’re unlikely to hear elsewhere. They include versions of The Roots’ “Step Into the Realm” featuring Black Thought, Outkast’s “Prototype” as sung by Norah Jones, a cover of Chick Corea’s “Paint the World” featuring Thundercat, a particularly dialed-in arrangement of Glasper’s early-career Mulgrew Miller tribute “One for Grew,” and an impossibly groovy revamp of Ready for the World’s “Love You Down” sung by the voice we hear on all three of Glasper’s 2024 Apple Music collaborative projects, Meshell Ndegeocello. “She’s an icon,” Glasper says. “And just one of the greatest artists, in my opinion, ever. I don’t think she gets as much flowers as she should.” \n\n<i>Keys to the City</i>’s sole original composition, “Didn’t Find Nothing in My Blues Song Blues,” features improvised singing from Esperanza Spalding, and plays—with its lighthearted onstage banter and meandering storyline—as something Glasper says is exemplary of the Robtober vibe. “[It] shows the other side of us—the pure, unadulterated—just two personalities with their instruments, jazz cats,” he says. “It felt so cool, so natural. She was just like, ‘Hey, you want to do a blues?’ I was like, ‘Cool,’ and then we just started. We never rehearsed it. She didn’t know what she was going to say. That’s why I called it what she said, ‘Couldn’t Find Nothing in My Blues,’ because it was literally made up in the moment. Those are cool things, because it takes courage to put shit out that you didn’t plan.”\n","short":"Better with friends: an exclusive collection of Glasper’s favorite collabs."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1d/fd/1f/1dfd1f67-983e-102d-382e-0f684e0afadb/24CRGIM45756.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"7992cb","textColor2":"81aaf2","textColor4":"6d90cd","textColor1":"90adf0","bgColor":"1e253b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/keys-to-the-city-volume-one/1770172836","playParams":{"id":"1770172836","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770172836/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4643652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4643652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729257958780,"RTCI":0}}},"1770241936":{"id":"1770241936","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770241936?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Ambient","Music","Electronic","Worldwide"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1590474126-1732190715","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Outré Day Spa","artistName":"Haitch Music & Desmond Bagely","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/19/37/cb/1937cb30-3dc5-8a00-3487-7d55184f7a60/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdb449","textColor2":"ccb2a3","textColor4":"a49185","textColor1":"ffde59","bgColor":"080e0e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/outr%C3%A9-day-spa/1770241936","playParams":{"id":"1770241936","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/665kqfjn2eJlfXvV0W5U86"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770241936/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1590474126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1590474126?l=en-US"},{"id":"1732190715","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1732190715?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1728608653784,"RTCI":0}}},"1770382117":{"id":"1770382117","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770382117?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jamie-miller/381183610","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Long Way Home","artistName":"Jamie Miller","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The pop riser explores highs and lows on an emotionally eloquent debut."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b9/c2/54/b9c25489-6957-2697-cb98-626f45d28491/4099964122961.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9764b","textColor2":"e77d59","textColor4":"c1694d","textColor1":"f18e57","bgColor":"2a161c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/long-way-home/1770382117","playParams":{"id":"1770382117","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3MmEb9UgXMbg02WG29sE3a"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770382117/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"381183610","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/381183610?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729241436618,"RTCI":0}}},"1770417497":{"id":"1770417497","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770417497?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kaleena-zanders/438767588","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Glorified -

The 11-track album bridges the time before Lia’s medically necessitated hiatus and after. The first half of <i>GOLD</i> offers six new tracks, including double lead singles “GOLD” and “Imaginary Friend,” while the final five songs—“BORN TO BE,” “UNTOUCHABLE,” “Mr. Vampire,” “Dynamite,” and “Escalator”—are rerecordings of songs released without Lia on ITZY’s January 2024 EP <i>BORN TO BE</i>. This time, they include all five members, and are identified as “final versions.” \n\n<i>GOLD</i>’s new tracks are a return to performance powerhouse form for ITZY. JYP Entertainment tapped two high-profile hitmakers, Ryan S. Jhun and Dem Jointz, for “GOLD,” the high-energy title track that opens the album, promising in a synchronized member chant that “day and night we beaming, blazing just like that.” Second lead single “Imaginary Friend” is more straightforward in its pop ambitions and more unique in its lyrical metaphor, comparing K-pop’s parasocial relationship to a comforting childhood imagining: “When there's monsters on your ceiling/I'll keep you safe so you can dream.”\n\nCatwalk-ready “Bad Girls R Us” returns to the swagger (“A star that will never lose/I will brighten up the night of your heart/Bounce along with the rhythm”), while “Supernatural” sings about wanting something beyond the realistic. Stray Kids’ rapper-producer Changbin, a fellow fourth-generation JYP Entertainment idol, features on and co-wrote the hip-hop B-side “VAY,” offering advice to maturing listeners: “Yesterday was yesterday and today is today/Past failures are a guide to success/Like walking up stairs/Go to the next level.” “FIVE” brings it back to the members of ITZY: “We will be we/Forget yesterday and jump/Let’s fly high in the sky with me/Fly one more time, trust in each other.” Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna, reunited “bright like dynamite GOLD.”\n","short":"The K-pop girl group

His first album, 2023’s <i>Amar</i>, established him as a bona fide star, but rapping is no longer his main focus. BigX is a proud father of two, and everything he does (rap included) is to give his children things he was never afforded. On 2024’s <i>TAKE CARE</i>, he makes clear where his priorities lie.\n\n“My kids is what drives me,” he tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “That’s the reason when I’m tired and I get up every day when I don’t want to get up, they’re the reason.” This album, as such, is for the next generation. Yes, he raps his ass off and showcases why he’s one of Texas’ most celebrated stars, but more important than acclaim and fame is making sure the mouths that rely on him are adequately fed. “My little boy, he made me realize, ‘Okay, life is for real. This is a real thing.’” \n\nThat seriousness makes its way onto <i>TAKE CARE</i>, like on “Therapy Session.” X showcases his signature Southern drawl over cheery piano chords, stinging handclaps, and soaring guitar solos. He lays out the stakes for the entire record, paying tribute to his two children: “My family rely/When I be away from ’em I cry/’Cause I love ’em the most, I’d hate for them ever to say that their daddy wasn’t right on they side,” he raps. “I feel like I see the whole world,” he says. “I really understand why we’re here.”\n","short":"One of Texas’ most celebrated stars is doing it for the

outdoor party, Open Air, where sets from the label’s crop of forward-thinking dance-floor talent lit up Finsbury Park in North London. Jody Wisternoff & James Grant have regularly been a highlight of the annual event and 2024 was no exception with the pair welcoming the evening in by dropping tunes from Simon Doty, Dosem, and Overmono & The Streets, alongside remixes of Ariana Grande, CHVRCHES, and Orbital as well as some of their own edits and reworks. “It’s always a pleasure to play to a hometown crowd, and performing alongside this amazing lineup in Finsbury Park this summer was no exception,” says Grant. Take yourself back to an uplifting day—and night—in N4 here.","short":"Hear the duo lift a hometown crowd in North London."},"artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/dc/0d/ca/dc0dca5f-39a7-23ce-7bf8-68bbac0d5d53/20866af6-58ff-446d-abe0-d268b934e754.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2000,"textColor3":"dbc2ae","textColor2":"f2dac5","textColor4":"d3c3aa","textColor1":"fcd9ca","bgColor":"566640","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/james-grant-jody-wisternoff-open-air-london-2024-dj-mix/1772136929","playParams":{"id":"1772136929","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772136929/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"33105350","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/33105350?l=en-US"},{"id":"1453598666","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1453598666?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729208307110,"RTCI":0}}},"1772341702":{"id":"1772341702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772341702?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Christian","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jackie-hill-perry/895014562","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/cf/0e/b2/cf0eb243-7c24-0426-5fcc-bf8943e726c8/Jobcb9930a7-6bb4-499f-990f-cdef8320f210-177451884-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346676938_1923501634-Time1729022602606.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f90b0d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"2e5778"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c6ae84","textColor2":"f90b0d","textColor4":"ca0d10","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2e5778","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/32/d9/a6/32d9a653-5d64-a625-0e9a-35d79fc25a39/6be0a2c0-b905-4872-9f74-b2b80f718426.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8cb98","textColor2":"97c0cd","textColor4":"7ea2ae","textColor1":"f3f4b2","bgColor":"1b2934","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/1c/ca/b1/1ccab1a0-e49b-f14a-adcd-6f655f65e710/Jobd003870f-6c3f-41d4-a9aa-0705410e422e-177451885-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346676939_1923501635-Time1729024358218.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"ccab7f","textColor2":"f3a76c","textColor4":"ca8a5a","textColor1":"f5d099","bgColor":"271715","hasP3":false}},"name":"Practice","artistName":"Jackie Hill Perry","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9c/01/06/9c01066c-60e9-6ad5-1e9b-b73cf696d9b2/962.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbad80","textColor2":"f3a86d","textColor4":"ca8b5b","textColor1":"f5d39b","bgColor":"271716","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/practice/1772341702","playParams":{"id":"1772341702","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/12lqoAlRSEuk75PSe1xAmm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772341702/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"895014562","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/895014562?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729233042084,"RTCI":0}}},"1772346149":{"id":"1772346149","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772346149?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-18","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chino-pacas/1666295765","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/be/b1/bd/beb1bd20-463e-1011-26c0-2d3d0a4f4c9e/a92714d5-ed42-4c6d-b645-6e9ce627b560.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d3d4d3","textColor2":"ececec","textColor4":"cecece","textColor1":"f3f4f3","bgColor":"535353","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9a/cc/6a/9acc6a81-1b39-ec12-d6cd-bf46db84d80e/ef084040-2b71-428e-a010-4627bbc6533d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c4ab93","textColor2":"efc58e","textColor4":"c5a477","textColor1":"edcfb0","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/44/c8/24/44c824d5-4b03-1b20-8a8b-0a3b1880d6a8/767fcc94-a065-4969-81c7-70488d59a096.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5c5c5","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"c2c2c2","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"161616","hasP3":false}},"name":"Que Sigan Llegando Las Pacas","artistName":"Chino Pacas","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Everything happened so fast,” Chino Pacas tells Apple Music. “It’s been a short while, but even my voice has changed. The transition of adolescence has become noticeable.” Cristian Humberto Ávila, the boy from Apaseo el Alto, Guanajuato, was only 16 when he decided to record his first song: “El Gordo Trae El Mando” was a corrido that someone had commissioned from him, and he decided to share it online on a whim. Soon after, he had signed a record deal and collaborated with major genre artists, and his future seemed bright. “<i>Ya no la bajo y ni pienso bajar</i> [I’m not going down, don’t even think about it],” he sings on “Dijeron Que No La Iba Lograr,” a statement of purpose that is now confirmed with the release of his first album.\n\nOn the day of his 18th birthday, Pacas dropped <i>Que Sigan Llegando Las Pacas</i>, his full-length debut and an official landing in the major leagues. The album assembles his most notorious songs—both by him and his musical allies—as an emerging corrido star, showcasing a talent in full bloom. “I spent a year and a half on it,” he says. “I had about 50 songs, 30 of which had been recorded, but went through the process of selecting only our favorites.” All the initial viral hits are here, but also future classics like “Mami Chula,” his most experimental track to date, and a much anticipated collaboration with Drake on “Modo Capone,” featuring Fuerza Regida. The singer talked to Apple Music about some of the key songs on the album.\n\n<b>“Smith” feat. Fuerza Regida & Junior H</b>\n“This is one of my favorite songs. It kicks off with the sound of an opera and the voice of my buddies Junior and Jesús [Ortiz Paz]. It’s such a great track. We premiered it at the Rolling Loud festival, then played it in Houston, and the response was amazing. We were missing a collaboration with Fuerza Regida, and Jesús offered this song that had already been recorded with Junior. We’re really happy with the result.”\n\n<b>“Morena Canela”</b>\n“This song is dedicated to all people, but mostly to dark-skinned girls. It delves into a more romantic vein that I hadn’t explored before. We started to experiment, and this is what we came out with. My friend Armenta wrote it, and I did the vocals. I had never performed this kind of material before; ‘Qué Onda’ is the only one that comes close.”\n\n<b>“Pues Podemos” feat. Turo Pacas</b>\n“A killer track that we worked on with my blood brother, Turo Pacas. We always wanted to record something together, did a few tracks but waited to put out a really good one. This one was done over a year ago. We kept it under wraps for a while. Few people knew about it, and we didn’t share it on social media or anything. I liked that we split the songwriting 50/50. I wrote the part that I’m singing, and he did the same. It’s like a fusion of our brains.”\n\n<b>“Modo Capone” feat. Fuerza Regida & Drake</b>\n“This is one of the hardest corridos I have. It features Drake and Fuerza Regida, two of the greatest stars in the American music business. We recorded it in Houston, and the process was lightning fast. We spent less than 30 minutes recording Drake’s voice; Jesús and I gave him some guidance. It was a bit difficult for him, but that's to be expected since he doesn't speak Spanish. That said, it flowed quite smoothly.”\n\n<b>“3 Letras (OVO)”</b>\n“This is a corrido that we wrote especially for Drake with various artists from the label. He gave me the info, and we came up with this. Some people may not get all the references, because it has some specific words in English—nods to the Drake persona. We did several versions and improvised three variations of the original story. He liked all three, but this was his favorite.”\n\n<b>“Mami Chula”</b>\n“I like that it has a bit of an urban tinge. We did a full reggaetón version and decided not to release it, even though that was the original genre. We transposed it to the guitar and it stayed like that. I’ve never put out a reggaetón track, but we’re now working on that with different artists. The second volume of this album will probably include some reggaetón.”\n\n<b>“Otra Vez Pegue Un Vergazo”</b>\n“This one is recent. It preserves the sonic identity that marked my beginnings, about a year and a half ago. It’s not that long, but time flies, and you can even hear the changes in my voice. The transition of adolescence has become noticeable. This is one of the few tracks that has my early voice.”\n","short":"“Everything happened so fast.” Mexico’s teen corridos phenom drops his debut."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/c1/64/c1c16434-3330-07b8-9bdf-649ca34f8b48/198704068560_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"cecdcd","textColor2":"d1ce6f","textColor4":"aaa75b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0e0809","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/que-sigan-llegando-las-pacas/1772346149","playParams":{"id":"1772346149","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2cdyBzD4njuK2dRKSbBSMV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772346149/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1666295765","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1666295765?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258570139,"RTCI":0}}},"1772368554":{"id":"1772368554","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772368554?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rod-wave/1140623439","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/75/7c/a0/757ca08d-cd84-079c-4944-4a571c6b9524/Jobeb44196b-5926-43d7-bf1c-9f4461c4ca75-176992232-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345820238_1916168350-Time1728406803834.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","dd9a63"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"191e20"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d0be89","textColor2":"dd9a63","textColor4":"b57f53","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"191e20","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/71/12/5d71128d-8e2d-746c-f386-8ab728a6ba47/24ff4d02-b210-4259-aff4-cf4424517bd3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6c6ca","textColor2":"d6b8a2","textColor4":"af9684","textColor1":"f4f5f9","bgColor":"110c0d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f8/ba/a5/f8baa504-2c76-6226-3c62-d4aec3a2afb7/Job8a0b0da8-da8a-401d-a87f-c6dd279b3183-176992233-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345820237_1916168349-Time1728408757881.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e38a65"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"191e20"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bfa89e","textColor2":"e38a65","textColor4":"ba7354","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"191e20","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6b/92/ad/6b92adfe-f238-7ed4-bb2b-644e5fdc21ba/f9ac759a-189d-4aea-9ae8-b45720fc9fdd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c8bd9b","textColor2":"f9d1ad","textColor4":"d4b497","textColor1":"eadcb3","bgColor":"41403e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2e/19/cd/2e19cd31-6252-0657-60d0-ebb6c2e0fa72/8b75276d-adad-47bd-9bed-693f1254d228.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"aba9a2","textColor2":"d7bbaa","textColor4":"b0998c","textColor1":"d1d0c6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Last Lap","artistName":"Rod Wave","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"No matter how hard he appears to try, Rod Wave seems unable to escape the sadness. As the veritable king of pain rap, the St. Petersburg, Florida, artist has frequently sworn off the emotional depths that came to define his catalog, only to return to this thematic well again and again to produce masterful works born of hard times and mired in misery. As such, the trap-soul hybrids his fans continue to expect and, perhaps, demand from him persist on his sixth studio album <i>Last Lap</i>. Case in point: The finality implied by its title runs counter to the title track’s closing refrain, his inability to let go less a choice than a calling. \n\nFrom the very beginning, Rod shows that he’s still wrestling with demons. Opener “Turtle Race” mourns the lost while fretting over fresh woes, not the least of which being an ominous interaction with law enforcement. “Federal Nightmares” furthers the narrative as he watches loved ones ensnared by a carceral system while wondering if he too will be harmed or even destroyed by it. \n\nNot surprising given the gravity of its contents, only a few vocal guests get to enter his inner sanctum this time around. Lil Yachty and Lil Baby trade knowing verses with their peer on the unfiltered “Fuck Fame,” while Rylo Rodriguez shares some experiences worth processing on the frank advice session “Jersey Numbers.” Thankfully, a hopeful streak emerges now and then to counter the anxious gloom, evidenced by the heartfelt declarations of “25” and the powerful positive thinking behind the gospel-tinged “The Best.” No passive figure in his own story, he strikes back against hater mentalities on “Apply Pressure” and jet-sets defensively on “Passport Junkie.”\n","short":"On his sixth album, the king of pain-rap bares his soul again."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5a/37/da/5a37da14-dea1-6123-6553-4a24010657e8/196872534610.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfa99d","textColor2":"e28b63","textColor4":"b97353","textColor1":"e9cebf","bgColor":"161514","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/last-lap/1772368554","playParams":{"id":"1772368554","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ffJTc6OVVJ7rr65r5CGbq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772368554/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1140623439","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1140623439?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729258362321,"RTCI":0}}},"1772394609":{"id":"1772394609","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772394609?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tyla/1552925732","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/ce/d6/4d/ced64d1a-fea3-5464-5b9b-2731c095be08/Job7268db01-279e-4620-b83f-952dfbc40dac-177192243-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346185803_1919444419-Time1728665836943.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fa8e69"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"131a14"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"58c5d1","textColor2":"fa8e69","textColor4":"d4835f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131a14","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/8a/9c/0a8a9cdb-2658-f5b7-c492-6ea7b58b8d36/3f25f69d-6ec1-4910-a1e4-0d833225eaa0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"261711","textColor2":"060201","textColor4":"271811","textColor1":"040101","bgColor":"af6f51","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3a/1a/fe/3a1afe8f-f4ab-7096-1f4c-fa6414e9bc95/Jobe8a27cfd-9465-4893-b493-0d3f08e0e804-177192244-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_346185802_1919444420-Time1728667497761.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"16dad5","textColor2":"98e5ff","textColor4":"81c5d5","textColor1":"11ffff","bgColor":"294830","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/f2/fe/52f2fe56-e9e9-ff2d-a2ed-4884ded47f97/434af226-0ccf-4f00-969f-9dd86f9bd712.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c69d77","textColor2":"dcb08d","textColor4":"b39374","textColor1":"f4bb92","bgColor":"0d220d","hasP3":false}},"name":"TYLA +","artistName":"Tyla","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"“I've always wanted to be a pop star, but beyond that, I wanted to be an African pop star,” Tyla tells Apple Music. “The roots of my sound are in amapiano music, in South African and African music.” Though the megaviral 2023 single “Water” may have put the South African singer-songwriter on the proverbial map—first as a social media sensation, then as the highest-charting African female soloist ever on Billboard’s Hot 100, earning her the inaugural Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance—she’s been carefully plotting her path to the top for years. “Since I started experimenting with amapiano, I just feel like it's really helped me get to this point where I created something that is fresh and new, but still familiar and comes from home,” she says. “It's a sound of Africa, and it's something that I couldn't be more proud about.” \n\nShe weaves through a blend of pop, R&B, amapiano, and Afrobeats (“pop-piano sounds cute,” she admits) across <i>TYLA</i>, a coming-of-age chronicle through love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. “I’m speaking about the things that I've gone through while creating the album—basically three years in the making,” she explains. “I was becoming a woman. So it was a lot of growing that happened, and me realizing my worth, and realizing how I want to be treated—and how basically, I'm that girl, and people need to know I'm that girl.”\n\nWhile the project was brought to life with the help of global producers including Sammy Soso, Mocha, Believve, Rayo, and Sir Nolan, Tyla made sure they all had a taste of her homeland. “[It was important] to bring some to South Africa,” she explains, “so when we get in the studio, they have context. Some people that try amapiano sound so watered down, it's cringey. So even though I am mixing it with pop and R&B, I didn't want it to sound watered down. Music is our everything in Africa. The way we speak, the way we dance, literally, our dance moves—they come so naturally. It's just in us. It’s our essence.” \n\nReleased in October 2024, the deluxe edition, <i>TYLA +</i>, adds three new tracks, including “PUSH 2 START,” the R&B-heavy “BACK to YOU,” and “SHAKE AH,” a blistering amapiano production brought to life with help from genre stars Tony Duardo, optimist, and Maestro Fresh-Wes. Below, Tyla talks us through key tracks from the album.\n\n<b>“Intro” (Tyla & Kelvin Momo)</b>\n“I wanted to start off my album with something that was truly South African, something that showed people the root of where I started, before ‘Water,’ before all of these mixtures. I secretly recorded a voice note when I was in a session with Kelvin Momo. I loved hearing the people in the session, speaking, hearing the language, the accents. It was so raw and real. Kelvin Momo is my favorite amapiano producer—his music and his sound is my heart.”\n\n<b>“Safer”</b>\n“The message of the song is something that I feel like a lot of people could relate to. And the energy of the song I feel like is a strong intro to open an album.”\n\n<b>“Water”</b>\n“‘Water’ surpassed all expectations. I could've never expected all of these accolades—a Grammy, the Billboard Hot 100, people all over the world dancing and pouring water down their back. From the time I finished recording the song, it was all that I was listening to. It was also like a step away from what I was used to, because I [had been] <i>very</i> PG. And with this one, I was more grown up and I was experimenting more. And even though I don't enjoy vulgar music, I feel like we were able to make the song speak about what it speaks about, but in a way that's friendly.”\n\n<b>“Truth or Dare”</b>\n“This was the song where I was playing more house-y with it. It’s me calling out people, being like, ‘Hey, <i>now</i> you care.’ I'm not that type of person, but these are feelings that I felt around the time where I'm like, ‘Where did this person come from? Out of nowhere, you want to now talk to me?’ and I literally hate it. I'm sure a lot of people have felt that.”\n\n<b>“No.1” (feat. Tems)</b>\n“Tems and I had been wanting to make a song for long now. We ended up making it work, and Tems' voice alone is so amazing, so unique. The song is for everyone, but when I had it in mind, it was really for the girls—me and Tems, girl power, African girls—and we were just really pushing that message of ‘I'm leaving. I don't need anybody. If this is not serving me anymore, I’m gone, and I'm going to be okay.’ Always put yourself before anything.”\n\n<b>“Breathe Me”</b>\n“It's a song that's so emotional and so real. It's just about love, of how strong love is, and how you don't even need anything else. I don't need anything else. You don't need anything else—just me, and you; just breathe me and we'll be fine.”\n\n<b>“Butterflies”</b>\n“With ‘Butterflies,’ I was in a session with [producer and songwriter Ari PenSmith] and he was playing me some stuff that he's worked on, and I was like, 'Cool, cool, cool.' And then he played this, and I fell in love with it. It sat so perfectly with my voice. I connected with the song instantly, and it was too specific to what I was going through to not do anything with it.”\n\n<b>“On and On”</b>\n“This was [an initial] version of my sound, before ‘Water’ and everything. I made this with Corey Marlon Lindsay-Keay in South Africa. We were supposed to go out, and we didn't end up going out, so I was dressed up in a whole outfit in the studio session, and he was producing. I love the song so much because it's so nostalgic but new. I love that it feels like old-school R&B. I love that it has hints of Aaliyah's influence, but it's new, and fresh, and African—all things that are Tyla. The messaging is not so serious—it’s literally about not wanting a party to end.”\n\n<b>“Jump” (Tyla, Gunna & Skillibeng)</b>\n“‘Jump’ is a very different vibe. I really just wanted to tell people who I am, and I had to show my confidence through the song. And the opening line, with Skilli being like, 'Original girl, you want a replica? No.' There's no replica. That intro was already perfect, and it segues to that line of me saying, 'They've never had a pretty girl from Joburg/They see me now and that's what they prefer.' That line is just—it’s too iconic for me, and I'm just so excited to hear all the girls sing it, all the Joburg girls sing it, all the girls from home. And having Gunna on it, I really feel like it took me into that world further, making it even more raw and cool.”\n\n<b>“ART”</b>\n“When I'm with someone that treats me so good, treats me well, treats me like art, treats me like a princess, I will be there for them. I will be their art piece. We also played with that wording where it can be ‘art piece,’ but also your peace and your comfort. As a woman, that's how I want to be treated, and that's how I would treat you if you treat me that way. It’s about being treasured.”\n\n<b>“On My Body” (Tyla & Becky G)</b>\n“This was such a fun one because it’s in my world, but also I played a bit with the Latin vibes. The feature came so organically—I was in studio, and she was in a session next door. She loved it, and she recorded a verse, and I absolutely died. I died. I just love her touch, and how it just broadened the audience, because now it's just bringing everybody into this experience. It's a melting pot with all these genres, and I love that I was able to expand it even further.”\n\n<b>“Priorities”</b>\n“This song was probably the most difficult to share, because it's really letting people into my heart and mind, and how I feel I've been with myself. I feel like people would resonate with it, and it speaks about what a lot of people feel and may not express. [The idea of having spread yourself too thin] is something that's so raw and real, that not even just women, men, everybody feels.”\n\n<b>“To Last”</b>\n“I love this song with all my heart. I was in the Vaal with LuuDadeejay, and I literally finished this song in five minutes. It was based off an experience that my friend was going through at the time. About a year prior, I wrote the lines ‘You never gave us a chance, it's like you never wanted to last.’ And that note just came to mind, and the song just flowed out of me. I ended up going through something that made me feel that way. It was like I told the future, which is not good—but I fell in love with the song again. It’s so South African: It’s amapiano, it's house-y, it's our sound.”\n\n<b>“Water (Remix)” (Tyla & Travis Scott)</b>\n“Travis reached out—he loved ‘Water,’ and around the time, I was like, 'I don't want a remix, I'm cool.' But Travis Scott was so unexpected that I wanted to do it so bad, and he absolutely killed it. He added some South African shout-outs in his verse, and I just knew that people from home were going to love it—he acknowledged us, and he mentioned [the South African telephone country code] +27 and all those things. And I also love that he brought a different energy to the song. Everyone knows ‘Water’ to be that summer banger, and now Travis made it still the summer banger, but also more gritty. Putting him on an African-sounding song was just the perfect collab.”","short":"The amapiano sensation adds three fresh tracks to her

Lives","artistName":"Koe Wetzel","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"An “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality works well for some artists, but Koe Wetzel likes to take things apart. On his follow-up to 2022’s <i>Hell Paso</i>, the cult-favorite singer-songwriter finds fresh sounds with a new collaborator, tapping Gabe Simon (Noah Kahan) to produce a genre-bending album that’s also his most fun and freewheeling. “There’s different layers to who I am as a musician, as an artist, and I wanted people to see that from this record,” Wetzel says. “So, if they can come away from listening to the entire record, not just picking a couple songs apart and having their idea of it, [but] listening to the whole record and be like, ‘OK, now we get it a little bit more. Maybe he is a decent artist, a decent musician.’”\n\n“Decent” is an understatement, as Wetzel’s deep, rich voice and refreshingly cliché-averse songwriting make for some of the more interesting tunes coming out of the country genre. Highlights on <i>9 Lives</i> include the title track, with its stomping beat and an irresistible chorus hook, as well as “Leigh,” a clever, humorous tip of the hat to a popular variation on women’s names. Up-and-comer Jessie Murph lends her swagger to “High Road.” Wetzel includes two covers on the album, both from late artists: the hip-hop wunderkind XXXTENTACION’s “Depression & Obsession,” and beloved country singer-songwriter Keith Gattis’ “Reconsider.” Below, Wetzel breaks down several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Leigh”</b>\n“We had a list of names, probably 30 names, and it was like, ‘This would be really cool to write this song.’ And I think we started off as a joke, and then, once we got kind of into it, we were like, ‘This kind of slaps.’ I was like, ‘People are going to take this the wrong way. These girls are going to take all this stuff the wrong way.’ It was a fun song for us to make. And yeah, it’s kind of a diverse song. It kind of has its ups and downs, but it’s a fun song.”\n\n<b>“High Road” (feat. Jessie Murph)</b>\n“We went back on a past relationship that I had had a while back. And we just deep-dove into every detail of what would happen whenever we’d fight. And I would go back on past experiences of a certain fight or how I would react to it. Sometimes, I would be there. I’d be like, ‘Hey, if we’re going to do it, we’re going to lay it out there. Let’s do it.’ And then other times, I’d be like, ‘You know what? I’m going to let you chill out, and then I’m out of here.’ So, I don’t know. We just went around and around and nailed out all the details. And then this was another song that pretty much wrote itself pretty quick.”\n\n<b>“Reconsider”</b>\nI hope that I did the song justice, but rest in peace to Keith [Gattis] and to Charlie [Robison]. I’m a little upset that I never got to see [Gattis] while he was around. The influence that he had on so many artists in Texas and in Nashville and just country music in general, it’s crazy and it’s beautiful. I sent the song to Wade Bowen, and [Gattis] and Wade were really good friends. He left me a voicemail, and he was like, ‘Dude, I’m happy and I’m sad and I’m crying.’ He was like, ‘Dude, the song, it’s phenomenal. You killed it.’ Hopefully I did the song justice, but I just wanted to throw a little ode to Keith Gattis and Charlie for the record.”\n\n<b>“Last Outlaw Alive”</b>\n“[An] outlaw, for me, is people who blaze their own trail and [are] not going by the norm, not confined into what people think they should be or what music thinks artists should be, just doing your own thing and not giving a shit what anybody thinks about it. So, if we’re going to use it like that, then there’s a shit ton of outlaws in this genre, and just music in general. But yeah, there’s a lot of them around. I think it’s only, with the way social media and everything’s going right now, I think we’re in for a lot more of them to pop up.”","short":"The country rocker adds bonus tracks to his 2024

FALDA,” Myke Towers saw his career reach the sort of heights associated with pop stardom. Yet those who saw the Puerto Rican phenom’s prolonged rise through trap and, subsequently, reggaetón assuredly remember his streetwise roots. “My approach to making music remains the same regardless of my previous hits,” he tells Apple Music. “I am continuously making music and perfecting my craft.”\n\nWith the full benefit of his experiences, Towers engineered this informed return to form, resulting in one of the most gratifying projects of his career. Working closely with top producers like Full Harmony and Ovy On the Drums, and collaborating with a handful of esteemed vocal talents, he reinforces his strengths as both rapper and singer while still hinting at his expanding range. “It showcases an elevated version of my previous released music and sounds,” he says, a sentiment immediately felt on the hard-hitting opener “COMPETENCIA” and the immediately following “OTRA OPORTUNIDAD.” “This album portrays the best version of me as an artist.”\n\nBuilding with others in Latin music has been core to Towers’ career, and some of his guests here speak to that aspect of his ascent. The slow-and-steady “AUNQUE LLEGUE OTRO” reunites him with his “La Curiosidad” cohort Jay Wheeler, while Bad Bunny’s unmistakable presence on the shape-shifting “ADIVINO” echoes their previous collabs like “Estamos Arriba.” Relative newcomers like música mexicana sensation Peso Pluma and rising Bronx rapper NTG add to the auspicious nature behind <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>, the former soaring with him on “SE TE NOTA” and the latter helping him take it back to the block with swagger for “LA PRIMERA VEZ.” \n","short":"An aggressive expansion of the Puerto Rican phenom’s 2024

That’s part of why she’s done leading with fear on her stripped-down new record <i>The Secret of Us</i>. She tells Apple Music: “This album is kind of like the inner tornado, I guess, when you’re trying to present a way and then it just doesn’t actually really ultimately work.”\n\nSince Abrams began releasing music in 2019, the singer-songwriter has homed in on emotional leaps of faith, her tremulous vocals expertly evoking the tear-splattered diary scribbles a great young love inspires. On <i>The Secret of Us</i>, she takes stock of every crush and contradiction that led her to this chapter, reflecting the glow of formative past romances through soft prisms of pop, folk, and indie rock. The through line between these different shades of Gracie’s warm style, of course, is the kind of intimate writing she developed in a private journal long before songwriting with partners as esteemed as Aaron Dessner and Taylor Swift. “I think the most important thing with songwriting, and it’s what we really wanted to do with this album, is just if you can articulate a feeling,” Abrams tells Apple Music. “I’ve always worked with people who I genuinely love and trust. And so, it’s been such a privilege that that’s been the baseline for me, because I know that that’s a really rare thing for young musicians—for musicians, period.”\n\nAnyone who missed Abrams’ coveted stint as an opener on the Eras Tour will welcome Swift’s feature on “us.,” a soaring centerpiece addressed to an older partner Abrams can’t be sure ever took her seriously. She isn’t afraid to face the anxiety around her own legitimacy or face it alone—Swift is the only feature across these 13 tracks. (“She’s been an unbelievable friend to me,” Abrams says of Swift.) But between the cathartic power chords of “Tough Love,” the twinkling balladry of “I Love You, I’m Sorry,” and the delicate simplicity of “Free Now,” the real secret to Abrams’ success shines through in her craftsmanship: She’s as serious as it gets. “I hope I’ll always feel like I’m chasing the next best version or whatever I actually need for myself at any given time with each album that I’m lucky enough to make,” Abrams explains. “But this [album] just matched where I’m at in such a real way.”","short":"The singer-songwriter’s breakout gets four new songs and three live tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/26/78/81/26788143-5e5f-0813-2480-ecf4280ef221/24UM1IM07082.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"393943","textColor2":"160e09","textColor4":"433d39","textColor1":"0a0916","bgColor":"f8fafa","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-secret-of-us-deluxe/1773473685","playParams":{"id":"1773473685","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0hBRqPYPXhr1RkTDG3n4Mk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773473685/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1450554836","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1450554836?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1729252044695,"RTCI":0}}},"1773518270":{"id":"1773518270","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773518270?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":35,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-10-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/charli-xcx/432942256","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/63/51/b2/6351b2b4-5b1b-9257-22c3-aee7afb4bbe6/94209eab-3adc-48e8-8636-6afc4ac933bd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"212425","textColor2":"16191a","textColor4":"2b2f30","textColor1":"0a0b0d","bgColor":"7c8789","hasP3":false}},"name":"Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat","artistName":"Charli xcx","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Remix Album","standard":"Forget song of the summer—2024’s undisputed album of the summer (northern hemisphere version) arrived in early June with a slime-green album cover and wall-to-wall bangers that would launch Charli xcx’s career to stratospheric new heights. (Cue news anchors worldwide grappling with the sociopolitical ramifications of “being brat.”) For years, the self-directed English artist enjoyed a reputation buzzier than “cult favorite” yet not quite “main pop girl,” but with the release of her sixth studio album, she hadn’t just captured the zeitgeist—she’d become it.\n\nIf you didn’t see it coming, well, neither did Charli. “I really was preparing for this album to be for my fanbase only, and not really break outside the walls of that at all,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe with typical candor. Nevertheless, she presented the concept to her label with a manifesto she’d written—things she’d wanted to say since 2016’s paradigm-shifting <i>Vroom Vroom</i> EP. “‘On this record there’s going to be no traditional radio songs, because we don’t live in that world now,’” she told them. “This fanbase I have built is so hungry for me and my peers and our slightly-left world of pop/dance music—they’re hungry for us to succeed. That doesn’t mean that we have to do any pandering to any other side of the industry. We just have to do it for them because they’ve championed us for so long, and that’s all we need to light a fire.”\n\nNot content to rest while that fire’s still burning, Charli’s also committed to single-handedly keeping the remix industry afloat. You could call the full-length remix album yet another shrewd marketing move, though the project was in the works well before <i>BRAT</i> blew up. Here, a cross-generational who’s who of cool kids mingles in the smoking section of fall’s most exclusive party, where NYC garage-rock legends rub elbows with genuine pop divas and mystical Swedish rappers. And for all <i>BRAT</i>’s messy rawness regarding the complications of being a woman in the industry, the remix album brings together a slick-talking Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande at her glitchiest, Robyn flexing her ’90s bona fides, Tinashe basking in her own long-awaited shine, and naturally, the Lorde remix that broke the internet. Brat summer is dead.

Album","standard":"The enigma born Noah Olivier Smith—better known as Yeat, to use the word “known” loosely—broke through in 2021 as a maverick of rage-rap. These days, the 24-year-old exists in his own orbit entirely, recording and engineering his own songs that are possibly informed by extraterrestrial wisdom and rife with bizarro ad-lib soundscapes, dystopian-sounding beats, and non sequiturs that could either be profound or total nonsense. (And umlauts inserted where no one has ever dared to insert umlauts before, naturally.) The songs across his deep, curious catalog sound like World War 16 battle cries, or the moment a UFO beam makes contact with a cornfield, or the sound of an old world being replaced with a new one.\n\nYeat’s known (again, loosely) for his strange preoccupations: sui generis slang terms, face-shielding headgear, bells and flutes. <i>LYFESTYLE</i>, his fifth studio album, shows off a handful of new obsessions: telling lies, gazing with wonderment at lights, threatening to cut people’s heads off like the Red Queen. It’s also a 22-track showcase for more probing stylistic experimentation, from “FOREVER AGAIN,” his version of a New Wave track, to “GONE 4 A MIN,” which channels a <i>Yeezus</i> deep cut thrown into zero gravity on which he makes a promise to “turn a deaf folk blind.” He’s big enough to feature on the most-streamed track from Drake’s <i>For All the Dogs</i>, but far-out enough to inspire more questions than answers.\n","short":"The enigmatic artist exists in his own orbit
