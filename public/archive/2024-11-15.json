Album","standard":"It’s not by chance that Make Them Suffer’s fifth album is self-titled. After weathering lockdown-related cancellations and a prominent lineup adjustment, the Perth metalcore crew emerge reenergized on their first album in four years. Notably, keyboardist/vocalist Alex Reade (ex-Drown This City) has replaced Booka Nile as the melodic counterpoint to Sean Harmanis’ harsh, aggrieved outbursts. Their powerful contrast is most striking on tracks like “Oscillator,” on which Reade cuts through the tumult with the pointed refrain “You’ve waged a war against yourself.” The 2022 single “Doomswitch”—which marked her recorded debut with the band and sees her break out some dynamic keytar flourishes in the song and video alike—sets the tone for the new entries, thanks to its industrial-level rhythmic pounding and repeated electronic lashings. Foregrounding vocal layering and a sudden swath of open space before one final crushing crescendo, “No Hard Feelings” makes for a cathartic centerpiece. Consolidating their strengths while audibly evolving as an ensemble, Make Them Suffer stake their claim as one of Australia’s most unflinching forces in heavy music.","short":"A forceful reawakening

Album and Interview","standard":"“It feels really good to be in the driver’s seat,” singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe on the eve of releasing <i>Shawn</i>, his first album in four years and most personal record to date. A teenage social-media sensation who became one of pop’s biggest stars in the late 2010s, Mendes pulled back after the release of 2020’s <i>Wonder</i>, canceling a 2022 tour and setting out on a journey to find himself, a decision he calls “terrifying” but one that was ultimately liberating. “It was the greatest gift I’ve ever given myself,” he says. “I gave myself a life. The best part about that is, it taught me that the next time I’m standing at the crossroads between choosing something in my truth or doing what would make everyone else happy, I have this reference point.”\n\n“Everything’s hard to explain out loud,” Mendes sings on the hushed opener “Who I Am,” a sketched overview of where Mendes has been and what’s to come over the next half-hour. It strips down Mendes’ music to its essence—vocals and strummed guitar framing lyrics that detail the way his thoughts raced as his life got too big around him.\n\n<i>Shawn</i> feels loose and confident even as it’s economical, putting Mendes’ reflections and smoke-plume voice front and center on the campfire sing-along “Why Why Why” and his tender, album-closing cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.” The swaying “Heart of Gold” is a Laurel Canyon-inspired cut where Mendes laments the way a longtime friend slipped out of his circle before passing away, its weeping slide guitar providing a counterpoint to the bittersweet reminiscing about the days when he and his friend “shot for the stars.” “That’ll Be the Day” is fatefully lovelorn, its arrangement as delicate as lace, as Mendes muses on the idea of eternal love.\n\nOn “The Mountain,” Mendes takes aim at the many rumors that have swirled around him and his intimates over the last two years in gently devastating fashion, rebuking anyone who might put him in a box while acoustic guitars roil beneath him. “Call it what you want,” Mendes sings on its refrain, and that phrase became an almost-defiant mantra for him as he was working on his fifth album. The song references a spiritual experience he had in Kauai. “Without going into the exact details of it, leaving that mountain that day gave me something I’ve always wanted, which was a sense of security that no success could ever provide me, no relationship could ever provide me,” he says. “It was security with myself. A lot changed after that, because when you’re not chasing something, you let go. And then it almost feels like things are starting to appear.”\n\nAs he tells Lowe, whatever label people might want to place on him “really doesn’t matter, because I feel this.” <i>Shawn</i>, as a whole, is a statement of purpose from a musician who’s a veteran of the game in his mid-twenties—and it shows what he’s capable of when there’s nothing holding him back.","short":"The pop star returns

Album and Interview","standard":"On <i>Access All Areas</i>, FLO deliver a fierce, shapeshifting debut album of tracks that explore the hopes, fears, and burning ambitions that come after a breakthrough which saw them tagged as <i>the</i> great hopes for British R&B. On 2022’s “Cardboard Box,” Jorja Douglas, Stella Quaresma, and Renée Downer’s tidy chemistry and harmonic timing referenced greats of the sound from yesteryear, while providing a glimpse of the future. “We know better than anyone what a journey it has been to get here,” Quaresma tells Apple Music. “But this is actually only the beginning. Those years, filled with lessons, learning, and even trauma…it’s all in the past as the <i>AAA</i>-era starts from today. This album signifies us letting our supporters in, sharing more of our lives, and giving out more of <i>us</i>.”\n\n<i>Access All Areas</i> strikes at the sounds they’ve always dreamed of—guided by the razor-sharp writing, education, and smooth production chops of exec producer MNEK. “He’s a really big part of helping us unlock different parts of our voices,” Quaresma says of the British multi-hyphenate. “We’re still so young with so much to learn, so we do lean on him for guidance.” And the results speak for themselves. FLO tangle with trifling partners (“Caught Up”), sizzling rap-style production (“Shoulda Woulda Coulda”), and self-acceptance (“I’m Just a Girl”) on the album which is a big-time flex session from a trio of stars stepping into their power, with even greater goals in sight. “We want to push the perception of girl groups so we had to start and finish with really strong statements on this album,” adds Renée. “We just had to. Because, as young Black women on the rise in this industry, when we reflect on our come-up and everything that we’ve been through, there are bittersweet but also positive messages that mean so much to us. So here it is, this is our truth.” Here, the London trio talks us through <i>Access All Areas</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Intro” (feat. Cynthia Erivo)</b>\nJorja Douglas: “We wanted to start this up in a really clear environment. And we spent the time to get it right. This is sultry and musical, we even added in bits with lovely strings—and finally asked [British actor and musician] Cynthia Erivo to narrate. She’s Black, British, and so talented, she’s someone we adore. This intro sets everything off nicely as we tap into our history here—and share how the journey so far has been for us these last few years.”\n\n<b>“AAA”</b>\nStella Quaresma: “We recorded this out in LA, in what was probably our favorite session for this whole album [working with Pop Wansel, MNEK, and Sevyn Streeter]. So the title of the album feels slightly different to this song, but it still felt like a nice way to continue with this start. This feels like a mix between throwback and current [R&B sounds], which we love.”\n\n<b>“In My Bag” (feat. GloRilla)</b>\nSQ: “This is about being on top of your game in any situation or scenario—physically, mentally, just whatever makes you feel good. We’re tapping into that confidence with this song. So it’s big and braggy, but also centers on being authentic to you. We don’t have Birkins, and we don’t have a [Rolls-Royce] Wraith, but we’re still true to ourselves.”\n\n<b>“Walk Like This”</b>\nRenée Downer: “We love trying out different [singing] styles like we did with this song. If you feel this, you’ll really appreciate a few more songs of this vibe across the album, some really fun ones. Even now as we listen back, I feel that [variation] we went for really adds so much.”\n\n<b>“How Does It Feel?”</b>\nJD: “We were instantly attracted to this pretty much as soon as we heard the demo. It was written by [American songwriter] Theron Thomas, and it’s the type of music we love to listen to, and always dared to be a part of. We want to push perceptions and this is the perfect sonic fit for that. If male artists are comfortable singing across any kind of style and approach, then why not us?”\n\n<b>“Soft”</b>\nJD: “This reminds me of my favorite Justin Bieber project, [2013 compilation] <i>Journals</i>. I think that’s why I fell in love with this song, even if others around us disagreed. Maybe they didn’t connect with the song, whatever, but we had to be clear and tell them where to go! This song is an R&B dream. And this is <i>our</i> album—so we don’t believe in persuading, anyway. So here it is.”\n\n<b>“Check”</b>\nRD: “We’re so happy that this song came about. MNEK and [British songwriter] Ryan Ashley were involved in writing this, and I feel they know us so well. At times, we struggle to write love songs that aren’t cringe! Honestly, we’ve made a few of those. But this one just had a vibe to it, like [USHER and Alicia Keys’ 2004 single] ‘My Boo,’ and we were who keen on adding in a sound that people could dance to.”\n\n<b>“On & On”</b>\nSQ: “This was written by [British singer-songwriter] KABBA, who did many songs for our last EP [2023’s <i>3 of Us</i>]. We were so captivated by this song it’s a straight old-school love song. I can still remember being in the room when we first heard it. We haven’t performed it yet, but we honestly can’t wait.”\n\n<b>“Bending My Rules”</b>\nSQ: “An inspiring vibe here. We’ve made sexy songs before, but this one just sounds so grown-up. It’s complex yet simple, it’s great to sing live and really shows off our voices.”\n\n<b>“Trustworthy (Interlude)”</b>\nJD: “This was a really pretty song to create [with MNEK and NOVA WAV] in London. It’s very easy to talk about the great things in a relationship but not so much with the difficulties. This is about the sensitive stuff, but it’s always easy when you speak from the heart and your own experiences, then everything flows easily.”\n\n<b>“Caught Up”</b>\nRD: “What I find so cool about this song is just how passionate it is. It takes me back to being 12 years old, listening to [Jazmine Sullivan’s] ‘Bust Your Windows,’ even when I obviously don’t know anything about that kind of behavior. But it fueled our imaginations and, as girls, we were still able to relate. We all play through these scenarios in our heads, even if they drive us crazy. Sometimes you have to remind your partner: You don’t know who you’re dealing with!”\n\n<b>“IWH2BMX”</b>\nRD: “If you could imagine [pulling] your stank face, with gun fingers in the air? That’s how we imagine this song— it’s ‘I Would Hate to be My [E]X,’ essentially. That’s it really—we’re flexing on them in a big way. Why not? If you feel good then stunt!”\n\n<b>“Nocturnal”</b>\nRD: “This song is a testament to FLO. We’ve been working so hard this last few years, hardly getting sleep, just trying to do things the right way. Not the easy way; we want longevity. This is about the lifestyle of not getting any sleep. We want to be ahead of up here even if that’s not immediately visible.” \n\n<b>“Shoulda Woulda Coulda”</b>\nSQ: “At first, it was hard for us to wrap our heads around this beat. It’s a really nostalgic sound that we wanted to sink our teeth into. Once we finished this song, we knew that our album was on a good path.”\n\n<b> “Get It Till I’m Gone”</b>\nRD: “The way that we layer our ad-libs here, and it’s mainly for the outro [section], is something we’ve done in the past: on ‘3 of Us,’ definitely, and some others. Now it’s a FLO thing. I just love it. One of us says [the line], and the rest come in and overlap. It’s really cool.”\n\n<b> “I’m Just a Girl”</b>\nSQ: “The writing process of this song was interesting. It started off about sex, as they always do. But somehow it wasn’t resonating. But we loved the sound here, this Rihanna-inspired rock vibe, think of maybe her <i>Rated R</i> era [in 2009]. We put this one aside until MNEK revealed to us a few days later in a session, that he had reworded, reordered, and completely reworked it. It went from this awkward, almost jokey vibe to now being something that’s deep and personal, and it’s because MNEK has been with us for so long. He’s heard us rant on his sofa over the years. He gets it, so he was able to capture five years’ worth of trauma and wrap it up into one angry song.”","short":"The UK R&B queens take off: “We want to push perceptions of girl

Release","standard":"Reconfiguring St. Vincent’s self-produced <i>All Born Screaming</i> for a Spanish-speaking audience may not have been an obvious choice. Then again, when has the modern-day guitar god Annie Clark done what’s expected of her or taken a conventional route? Converting the lyrics and rerecording her vocals account for the overt changes present on <i>Todos Nacen Gritando</i>, which otherwise maintains the track order and runtime of the English-language original. Much like a faithful literary translation for a Latin American audience, the integrity of the material remains intact, the robust riffage on “Hombre Roto” and sonic swells of “La Fruta Mas Dulce” hitting reliably hard. Dave Grohl’s drums still shatter on the “Pulga” chorus, Clark’s earnestly possessive chorus just as evocative as before. If nothing else, these versions simply make the songs more accessible to those who might have missed some of the meanings and sentiments behind them.","short":"This Spanish rework of All Born

Album","standard":"During the long and idle months of the pandemic, Gwen Stefani spent more time than usual at her now-husband Blake Shelton’s ranch. “During COVID, we were there so much that we actually got to see the seasons,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “We started seeing the wildflowers, seeing what was in Oklahoma that we never saw before.” Transplanting hundreds of irises they found on the ranch that year was a project she would normally be too busy for, but now they were doing it as a family. The pop-rock queen had felt the itch to write new music for years, but had struggled to find a sound that reflected where she was now. Then came “Purple Irises,” a sweet pop-country duet with Shelton that lets go of insecurities and goes all in on love. The seed was planted for <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani’s fifth solo album.\n\nWhile making the warm and unabashedly enamored <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani found herself echoing the music she grew up on in the ’70s. “I always picture myself in the back of the station wagon and my parents driving to church, and all the great soft rock that was on,” she says. “Anything from Hall & Oates to Chicago to Fleetwood Mac.” Garden symbolism abounds: Tears of past heartbreaks water the soil, yielding fields of late-blooming flowers. Despite the cowboy hat she dons on the cover, it’s not quite a country album, but some nods to ranch life sneak in. “I drive you crazy, you drive the truck,” she sings on the title track, and on “Marigolds,” she recalls dressing like a cowgirl to catch Shelton’s eye upon first meeting.\n\nIt’s been nearly three decades since her band, No Doubt, became a household name with their third album, <i>Tragic Kingdom</i>, but the process of writing <i>Bouquet</i> brought Stefani back to the feeling of taking a leap of faith to find her voice. Naturally, she’s got a flower metaphor for that. “Every time you plant that seed, you have this hope, but you don’t know if it’s going to bloom,” she said. “You don’t really have control. All you can do is everything you can to help.”\n","short":"On her fifth solo album, a love of ’70s pop—and garden metaphors—blooms."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bouquet/1766869105","playParams":{"id":"1766869105","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/50F6vOQBQF2qo1jwVTfv9J"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766869105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"108717","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/108717?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674310012}}},"1767429726":{"id":"1767429726","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767429726?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tribal-gaze/1552334925","name":"Deadbody -

It leads to material that on a lyrical level can feel very serious and weighty (“The Light That Has Lighted the World,” “The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)”) with vocals that share that heavy tone. However, finally freed from his secondary status in the world’s greatest rock 'n' roll band, Harrison indulges his own tasteful playing and memorable guitar lines and tones and breaks past the philosophical dirges with the expertise and pleasure of a consummate professional. “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)” is a '60s holdover, while “Don’t Let Me Wait Too Long” and “Sue Me, Sue You Blues” shuffle past with clear knowledge of how to find a steady groove.

Originally conceived around a “graduation” concept that would see the group’s teen members leaving upon maturation, the K-pop group has been singing about the wonders of youth since their fresh-faced debut in 2016. By 2024, the vocal stylings and thematic explorations of the now fixed-member group have matured along with its seven members. MARK, RENJUN, JENO, HAECHAN, JAEMIN, CHENLE, and JISUNG are no longer singing about “Chewing Gum,” but rather the complexities of searching for something better.\n\nNCT DREAM’s fourth album, <i>DREAMSCAPE</i>, is an ’80s-inspired, fairy-tale-like follow-up to <i>DREAM( )SCAPE</i>. If <i>DREAM( )SCAPE</i> explored the pains and anxieties of contemporary early adulthood, then <i>DREAMSCAPE</i> wonders what possibilities await those who are able to escape those burdens. Like with so many pop music discographies, that escape often comes in love. Tracks like “When I’m with You” and “Flying Kiss” have members singing about the temporary relief a connection can bring. While the album may end with the previously released English-language single “Rains in Heaven,” the penultimate pop track “Off the Wall” gives a more disco-driven celebratory end. In <i>DREAMSCAPE</i>, utopia remains aspirational, but NCT DREAM’s boundless energy makes searching for it seem oh so fun.\n","short":"The whimsical NCT subunit makes searching for utopia sound fun."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dreamscape/1767771688","playParams":{"id":"1767771688","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4CbiijbtjdFusL6uXiZJ2k"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767771688/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1208839599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1208839599?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674528145}}},"1767885153":{"id":"1767885153","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767885153?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":37,"genreNames":["Bluegrass","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/01/a8/64/01a864b5-adad-6045-8d26-3496f84139d7/f2e7568a-af64-46bf-9b34-5536e829db91.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b4b4b4","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor4":"a0a0a0","textColor1":"dfdfdf","bgColor":"0c0c0c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dolly-parton-family/1751609124","name":"Smoky Mountain DNA: Family, Faith and Fables","artistName":"Dolly Parton & Family","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/11/3d/2c/113d2c58-43b9-3374-56c4-1245996a5030/198704146053_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"40332b","textColor2":"40241b","textColor4":"634b40","textColor1":"150600","bgColor":"efe6d7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/smoky-mountain-dna-family-faith-and-fables/1767885153","playParams":{"id":"1767885153","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/28bVqBO08O6jcgirj9Yj0l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767885153/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1751609124","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1751609124?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731655622407}}},"1767934303":{"id":"1767934303","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767934303?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/72/4c/f2/724cf21c-27be-6419-96d5-046bf543888a/Jobab70265e-6d9a-4cf0-a9b4-b2599822c5a2-175995211-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_343591577_1899750587-Time1726857959447.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d4b47b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bfbfbf","textColor2":"d4b47b","textColor4":"aa9063","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/55/2a/2b/552a2bb5-1df8-b1aa-2919-30b6d112f831/f80bc4f6-ddfd-4e19-bcbd-cb789712ece0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3a393b","textColor2":"2e2d30","textColor4":"555456","textColor1":"0d0b0e","bgColor":"efeff1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/a3/6d/71/a36d71dd-9775-1508-ef88-44b6345132bf/Job2aef1e75-ac21-45f4-8dfe-5ed7935015d2-175995212-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_343591576_1899750588-Time1726859045750.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e4cab4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c1baa9","textColor2":"e4cab4","textColor4":"b6a290","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f4/f2/fe/f4f2fe45-6a63-83e5-3366-a2b37460fec6/2b860c71-df7b-4cc1-a9a9-0d60df1ab28a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"48484c","textColor2":"282629","textColor4":"514f52","textColor1":"1d1d22","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brooks-dunn/16105","name":"Reboot II","artistName":"Brooks & Dunn","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1b/c9/cd/1bc9cd72-6d9d-1dd0-9f18-c6cec07fe78e/196872425321.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"bebebe","textColor2":"eee7d3","textColor4":"bfb9a9","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"030303","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Few acts have influenced country music like Brooks & Dunn. The best-selling duo in the genre’s history, Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn helped define the ’90s country sound with landmark albums like their 1991 debut <i>Brand New Man</i> and 1993’s <i>Hard Workin’ Man</i>. It’s fitting, then, that the iconic duo would round up some of country and Americana music’s best and brightest artists for this collaborative record, which serves as a sequel to 2019’s <i>Reboot</i>. Where the first <i>Reboot</i> revisited the duo’s biggest hits, <i>Reboot II</i> lets featured artists—including Lainey Wilson, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram, The Cadillac Three, and more—choose deeper cuts, offering a fuller glimpse of the sheer breadth of the pair’s influence.\n\nBrooks tells Apple Music that compiling the project was loose and playful, with each artist free to conceive their track however they chose. “It's just turning everybody loose,” Brooks says. “Bring your own bands if you want. Bring your own producer if you want, whatever studio you want to work in. If you don't want to deal with that, you can use our stuff and we will be there. After that, pick a song and do it however you want.”\n\nDunn enjoys the record’s break from the traditional album formula and relished the opportunity to reimagine songs that, in many cases, are several decades old. “People don’t like change,” he says. “And even on stage ourselves, if we change a little riff or a turnaround here in the middle of it, you might get a little bit of pushback from the fans, so we always try to adhere to that. Now, we've gone completely the other way with this record and just let the horses run.” Below, Brooks & Dunn share insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Rock My World (Little Country Girl)” (feat. Marcus King)</b>\nDunn: “Marcus is a guitar slinger. He gave that song a totally different vibe, which it was. He’s a legit blues player. Just a guitar slinger. Rips it.”\nBrooks: “He came in with his band… I went in his vocal booth and said, ‘Marcus, I don’t want to get in your business or anything, but you know that guitar solo you’re doing is like 16 bars? Would it really [throw] you off if we made that 32 bars?’ He's like, ‘Fricking get out of this room.’ He goes, ‘Boys, we are not doing any Nashville BS now. We are South Carolina kickers. Here we go.’”\n\n<b>“Ain’t Nothing ’Bout You” (feat. Megan Moroney)</b>\nDunn: “Walked in, heard it, you’re expecting something totally different, right? And you hear that vocal coming through there and now you’ve got to go, ‘Oh, I got to go chase that. OK, let's go.’ Megan hits that darn airy voice and it’s like, ‘We’re done here.’”\n\n<b>“Hillbilly Deluxe” (feat. HARDY)</b>\nDunn: “HARDY scared me to death at first, and then I went, ‘That’s maybe one of my favorite tracks. Can’t say that on [the] radio.”\n\n<b>“Brand New Man” (feat. Warren Zeiders)</b>\nDunn: “It was like coming at a new song in a new way and trying to find it in the studio with the players. And the guys that Dann Huff had cast for that [song], it was really cool. We stopped at one point and just said, ‘You know what? Let’s take this chorus.’ And I was trying to read his mind, trying to read him while he was in the studio. I said, ‘What do you think we take this chorus and hit it like a Nirvana vibe?’ And everybody goes, ‘Whoa.’ And it came off, in my opinion, really, really cool.”\nBrooks: “There's one change in there that just says Nirvana. The vibe is definitely there.”","short":"A bigger, bolder sequel: “We just let the horses run,” says Ronnie Dunn."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reboot-ii/1767934303","playParams":{"id":"1767934303","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1nt0BAJMDSGQvmZbq0xhoI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767934303/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"16105","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/16105?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731658417126}}},"1768164542":{"id":"1768164542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1768164542?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/39/c2/38/39c23854-a279-e64d-8ac0-f8eba78b6015/Job67bfb8fc-3889-4ca4-9272-f8e9eca211c7-176816495-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345449512_1913416789-Time1728086614402.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","151515"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c6c2b2"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"30322e","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"383734","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c6c2b2","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dd/e8/ff/dde8ff6d-22bd-6a5e-fc4a-22b925797d2c/5b0e4b68-7a54-44ba-b1a0-3968507b0d14.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c82e20","textColor2":"f43628","textColor4":"c72e23","textColor1":"f63524","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/64/bd/5a/64bd5a00-07c8-1b73-2ee3-551d91d02d2f/Job166a45a7-71d5-417b-9b87-43508319d347-176816494-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_345449511_1913416788-Time1728085611610.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","121212"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c6c2b2"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2f2926","textColor2":"121212","textColor4":"2f2f2c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c6c2b2","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/07/3a/bd/073abd5d-89f7-d386-86db-4bce8eae2a1e/1f50bfb9-51f0-4e89-95cf-87a23770fa92.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ccc7bb","textColor2":"d5cfc4","textColor4":"b9b5ab","textColor1":"ece6d8","bgColor":"4c4b4a","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8a/87/7e/8a877eba-e310-718a-ec02-2dc315211a4b/580496c1-50f8-4761-b54c-a5ea3829c7c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9f9c9d","textColor2":"f43121","textColor4":"c3271a","textColor1":"c6c3c5","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-black-keys/5893059","name":"Ohio Players (Trophy Edition)","artistName":"The Black Keys","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/23/7e/e9/237ee9df-889e-4690-d967-3bc4f79a0e36/075597897517.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"c3bdb2","textColor2":"d7d2c3","textColor4":"b5b1a4","textColor1":"e8e2d4","bgColor":"2d2d2b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"The Black Keys have spent the past two decades carrying the banner of blues-rock revivalism into the present. The duo have sold more records than most pop stars and have proven, time and time again, that rock has always been here—if you were willing to look. The band, made up of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney, emerged from Akron, Ohio, in the early aughts as a welcome counterbalance to what was monopolizing record shelf space at the time. The New York City alternative scene was thriving, with bands including The Strokes, LCD Soundsystem, and Interpol dictating the sound coming out of venues, warehouses, and loft spaces up and down the East Coast. \n\nAuerbach and Carney, meanwhile, were crafting a sound that was more Mississippi Delta than Mercury Lounge. The duo’s shared love of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Thin Lizzy, and T. Rex formed the foundation of their lo-fi sound, and they spent the next two decades expanding their range, introducing elements of psychedelia and big-chorus anthems that made them festival-headlining mainstays. \n\nNow, The Black Keys are returning with album number 12, the aptly titled <i>Ohio Players</i>, a project that bubbles over with the energy of two dudes just here for a good time. “I think once we experienced success, it was like, ‘Let’s try to keep it going and not make the same record again,’” Carney tells ALT CTRL Radio’s Hanuman Welch. “But what happened during this process was the pandemic hits, and after a year of not seeing each other, we walk in the studio to start working on our next record, and something had just changed between us. It was like we finally became best friends; everything was enjoyable. Creatively, we were starting to kind of push things a little bit, but as soon as we finished [2022 album] <i>Dropout Boogie</i>, before it was even released, we started working on this record. The intention was to call our friends to come in and work with us.” \n\nPast collaborations have netted The Black Keys the sort of accolades other bands work their entire careers hoping to achieve. The duo’s <i>El Camino</i>, co-produced by Danger Mouse, won Grammys for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Performance in 2013. But <i>Ohio Players</i> is the first time the band has truly collaborated in the sense of sharing writing and performing duties. And then they brought on some friends. \n\nThe album’s first single, “Beautiful People (Stay High),” was co-written by Beck and Dan the Automator, and is the result of supporting Beck on tour 20 years ago after meeting him at a 2003 <i>SNL</i> after-party. “I just busted out this promo CD,” Carney remembers. “And I was like, ‘This is my band.’ And two weeks later, Beck reached out and took us on tour. So, this track is a result of this relationship and fandom that I have for Beck. We’ve been talking about making music off and on for years, and right when we finished our last record, we’re like, ‘Get down, it’s time.’” \n\nThe Black Keys managed to enlist another generational talent for the project: Oasis’ Noel Gallagher. “[Collaboration] can always fall flat on its face,” says Carney. “And so, we basically spent 80 grand running the gamble of, ‘This could not work,’ because we didn't have a song. So, we booked the smallest, tiniest studio in London, really, Toe Rag—it’s where The White Stripes did <i>Elephant</i>. It was, like, zero frills. We showed up, and Noel was there—a guy we’ve briefly met a couple of times, and a legend—and we’re now going to write a song from scratch.

A Juilliard-trained jazz pianist who made his name as the bandleader on Stephen Colbert’s <i>The Late Show</i>, he has played with everyone from Prince to Beyoncé, won record-breaking numbers of Grammy awards (five alone in 2022), and picked up an Academy Award along way, for his music for the 2021 Disney/Pixar movie <i>Soul</i>. \n\nSo you have to ask why, of all the music he could turn his talents to, has he decided on Beethoven? “Oh, my goodness!” replies Batiste. “The endless amounts of integration, ingenuity, whether it’s from an orchestral perspective or compositional perspective, just the range of different innovation,” he tells Apple Music Classical. “That, coupled with the appeal of his music across generations, and across different spectrums of music listeners—whether you are a classical music listener, whether you’re a person of faith, whether you’re a child, whether you sing in a choir, whether you’re an amateur pianist—is a rare air. Beethoven occupies rare air in terms of the canon.”\n\nBut this is not Beethoven as you know it: in Batiste’s hands, the late 18th/early 19th-century German Romantic composer’s repertoire is reimagined through the idioms of jazz and blues improvisation. Rapid blue-note runs add fireworks to the famous <i>Für Elise</i>; the theme from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony stomps and swings; while the Symphony No. 7’s slow movement (“7th Symphony Elegy”) takes us seamlessly from stride rhythms to shuffle. Think of it as a blues journey: “In the ‘Waldstein Wobble,’ you have the boogie-woogie, then you have the stride, then you have the up-tempo gospel stomp and shout music, and then it goes into this sort of plagal, choral-like church rendering of the theme,” explains Batiste. “And later it goes into a more contemporary blues space, like what you might hear from Chick Corea, that sort of a <i>Return to Forever</i> sort of space.”\n\nTypically, then, Batiste won’t be pinned down to one genre or style; but “if I wanted to classify my sound, one of the pillars of it would be new age blues piano,” he says. You can hear it in his Keith Jarrett-like take on Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” a realization that picks up from where Lauryn Hill’s gospel rendition in <i>Sister Act 2</i> left off. And it’s there, too, in the three original works on this album that are more loosely Beethoven-inspired: “Dusklight Movement,” which evokes the pathos of Beethoven’s “Moonlight” Sonata with Arvo Pärt-like arpeggios; the Jarrett-infused spontaneous improvisation, “Life Of Ludwig”; and the lyrical melancholy of the theme from his <i>American Symphony</i>, a work that became the focus of a 2023 documentary charting its journey from conception to world premiere at the Carnegie Hall. “I want to extend on Beethoven’s music,” reveals Batiste. “I know some people will clutch their pearls to hear that, but I think it’s a beautiful thing.\n\n“I hear the blues in Beethoven’s music, even though the blues wasn’t codified as a form yet,” he says. “I hear rhythmic influences in his music that through the diaspora led to the blues, that led to gospel music. Was he conscious of it in the way that we are today, and thinking, ‘Oh, this is a blues inflection’? No, he wasn’t, because it wasn’t invented yet. But he was drawing from such a wide palette of musical influence, that there are connections to be made now that couldn’t have been made then. \n\n“That’s the beauty of being an artist in the 21st century. You have such a rich tradition, and such a cultural inheritance to play with. If you have the imagination to hear it, and the technical facility to pull it off, then you can make things a reality that never existed before.”","short":"“I hear the blues in Beethoven’s music”: Jon Batiste delivers a soulful homage."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-blues/1769426743","playParams":{"id":"1769426743","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3eXr4s3rCLxNJpxqaIDyqJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769426743/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"211400086","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/211400086?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674323195}}},"1769432780":{"id":"1769432780","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1769432780?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2f/49/1b/2f491bea-3cad-4517-d007-39ab9fd48cb8/8c0ef4ee-89e5-4cf2-a7a8-2421cc47f388.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"33352f","textColor2":"171712","textColor4":"343531","textColor1":"16160f","bgColor":"a8aead","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3b/1d/b8/3b1db8c0-ae36-4619-2b5f-c02dfbd4a818/68b2e22d-89c7-4187-8af1-fa862f5d5c97.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bdbbc9","textColor2":"c8bfd8","textColor4":"a8a1b5","textColor1":"e2dff1","bgColor":"29292a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/maxo-kream/740689353","name":"Personification","artistName":"Maxo Kream","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/ae/e2/1eaee2e2-5624-0b0e-12cb-03101e7842bf/198846338521.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccc4c9","textColor2":"f0dae6","textColor4":"c2b1bb","textColor1":"fbf2f7","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since Maxo Kream first broke through with 2015’s <i>#Maxo187</i>, he’s established himself as one of the most creative songwriters and storytellers in rap.

There’s Trigga Maxo, hardened by the streets and inspired by the swampy Southern goodness of Houston’s rap tradition. Then there’s Punken, the character named after his childhood nickname, fond of nostalgia and simpler times. Kream also introduces Emekwanem, after his given name, representative of his responsibilities as a man and father.\n\n<i>Personification</i> finds Maxo diving into all of the themes presented by these different characters, a style exemplified on “Bibles and Rifles.” On the skittering, dance-inspired track, Maxo asks: “Is it heaven for a gangsta/Is it heaven for a G/The ones who rob, shoot, or shank you but still take care of families?” It’s a question Maxo Kream ponders again and again on <i>Personification</i>: Is it too late to be good?

As with many BTS tracks—both solo and group—the six songs on <i>Happy</i> are designed as sources of comfort for world-weary listeners looking for a “Dynamite”-level kick-start to, or a “Spring Day”-like reassurance in, their daily routines. “I’ll Be There,” a rockabilly pop-rock track that has JIN promising listeners he will always sing for them, falls into the former category, while the sweet ballad “I will come to you” veers closer to the hopeful yearning of the latter (“When the warm spring breeze blows/I’ll go to you”).\n\nNotable collaborators on <i>Happy</i> include Gary Barlow, the lead singer and primary songwriter of English rock band Take That. Barlow co-produced and co-wrote lead single “Running Wild,” a pop-rock track reminiscent of JIN’s 2022 Coldplay collab “The Astronaut.” JIN’s K-pop colleague WENDY, a vocalist for Red Velvet, lent her voice to the duet “Heart on the Window,” while Taka and Toru of Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK co-wrote “Falling.” Big Hit Music producer and frequent BTS collaborator Pdogg worked on four of the six tracks, weaving JIN’s solo album debut even more tightly into the broader BTS musical journey.\n","short":"The last of the BTS members to go solo drops six tracks designed for comfort."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/happy-ep/1772351320","playParams":{"id":"1772351320","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772351320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1191850724","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1191850724?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674192076}}},"1772959527":{"id":"1772959527","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1772959527?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/48/72/dc/4872dc03-5b3e-a2ab-0ff3-865371e1ef2d/cf583763-4530-4f28-9031-8c21d224c8b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9d6de","textColor2":"ebeff0","textColor4":"c8d2d5","textColor1":"edf3fa","bgColor":"3b606c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e1/c3/53/e1c353a5-7330-01eb-035e-02caded50c48/04507081-e055-4190-b227-16f990ddaee2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cab0a4","textColor2":"f79b54","textColor4":"cc824a","textColor1":"f5d4c6","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/quando-rondo/1341519176","name":"Here For A Reason","artistName":"Quando Rondo","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/76/06/47760681-a880-67dc-26d9-6c571ca33fe1/075679629319.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcccc","textColor2":"03ff0d","textColor4":"04cc0c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"060505","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Quando Rondo has been a consistent figure in rap since 2017, so it’s easy to overlook that at the time of his 2024 LP, <i>Here for a Reason</i>, the Savannah, Georgia, rapper was still only 25 years old. On the project, he shares the perspective of a young man far removed from his teenage years, yet still growing into the shoes of adulthood. He’s at times confident, other times confused, figuring out his place in the world as both a role model and student. His curiosity is inspiring, a willingness to learn that suggests fame at a young age didn’t corrupt him.\n\nOn the album’s second track, “Gotta Do Better & Pray,” Rondo cues up a smoked-out soul beat and croons about the problems that plague him, neatly narrating from the perspective of his girl who knows something is wrong. “She know that I ain’t been the same since I lost my lil’ n***a/On top of that I caught a case, they got me lost in the system/Been through so many heartbreaks, I got so much on my mental.” On “Grow Up,” though, he proudly flexes his wins over a glimmering piano line that gives the song some serious pep.

But with his third album <i>The Crossroads</i>, he’s attempting to find balance between enjoying the spoils of his success and staying grounded. He’s boastful and braggadocious on “Mad as F*ck” and “Back on the Road” (which includes one of the album’s two Lil Wayne features), but he never lets his success lead him too far from what’s important to him. He admits to buying a house in Boca Raton, Florida, since Miami homes were too expensive, and recalls memories of working at a TGI Friday’s restaurant and growing up around violence. But he’s arguably at his best when he’s waxing poetic about his family: “06 dreamin” honors his mom’s musical pursuits on shows like <i>American Idol</i> and <i>Making the Band</i>, “Shai Afeni” is a heartfelt ode to his newborn daughter, and “Now You Know” mourns the loss of his grandmother.

The alt-pop artist wrote her first album, 2022’s <i>young forever</i>, during what she called the worst year of her life. But as Barrett sifted through her recent experiences to inspire her follow-up, she realized she wasn’t sad anymore. This epiphany spurred a new creative approach, one in which she could channel her energy into creating a character instead of resurfacing her own pain.\n\nOn <i>AFTERCARE</i>, Barrett immerses herself in dark, moody soundscapes as she transforms into an empowered woman who owns her sexuality while remaining vulnerable. It opens with the hazy title track, where the question “You love the chase, but will you stay when it ends?” sets the tone for an exploration of love, sex, and the often messy aftermath. Barrett purrs her carnal desires on the provocative “PORNSTAR,” and makes that physicality feel as essential as oxygen on the howling “HEARTBEAT.” On the cinematic ballad “RUSSIAN ROULETTE” she bets it all on love, and on the haunting “EDWARD SCISSORHANDS” she confronts the fallout: “Whenever you touch me/You cut me to pieces.” But as defiant closing tracks “STAY ALIVE” and “DIRTY LITTLE SECRET” show, Barrett emerges stronger and wiser—and ready to dive in all over again.","short":"Epiphanies and experience lead to a brighter outlook on her second

to blur the cultural, linguistic, and musical boundaries of the global pop scene. “What is it? K-pop or J-pop? Or they not? Or they rap?/Please know that/We give thanks to hip-hop,” Japanese artist Awich raps on the previously released cypher “WOKE UP REMIXX,” which notably does not include any of the XG members but rather a who’s who of Korean and Japanese hip-hop stars. When Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya, and Cocona are front and center on the eight-track album, it’s often to lean further into the wolf imagery also at the thematic core of their first world tour. “So don't play with us/Could be dangerous,” lead single “HOWLING” warns as it simultaneously welcomes listeners in with an “ah-woo” and a rubbery bass. “So run if you hear the sound/’Cause that's how we howl.”\n","short":"The Japanese girl group’s second mini album leans into hip-hop."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/awe/1775445626","playParams":{"id":"1775445626","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1eS784kXLyL0YpDz5E7AuV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775445626/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1609409493","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1609409493?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674200598}}},"1775462846":{"id":"1775462846","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775462846?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2c/11/24/2c11245b-bfda-d661-86ab-7194654d3ecc/fa76cdcf-6049-4321-861a-4e35a441a7f4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7afa8","textColor2":"cfc4af","textColor4":"ada08f","textColor1":"dcd7ce","bgColor":"231110","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5e/01/45/5e0145f8-8877-9e8a-1278-bfaf9dfc38d1/6ae76d5e-8444-4e98-a8a1-367fe30c2297.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ded8d0","textColor2":"f8c69f","textColor4":"deb18b","textColor1":"f8f6f5","bgColor":"785e3d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7c/aa/02/7caa02d7-bf9c-c3ab-10e4-852dda9bd268/07d733b3-eb0f-443d-8337-b7c2bd284ef1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"281e0f","textColor2":"060503","textColor4":"281e0e","textColor1":"060504","bgColor":"b1843b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rauw-alejandro/1107186883","name":"Cosa Nuestra","artistName":"Rauw Alejandro","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ab/e8/09/abe8092d-ef44-61b9-6b50-ab7efb78ca51/196872401516.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bf8a2f","textColor2":"dc9465","textColor4":"b87951","textColor1":"e6a93a","bgColor":"270f03","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Operating at an exceptionally high level in the past few years made Rauw Alejandro a bona fide Latin music superstar. His proverbial star shone brightly on 2023’s <i>SATURNO</i> and the corresponding <i>PLAYA SATURNO</i>, each showing how innovative the one-time R&B reggaetonero had become. Given the retro-futurist musical vision executed on that pair of projects, his decision to open his subsequent album <i>Cosa Nuestra</i> with the Afro-Cuban song stylings of its title track feels all the more bold in intention. Indeed, just as he’s explored and expanded upon sounds beyond the reggaetón and trap that earned him early acclaim, he appears eager to broaden and mature further at this notable stage in his career.\n\nThose concerned that <i>Cosa Nuestra</i> would prove a strictly old-school affair have no need to worry. Apart from a fairly faithful rendition of salsa romántica staple “Tú Con Él”—its lyrical theme echoing the romantic ones he regularly delivers—Alejandro is chiefly interested in progression as opposed to nostalgia. As suggested by early singles “Déjame Entrar” and the poppy pair “Pasaporte” and “Touching The Sky,” his heart and his sweat exclusively belong to the dance floor and the boudoir. That translates to the feverish club hybrid “Mil Mujeres,” the polished trap of “IL Capo,” and the refreshingly intimate “Amar De Nuevo.”\n\nWhether reuniting with his “Party” pal Bad Bunny on “Qué Pasaría...” or making a new friend in Pharrell Williams via the bilingual tropicalia of “Committed,” Alejandro engages in some truly marvelous world-building here. In particular, the collaborative moments reflect his evident love for both past and present, drawing in seminal reggaetón duo Alexis & Fido for the rugged throwback “Baja Pa’ Acá” one minute and grooving with bachata king Romeo Santos on the atmospheric slow jam “Khé?” Refining a technique that previously served him well, he frequently shape-shifts along with the beat. This comes through in inventive ways on the deceptively silky “Espresso Martini” with guests Marconi Impara and Yan Block, as well as the springy pop-rock of “2:12 AM” with LATIN MAFIA.

But the fact that Myles Smith’s story has followed a certain trajectory doesn’t make it any less remarkable: In only four short years, the Luton singer-songwriter has gone from hopefully uploading covers to TikTok to becoming a global breakout star thanks, in particular, to his inescapable 2024 track “Stargazing.” “I always believed in the feeling of the track and I always knew there was something special in it, but I think the extent it’s taken off, I definitely couldn’t have predicted,” Smith told Apple Music following its release. “To see the world having a similar, visceral reaction was quite surreal.”\n\nThe deeply romantic “Stargazing” features up top on <i>A Minute…</i>, the follow-up to 2024’s earlier debut EP <i>You Promised a Lifetime</i>. And alongside it, there’s more of the soaring, folk pop the singer-songwriter has built his name on, complete with fiddles, handclaps, sing-along choruses, and open-hearted lyricism—and, of course, Smith’s warm, evocative vocals. See opener “Nice to Meet You,” for example, or the atmospheric “Wait for You,” on which Smith promises to be there for someone until they’re back to their best: “I see you fighting those demons inside/I will wait for you.” Elsewhere, James Bay joins for “Waste,” on which both singer-songwriters hope to cross paths with someone they’ve lost in a touching duet that feels like yet another sign of how far Smith has come. (Bastille’s Dan Smith also has credits on two of the EP’s songs, having joined Myles—a huge Bastille fan—on stage at Glastonbury in summer 2024.) \n\nThe songs here concern getting together and staying together (“Take my heart, don’t break it/Love me to my bones,” pleads Smith on “Stargazing”), with plenty of promises from the singer-songwriter to stick with a loved one through thick and thin. But by the EP’s final moments, Smith also explores the devastation of when things don’t quite work out that way. “We were just kids who fell in love/We didn’t know quite what it was,” he sings softly on “Little by Little,” <i>A Minute…</i>’s delicate closing track. “Sad how we’ve grown so far apart/Everything’s fading out.”","short":"More soaring, sometimes devastating folk pop from the breakout star."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-minute-ep/1775728445","playParams":{"id":"1775728445","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775728445/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1249499491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249499491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731674225236}}},"1775728819":{"id":"1775728819","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775728819?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/da/e7/b5dae748-c297-d3df-b6fc-a75ebc9c994f/0e4475d6-54fa-4c72-9dff-d2a31d5e397c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7a295","textColor2":"d8b7a2","textColor4":"ba9685","textColor1":"d3c6b6","bgColor":"451310","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/transformation-worship/1647631398","name":"Undefeated Champion","artistName":"Transformation Worship","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d3/fb/b6/d3fbb6fe-44b7-3936-9d56-7b3a27a35403/24SYMIM16074.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e5b04d","textColor2":"f0cd49","textColor4":"e2a73a","textColor1":"f3d960","bgColor":"ae0e00","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"A spirited combination of hip-hop, R&B, and gospel."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/undefeated-champion/1775728819","playParams":{"id":"1775728819","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/62lvhc9b0g7gkj9eFD9Tsn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775728819/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1647631398","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1647631398?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731657924606}}},"1775759566":{"id":"1775759566","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775759566?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ashley-anne/1256245285","name":"call me when you land -

On “Haunted House,” he keeps the horror alive, spitting over string swells and piano chords that practically shriek in terror. “Take a step into this haunted house,” he teases, before warning: “Once

mid-1990s classic, with plenty of pop savvy and sex positivity.","standard":"Packed with hits—and plenty of personality—TLC’s 1992 debut <i>Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip</i> had helped reshape the sound of modern pop. By expertly mixing together R&B and hip-hop, TLC members Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas had proved they could blur genre lines with ease. Still, the new jack swing aesthetics of <i>Ooooooohhh...</i>—and the youthful image projected by the trio—could easily have fated TLC to subsequent obscurity, subject to the whims of a fickle marketplace (and an even crueler industry).\n\nThe group’s 1994 follow-up, <i>CrazySexyCool</i>, put all of that noise to bed. With its decidedly more mature themes and undeniably strong execution, the album proved a multi-platinum powerhouse, one that proved once and for all that TLC wasn’t a fad. All three members were in their mid-twenties when <i>CrazySexyCool</i> was released, and the album finds them digging deep into the dynamics of modern relationships—albeit with a sex-positive perspective. “Creep,” the smash lead-off single, leans heavily into the old adage “turnabout Is fair play,” with T-Boz quietly yet confidently admitting to down-low trysts (all done as retaliation against her philandering partner). The funk-fueled “Kick Your Game,” meanwhile, finds the group members poignantly goading their would-be suitors, while the trio’s take on Prince’s gender-fluid “If I Was Your Girlfriend” adds new dimensions to the already iconic track. Throughout <i>CrazySexyCool</i>, the three distinct personalities, voices, and attitudes that make up TLC come through clearer than ever, making for a remarkably cohesive and assured effort.\n\nThe group is helped, of course, by some top-tier production. Dallas Austin, the studio architect behind much of <i>Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip</i>, returns here with a handful of notable cuts—including “Creep”—as does hip-hop hitmaker Jermaine Dupri. And Babyface helms some of <i>CrazySexyCool</i>’s most memorable R&B moments, including the intimate “Diggin’ On You” and “Red Light Special.” Yet it’s the Organized Noize production team that bolsters the album’s remarkable second half, featuring the still-ubiquitous motivational hit “Waterfalls,” and the forward-thinking closing track “Sumthin’ Wicked This Way Comes.” And the guest list for this provocative party includes such vanguard rappers as Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest’s Phife Dawg, and a <i>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</i>-period André 3000. Their presence on <i>CrazySexyCool</i> was a clear nod to the trio’s hard-earned hip-hop dominance—and further proof that no 1990s act could mix sounds and styles as effectively, and as joyously, as TLC."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/crazysexycool-30th-anniversary-edition/1777307230","playParams":{"id":"1777307230","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1777307230/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"17360","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/17360?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1731684591416}}},"1777486722":{"id":"1777486722","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1777486722?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/83/ea/8483eaa5-c7e1-c67e-e88a-fe94a0ea92f7/b4886c33-d906-4d93-be55-7a261a4c5a57.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"333232","textColor2":"3a312d","textColor4":"605955","textColor1":"020101","bgColor":"f8f8f7","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/81/11/44/81114476-2850-5148-b702-673a908ab57c/46a71ce5-990f-4a8e-9db3-8689ae33f145.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"393534","textColor2":"211a16","textColor4":"413c39","textColor1":"161210","bgColor":"c2c2c2","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/27/93/2d/27932df6-07ce-1f14-68d9-676342cdebb2/e74ec38a-6270-40c8-a7ea-d9c01662071b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"45403c","textColor2":"2d2823","textColor4":"514c48","textColor1":"1e1814","bgColor":"e0dfde","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/a%24ap-ferg/582346993","name":"DAROLD","artistName":"A$AP Ferg","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1b/ad/80/1bad80ad-ec2e-c065-72f0-58bbf03eeea7/196872451993.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"46413f","textColor2":"231b16","textColor4":"4f4845","textColor1":"171210","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Back in the 2010s, the A$AP Mob was a force to be reckoned with in hip-hop. Masterminded by A$AP Yams, the Harlem-based, fashion-centric crew helped redefine what a New York rapper could look and sound like. But in the 2020s, most of the members had spun off into their respective lanes, not the least of whom being A$AP Ferg. Having apparently shed half of his moniker and capitalized the rest, he makes his full-length return four years after the <i>Floor Seats II</i> mixtape, offering some insight into the artist—and the man—he grew into.\n\nAfter pledging his neighborhood allegiance alongside fellow Harlemites DD Osama and Bloody Osiris on the dizzying opener “Light Work,” Ferg gets straight to it over the Lex Luger/Mike WiLL Made-It co-production “Thought I Was Dead.” With proof of life now well established, plus the added benefit of a Dapper Dan introduction, he recounts on “Alive :( ” how he unplugged from online life and took inventory of himself, leading to meditative introspection as well as self-destructive whims. Some might find it surprising to learn the erstwhile Hood Pope came to resent what fame did to him, but these reflective revelations seem to have improved his New York state of mind.\n\nThat said, he hasn’t rejected the rich-rapper lifestyle wholesale, evident on the not-so-humble brags of “Messy.” On “Casting Spells,” he flips the perspective to a more critical lens, offering rare scrutiny in verse of a cultural propensity towards materialism and superficiality. Indeed, he aims to do something good with what he’s got, a message summarized amid the grieving of “Dead Homies.” Elsewhere, Southern rap royals Future and Denzel Curry commune with Ferg in their unique ways on “Allure” and “Demons,” respectively, reaffirming his Trap Lord bona fides. Yet <i>DAROLD</i> finds him just as likely to connect with soulful singers as rappers, with the inimitable Mary J. Blige joining for two songs, including the hopeful “Chosen.” Assured of his own greatness and his accomplishments thus far, he says it with his whole chest on the righteous closing track.","short":"Four years after Floor Seats II, the Hood Pope returns with some wisdom.

On the 2024 sequel, though, the duo opt to mostly handle things themselves, with Nudy riding high off the success of his 2023 album <i>Gumbo</i> and Pi’erre in a similar boat following his decision to release some of his rarest snippets in an EP titled <i>Grails</i>.\n\nWith a sole feature from BabyDrill, <i>Sli’merre 2</i> is entirely centered on Nudy’s flow and the way he wraps himself in the warm, synth- and bass-heavy beats from Pi’erre. The Atlanta-born rapper remains as defiantly playful as ever, dedicating an entire track entitled “Money” to “trying to break” his bank account, and another that finds him explaining how little he
