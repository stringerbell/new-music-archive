Album and Interview","standard":"The first time ROSÉ was interviewed about her debut solo album, she burst into tears. “I ended up crying for the whole 30 minutes,” the K-pop singer recounts to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “It was not a smooth ride, and it just showed how much time and effort and blood, sweat, and tears I actually did put into it.” ROSÉ was born in New Zealand to Korean parents and raised in Australia, shooting to global fame in 2016 as one-fourth of the mega-successful girl group BLACKPINK. The 12-track <i>rosie</i>, which is what she’s called by her friends and loved ones, is, as she says, both a “time capsule” and a “therapy session”—a raw chronicle of her twenties as she’s still experiencing them, and an opportunity to be more personal than K-pop artists often get to be.\n\n“It's just what I talk about with my friends and family, put into an album so that we can all share it and hopefully my fans feel closer to me,” she says. On “toxic till the end,” the singer makes a clear mid-track announcement—“Ladies and gentlemen/I present to you the ex”—before getting even more vulnerable with the world: “I’ll never forgive you for one thing, my dear/You wasted my prettiest years.” \n\nWhile much of <i>rosie</i> explores the complexities of romantic heartbreak, ROSÉ also delves into other, lighter subjects. “APT.,” a collaboration with Bruno Mars, gets its name from a popular Korean drinking game ROSÉ played in her early twenties. The infinitely energetic pop-rock track shot to the top of the global pop charts upon its release, ushering in <i>rosie</i> along with the subsequent pre-release track “number one girl,” co-written and co-produced by Mars. In the latter, ROSÉ recounts the emotional spiral brought about by a night spent scrolling through social media judgments. Though the pop piano ballad is about superstardom (“Tell me that I’m special/Tell me I look pretty/Tell me I’m a little angel/Sweetheart of your city”), it also “represents every toxic relationship,” she says.\n\nWhile long work hours and a life in the public eye may weigh on ROSÉ, as evidenced by some of <i>rosie</i>’s most visceral moments, music is another one of ROSÉ’s love stories. “At the end of the day, it’s what I love to do,” she says, “and that’s the only thing that makes me feel alive and a person.”\n","short":"The BLACKPINK star’s solo debut is a “time capsule” and a “therapy

Mini Album","standard":"Ten months after the release of chart-topping mini album <i>With YOU-th</i>, K-pop group TWICE released <i>STRATEGY</i>. The 14th mini album in their near decade-long career leads with the English-language “Strategy,” a smooth song outlining the pop powerhouses’ ultra-confident seduction plan: “I got you on my radar, soon you're gonna be with me/My strategy, strategy will getcha, getcha, baby.” Megan Thee Stallion, who is becoming increasingly prolific as a K-pop collaborator, features on the main version of the title track, lending her precise flow to TWICE’s buoyant pop: “I'm a man-eater, you just a light snack/I got him pressed like he's workin' on his triceps.” The K-pop collaboration is a follow-up to TWICE’s feature on the Houston rapper’s “Mamushi” remix, also released in 2024. \n\nElsewhere on the seven-track album, TWICE gives their fans, known as ONCE, a holiday gift with the seasonally minded love song “Magical”: “I always hated the winter season/My heart was right on the brink of freezing/Then you came around and suddenly/It's like I'm never gonna be cold again.” Notably, TWICE member Dahyun co-wrote the lyrics for “Keeper,” one of three tracks (in addition to “Like It Like It” and “Sweetest Obsession”) that feature Korean-language lyrics. \n","short":"Megan Thee Stallion guests on

Dumb Immature","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Betty Taylor","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Pairing brightly chiming melodies with casually biting lyrics, Sunshine Coast quartet Betty Taylor leaves a lasting impression on its debut EP. Formed in 2022 as the duo of guitarist/vocalists Sophie Patrick and Kayla Smart, the band soon picked up bassist Claire Chittick and drummer Katie Ishaque and quickly began getting traction for dreamy indie pop that packs a real dose of empowerment. “I don’t need saving,” Patrick announces on the anti-sugarcoating anthem “Glitter,” during which she also tells the song’s subject that she’d rather have sex alone than have them come around. “Gaslighter” similarly takes its target to task without flinching, while the closing “Fuck You” is lighter and jauntier in sound but pointedly counters the title phrase with a regretful “I’m still in love with you,” Buoyed by spacious production from Aidan Hogg (G Flip, Jaguar Jonze), <i>Young Dumb Immature</i> sees Betty Taylor equally comfortable channeling the wide-screen scope of The War on Drugs on “Stallin’” or laying down a heady sheen of effects on “Hollow” and the self-possessed title track. The latter takes stock of past criticisms and turns them into a badge of honor, as Patrick repeats back the insults with stubborn pride. This is a promising debut indeed.","short":"The Sunshine Coast quartet dishes out punchy, irreverent indie

YoungBoy, it’s safe to assume that the circumstances are dire. Compared to his mind-bogglingly prolific output in recent years (one album and six mixtapes in 2022, two albums and two mixtapes in 2023), the Baton Rouge rapper’s relative silence in 2024 spoke volumes. YB had initially set the release date for his seventh studio album (and the last under his Motown contract) in April. But days before the album’s intended release, he was arrested on a number of charges, spending much of the year in a Utah county jail.\n\nNevertheless, <i>I Just Got a Lot on My Shoulders</i>, whose release was prompted by a recent hack of YB’s iCloud, presents the rapper as a complicated antihero—a 25-year-old man carrying the weight of the world. He battles familiar demons late at night on “Killa Season,” snarling, “I ain’t never happy, I’m evil as fuck.” His semi-recent turn to Mormonism seems to have curdled as he returns to his old vices on “Catch Me” and “Never Stopping.” And yet he’s still speaking directly to those in the struggle on songs like “Hope You Make It,” where he quotes an old refrain from his late grandmother: “All you need is faith.”","short":"The prolific Baton Rouge rapper emerges after a (relatively) quiet spell."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/19/eb/9e/19eb9ecc-9093-a0c8-6c12-643dc0b88938/198704089374_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"33070a","textColor2":"151616","textColor4":"42181b","textColor1":"020101","bgColor":"f8202f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-just-got-a-lot-on-my-shoulders/1778764078","playParams":{"id":"1778764078","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Jr8lg2QUD5oY8hCsnPYEi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1778764078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168822104","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168822104?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1733485030266,"RTCI":0}}},"1779112223":{"id":"1779112223","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779112223?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Folk","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gavn/1351519782","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Forevergreen -

The British pop star released her third album <i>Radical Optimism</i>—on which she realized her long-held dream of working with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker—and headlined Glastonbury Festival, something else she’d been “manifesting” since the start of her career. Then, in October, she ticked off another major moment: this performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall. Here, alongside the 53-piece Heritage Orchestra, conducted by Ben Foster, and a 14-person-strong choir, Lipa performs <i>Radical Optimism</i> start to finish, followed by some of her best moments—from “Be the One” and her 2023 <i>Barbie</i> smash “Dance the Night” to <i>Future Nostalgia</i>’s excellent “Love Again” (its “My Woman” sample performed by horns) and “Levitating.” Plus, there’s a Cleo Sol cover (“Sunshine”) and an appearance from actual Elton John, who joins her on stage for their 2021 megahit “Cold Heart.” \n\n<i>Radical Optimism</i> was an album of golden, breezy, and psychedelia-inspired pop, yet here, its songs take on a grand, cinematic quality, with an almost Bond-theme edge to “Houdini” or “Training Season.” As the album’s songs are bolstered with strings and horns, Lipa delivers performances both towering (on the galloping earworm “Falling Forever,” for example) and intimate, as on the stripped-back “Anything for Love.” Then Lipa switches gear, intent on getting the party started (and it works; just listen to the crowd reaction as “Dance the Night” opens, complete with live disco strings). By the time Lipa ends her set with “Don’t Start Now,” accompanied by the choir <i>and</i> an audience sing-along, this Royal Albert Hall performance feels like a joyous celebration for a British pop star who spent 2024 achieving her dreams. “An unforgettable night” indeed, as Lipa puts it herself as this show closes out.","short":"Hear Dua cap off a milestone year live from the Royal Albert Hall."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0e/c1/57/0ec1575f-5153-ac4b-d578-c5fa3a90bfe1/5021732511676.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cf2d2e","textColor2":"f60417","textColor4":"cb0313","textColor1":"fc3839","bgColor":"1c0201","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dua-lipa-live-from-the-royal-albert-hall/1779948675","playParams":{"id":"1779948675","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2zSqnTr0gSXrSlPbHzLfJS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779948675/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1031397873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1031397873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1733480778768,"RTCI":0}}},"1779996592":{"id":"1779996592","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779996592?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Christian"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/derek-minor/557013051","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Resist The System! -

never a bad thing, particularly for fans who grew up alongside the beloved rapper’s melancholy melodies. His third (and ostensibly final) posthumous album, released just shy of the five-year anniversary of his tragic death in 2019, fills the void with 18 more tracks of misfit music. The themes of <i>The Party Never Ends</i> are familiar: doomed love, vicious cycles, numbing out, and fighting demons, sung in an anguished warble over emo-inflected trap beats. But it’s profoundly chilling to hear Juice deliver lines like “Oxycodone knows my soul, makes me whole/Death melodies on my stereo” (“Oxycodone”), or when he concludes on “Misfit,” “I was pretty cool in my last life.” Nor does it feel much like a party when Eminem, one of Juice’s biggest inspirations, recounts his own struggles with addiction on “Lace It”: “Do not think I take it for granted that I’m still here, synthetic heroin, you/Tried to kill me, then you murdered Jarad, didn’t you?” Then he warns young listeners: “I ain’t lecturing you but, man, just be careful.”","short":"Five years after his passing, a final LP from the Chicago emo-rap legend."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0f/c8/a3/0fc8a3b6-7f8e-0c8d-6621-ff0d381f2496/24UM1IM10947.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9ccca","textColor2":"d4904d","textColor4":"aa733e","textColor1":"fcfffd","bgColor":"000003","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-party-never-ends/1781129434","playParams":{"id":"1781129434","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7kOpqRCEqTTzcGc4CwEFph"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781129434/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1368733420","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1368733420?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1733490617792,"RTCI":0}}},"1781206929":{"id":"1781206929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781206929?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-05","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1558712322-1680995393","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Castle in the Sky -

Still, as much as some might want another “Pull Up,” this second installment reflects his growth and development over a diverse production palette. \n\nMenacingly dark and razor-sharp cuts like “Fuck Opps” and “Watch Me Ball, Pt. 2” speak to his tenure as a drill ambassador, while “Any Other Way” speaks frankly on pain with a street poet’s perspective. A young veteran of the game with plenty to say, he mostly eschews features; an exception is the ominous “Outside” with GloRilla and Mello Buckzz.

something that, across decades of performing, has always seemed to come naturally to him. “You come to my show, you’ll get some technique, you’ll get some hip-hop, and you’ll get something that probably makes you want to go home and make love to your person,” he told Apple Music just ahead of the release of <i>Let Go</i>, the first of three Apple Music-exclusive projects he released in 2024. “It’s literally my personality. Anybody that knows me is like, ‘He doesn’t change when he is onstage,’ and I think that’s what people gravitate to: the honesty of my music.”\n\nIf you’ve not had the chance to hear him live, now would be your best opportunity to right that wrong, with the exclusive four-song set Glasper performed for Apple Music at New York’s famed Electric Lady Studios. With a couple of his most trusted collaborators—drummer Justin Tyson, bassist Burniss Travis, and DJ Jahi Sundance—Glasper delivers one-of-a-kind renditions of three songs from his Apple Music partnership, along with the debut performance of “Never Too Late,” a track that features Glasper himself on lead vocals. Make yourself comfortable and bask in the musicality and charm that has kept Glasper selling out shows the world over for decades now.\n","short":"The pianist and composer delivers an intimate performance from NYC."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ad/b9/59/adb95999-221c-8bc2-003c-24564bc007ec/24CRGIM46957.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d6d0ce","textColor2":"dedcda","textColor4":"bbb5b1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"33180c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-sessions-ep/1781983447","playParams":{"id":"1781983447","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781983447/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4643652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4643652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1733457888969,"RTCI":0}}},"1781990508":{"id":"1781990508","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781990508?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Holiday","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/koe-wetzel/1139953953","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/99/5a/0f995a2e-2ac8-e95e-a808-dc518d3d1763/2b9118e7-e434-4fa5-b180-b03620196eaa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bab8be","textColor2":"d6e2ea","textColor4":"b2babf","textColor1":"e0e0e8","bgColor":"241c16","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e0/16/c7/e016c7a9-f3f1-675f-b760-b66af4bb6c21/b2c40bc0-846a-46ef-833f-c1ccd8afaa1a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfb39c","textColor2":"e7c0a4","textColor4":"c6a791","textColor1":"f3cfb3","bgColor":"404244","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e6/23/a9/e623a9ea-bd49-8aff-dd1b-863c3760d7fd/00cc4b26-ccd9-41d7-8107-d358ed74ae0e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cbaf94","textColor2":"e0be9c","textColor4":"bba084","textColor1":"f4d2af","bgColor":"282727","hasP3":false}},"name":"Koe Wetzel Presents... Wetzel's Wonderland Chapter 2","artistName":"Koe Wetzel","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Koe Wetzel knows how to have a good time, so it’s not a stretch for the famously rowdy, hard-partying country artist to bring that energy to the holiday season, too. On this expansion of 2023’s <i>Wetzel’s Wonderland</i> collection, the “High Road” hitmaker sets his sights on another handful of Christmas classics, reimagining them with the bold bravado that characterizes his broader catalog. The EP kicks off with Wetzel’s spoken-word performance of “’Twas the Night Before Christmas,” which, with Wetzel’s charismatic and spirited delivery, sets the stage for the fun to come. “Run Run Rudolph” gets a faithful treatment, retaining the driving energy of the Chuck Berry original while cranking up the distortion to fit Wetzel’s rock-heavy sound. “Please Come Home for Christmas” is a vocal showcase for Wetzel, who leans into the soulful side of his big, booming voice while reminding he has a compelling softer side, too. The project closes on an emotional note with a slowly building performance of the Bing Crosby classic “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” that makes the most of Wetzel’s impressive range.

That should be obvious to anyone familiar with the Sonoran singer’s growing catalog of work, the genuine love for these sounds and the traditions that guide them evident on his studio recordings as well as some rousing live albums. Meant as a heartfelt return to genre roots following 2024’s hour-long <i>Boca Chueca, Vol. 1</i>, this album brought him back to his hometown of Hermosillo to record. With some curatorial guidance from hitmaking figure Edgar Barrera, <i>Palabra De To’s</i> primarily favors Mexican songwriters to pay overt homage while perpetuating his country’s musical legacy.\n\nDespite the Last Supper theme conjured by the cover art, these 16 tracks are largely devoid of collaborations, with the welcome exception of Luis Mexia on the self-aware “Ocupo Una Limpia.” As such, León’s performances take on a certain intimacy, unhurried by obligations and unencumbered by distractions. On opener “Enséñame,” his reliably robust voice shakes under the sheer weight of sentiments as it beauteously approaches falsetto. Though he regains his strength on the powerful “Lado Frágil,” vulnerable moments nonetheless abound. Throughout the album, he shows off different aspects of his range: a rakish romantic on “Modo Zombie,” a heartbroken hero on “El Amor De Mi Herida,” a dour drinker on “El Curioso.” The longing suffused through closer “Eres Y Serás” grows in size during its instrumental break, the harmonica saying more than even he could sing.\n","short":"An intimate return to roots, recorded with Edgar Barrera in Hermosillo."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/e6/11/c9e6117e-5db5-e5db-29df-6ca26ef4870e/00198704274855_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"bfb59b","textColor2":"e7ac77","textColor4":"be8e62","textColor1":"e8ddbe","bgColor":"1e1711","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palabra-de-tos/1783127481","playParams":{"id":"1783127481","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZzClIM2jdVPjt7HBICDQP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783127481/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1370196486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1370196486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1733488374221,"RTCI":0}}},"1783389761":{"id":"1783389761","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783389761?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-06","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/khalid/82842423","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fe/93/81/fe938189-0a73-e9fe-6c83-fcfbdb59440d/92ca6622-7f37-4aca-86ca-b60f30697a8b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afb0ac","textColor2":"d7aa8a","textColor4":"b08d72","textColor1":"d6d6d2","bgColor":"131812","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a5/5a/c5/a55ac5e9-d281-ddc0-8a6b-1f6204df5f00/533361fa-4f9b-4829-b118-7aaf3359b5d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0b3b1","textColor2":"c8cbc1","textColor4":"a1a39b","textColor1":"dcdedd","bgColor":"040503","hasP3":false}},"name":"Sincere (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Khalid","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Khalid’s journey into the music industry began at 19 with the release of his acclaimed debut album <i>American Teen</i>—a coming-of-age story filled with the trials and tribulations of burgeoning adolescence. Khalid’s unfiltered lyricism and earnest portrayal of adolescent frustrations and anxieties resonated with many and propelled him to stardom. At 21, he released <i>Free Spirit</i>, a soulful meditation that saw the singer-songwriter shedding the naivety of his teenage years and marking his first step into adulthood. Half a decade after <i>Free Spirit</i>, Khalid is back and better than ever and ready to show his fans his growth with the release of his third studio LP, <i>Sincere</i>. “I needed to take that break,” he tells Apple Music. “I needed to stop. And I don’t look at it in a place of being afraid to come back. If I’m going to take this break, when I come back, I’ll come back with more clarity. I’ll come back with a better choice of decisions, more maturity, more knowledge.”\n\nOn <i>Sincere</i>, Khalid proudly shows off that new knowledge, drawing inspiration from life experiences over five years and showcasing his evolution not only as an artist but as a person as well. “It was a very difficult process in naming this album, because I had to find one that summed up what I really felt in this music,” he says. “I thought of it as my most vulnerable in a while, because when I’m thinking of these songs, I’m saving them over the year like, ‘Okay, no, I have to keep this.’ And that’s vulnerable because I’ve known the songs’ impact on me when I was in the studio. I believe that if I trust my intention and I trust my heart, then it’ll have a similar impact to my listener.”\n\nThroughout the album’s 16 tracks, Khalid shares intimate vignettes about the lessons he’s learned, whether it’s about heartbreak (“It’s All Good,” “Broken,” “Tainted”), loneliness (“Who’s There to Pick Me Up,” “Decline”), or falling in love (“Adore U,” “Altitude”). However, not every song on the project is about love lost: Khalid is introspective on the soul-searching and dreamy track “Ground,” where he details his experience with psychedelics due to feeling uncertain within his career. On the Arlo Parks duet “Breathe,” Khalid is transparent as he yearns for freedom from the darkness of his mind. “When I listen to this album, you can see the time that it took,” he says. “You can see the time.”\n\nOn the deluxe edition of <i>Sincere</i>, Khalid adds six new tracks that feature collaborations with Normani (“Personal”), Chlöe (“MIA”), and Nigerian singer-songwriter Ayra Starr (“Make It Up to You”). \n","short":"Normani, Chlöe, and Ayra Starr join the singer-songwriter on his expanded
