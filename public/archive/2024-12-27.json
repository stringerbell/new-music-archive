faith and religion nonetheless manifests via the lyrics of many of its more notable artists. Among them, DMX became known to his true fans for his declarative sermons almost as much as his distinctive Yonkers bark. On <i>Let Us Pray: Chapter X</i>, his second posthumous project after 2021’s guest-heavy <i>Exodus</i>, a handful of his hip-hop homilies find fresh arrangements by Warryn Campbell and high-profile support from guest vocalists. Though Killer Mike is the first to take the pulpit, on “Favor,” the late Earl Simmons soon emerges with gratitude and gravitas, backed by powerful choir callbacks from Mary Mary. Christian rap star Lecrae gives glory to God on “Bear With Me” before X, in turn, offers his own words of gratitude. His voice booms on “One Life To Do It” with MC Lyte and quavers on “Until I’m Gone” with Snoop Dogg. Instrumentals for all four songs follow, leaving space for the listener’s own prayers.","short":"The late rapper’s homilies reimagined fresh arrangements and guest verses."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/fe/1f/95fe1fda-836e-511e-a3f3-ac401d7f368e/24UM1IM04186.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb8f77","textColor2":"e2905a","textColor4":"be774c","textColor1":"dfad91","bgColor":"2c1611","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-us-pray-chapter-x/1771537436","playParams":{"id":"1771537436","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Uwc1AZZlUPPjq5tifmpug"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771537436/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"135710","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/135710?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1734948527774,"RTCI":0}}},"1771741897":{"id":"1771741897","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771741897?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c3/de/70/c3de70ee-d9e3-2f13-eb02-27f205406350/Job77e6250f-fcef-451f-9c79-220e68112027-181149260-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_354083629_1982229892-Time1733438252820.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fdcfa8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3c1c6","textColor2":"fdcfa8","textColor4":"cba686","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3c/d5/6c/3cd56ce2-bff4-087d-2e0c-69255964c3a5/Job3f6451d6-0726-451b-8466-403d625324f8-181149261-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_354083630_1982229891-Time1733440925343.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","bfcccf"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c4c5c7","textColor2":"bfcccf","textColor4":"9aa4a6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b1/fb/14/b1fb14fb-bb63-c014-1508-6745f0133b29/ee1aae11-e898-4788-aeca-a7841bab01b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"9ca0a3","textColor2":"dfa68e","textColor4":"b98b78","textColor1":"bcc0c4","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5e/a9/ba/5ea9ba84-5f18-525e-7da8-7253cc362ca6/d9e98e6d-6f9e-44c4-8c59-51053572b003.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0a39b","textColor2":"da8765","textColor4":"b26f54","textColor1":"ecc8bd","bgColor":"141111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=418259765-1085268304","name":"LUCKY HER","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Mozzy & Kalan.FrFr","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In a year full of West Coast hip-hop greatness, with California very much centered, Sacramento’s own Mozzy has played a not-insignificant role. His two substantial outings, <i>CHILDREN OF THE SLUMS</i> and the guest-heavy <i>BRASH DUMMIES<i>, seemed to further validate the successes he enjoyed during his mid-2010s breakout. No stranger to a collaborative project, he links with the highly skilled Kalan.FrFr for <i>LUCKY HER<i>, a 10-track effort that sonically bridges the Bay and LA. Thematically, women consume their respective focuses, right from jump on the Rob49-assisted opener “BBL.” Streetwise romantics frequently pervade these proceedings, with Mozzy’s gruff confidence merging effortlessly with Kalan’s melodic delivery on cuts like “EGGS IN THE MORNING” and “MY HOOD.” On the guest front, Skilla Baby brings a cautious cool to the jazz-inflected “SIZE ME UP,” while Shordie Shordie finds a suitable pocket amid the subversively playful metaphors of “EULOGY.”</i></i></i></i>","short":"The Bay meets LA on this melodic yet streetwise

A decade after the EDM boom, and a few years out of lockdown’s subdued haze, dance music reestablished its footing as a playground of experimentation. Stadiums and festivals filled with adventurous cross-pollinators like Jamie xx, John Summit, and RÜFÜS DU SOL, while underground clubs pulsed with sounds that defied easy categorization, courtesy of innovators like horsegiirL and Yanamaste. Really, the year was about reclaiming electronic music’s core ethos: providing a space of communal creativity that refuses to be put in a box. In that spirit, Apple Music invited DJs and producers from all corners of the scene to create exclusive DJ mixes for New Year’s Eve. They’re bold, boundary-pushing, and full of surprises.

2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Stacey Hotwaxx Hale","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"In 2024, electronic music entered a new creative era. A decade after the EDM boom, and a few years out of lockdown’s subdued haze, dance music reestablished its footing as a playground of experimentation. Stadiums and festivals filled with adventurous cross-pollinators like Jamie xx, John Summit, and RÜFÜS DU SOL, while underground clubs pulsed with sounds that defied easy categorization, courtesy of innovators like horsegiirL and Yanamaste. Really, the year was about reclaiming electronic music’s core ethos: providing a space of communal creativity that refuses to be put in a box. In that spirit, Apple Music invited DJs and producers from all corners of the scene to create exclusive DJ mixes for New Year’s Eve. They’re bold, boundary-pushing, and full of surprises. Have a listen and add your favorites to your library.","short":"The Detroit legend spins groovy house and techno for a special night."},"artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5b/61/06/5b61060c-2af4-98da-5f95-0a423a4231d7/4b5ba460-eacc-440a-8f00-99947c1de717.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2b2b2b","textColor2":"282828","textColor4":"4c4b4b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"dadbdb","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nye-2025-dj-mix/1782199313","playParams":{"id":"1782199313","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782199313/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1697213552","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1697213552?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735058928449,"RTCI":0}}},"1782338118":{"id":"1782338118","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782338118?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/imminence/405241524","name":"The Reclamation of I","artistName":"Imminence","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/8a/62/ca/8a62cae3-60bb-dade-8c75-7fd3cface4ac/199066053584.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a8bbbc","textColor2":"a8e2de","textColor4":"86b4b2","textColor1":"d3eaeb","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-reclamation-of-i/1782338118","playParams":{"id":"1782338118","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1lLhbY9YaNZzxVSJm5ygjf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782338118/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"405241524","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/405241524?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735301412083,"RTCI":0}}},"1782345790":{"id":"1782345790","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782345790?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-01","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/04/46/8c/04468c1e-b2ff-f5a5-7714-56177d0bc668/92edbf47-5551-4559-979a-50e80a81918e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2b2b2c","textColor2":"0a0a0a","textColor4":"2b2b2c","textColor1":"0a0a0a","bgColor":"b0b1b2","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/90/dd/a9/90dda94c-39c7-25c7-d10d-122ecc08037a/fc8b8292-95b9-4bfe-8217-600dd4e6e68b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2d2f2e","textColor2":"090909","textColor4":"2d2f2e","textColor1":"090909","bgColor":"bdc4c2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-cure/566519","name":"Songs Of A Lost World + Songs Of A Live World: Troxy London MMXXIV","artistName":"The Cure","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"“I know that my world is grown old,” Robert Smith says in “And Nothing Is Forever,” one of the many standout tracks on The Cure’s 14th studio album and first in 16 years. <i>Songs of a Lost World</i> deals almost exclusively in death, dying, and the relentless march of time; the songs move slowly, and many go on for minutes before Smith opens his mouth. There’s no pop hits, no hooks, and—let’s face it—no fun. It’s also some of the band’s most engrossing work, a statement that, like most great Cure songs, can’t be taken lightly.\n\nThe glacially paced opener and lead single, “Alone,” is majestic and mournful, with string swells and apocalyptic lyrics about birds falling out of the sky. But mostly it’s about dying alone, the shattered pieces of a regret-filled life, and the forgone conclusion that is our mutual demise: “This is the end of every song that we sing.” On “A Fragile Thing,” a plinking piano gives way to a thudding bassline as Smith sings of heartbreak, distance, and fait accompli. It might be the closest the album comes to vintage ’80s Cure, but now the 65-year-old Smith’s customarily downbeat lyrics come with the weight of lived wisdom and cruel inevitability. “Warsong” twists the screws with a churning, droning meditation on domestic battles and bitter regret; at a bit over four minutes, it’s also the shortest song on the album.\n\n“Drone:Nodrone” is the catchiest and most upbeat of the bunch—musically speaking, anyway. Smith’s lyrics are no picnic, of course. They’re not a completely hopeless death spiral, but they certainly acknowledge a tumultuous relationship: “The answers that I have are not the answers that you want” and “I can’t anymore/If I ever really could.” The track also features squalling guitar leads from former Tin Machine/David Bowie sideman Reeves Gabrels, who joined The Cure in 2012 but makes his first studio appearance with the band here. “I Can Never Say Goodbye” laments the death of Smith’s brother Richard with the refrain “Something wicked this way comes,” a phrase from Shakespeare popularized by the title of Ray Bradbury’s influential 1962 novel. (The Cure debuted the song in concert in 2022 in Poland, where Richard Smith apparently lived for many years.) Like much of <i>Lost World</i>, it’s a tearjerker.\n\nWith all this loss and mortality, <i>Songs of a Lost World</i> recalls Bowie’s 2016 swan song, <i>Blackstar</i>. Finishing an album about death with a sprawling, gorgeous track called “Endsong” isn’t necessarily ominous, but who knows? For what it’s worth, Smith is already promising a follow-up to <i>Songs of a Lost World</i>. Hopefully, it won’t take 16 years.","short":"Robert Smith and co.’s 2024 comeback album, plus live versions of each

Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—it brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This mix, curated by the UK electronic duo Punctual, will help you stay locked in during your next gym session. “We start this mix with our lighter, more fun tracks to help you hit the ground running, and we get deeper and more vibey throughout the mix to take you on a journey before building to a crescendo at the end,” Will Lansley tells Apple Music. “Music can really help with motivation, and it can also be a great distraction from the burn, so getting it right is important.” Among their favorite tracks? Lansley gives a shout-out to the duo’s own songs “We Could Have It All” (“It has a dark and emotional combination of synths and vocals that we just love,” he says) and “Heaven Knows” with Kaskade and Poppy Baskcomb.

success of his 2024 hit single “Get in with Me” really put numbers on the board for the Florida rap phenom. Following his <i>Mr Beat the Road</i> project from earlier in the year, <i>Dlow Curry</i> is a game-winning buzzer-beater from the logo. After likening himself to a certain point guard on the title track, he backs it up with skillful braggadocio on booming cuts like “The Biggest Pt. 2,” “Dlow Gucci,” and “Star Life.” While most of the tracks rightfully center him, he does get some notable support on the proverbial court. He’s joined by New York rap royalty on two occasions here—first by Bronx drill princess Ice Spice on the mellowed “Pillsbury Dlow” and then by Coke Boys don French Montana for the effortlessly swaggering “Mo Chicken.” Elsewhere, he trades off with Lil Baby and NoCap on “PJ” and “What You Need,” respectively, reminding that the South still has something to say.","short":"The Florida rap phenom shoots a game-winning buzzer-beater from deep."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a9/77/36/a977361a-ff20-d994-55bd-b6c935d98f2a/196872707458.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ebcccc","textColor2":"fffbe7","textColor4":"ebc9b8","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"9e0200","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dlow-curry/1783609512","playParams":{"id":"1783609512","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2KtiNduXFIrpZG2nQuboD4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783609512/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1474308236","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1474308236?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735304931559,"RTCI":0}}},"1783621777":{"id":"1783621777","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783621777?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/connie-diiamond/1036380009","name":"Underdog Szn: BRB","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Connie Diiamond","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bb/57/ae/bb57aea4-f63d-9cdc-161e-a25c44b7c899/24UM1IM35170.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0bcc0","textColor2":"e8ddd3","textColor4":"c1b9b1","textColor1":"e7e1e6","bgColor":"26272b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/underdog-szn-brb/1783621777","playParams":{"id":"1783621777","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1PVdtnjL3k4VoIiL3x5Glb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783621777/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1036380009","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1036380009?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735338443186,"RTCI":0}}},"1783811280":{"id":"1783811280","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783811280?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-13","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/59/70/0e/59700ed0-c226-264b-e1c9-e051de5865c4/Job6322edc4-d75c-4ca4-a89c-7290bac866e0-181669328-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_355260215_1990514280-Time1734104495162.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","a5da4f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"94b064","textColor2":"a5da4f","textColor4":"84ae43","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/16/4d/11/164d11c5-8122-0301-d02a-ec674adfb424/Job24c2cd25-a7d6-43d5-b722-47ed0c8b7fd8-181669329-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_355260216_1990514279-Time1734105766204.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"b3adc2","textColor2":"acde61","textColor4":"8bb253","textColor1":"ddd8ec","bgColor":"0a031a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=250063874-28446224","name":"The Skeleton Key","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Roc Marciano & The Alchemist","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Roc Marciano has always kept his list of collaborators to a limited few. Across his discography, plenty of work is self-produced, and projects that feature outside help are contained; the list basically ends after Animoss, Chuck Strangers, Jake One, and the occasional beat from Q-Tip or Knxwledge. But The Alchemist seems to join in on the fun more often than the rest, cooking up a few beats on a number of Roc Marci projects, in addition to serving as the only producer on 2022’s <i>The Elephant Man’s Bones</i> and 2024’s <i>The Skeleton Key</i>. On the latter, the formula stays the same: Alc cooks up hazy, stoned grooves filled with psychedelic drum fills (“Street Magic”) and lush soul samples (“Skirt Steak”), while Marci takes listeners back to his childhood on Long Island and his experiences as a leading figure in New York’s rap underground. At 10 tracks and with zero features, <i>The Skeleton Key</i> is Roc Marciano and The Alchemist pure and uncut.","short":"Two underground gods link up for a subdued, considered affair."},"artwork":{"width":1920,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/48/b6/4c/48b64c69-3d2b-4377-32ac-3067bf78190e/764656053147_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1920,"textColor3":"bab6bc","textColor2":"ff3002","textColor4":"cc2606","textColor1":"e8e4e5","bgColor":"030015","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-skeleton-key/1783811280","playParams":{"id":"1783811280","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3o97J40gRWIoGO2Hnyez52"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783811280/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"250063874","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/250063874?l=en-US"},{"id":"28446224","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/28446224?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1734789913214,"RTCI":0}}},"1783828112":{"id":"1783828112","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783828112?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/04/aa/df/04aadfe4-72cf-3de3-af2a-5d01de59ff18/1b05bc84-fae4-4d72-9179-43b66079604b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c2ca","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"b79fc0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"3e204a","hasP3":false},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/11/1e/a4/111ea41c-0f78-b2fd-169f-1a911c79cb21/b6e1c08d-dd78-430f-8fe3-e4cb7655efa8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"46344d","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"55495a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"cac4cc","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cf/43/09/cf430916-a6a5-e358-4db8-db8e7c110c33/bd890b0c-3393-4ff1-aece-fb1dae05b8c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1800,"textColor3":"d7cedb","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c6b2cf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"714d82","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/1e/ce/a51ece8e-d955-d7bd-94e2-aa95c3fd7fc7/a10d9e73-39d1-4d93-916b-82394142c8a6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"dad3de","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c0a9c9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5f3470","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/17/51/d8/1751d8b9-405a-532b-c0b6-2424638289ef/8479fe5f-3a08-4b8c-a367-b7b0fe615e6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"393837","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"4b3a52","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"e4e2e5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ff/1f/78/ff1f7868-36cc-092a-7bf8-f367bb32a533/a3c5d364-3a84-4f3a-bc28-b40dee6590af.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"46344d","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"55495a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"cac4cc","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/erol-alkan/126014028","name":"NYE 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Erol Alkan","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"In 2024, electronic music entered a new creative era.

From the moment the former N.W.A member’s ostensibly solo debut <i>The Chronic</i> entered the zeitgeist, artists have repeatedly tried—and generally failed—to achieve the level of chemistry and clout generated by their seminal pairing. While they’ve stayed in each other’s orbit over the years, trading beats and bars on albums like Snoop’s 2006 <i>Tha Blue Carpet Treatment</i> and Dre’s 2015 <i>Compton</i>, the auspicious release of <i>Missionary</i> marks their first full-length team-up in more than three decades. Its title a clear nod to the 1993 West Coast masterpiece <i>Doggystyle</i>, this long-hoped-for album changes positions without losing the feeling.\n\nThough <i>Missionary</i> largely leaves the microphone duties to Snoop, it doesn’t take too long before he and Dre are sharing verses again, exuding music-mogul energy on “Outta Da Blue.” The good doctor, in turn, busts out the martial drumwork for “Hard Knocks” and puts a subtle spin on G-funk’s inherent groove on hard-hitting closer “The Negotiator.” Demonstrating the extraordinary pull both artists maintain in the industry, “Last Dance With Mary Jane” flips Tom Petty for a trip down Snoop’s own memory lane with some contemporary musings from Jelly Roll. In that same vein, they convene with Sting over “Another Part of Me,” an inventive interpolation of one of The Police’s rock classics. Golden Age peer Method Man comes through for the triumphant “Skyscrapers,” but a family reunion with both 50 Cent and Eminem on the slow and funky “Guns N Smoke” should evoke the strongest nostalgic vibes.","short":"The West Coast legends’ first full-length team-up in more than 30

opportunity to do something she doesn’t often have time for: capture her songs in new ways. “I get kind of excited thinking about all the different configurations they could be played in,” the singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “Between recording the record and live shows, there’s not always a lot of time or chances to perform the songs in alternative ways. But some of my favorite renditions of the songs don’t happen at a show but rather in a rehearsal or at home.” This session wasn’t actually recorded at home—it was captured at Hotel El Ganzo in Mexico, where she played a seven-day residency in October 2024—but it does harness the intimacy of just playing music with mates. “My friend and bandmate Jazzi Bobbi is playing the saxophone that you’re hearing, and my boyfriend Eli Smart is playing the second guitar,” says Yanya. \n\nThe session kicks off with her 2024 single “Like I Say (I Runaway)”—“I felt like this song was written for an acoustic version with two guitars… It’s refreshing to hear it without the drums and production, but the addition of the extra vocal really makes the chorus shine!”—and then moves on to a cover of PJ’s Harvey’s “Rid of Me.” “The song has been a favorite of mine to cover in recent years,” she says. “The obsession with it started in 2022 when I rediscovered ‘Rid of Me’ and realized it was one of those songs that had been playing in the back of my mind somewhere since I had first heard it when I was a teenager. I feel a lot more comfortable and confident sometimes playing this song rather than my own songs, which is unusual.” Tune in to Yanya’s raw, intimate session here. \n","short":"“Like I Say (I Runaway)” meets a PJ Harvey cover on an intimate session."},"artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e7/5e/a0/e75ea040-719a-d9f5-0cdb-5b047465c877/5054429202021.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"d2d2d2","textColor2":"fac4ab","textColor4":"cfa48f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple-music-sessions/1784801121","playParams":{"id":"1784801121","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784801121/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1102497241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1102497241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735254459648,"RTCI":0}}},"1784806167":{"id":"1784806167","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784806167?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a4/ae/f5/a4aef5a2-0f0a-0a48-0550-88a66384a68e/8da41ecd-412b-466e-9286-3729066dcaac.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9c9ca","textColor2":"f5c5ae","textColor4":"cba795","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"3d3d3d","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/02/09/69/020969b3-d16b-dd8b-9fc1-70a8fe81ce74/0cf384a7-8c30-4c40-98d3-b9e8c7603a47.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"d8d8d9","textColor2":"e8c5af","textColor4":"caaf9d","textColor1":"f9f9fa","bgColor":"555555","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/36/3f/e9/363fe94e-1682-c258-5c8e-dc0b076a6f6e/e962012e-d9a8-46d1-80f5-7c90efc0d4a9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d6d7d7","textColor2":"f6f6f7","textColor4":"d6d6d7","textColor1":"f6f7f7","bgColor":"545454","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/91/19/28/91192855-0c0f-b489-6acc-ae14a748ad3d/7593a4e3-a317-46bd-9854-88120c1de5ff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cbcbcc","textColor2":"e0b99f","textColor4":"c2a38e","textColor1":"ebebed","bgColor":"4a4a4a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/56/bd/88/56bd889f-6dbb-c9a7-86f5-15596ddc5f61/5ddcd043-bad8-4886-a616-75c49f8aa628.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"d7d7d7","textColor2":"f7f7f9","textColor4":"d6d6d7","textColor1":"f8f8f8","bgColor":"525252","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/r%C3%BCf%C3%BCs-du-sol/799587823","name":"NYE 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"RÜFÜS DU SOL","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Exclusive DJ Mix","standard":"In 2024, electronic music entered a new creative era.

Chalamet performed all the Bob Dylan songs live on set and for the soundtrack, daring to put his own stamp on nothing less than some of the most hallowed and scrutinized compositions in pop history. “It was the most unique challenge I’ve taken on, but where my confidence came through is eventually doing all the music live,” Chalamet tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Maybe it was the least responsible thing on the actor’s part because the music exists, and the performances exist.” But what is the ideal balance between imitation and interpretation? How do you satisfy an obsessive, far-reaching fandom that’s had more than six decades to calcify their ideas and sharpen their attention to detail while also engaging a younger audience for whom the draw may be the star rather than the subject?\n\nThe answer, my friends, is “Blowin’ in the Wind”: As familiar and canonical as anything in the American Songbook, it’s presented here, as it is in its original form, sparsely adorned with acoustic guitar as Chalamet offers just enough of Dylan’s most distinctive vocal tics and adenoidal stylings (“how many yeeeeeurhs...”) without veering into caricature. (“It’s not an impression Olympics,” Chalamet reminds.) This is the approach throughout, from the vocals to the arrangements in collaboration with music supervisor Nick Baxter—faithful enough to potentially give even the most ardent Dylanologist occasional pause, but insistent that this isn’t the project’s objective. Rather, the soundtrack is, in parlance that Dylan almost certainly would not himself use, a flex.\n\nThe (spoiler alert!) full-band electric songs from <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i> and <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> capture the originals’ ramshackle spirit, with Chalamet having some fun with “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,” “Like a Rolling Stone,” and “Subterranean Homesick Blues” in particular. And he’s not on his own: Monica Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez, harmonizes with Chalamet on a handful of songs and steps out front for “There but for Fortune,” “Silver Dagger,” and “House of the Rising Sun.” Edward Norton recreates Pete Seeger’s interpolation of “Wimoweh” (eventually better known as “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”) and Boyd Holbrook channels Johnny Cash’s charming menace in “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Big River.”\n\nBut just as those artists were eventually eclipsed by Dylan, maybe some more willingly than others, the success of <i>A Complete Unknown</i> lives or dies with Chalamet’s ability to embody a mystery that has spent a lifetime refusing to be solved. And while there is an audience that will hungrily seek out every factual or stylistic deviation, Chalamet settled his own nerves by finding solidarity with Dylan’s commitment to blurring the line between biography and mythology. “This is interpretive,” he says. “This is not definitive. This is not fact. This is not how it happened. This is a fable.”","short":"Don’t think twice, it’s all right to marvel at Timothée Chalamet’s take on Dylan."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/5e/68/055e68ef-95d7-2621-d487-f5bade61cd8f/196872547214.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cec8c2","textColor2":"e1aa4d","textColor4":"bb8d42","textColor1":"f8f3ed","bgColor":"251a18","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-complete-unknown-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1784811806","playParams":{"id":"1784811806","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/21abnHIwhrjqFs4Yywsm9t"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784811806/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1719822344","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1719822344?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735258365379,"RTCI":0}}},"1784833313":{"id":"1784833313","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784833313?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7c/5b/c4/7c5bc49d-5ffb-77fd-d79c-373540de3faa/Job7c388a8d-2d5f-495f-9e65-9a6240cacbd8-182085819-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356161404_1997117383-Time1734646687352.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","222d3f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ffffff"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f5060","textColor2":"222d3f","textColor4":"465666","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e9/00/0b/e9000b40-4d0f-e550-d0a9-25176d0d049d/Job75a2ccf8-8cb5-47a3-8a1a-a8c097c8f0df-182085820-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356161405_1997117382-Time1734649130596.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"445060","textColor2":"232b40","textColor4":"4c5466","textColor1":"192538","bgColor":"f1fcff","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b6/5a/c5/b65ac57e-bfbd-ddf8-8145-6bc3180f85c5/e66630e8-76f4-4824-874b-f712f2c61001.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d5dae2","textColor2":"d2edf7","textColor4":"b6cfdc","textColor1":"f9fbfe","bgColor":"435470","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ea/f6/39/eaf63915-fa40-95cb-e4e8-eb44a7f704e4/296d1434-0e74-4eac-9a5f-b031517ab534.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"bebbd7","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"b5a8cd","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"283b68","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/katy-perry/64387566","name":"1432","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Katy Perry","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"When she skyrocketed to stardom at the tail end of the 2000s, Katy Perry was a girl-next-door gone wild: dancing on tables, kissing cherry-Chapstick-ed strangers, and shooting whipped cream out of her sparkly bustier. Her trademark hits represented pop as pure escapism—fun and frivolous, with production from the era’s biggest hitmakers (Max Martin, Stargate, Dr. Luke). Sixteen years after her breakthrough with 2008’s “I Kissed a Girl,” the era from which Perry emerged has cycled back into fashion as a nostalgic trend. But on her sixth album (not including her contemporary Christian record as Katy Hudson), named for her angel number—and for how people typed “I love you” back in the pager era—the 39-year-old singer is focused on the present.\n\n“When I was going through [2008 debut album] <i>One of the Boys</i>, it was like, ‘Oh my god, hold on to this ride!’” Perry tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, tracing the arc of her career as it pertains to her emotional life. She describes <i>Teenage Dream</i> and <i>PRISM</i> as periods of professional highs and personal turmoil. With 2017’s <i>Witness</i>, her world began to balance; that stability solidified on 2020’s <i>Smile</i>. “And now, <i>143</i> is the celebration of that wholeness, which is a space I’ve never written a record from,” she continues. “I’ve always written a record from defense, or not feeling enough, or trying to transmute my trauma. The biggest lie I think artists have ever been sold is that they have to stay in pain in order to create. That’s absolutely not true.”\n\nFour years after her last album, <i>143</i> arrives as a full-on dance record, sampling liberally from Crystal Waters’ 1991 classic “Gypsy Woman” on the Doechii collab “I’M HIS, HE’S MINE” and venturing deeper into piano house on the euphoric “LIFETIMES.” As for whether songs like “WOMAN’S WORLD” are works of high camp or the remains of a bygone era, your mileage may vary. “I just wanted to explore other territories; I didn’t want to keep repeating myself,” Perry says of her pivot to the dance floor. “The energy I’m hoping to create is freedom to be yourself—freedom to be sweaty, freedom to dance with a stranger.”\n","short":"Four new tracks round out the deluxe edition of her sixth studio album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7a/3b/b0/7a3bb0c2-50d6-bc82-4d3c-fcdb1500c9f1/24UM1IM36819.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3f4f5d","textColor2":"1f293f","textColor4":"485465","textColor1":"142336","bgColor":"edfdfc","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/1432/1784833313","playParams":{"id":"1784833313","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Xd0KCzb0EJtPbUEiyxYVH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784833313/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"64387566","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/64387566?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735291970710,"RTCI":0}}},"1784836159":{"id":"1784836159","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784836159?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/74/89/a3/7489a32c-446f-ea91-056b-b68ea6500497/cdf4af92-5290-4a64-b639-96ca0ac2c62b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2e2d2b","textColor2":"21211f","textColor4":"414240","textColor1":"080705","bgColor":"c2c6c4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/so-soo-bin/580777307","name":"LOVE HAPPENING -

A decade after the EDM boom, and a few years out of lockdown’s subdued haze, dance music reestablished its footing as a playground of experimentation. Stadiums and festivals filled with adventurous cross-pollinators like Jamie xx, John Summit, and RÜFÜS DU SOL, while underground clubs pulsed with sounds that defied easy categorization, courtesy of innovators like horsegiirL and Yanamaste. Really, the year was about reclaiming electronic music’s core ethos: providing a space of communal creativity that refuses to be put in a box. In that spirit, Apple Music invited DJs and producers from all corners of the scene to create exclusive DJ mixes for New Year’s Eve. They’re bold, boundary-pushing, and full of surprises.

Beyond a scant few features, the vanguard rapper seemed on hiatus, all but certain to break his streak of dropping yearly solo projects that began with 2018’s <i>Ares</i>. Thankfully, the surprise release of <i>Papi Arca</i> in the final weeks of December maintains his admirable release record. The nine-track effort demonstrates his signature style over several musical modes—spitting toughened rhymes with that unmistakable rasp on opener “La Franquicia” and ending as a romantic reggaetonero for “Besitos Pa’ Esas Nalgas.” Between those bookends, he keeps things mostly collaborative, subtly interpolating a J. Cole smash with Eladio Carrión on the R&B-driven “BFF” and recounting sexual conquests alongside Sech on the rugged “La Varita.” Still, a veteran of his caliber doesn’t require guests to shine, as evidenced by the tropical “Pa allá” and the late standout “THC.” ","short":"The vanguard rapper surprises fans with a diverse and robust

Written by Cleo Sol alongside Inflo (Adele, Little Simz, Tyler, The Creator), the production nexus of the Sault operation, <i>Acts of Faith</i> is a spiritually enriching blend of soul, R&B, gospel, classical, and jazz influences.

To be clear, that streetwise edge never quite left his music as he pivoted to reggaetón and, eventually, global pop, all evident on his 2024 album <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i>. Yet this aspect of his artistry—the rugged rapper who helped to define a pivotal wave in Latin music—remains so integral to his approach that he’s essentially begun an entire series devoted to this veritable beast mode. A direct successor to 2021’s <i>LYKE MIKE</i>, the similarly rap-centric <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> (note the extra vowel) leaves no doubt of the Puerto Rican star’s enduring hip-hop bona fides.\n\nTowers’ choice of guests speaks strongly to his roots, tapping generational peers like Dowba Montana and Miky Woodz to spit proudly alongside him. Eladio Carrión helps open the proceedings on “QUÉ QUIERES DE MI?”, a joint show of force from two artists with parallel and noteworthy ascents. From there, Neutro Shorty and Jon Z show a genuine love for the format on “NUNCA ME QUEJÉ” and “TRAP,” respectively. While some of these collabs are, in effect, reunions, exceptions exist, like the Akapellah team-up “MI BRILLO.”\n\nThough the temptation to flood <i>LYKE MIIKE</i> with features must have been tempting, Towers largely spends these 23 tracks on his own, showcasing a skill set he honed in the underground before earning mainstream accolades. He commands the pulpit on the gospel-tinged “REVERENDO” and feeds the streets on the decidedly darker “TÍTERES.” With producers like Murda Beatz and Fly Twilightzone in his proverbial corner, the beats surrounding these exquisite bars never feel staid, as cuts like the drill-adjacent “440” and the Michigan-nodding “YO ESTARÉ” expand his sonic range.","short":"A welcome return to trap roots from the Puerto Rican star."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7a/63/86/7a63868c-95d0-9989-85ac-0a6f63567f40/5021732590794.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a8a8a8","textColor2":"e3ae41","textColor4":"b88e36","textColor1":"cfcfcf","bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lyke-miike/1785946400","playParams":{"id":"1785946400","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0G1YnsWxzQoJ2B1QtZLj1e"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785946400/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735304560254,"RTCI":0}}},"1785976290":{"id":"1785976290","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785976290?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":31,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/93/1f/b7/931fb720-320f-e3a2-c33a-46e5728d9a9a/87c2abeb-6e86-464a-a8b4-5e92e287d688.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"cdb4b9","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"c94380","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"351116","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/8c/67/36/8c673696-97dd-bd2e-4e14-d7530849fc7b/4b8286a6-33f7-4a22-99d2-052709ca2164.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1800,"textColor3":"c6a0a6","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"bb939e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"581c27","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/75/b2/5d/75b25d2d-b283-8e9e-6bf1-32fef5ec6ba2/49022f5c-5a1a-4bfb-b338-ba2857db0fc0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"b08b9d","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"bd8597","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"381217","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/7d/fd/387dfd0b-9597-eb59-9b8e-cb5515597553/d482b2a4-c5a5-4f67-8c90-cf55c56d2b4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2a0f1c","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"2a101d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"ca478a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/26/6b/71/266b713b-47c1-ad09-b67a-d68c300ffa11/a88ecf6f-3a2a-4f95-9bc8-b1575a1fab5c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"d9c0dc","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"e3a3b9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"ad2c67","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/paris-hilton/159264092","name":"2024 MegaMix (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Paris Hilton","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"The Best of 2024","standard":"“I’m known as the queen of clubbing and that’s the energy I’m going for every time,” Paris Hilton tells Apple Music of her approach to mixing tracks.

Few, however, could’ve anticipated an entire EP’s worth of collaborative songs from the two groups, now ranking among the biggest and most popular in música mexicana. Following Fuerza Regida’s radical and unique <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i>, a full-length exploration of corridos through a dance-floor lens, this concise set doesn’t so much return to form as find common ground with their tremendously talented Hidalgo County cousins. Comprised of five songs, the surprise-released <i>MALA MÍA</i> eschews electronic experimentation altogether, leaning into vocal harmony and lush instrumentation. A musical merger of their core creative strengths, “ME JALO” starts out with boisterousness and peaks with a cumbia coda. That latter vibe returns for “COQUETA,” showcasing the accordion flourishes of Juan Javier Cantú and the percussive charms of Carlos Guerrero.","short":"Two modern música mexicana giants reunite for a full EP."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ba/96/9e/ba969e5d-857d-bbda-08e2-edc08642d188/196872772869.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7bac7","textColor2":"168feb","textColor4":"1174c8","textColor1":"e5e6eb","bgColor":"01093a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mala-m%C3%ADa-ep/1786262009","playParams":{"id":"1786262009","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786262009/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1275690475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1275690475?l=en-US"},{"id":"1613772487","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1613772487?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735331318071,"RTCI":0}}},"1786271111":{"id":"1786271111","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786271111?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1209282817-890923024","name":"THE HARDY BOYZ","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Baby Smoove & Rocaine","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/99/2b/8f/992b8f4d-4716-945c-4578-0f90ff1642c5/193436411127_gdWzbQtOGHINSJPADEBAFDACAconverted.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"aaa8a6","textColor2":"7098e5","textColor4":"5f7fbd","textColor1":"cdcbc8","bgColor":"1e1c1f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hardy-boyz/1786271111","playParams":{"id":"1786271111","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3jRuiaGevkRLogSlkg6HS9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786271111/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1209282817","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1209282817?l=en-US"},{"id":"890923024","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/890923024?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735280573855,"RTCI":0}}},"1786289340":{"id":"1786289340","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786289340?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/27/77/e0/2777e0e6-8ba5-363e-fc41-c8cb3404a0dc/dfed052b-56bd-4afa-8d09-5e8df9fb6225.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"daba95","textColor2":"f8ba99","textColor4":"dba688","textColor1":"f5d2a9","bgColor":"6a5744","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zach-bryan/1436413980","name":"24 (Live)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Zach Bryan","editorialNotes":{"short":"A career-spanning memento from the 2024 Quittin’ Time Tour.

Cole","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Anniversary Edition","standard":"Named after his childhood home, J. Cole’s highly revered third studio album sticks to the Fayetteville, NC rapper’s well-established formula, featuring several self-produced cuts in which warm, old-school samples underpin lyrics about life’s weighty lessons. But unlike earlier offerings, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive</i> makes hard pills easy to swallow, as the rapper finds his footing and perfects the balance between conscious and commercial.\n\nThe album also finds Cole trying to balance the coexistence of darkness and light, with the smile-inducing “Wet Dreamz” pouring into poignant cuts like “03’ Adolescence.” All the while, Cole’s lyrical approach is as unpretentious as his wardrobe, with the MC delivering lessons on cultural appropriation, relatable childhood faux pas, and the true meaning of life.\n\nThanks to its unflinching confidence, playful narratives, and soulful reflections, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive</i> would prove to be Cole’s most successful album—culturally and critically—upon its release in 2014. It would go on to sell more than 3 million copies, thanks in part to a daring (and deeply personal) marketing campaign: Cole announced the record less than a month before its drop date, and in the lead-up to release day, the rapper invited a group of his biggest fans to the <i>actual</i> 2014 Forest Hills Drive for a listening session (later, Cole turned that very home into rent-free housing for single mothers). To this day, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive</i> remains a crucial entry in the J. Cole catalog: an album that draws on his past, while also giving listeners a glimpse of his future.","short":"Cole celebrates a decade of his classic breakthrough with eight added tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/27/df/ba/27dfbaba-55ec-29c4-3e0f-4db73110bf37/24UM1IM40941.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8b8c1","textColor2":"3dc2de","textColor4":"359fbf","textColor1":"e0e0e0","bgColor":"161643","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/2014-forest-hills-drive-10-year-anniversary-edition/1786468896","playParams":{"id":"1786468896","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2fSAC0ZiYnwKfzLEvyaMm8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786468896/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"73705833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/73705833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735372480138,"RTCI":0}}},"1786505241":{"id":"1786505241","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786505241?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":23,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-24","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4d/9d/72/4d9d7267-bc26-2d8e-51c4-b60c25ab139a/002c5f63-ee1e-416f-a5d1-083e90f97438.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"251a12","textColor2":"0f0a07","textColor4":"2c1e15","textColor1":"070503","bgColor":"9e6d4e","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nle-choppa/1449052753","name":"PICASSO: SLUFFIN SZN X SLUT SZN","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"NLE Choppa","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","short":"A 23-track Christmas Eve surprise from the Memphis MC shows his range."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ee/1b/ed/ee1bedfd-2507-0ee3-f31f-c70ac0df10fd/093624834397.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363533","textColor2":"2c1d08","textColor4":"524635","textColor1":"090805","bgColor":"ebe9ea","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/picasso-sluffin-szn-x-slut-szn/1786505241","playParams":{"id":"1786505241","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5XKf4jhGXPuxuUcv32bxe8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786505241/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1449052753","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1449052753?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735414497827,"RTCI":0}}},"1786643044":{"id":"1786643044","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786643044?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":38,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-20","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/18/a9/a3/18a9a3b7-4028-b67f-22cf-4b9611a916fc/c4e0ec5a-bc0d-437b-8f50-7e438f6018bf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"201c17","textColor2":"040304","textColor4":"211c17","textColor1":"030304","bgColor":"957f63","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/64/29/40/642940ff-dd64-65be-ee4a-b4720edb2def/22d402f5-11cb-4972-b6fd-52555cbfb1cd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6b095","textColor2":"f4b06f","textColor4":"c6905c","textColor1":"f4d8b6","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sza/605800394","name":"SOS Deluxe: LANA","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"SZA","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"In 2022, <i>SOS</i> solidified SZA’s position as a generational talent who translates her innermost thoughts and observations into intimate and relatable music. The LP became an instant classic, even landing on Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums list. Two years after its release, SZA adds 15 more tracks to her critically acclaimed album for the deluxe edition.\n\n<i>SOS Deluxe: LANA</i> finds the singer-songwriter even more candid than its predecessor. Across the collection’s now-38 tracks, SZA is vulnerable as she confesses her weaknesses and acknowledges her flaws, all while on her journey to find peace. On the atmospheric opener, “No More Hiding,” the artist embraces a new side to herself, letting go of things that no longer serve her and evolving into a better person: “Everything I love, I gotta let go/Gotta break it if you want it to grow/Had to build everything twice over/Don’t tell me ’cause I know,” she lilts over an acoustic guitar. She continues to display her vulnerabilities on her road to emotional reawakening and attempting to break old patterns, whether she’s dealing with heartache from a toxic partner (“What Do I Do”), prioritizing her self-worth (“My Turn,” “Conceited,” “Forgiveless”), or struggling to let go of her fears (“Chill Baby”).\n\nOn the soulful and gritty title track, SZA says precisely what’s on her mind after a night of crying over a lost relationship: “I talk bullshit a lot/No more fuck shit, I’m done,” she swaggers. This isn’t the only song that shows her weariness towards relationships that no longer serve her; see also “Smoking on My Ex Pack” and “Far.” However, not every song on the project is about moving on and leaving her past relationships behind her: SZA still has a penchant for making wrong decisions against her better judgment (“Kitchen,” “Too Late,” “F2F”). She revels in the toxicity of her relationships (“Scorsese Baby Daddy”) and questions her worth in some instances (“Love Me 4 Me,” “Special”). She becomes introspective on “Crybaby” as she addresses the labels that are often placed on her by critics and fans alike. However, instead of rejecting these notions, she embraces her traits and owns her imperfections. The album sketches the ebbs and flows of emotions, with strength in one moment but deep regret and sadness the next.\n\nSZA continues to showcase her growth, not just lyrically, but sonically as well, blending a mix of her beloved lo-fi beats and sharing space with pop, grunge, punk-inspired, and even bossa nova without any of it sounding out of place. On the lighthearted and vibrant track “BMF,” she interpolates the Stan Getz & Astrud Gilberto rendition of “The Girl from Ipanema” while showing her admiration for a guy she’s infatuated with. On the Phoebe Bridgers-assisted duet “Ghost in the Machine,” the duo takes a deeper look at the realities of stardom, seeking a bit of humanity within their day-to-day interactions. The track is progressive in its use of strings and acoustic guitars and haunting in its vocal performance.\n\nThroughout the journey of <i>SOS Deluxe: LANA</i>, there are moments of clarity and tenderness where SZA feels the discomfort of healing while trying to find the deeper meaning within the trials and tribulations she endures. She embraces this new level of confidence in her life, where she isn’t looking for anyone to save her from the depth of her emotions, but instead is at peace with where she’s at in life.\n","short":"Two years after its initial release, an instant classic grows by 15 tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/97/bd/88/97bd8804-7d3e-e6c8-0532-ff22877b931c/196871766890.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ccd2d4","textColor2":"e18060","textColor4":"b46d55","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"00212b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sos-deluxe-lana/1786643044","playParams":{"id":"1786643044","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3VQkNrG74QPY4rHBPoyZYZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786643044/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"605800394","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/605800394?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1735383978304,"RTCI":0}}},"1786690272":{"id":"1786690272","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786690272?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/41/e8/27/41e82774-2342-9b52-1784-421b36162b11/Jobefecd22a-51fa-45d3-a9a4-84e7e03119f4-182164391-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356343151_1998458108-Time1734739284132.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","001220"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"012c39","textColor2":"001220","textColor4":"003041","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/07/ee/4c/07ee4c99-c107-9438-9ad8-dd1546351162/8dda3013-f033-47d3-a496-ceac4cd80de4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"433c37","textColor2":"28211a","textColor4":"48423d","textColor1":"221912","bgColor":"c7c8c9","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/69/a0/8a/69a08adf-c696-20cc-eb31-c48ff7c2b47d/Job93180399-980b-45f0-b9ac-7a1e0dc9e473-182164392-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_356343153_1998458106-Time1734741049102.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"012145","textColor2":"161614","textColor4":"123035","textColor1":"010328","bgColor":"0099b9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5d/6d/7f/5d6d7f65-b9ff-caa8-acf6-5983476422b7/af689663-f7b9-419a-9de1-ecd3d9a1abaf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"1d292b","textColor2":"0d1312","textColor4":"1a2a2d","textColor1":"11110f","bgColor":"4f899b","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ice-spice/1552372505","name":"Y2K! : I’m Just A Girl (Deluxe)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ice Spice","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Throughout hip-hop history, New York has produced several of the biggest and most iconic female stars. A genuine breakout talent in her city’s abundant pool of drill artists, Bronx rap phenom Ice Spice earned the blessing of no less than Nicki Minaj after “Munch (Feelin’ U)” went from delightfully viral to utterly ubiquitous. Collabs with the Queen from Queens like “Princess Diana” put the outer-borough upstart in a rarefied space as she amassed other hits including “Gangsta Boo” and the Taylor Swift team-up “Karma.”\n\nRoughly two years after making such a strong first impression, Ice Spice looks to cement her place in the game with <i>Y2K!</i>. Named in honor of her January 1, 2000, birthdate, her debut album may not be materially that much longer than the preceding <i>Like..?</i> EP. Nonetheless, it augments her sonic world in exciting ways while maintaining the brash authenticity that got her to this point. \n\nThough perennial studio partner RIOTUSA remains at the production helm, the beat choices here skew darker and harder than one might expect. The dissonant rhythmic thump of “BB Belt” and menacing synth stabs of “Plenty Sun” soundtrack pointed and pithy verses intended to cut down the competition. Even though a handful of the titles may verge on the scatological, punchlines like “Spent 150 on some carats/That shit cray like them n****s in Paris” keep songs like “Think U the Shit (Fart)” feeling sharp rather than sophomoric. The exclusive guest list here reflects her elite status, wrangling Travis Scott for the victorious “Oh Shhh…” and then Gunna for the badass team-up “Bitch I’m Packin’.”","short":"The NYC MC’s 2024
