Minus","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Ela Minus’ second album, <i>DÍA</i>, takes a massive leap when it comes to the sheer size of the Colombian producer and songwriter’s music. Her 2020 breakout debut, <i>acts of rebellion</i>, felt like someone communicating electronic pop to you in secret, with warm analog synth squiggles and a delightfully brittle feel, not unlike coldwave’s minimalist steeliness or the punkish, romantic sound of ’80s synth-pop. On <i>DÍA</i>, Minus cranks up her stylistic tics to max volume: The synths crash like monsoons, and her voice soars above the music instead of lying in wait in the shadows. The saucer-eyed wobbles of opener “ABRIR MONTE” immediately recall the lush rave waves of Jamie xx’s “Gosh,” while “ONWARDS” conjures peak-era electroclash, right down to Minus’ excellently disaffected and cool-to-the-touch vocal take.\n\nAt times, <i>DÍA</i> also feels like a modern update of the icy, gothic synth-pop that Swedish duo The Knife first perfected on their 2006 album <i>Silent Shout</i>. The swooning tones and static bursts of “IDK” tackle feelings of anxiety head-on, while “I WANT TO BE BETTER” is riddled with self-doubt and regret, a hand reaching across the void toward past acquaintances. The feelings feel real; the imagery is corporeal and thoroughly sanguine—the latter quite literally over the serpentine synths of “IDOLS”: “All it took/Was a little blood/To see what I’m really made of.”","short":"The Colombian artist’s second album is modern gothic

Human Fear","artistName":"Franz Ferdinand","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"According to Alex Kapranos, longtime lead vocalist of Franz Ferdinand, fear may be the largest untapped source of renewable energy on the planet. The millennial-era stalwarts are hoping that by charging headlong into that which frightens us most, maybe, just maybe, we’re all capable of tapping into the secret drive hidden on the other side. “I think we all have fears within us and fears that we confront in our life at different times,” Kapranos tells Apple Music’s Hanuman Welch. “And how we react to those fears is how we learn who we are really. And fear is not necessarily a bad thing either. Fear is associated with some of the greatest things you do in your life. Think about asking somebody out on a date: There's quite a lot of fear that you have to overcome to do that. Yeah, no. I think it's a fascinating insight into who we are.”\n\nKapranos and Franz Ferdinand are no strangers to self-reflection. <i>The Human Fear</i> arrives at the peak of millennial-era revivalism thanks to the cresting wave of indie-sleaze nostalgia. But the band’s workmanlike approach to touring hasn’t seen them slow down much in the two decades since their self-titled art-rock debut catapulted them to fame. A lineup change also inspired the band to get back into the studio, where they captured a bit of that anthemic energy on the album’s lead single “Audacious,” a glam-rock bruiser they say serves as a bit of a mission statement for the entire album.\n\n“I think the spirit of the song encapsulates what I think being in a band should be, which is quite an audacious thing,” bassist Bob Hardy reveals. “There’s no point being onstage or getting on a stage unless you’re going to do it in an audacious way. If you’re not going to do it the whole way, then what the fuck are you doing?” Much of that “what the fuck are you doing” energy emerged organically when the band reassembled in the studio.\n\nNot that a sense of zeal has ever been absent across the band’s discography, but the Scottish quintet wanted to make sure they were hitting the record button with their guitars already firmly tuned. “We made sure that the songs were bangers first and foremost,” Hardy says. “And then we got the band together and learned them. And a lot of the album’s recorded live, so it’s the live sound of the band really tearing into it, and I think it gives the whole record a really exciting feel. It sounds like we’re having fun, and we were having fun making it.”\n\n“I hear stories about bands that will go into the studio and say that, ‘Well, the studio's jammed a bit.’ And then the record just came, and you can hear it sometimes,” Kapranos adds. “I like the idea of going to the studio when you’ve got some great songs and you know how to play them. I think that makes for a good record.”","short":"The Scottish dance-rockers find inspiration in the titular

Ward","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Don’t let the title fool you. Josh Ward may be the same ol’ cowboy on this 2025 LP, but the rodeo competitor turned country singer-songwriter still has plenty to say. The Houston-born artist, who also spent time in the Texas oil fields before turning to music, sticks to his roots on this 12-pack of tunes, pairing expertly crafted traditional country arrangements with vivid, often emotional snapshots of a simple life lived hard. The record opens with “There’s a Drink for That,” a lively two-stepper with the soul of Chris Stapleton and the swing of George Strait. “Ain’t Got to Me Yet” is lush and layered, with big ’90s harmonies and an emphasis on melody, landing like a tear-drenched “Neon Moon.”\n\n“Beer Joint Down” and “Better on a Barstool” don’t reinvent the drinking song but more than do the canon justice with gritty honky-tonk riffs and plenty of fiddle, and closer “Walkin’ in My Boots” shows Ward’s softer side as he considers how his own son might follow in his footsteps. The title track is the record’s centerpiece and thesis statement, as Ward takes admiring stock of the many ways to live the cowboy life, tipping his hat to those who “die young” and those who live to see “another day, another dollar, another place in time.”","short":"The rodeo cowboy turned country star sticks to his roots on this

country tune too. The legendary drummer has traded in his sticks and cymbals for a horse and lasso on <i>Look Up</i>, his first album in six years and a confident play on the tropes of country standards. Produced and co-written by T Bone Burnett, the album’s 11 originals were recorded between Nashville and Los Angeles, and they find Starr showcasing his ability to adapt his unique talents.\n\nOn songs like “Time on My Hands” and the Billy Strings-assisted “Breathless,” Ringo sings of love and love lost, even recruiting cinematic string swells and a pedal steel solo on the former. It conjures images of cold nights around the campfire, endless stargazes, and storytelling sessions. While Ringo Starr uses <i>Look Up</i> to honor the history of this slice of American music, he never shies from his own vision.","short":"At 84, Ringo trades a yellow submarine for a ranch on 11

Miller","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"Posthumous rap albums can often feel opportunistic: indiscriminate grab bags cobbled together for one last payday. But <i>Balloonerism</i>—the second album from the beloved musician since his death in 2018, released two days ahead of what would have been his 33rd birthday—is far from an assemblage of cutting-room floor scraps. Culled from a single week of extended jam sessions (according to close collaborators), the album is considered to be Mac Miller’s “lost project,” recorded between his 2013 album <i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> and his 2014 mixtape <i>Faces</i>—arguably the most pivotal year of his creative evolution. “It is a project that was of great importance to Malcolm, to the extent that he commissioned artwork for it,” read a statement from Miller’s estate confirming the official release in fall 2024, noting the unofficial bootleg versions that have circulated through the years.\n\nThere’s only one voice besides Miller’s across <i>Balloonerism</i>’s 14 deep and dreamy tracks—that of SZA, his longtime friend, who appears on “DJ’s Chord Organ,” a heady track credited to Miller’s production alter ego Larry Fisherman that borrows a chord organ once belonging to lo-fi folk hero Daniel Johnston. Otherwise, Miller goes his own way, probing life’s great mysteries with modesty and good humor. The rattle of a tambourine echoes through the album, produced in part by Thundercat, as do Miller’s preoccupations with death as a concept, a puzzle, a voyeuristic spectacle, and, finally, life’s ultimate trip. “What does death feel like?” he wonders repeatedly on “Rick’s Piano,” believed to have been recorded at Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La studio. And on the hushed and haunting epic “Tomorrow Will Never Know,” he looks down at himself from a distant God’s-eye view and arrives at the enlightened conclusion: “Living and dying are one and the same.”","short":"A pivotal “lost” album gets an official release, five years after his passing."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f0/ba/18/f0ba1896-543e-8949-95e3-575c298fcae3/093624834984.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"bed6ea","textColor2":"fbd5c2","textColor4":"d2bdbd","textColor1":"e2f4fb","bgColor":"2e5fa9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/balloonerism/1780891320","playParams":{"id":"1780891320","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ANFIaCb53iam0MBkFFoxY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780891320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"419944559","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/419944559?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1737097345986,"RTCI":0}}},"1781666357":{"id":"1781666357","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781666357?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-08","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8e/19/69/8e196996-833d-8525-8718-4076ce7ed4f7/6d2ec150-21fb-49d0-a33c-ca29c0a219f8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"25231f","textColor2":"191815","textColor4":"32302b","textColor1":"080806","bgColor":"989283","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/05/09/06/0509067e-ff10-007b-e77e-45324ea06273/4e57a26d-e350-4f16-9ccc-a04c3c53c781.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ccc8ba","textColor2":"dfdbce","textColor4":"bcb9ae","textColor1":"f3eedd","bgColor":"31302f","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/50/45/c4/5045c4c3-ce7a-a199-b216-cc803c7b49e9/7cdc3d32-2084-4452-a181-f8ead1d4cbbe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292722","textColor2":"171613","textColor4":"312f2a","textColor1":"0d0c0a","bgColor":"989283","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ethel-cain/1474427879","name":"Perverts","artistName":"Ethel Cain","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Around the time of her big break with 2022’s <i>Preacher’s Daughter</i>, Ethel Cain was dubbed a pop star, though it was often hard to tell from her songs. Aside from “American Teenager,” a Springsteen-esque anthem that laundered sneakily unpatriotic sentiments through arena-ready melodies, that album’s songs were largely dirges (gorgeous ones, at that) preoccupied by ideas of doomed love, faith, and fate. Written and produced almost entirely by Cain (the stage name and alter ego of Hayden Anhedönia), the project’s lore was nearly as compelling as the music itself, launching Anhedönia into something like stardom.\n\nSince then, Anhedönia’s spoken freely about the pitfalls of popularity; she penned a Tumblr post last year identifying an irony epidemic within online fan culture: an aversion to approaching art with sincerity rather than memes. You could be tempted to view <i>Perverts</i>, Cain’s first release since <i>Preacher’s Daughter</i>, as a provocation—an often-challenging 90-minute work that seems designed to scare off a stan or two. Songs like “Pulldrone” and “Housofpsychoticwomn” are noise experiments that stretch well past the 10-minute mark, full of eerie drone, depersonalized spoken word, and terrifying imagery regarding sex and sin. The moments of hard-earned beauty feel all the more rewarding: the fuzzy, sultry “Vacillator,” or “Etienne” and “Thatorchia,” a pair of elegiac instrumentals that sound like beams of heavenly light

found her love for music while performing at the local Baptist church in her small Georgia hometown—hardly a natural habitat for hell-raisers of any kind. Instead, you hear that church choir influence in her voice, which splits the difference between Lainey Wilson’s warbling twang and Lana Del Rey’s dusky croon. Flourishes of soulful Southern gospel find their way, often sneakily, into most tracks on this debut album from Avalon, like the Parton-checking “Hey There, Dolly” with its down-home harmonies, and the feisty, quick-fire verses of the vice-laden “Something We Regret.” Lyrically, religious imagery tends more toward fire and brimstone, like on “Damned,” where Avalon likens a situationship to purgatory. Avalon is as confident and capable a songwriter as she is a vocalist, and this first full-length project from the young country up-and-comer is unusually assured. The more she raises hell, it seems, the higher her star rises.","short":"The Georgia singer-songwriter’s full-length debut is rowdy and

best DJs who deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Elderbrook crafts this spacious edition—a sweeping, powerful mix for the next time you hit the mat. “I was imagining an intense yoga session,” the British producer tells Apple Music. “No one is falling asleep at this one.” He bookended the mix with two of his own favorite compositions and filled the middle with songs by some of his favorite artists (Mind Against, Bonobo, Davi, and others), transitioning from a mellow, reflective vibe into one where you’re meant to break a sweat.

This month’s mix—a dizzying journey through house, techno, soul, and reggaetón—was crafted by A-Trak for your next ride. “I wanted to cover a few pockets of my sound within an hour, and to follow some ups and downs in intensity,” he says. These days, the Canadian turntablist does cardio five times per week (“Hey, we’re not getting any younger,” he says) and “definitely” plans on cycling to this mix. “For years, I’ve been saying, semi-jokingly, that I make gym music, because friends will say they hear my remixes at [fitness studios]. But it’s funny: When I exercise, I’m down to listen to stuff that I wouldn’t listen to in other contexts. It’s fun to be more open during a workout.” Among his favorite tracks: “Fallin in Love,” a collaboration with his Duck Sauce partner Armand Van Helden, and “All My People” by Confidence Man and Sweely. “Because we love a perky workout.”","short":"House, soul, reggaetón, and more.

DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—it brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This set, curated by Swedish house don Alesso, will keep you locked on your next run—or any sort of exercise you might choose.\n\n“My workouts are varied between different methods, so I wanted this mix to work in any scenario,” Alesso tells Apple Music. “I always try and start strong and take you on a journey from start to finish before ending with a bang. On this one, I start off with some festival tracks from me, Max Styler, and others, and then move into some more underground artists before ending on a crescendo with a brand-new one from FISHER and an unreleased edit from rising talent HNTR.” Alesso calls Sebastian Ingrosso’s “Flood” a perfect workout track. “Seb has been a mentor and friend of mine for more than a decade, and I love what he did with the track,” he says. He also loves Kölsch's remix of Blue Boy’s \"Remember Me”: “It's so different from the original pop song, but still super catchy and plays in any room.”","short":"The Swedish house don takes you on “a journey from start to finish.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4e/c2/8f/4ec28ff9-76cd-a537-628c-6d1f55f23c16/73b4232e-3a26-4f02-98d1-9ab1af638a6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f3030","textColor2":"2d2d2d","textColor4":"545554","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"edf4f1","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-jan-2025-dj-mix/1786233570","playParams":{"id":"1786233570","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786233570/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"432464201","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/432464201?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1736485756619,"RTCI":0}}},"1786288217":{"id":"1786288217","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786288217?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/teramaze/284809113","name":"DESIRE COLOURS N LUST -

little nostalgia. Holding it down for Atlanta in the 2020s, his lengthy run of rap hits over a seven-year stretch inevitably led the hip-hop star back to his beginnings, at least thematically. <i>WHAM</i>, a bespoke acronym for Who Hard As Me, calls back to some of those earlier successes by reclaiming the titular fortitude of breakthrough projects like <i>Harder Than Ever</i> and <i>Too Hard</i>. \n\nStill operating at the fore of trap’s commercial evolution, indeed with some of the same producers he’s been with throughout his journey, he comes through with reliably polished bangers “F U 2x,” “Say Twin,” and the Southside- and Wheezy-helmed “Stiff Gang.” On “I Promise,” he looks back on where he started from his now-vaunted vantage point, with nods to the illicit activities that prepared him for his contemporary money moves. He frequently focuses his attention on personal and romantic matters, evidenced best on the conciliatory yet booming “So Sorry.”\n\nAt this stage in Lil Baby’s career, he could have just about anyone he wants as a feature. <i>WHAM</i> demonstrates his pull from early on, grabbing ATL titans Future and a newly freed Young Thug on the flex-fest “Dum, Dumb, and Dumber.” 21 Savage maintains an ominous vibe on “Outfit,” while Rod Wave and Rylo Rodriguez tap in for the comparatively sleeker “By Myself.” Yet it’s GloRilla who offers the rapper his finest foil here, giving as good as she gets on the standout “Redbone.”","short":"ATL’s hardest expands his 2025 offering with four new tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/dc/ee/2ddceec7-f66b-a0ea-b636-72346a2649a7/25UMGIM00552.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"aeb4bd","textColor2":"abbece","textColor4":"8a9aa6","textColor1":"d7dfea","bgColor":"080a09","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wham-extended-version/1789237341","playParams":{"id":"1789237341","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5XYdFmT54volmxN5OCI5Xy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789237341/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1276656483","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1276656483?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1737105920971,"RTCI":0}}},"1789254781":{"id":"1789254781","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789254781?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b8/e7/c1/b8e7c14b-5618-a57c-a57b-8ab6e3b9c52c/edb28fde-06d4-4883-a1c3-02f606c671e2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"474845","textColor2":"31312b","textColor4":"565652","textColor1":"1f201b","bgColor":"eaeaef","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/naina/1608461086","name":"NAINA Presents: NAINA, Vol. 12 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"NAINA","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"NAINA is firmly in control for the 12th volume of NAINA Presents, mixing genres and eras in her trademark style. “We’re back!” says the DJ, Hooversound Recordings co-founder, and Apple Music Radio host.

There’s a welcome throwback to Hiroki Yamamura’s Michael McDonald homage “Venus Beats” and the high-energy “Want to You” from Atlanta’s Nikki Nair. “I really enjoy spotlighting how well these hybrid club genres complement each other—and how these new amazing producers are changing the game by taking elements from jungle, footwork, and techno,” says NAINA. “If you enjoy this, be sure to check out the rest of NAINA Presents, where I’ve invited some of my favorite artists to contribute to the mix series.”","short":"A mix of jungle, footwork, and techno from the Apple Music Radio host."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b9/72/d5/b972d5b4-40e5-0f7e-725c-b5feddcbf275/088bb4e0-20d2-47b0-b0a4-b497984d6f08.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"282031","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor4":"41394b","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c8a2f9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/naina-presents-naina-vol-12-dj-mix/1789254781","playParams":{"id":"1789254781","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789254781/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1608461086","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1608461086?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1737080642532,"RTCI":0}}},"1789280069":{"id":"1789280069","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789280069?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-17","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/93/5d/69935d74-6fc3-aea4-c2f0-a584e0e29e02/47f6178b-3d08-4b8d-84ea-7f52fc8940a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor4":"b7b7b7","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fe/92/11/fe921115-f131-4c14-8a41-5d75984a862a/4d4e76b0-d50a-46ec-8073-8dedb858c819.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1ab5a","textColor2":"f0cb72","textColor4":"c4a65e","textColor1":"eed26c","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/busta-rhymes/54583","name":"Dragon Season...

Following in the tradition of his zodiac-inspired <i>Year of the Dragon</i> and the collaborative Q-Tip mixtape <i>The Abstract and The Dragon</i>, this EP offers a preview of his promised return to fire-breathing form. Beginning with the ferociously boastful intro “Letter to My Children,” he proceeds to ensure that everything remains raw. No matter what kind of beat enters his lair, he wields seemingly supernatural rap powers over the music, from the positively funky single “Do the Busabus Pt.2” to the stop-start clamor of “Keep Executing.” The oft explicit nature of his lyrics only serves to strengthen his arguments, adding heft to the gospel-tinged boom-bap take “National Treasure.” The sole vocal guest here, emerging singer YG Marley, honors his own legacy with Jah praise over the reggae-pop grooves of “Treasure & Gold.”","short":"Flipmode’s finest gives a sneak preview of the serpent’s

and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. This month’s edition, made for the gym, comes from none other than Melanie C, the millennial pop icon, fka Sporty Spice, who is now a solo artist and touring DJ. True to form, she describes her own fitness routine as “beast mode” and says it spans running, cycling, strength training, and dancing behind the decks. For this mix, she leans into the music that motivates her. “Being a Spice Girl means I can have some fun with mixes,” she says, like opening with a mashup of Soulsearcher’s “Feelin’ Love (Club Mix)” and Spice Girls’ “Who Do You Think You Are.” Another of her favorites, “Move,” by ESSEL and MERYLL, was one of her frequent tunes to play out in 2024. “Music is massively important to me,” she says. “It gets me going if I’m not feeling it, and keeps me going when it gets tough—in every area of my life, not just working out.”","short":"Slam it to the left!
