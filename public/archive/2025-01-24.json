Album and Interview","standard":"For Rose Gray, the club has always represented freedom. “If you’re going to the right places, all inhibitions are dropped and no one cares what you do,” the East London-born singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “There’s something primal about lots of people in a room listening to heavy drums.” Gray would know. Ever since her late teens, she’s spent every available moment immersed in nightlife, building a community of go-go dancers, promoters, and DJs who not only love clubbing but respect it, too. The music she makes is similarly reverent: scooping into the vast melting pot of dance music, she welds together everything from <i>Screamadelica</i>-inspired acid house, delectable nu-disco, subterranean future garage, and psychedelic trance. “I think there’s a real bond with anyone that makes dance music that means you’re allowed to take and borrow sounds and melodies and it’s celebrated,” she says. \n\nWith this debut album, though, Gray set out to refine a sound that felt her own. Inspired by pop icons such as Kylie Minogue, Robyn, and <i>Ray of Light</i>-era Madonna, she recruited some best-in-biz collaborators, including songwriting master Justin Tranter, who signed Gray to their publishing house, Sega Bodega, Sam Homaee, Zhone, Sur Back, Uffie, and Alex Metric. The result is <i>Louder, Please</i>, a euphoric and chest-achingly candid distillation of British club culture and turn-of-the-millennium pop. “I had to really grab that sound by the horns,” Gray says. “I think this record is the most pop out of anything that I’ve done. I was like, ‘Yeah, I’m ready to do this.’” \n\nThe album title itself is another representation of Gray’s personality. “I’ve probably grown up being dangerously obsessed with loud music,” she says. “But the ‘please’ at the end is very me. I’m quite maximalist and I can be brash, but I will always be polite, which I think feels like some of the record. It’s heavy, but there’s a sweetness to it.” Read on for Rose Gray’s track-by-track guide to <i>Louder, Please</i>. \n\n<b>“Damn”</b>\n“I was writing with [The Blessed Madonna collaborator] Pat Alvarez and Caitlin Stubbs [Dom Dolla, Bebe Rexha]. We’d actually written a completely different song, but it went into this quite industrial techno record. The song is basically a stream of consciousness of me just blurting out all the things I do to keep myself sane. It has this introduction energy, to me. It feels like, ‘I have arrived.’ It’s maximalist and in your face. Also, if you pick apart the lyrics, there are Easter eggs to other songs on the album.” \n\n<b>“Free”</b> \n“I don’t like the word ‘spiritual,’ but this song feels connected. I was in LA when I wrote it and, lyrically, I definitely wanted to play on this idea that you might have everything, but really what matters is how you feel in yourself. I used to get goosebumps when I listened to it. It feels a bit more grounded than the rest of the album. I like that it comes after ‘Damn’ because it’s like the devil and then the angel as I bring in the sweet-summer, window-down, sun-kissing-your-skin vibes.” \n\n<b>“Wet & Wild”</b>\n“I’ve had moments, more so when I was a little bit younger, of leaving the club in a drunken state in a bit of a mic-drop moment. Maybe you’ve had a row or maybe the guy you’re with is flirting with someone else. So you’re just out the club, maybe you’re crying and sort of expecting your group of friends to know that you’ve left and want them to follow you. But that doesn’t happen because everyone’s having a great night and just thinks you’ve gone to the toilet or something. That’s what ‘Wet & Wild’ means. It’s a bit of an eff you! I’m going to run in the streets of the city, feel myself, and have a little cry.” \n\n<b>“Just Two”</b>\n“I worked on this song with Uffie, who has become a very good friend. I think she’s the coolest human ever. I’m in awe of her. I had actually written the chorus of the melody and had that on my phone, but I wanted to do something upbeat and have really ’90s chords. Having Uffie in the room just shaped it to become a little bit more underground. Lyrically, the song is about how, when you’ve found your person, there’s nothing better than being with them and sharing a life with them and all the things that you do just for a kiss. It’s quite cheeky.” \n\n<b>“Tectonic”</b>\n“I’m in a relationship with someone who is away a lot, and I wanted to use nature to describe that feeling of separation. I feel like we are connected, but when we’re away from each other, there’s a crashing of tectonic plates. I really enjoy the soundscape. Alex Metric, who I wrote it with, is such a little tech wizard that he has a lot of these synths from the ’90s. I think he actually bought some stuff off of William Orbit, who produced <i>Ray of Light</i>, which is one of my favorite albums ever. I could make a whole album in the world of this song.”\n\n<b>“Party People”</b> \n“Writing this song was a whirlwind. I met Sega Bodega a few times and he said I should come to Paris to write with him. People say they want to work with you, and it’s like, ‘Is it actually happening?’ We wrote three songs, including ‘Party People.’ It’s kind of a nursery rhyme. I feel like I am surrounded by party people and I’m fascinated by them, honestly. I have this group of friends, and if they were living in the late ’80s and ’90s, they would’ve been at every rave. I based the song on them and how they’re all very free. I think ‘Party People’ feels like I’m sat on the edges of a club or at some warehouse and I’m watching everything that’s happening. I’m obsessed with people that party.” \n\n<b>“Angel of Satisfaction”</b>\n“For the last couple of years, I’ve seen real success happen to friends. I’ve been at these industry things and you see the people that you grew up idolizing and who, in my eyes, have made it. And then I just always think, ‘Is that really what I want?’ There are a lot of questions I’m always asking myself. I definitely think that there are very healthy ways of doing it. But it’s quite a scary world out there. I wanted to create a song that was my debate on that subject, and I did have some sort of visualization of it in a dream. I explained that to Justin Tranter, and they were able to help make it digestible. In the end, we wrote it very quickly.” \n\n<b>“Switch”</b>\n“This song was written the first time I worked with Justin. It felt like things were aligning for me, and I felt a sort of switch personally that I had become the artist I envisioned I’d become as a 17-year-old. I just said, ‘I feel like things are really switching up for me.’ I knew that ‘switch’ was a great lyric. Justin and I talked for quite a while about what switch can mean, and we formed the song. I remember when I first wrote it, I thought it sounded like a game: bouncy, fun, candyfloss pop, but also quite sexy and hot if you look at the lyrics.” \n\n<b>“Hackney Wick”</b>\n“With this song, we had made the instrumental kind of roughly what it is now. I was trying lots of different vocal things on it and they just weren’t working. Then I said, ‘Can I just talk about some nights out on the mic?’ I used to go to these mad parties in Hackney Wick. We’d go from one party to the next, and then you’re on the canal and you’re having a beer and then you’re cuddling someone and the sun’s coming up. It was just such a fun time. I just felt the music really captures the energy of Hackney Wick. Then Caroline Sur Back [Caroline Sans, aka experimental pop artist Sur Back] created this beautiful string section, and I was like, ‘Why not? Why can it not now go into something really ethereal and romantic?’ That’s kind of how I feel about that whole time in my life, really.” \n\n<b>“First”</b>\n“I’m a very competitive person. Painfully competitive, in fact. I’ve got so much Capricorn in me and I’m working on it, but I’m always at the starting line, ready to go, and that kind of falls into relationships as well. It’s not a personal thing and I notice it with couples where they’re often competing with each other. I wanted to try and capture that in a song. I really enjoy the production. It’s another sprinkle of drum ’n’ bass. It’s a bit garage-y. I feel like the middle eight goes a bit dubstep.” \n\n<b>“Everything Changes (But I Won’t)”</b> \n“Obviously, I absolutely love the club, but there’s a whole side of me that’s very alternative and listens to lots of different music. I wanted to have at least one song that was bringing you down. I have probably been in love with the same person for most of my adult life. It’s very interesting growing up with someone and seeing us both change so much, yet still kind of remain the same. I would say that this is the only complete love song on the album. I wanted to create the feeling of me being in the middle of a storm where so much is happening around me, but I’m still very much grounded. I remember when Sean Wasabi, the producer, played the synth loop. I was like, ‘Wow, that really captures that feeling.’” \n\n<b>“Louder, Please”</b>\n“I created this with Caroline. I had written a song called ‘Louder’ that I really enjoyed the chorus for, and then I sung it through on a vocoder, just with piano. We sent it to Caroline with a few references, and, honestly, she sent back basically what the song is now. Similar to how ‘Damn’ was like an introduction, this feels like a closing. It’s like a warm hug. I got my little cousin, who, bless her, is just like a fairy, to say, ‘Can you play it a little louder, please?’ It felt cathartic to finish the album with a child’s voice. I think underneath it all, I just remember being little and asking my dad to play music louder.”","short":"The Londoner’s debut arrives: “This is the most pop record I’ve done.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/louder-please/1766520241","playParams":{"id":"1766520241","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/79SqMfih2FN1NaLtZUcccG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766520241/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1487826227","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1487826227?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737716017625}}},"1766752112":{"id":"1766752112","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766752112?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Worldwide","Music","Rock","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9f/33/e2/9f33e25a-2294-3dbf-b4c0-309cb7b7cd06/3102d93c-cec8-4e38-9949-34d5b192641b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4b3ad","textColor2":"efd1cb","textColor4":"c2aba6","textColor1":"f1dbd4","bgColor":"111112","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/18/22/cc/1822ccaf-6a4e-6b8a-cf9b-6eaff0a879fc/adcfa1fc-482c-4097-806c-c4f1f197532e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfb29e","textColor2":"eb9364","textColor4":"ca8059","textColor1":"f0d3ba","bgColor":"48312c","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wardruna/299406921","name":"Birna","artistName":"Wardruna","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e3/a9/e1/e3a9e1e7-b104-6a87-5120-2b958999ef2b/196872362817.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b57d54","textColor2":"d49442","textColor4":"a97735","textColor1":"e29d69","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"On their sixth studio album, mystical Norwegian folk troupe Wardruna conjure a song cycle about the she-bear, or Birna. “Bears are an absolutely fascinating species, and it’s easy to understand why they have become such an important part of folklore in certain types of culture—in fairy tales, in lullabies, and in star signs,” Wardruna’s songwriter, co-vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist Einar Selvik tells Apple Music. “Why I chose the she-bear rather than the male bear is the fact that their annual rhythm mirrors completely the rhythm of Mother Earth in a way—the cyclic turns of life, death, and regeneration. That’s the story I wanted to tell on this record.”\n\nSince 2003, Selvik and his musical partner and co-vocalist Lindy-Fay Hella—along with an ever-expanding cast of backing musicians—have used Old Norse language and ancient traditional instruments to channel the majesty of the natural world. “Giving voice to the wild, I think, is important,” Selvik says. “I think a lot of us feel a deeper and deeper void between us and our surroundings. To be living so removed from nature, from the cycles of the Earth, is not healthy. But our society doesn’t really allow us to follow the rhythm of the seasons. We tend to have one tempo year-round; we eat everything year-round, neglecting the fact that we are cyclic beings. That’s one of the things bears can teach us. And not only bears, but nature: They help us remember that we’re part of something.” Below, Selvik discusses each song on <i>Birna</i>.\n\n<b>“Hertan”</b>\n“Hertan is the proto-Scandinavian word for ‘heart,’ and that is where we start this journey—with the pulse that beats in everything and that governs all of these movements within ourselves, and also in nature in various forms and beings. That’s, of course, the physical heart, but then you also have the metaphorical heart, the ship of emotion. That is what counsels our decisions and choices here in life and our emotions. It takes us through one of these cycles of death and rebirth. In enduring that process, we understand it and see it clearly, these movements and patterns and our place in them.”\n\n<b>“Birna”</b>\n“The word means ‘she-bear.’ It is a track that represents a dialogue between man and she-bear. It’s written in a playful way, like many of the old bear songs from traditions where there are a lot of bears in their culture. It addresses the somewhat problematic relationship we have had with bears throughout time. It acknowledges that our path together has been a tangled one. And then, the she-bear asks to lend its hide, which is something that has been used ceremonially or in many traditions to borrow the bear’s strength, to borrow its courage or whatever skill. It is said that bears have the strength of 12 men and the wits of 10, and that is often the skills we wanted to learn from them.”\n\n<b>“Ljos til Jord”</b>\n“Here, we start at the summer solstice, and we follow the bear’s movement towards the den. We see the birds migrate, we see the salmon swim upstream in the river to spawn where they were born and then die. All of these movements we see in nature. It is written in the lyrics that it’s almost like every year we’re invited to this wonderful, luscious feast, but at some point, the hostess of the party leaves, and we’re left to gather what we can to survive until she returns in spring.”\n\n<b>“Dvaledraumar”</b>\n“It means ‘Dormant Dreams,’ and this, of course, is the hibernation. The bear doesn’t really hibernate, per definition—it goes into a semi-hibernating state where it lowers its heart rate to between eight and 10 beats per minute. I chose nine beats per minute for conceptual reasons, and that is the pulse that leads you through this 15-minute dreamscape. The sounds you hear—they’re almost whalelike—they come from a lake that freezes in a very specific way in wintertime. We were lucky to have Jonna Jinton, the Swedish artist who has been recording these singing ice lakes for several years now, collaborating on this song with both the field recordings and some vocals toward the end.”\n\n<b>“Jord til Ljos”</b>\n“This was made as one track with ‘Dvaledraumar,’ and the title means ‘Earth to Light’ or ‘Womb to Light.’ It follows the same pulse as ‘Dvaledraumar,’ with the same instrumentation in a way, but it subtly transforms as the den is becoming smaller and smaller, and the birds are singing. It’s time to wake up and enter spring, to enter the life cycle of the year.” \n\n<b>“Himinndotter”</b>\n“This is the emergence of spring, but also coming into light, or enlightenment. You have journeyed together with this bear through this cycle. It’s a song very much about seeing these movements and cyclic patterns that we are a part of and realizing the repercussions of messing with these systems. It’s a lot about seeking connection, but also acknowledging that at this point, the shepherd of the forest—in this case, the bear—is no longer welcome in its homelands. The choir you hear is an all-female choir from Oslo, the Koret Artemis. They work a lot with traditional music from all over the world. I wanted it to feel like we’re in unison, that we are many people who think and feel the importance of this.”\n\n<b>“Hibjørnen”</b>\n“It means ‘The Den Bear,’ or ‘The Hibernator.’ It’s written as a lullaby because lullabies are very much connected to bears. Wherever there are bears, you have a lot of lullabies about bears because of their sleep. And the way they mother their cubs is so powerful. It’s the reason why we call some mothers ‘mother bear’ or ‘mama bear.’ Bears are badass moms. They give it all. So, it’s a lullaby from the bear’s perspective within the den.”\n\n<b>“Skuggehesten”</b>\n“It means ‘Shadow Horse,’ and we’re in the human realm again, not the bear realm. It’s basically a long set of metaphors and descriptions of when you’re in a dark place or when darkness rides you. It’s pretty aggressive in a way. At the same time, it’s emotional. It’s the type of song I really recommend you have a look at the lyrics. It, of course, is best if you know the original language because it’s not as poetic in the translation, but we always include English translations in our booklets.”\n\n<b>“Tretale”</b>\n“It means ‘The Voice of Trees.’ It’s basically a song about how your surroundings speak to you—or through you, potentially—if you listen. It’s the type of voice that whispers silently in your ear. You can’t necessarily hear it externally, but it speaks through you from within. A lot of the sounds you hear in the song, it’s me out in the forest shaking big and small trees, scraping on the bark of many different trees and twigs and all sorts of things—and the wind in many different types of leaves. So, the soundscape is very much trees. Trees and instruments, of course.”\n\n<b>“Lyfjaberg”</b>\n“It means ‘The Healing Mountain,’ and this song came out a few years ago. It was made after the last album was finished, but as a result of us having to postpone the record [due to the COVID-19 pandemic], that is why we released the song [in 2020]. We really wanted to release music, and a lot of people were waiting. We know Lyfjaberg from the old myths and the old Eddic poetry as a mythical place where, if you were able to climb this mountain, you would be healed of all your illnesses. So, the song contains incantations and ancient healing spells. And climbing a mountain is a very good metaphor also for fighting difficult things in your life. The core of it is that anything of true value comes at a true cost. You won’t reach the top of the mountain without walking uphill.”","short":"The mystical Norwegian folk troupe offer a song cycle about the she-bear."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/birna/1766752112","playParams":{"id":"1766752112","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5clP0vXvX350quRCTw248H"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1766752112/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"299406921","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/299406921?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737716065292}}},"1767636603":{"id":"1767636603","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767636603?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/31/ff/0c/31ff0ce6-7cfe-e649-e324-25f224d91c53/97fc0d4a-9ec2-409f-980e-28fe980a0a3e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7a19b","textColor2":"cba99e","textColor4":"ac8b82","textColor1":"d9c4be","bgColor":"301610","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vukovi/465243182","name":"MY GOD HAS GOT A GUN","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"VUKOVI","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ed/96/88/ed968879-34d5-8c8b-7206-c8d78b27bde3/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdc0c6","textColor2":"f91921","textColor4":"c8151c","textColor1":"eceff6","bgColor":"040406","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"The alt metal duo delivers an absorbing mix of intensity and invention."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-god-has-got-a-gun/1767636603","playParams":{"id":"1767636603","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3NuG2Ua7jKgshFKhXC2Mxk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767636603/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"465243182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/465243182?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737695333784}}},"1767658574":{"id":"1767658574","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1767658574?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e0/9c/88/e09c88ca-83d5-aa0c-5b0b-2a1cddee4266/0182b2b5-c0de-431d-854b-acbffeba2154.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1e2b34","textColor2":"191f25","textColor4":"324047","textColor1":"00050d","bgColor":"96c3cf","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/df/00/dcdf000e-e2e2-57fd-bf5b-12a44e0e01de/bcad7095-9a91-428b-9b1a-16c00ff0aaf2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"363230","textColor2":"181615","textColor4":"343232","textColor1":"1a1513","bgColor":"a5a5a4","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0b/17/69/0b17693a-9126-f849-c373-36d2921d918f/ce3c4ff9-b13a-482c-b007-6faa28928cd3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1c262a","textColor2":"12161b","textColor4":"253139","textColor1":"070708","bgColor":"72a1b2","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fka-twigs/679661890","name":"EUSEXUA","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"FKA twigs","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/18/62/27/18622713-a797-9f9d-b85c-f0373f190a27/075679634382.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"393433","textColor2":"3b2c28","textColor4":"594f4a","textColor1":"120c0a","bgColor":"d3d8d4","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"One summer night in 2022, during a break from shooting <i>The Crow</i> reboot in Prague, FKA twigs found her way outside the city to a warehouse rave, where hundreds of strangers were dancing to loud, immersive techno. The experience snapped the English polymath (singer, dancer, songwriter, actor, force of nature) out of the intense brain fog she’d been stuck inside for years—so much so that she was moved to invent a word to describe the transcendent clarity, a portmanteau of “sex” and “euphoria” (which also sounds a bit like the Greek word used to celebrate a discovery: eureka!). <i>EUSEXUA</i>, twigs’ third studio album (and her first full-length release since her adventurous 2022 mixtape, <i>Caprisongs</i>), is not explicitly a dance record—more a love letter to dance music’s emancipating powers, channeled through the auteur’s heady, haunting signature style.\n\nThe throbbing percussion from that fateful warehouse rave pulses through the record, warping according to the mood: slinky, subterranean trip-hop on the hedonistic “Girl Feels Good,” or big-room melodrama on the strobing “Room of Fools.” On the cyborgian “Drums of Death” (produced by Koreless, who worked closely alongside twigs and appears on every track), twigs evokes a short-circuiting sexbot at an after-hours rave in the Matrix, channeling sensations of hot flesh against cold metal as she implores you to “Crash the system...Serve cunt/Serve violence.” Intriguing strangers emerge from <i>EUSEXUA</i>’s sea of fog, all of them seeking the same thing twigs is—sticky, sweaty, ego-killing, rapturous catharsis.","short":"The UK polymath’s heady love letter to dance music’s emancipating

Album","standard":"Don’t let the title fool you. Josh Ward may be the same ol’ cowboy on this 2025 LP, but the rodeo competitor turned country singer-songwriter still has plenty to say. The Houston-born artist, who also spent time in the Texas oil fields before turning to music, sticks to his roots on this 12-pack of tunes, pairing expertly crafted traditional country arrangements with vivid, often emotional snapshots of a simple life lived hard. The record opens with “There’s a Drink for That,” a lively two-stepper with the soul of Chris Stapleton and the swing of George Strait. “Ain’t Got to Me Yet” is lush and layered, with big ’90s harmonies and an emphasis on melody, landing like a tear-drenched “Neon Moon.”\n\n“Beer Joint Down” and “Better on a Barstool” don’t reinvent the drinking song but more than do the canon justice with gritty honky-tonk riffs and plenty of fiddle, and closer “Walkin’ in My Boots” shows Ward’s softer side as he considers how his own son might follow in his footsteps. The title track is the record’s centerpiece and thesis statement, as Ward takes admiring stock of the many ways to live the cowboy life, tipping his hat to those who “die young” and those who live to see “another day, another dollar, another place in time.”","short":"The rodeo cowboy turned country star sticks to his roots on this

Album","standard":"After several years building a following on YouTube with his inventive cover songs (as well as a viral <i>America’s Got Talent</i> appearance alongside Journey’s Neal Schon), Georgia-hailing singer-songwriter Teddy Swims burst onto the global pop scene in 2023 with <i>I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1)</i>, which featured the chart-topping single “Lose Control” and showcased his innovative blend of country’s open-hearted melodicism and the soulful textures of vintage R&B. The sequel to that record finds Swims diving headlong into the latter genre more than ever before, with a few guests to accentuate his loverboy stylings; GIVĒON lends his impressive lower range to the slow jam “Are You Even Real,” while Coco Jones and GloRilla make for perfect foils on the swaggering, low-slung “She Got It?”\n\nBut as with its predecessor, <i>ITEBT (Part 2)</i> is above all a testament to Swims’ adventurousness; single “Bad Dreams” combines modern-production touches with a retro-rock sound favored by contemporaries like Black Pumas and Leon Bridges, while the sweeping chorus of “Guilty” finds Swims tipping a cowboy hat towards his recent work with artists like Thomas Rhett and Luke Bryan. Swims’ wide-ranging approach continues to ensure that there’s something for everyone in his music, even as he retains his sense of self throughout.","short":"Like any good sequel, it’s bigger, bolder, and more adventurous."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ive-tried-everything-but-therapy-part-2/1771020838","playParams":{"id":"1771020838","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6kvSdLjli85tMwW4jlCN0o"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771020838/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1462541757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1462541757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737724404456}}},"1771767801":{"id":"1771767801","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771767801?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9a/20/0c/9a200c84-ca24-7d44-e42e-68fbc1a72515/Job2e6276eb-3dab-4592-b00b-b77d2e4d3f9c-177714526-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347208472_1927635783-Time1729268902336.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b3d8e8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"201912"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d0cdd3","textColor2":"b3d8e8","textColor4":"9cbfd0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"201912","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/78/47/7e/78477e6a-6809-acb6-167a-f0a838b4de8a/0e65ddcc-ff93-414d-908c-7b2c7c232cfa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5cbd4","textColor2":"dead8d","textColor4":"b89581","textColor1":"eef0f4","bgColor":"223753","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e9/14/67/e914676e-1000-16ac-cc03-06ec3f1f9b30/Job0d3851c1-78b9-456b-bf96-170dd849c3a7-177714527-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347208473_1927635782-Time1729270819301.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c7d9de","textColor2":"fbdfd4","textColor4":"d5c5bf","textColor1":"e9f7fa","bgColor":"405d6f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ea/6c/9d/ea6c9dc1-e09f-76cf-ba4d-afc452bc58f4/bc63eab9-c90e-423d-bcf3-cf11048a5a33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d7d6d7","textColor2":"e9f5f9","textColor4":"cbd7dd","textColor1":"f8f4f1","bgColor":"51606e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/b5/7b/0fb57b28-cca8-57ef-b0c9-7c9dc86c2cbb/9c3192f8-02b1-46f7-831c-ac8e648eaa40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ceced6","textColor2":"d4e0e4","textColor4":"b6c3ca","textColor1":"f3edf4","bgColor":"3c5260","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kane-brown/930928857","name":"The High Road","artistName":"Kane Brown","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/36/1a/ae361a2e-cea6-d47f-166b-1c015726846b/196872381474.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b1bec1","textColor2":"97c8e3","textColor4":"8aadbf","textColor1":"c8dde5","bgColor":"554333","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since he skyrocketed to stardom with his 2016 debut full-length, Kane Brown’s strength has been his versatility—a vision of mainstream country broad enough to accommodate the sounds of R&B, hip-hop, and pop. But as the 31-year-old singer from Chattanooga, Tennessee, tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, his fourth album is the first one where he could really be meticulous. “I got thrown into all this,” he said. “This album I’m really excited about, because I actually took my time. I actually got to rewrite some lyrics. I feel like everything’s placed.”\n\nOn <i>The High Road</i>, the follow-up to 2022’s <i>Different Man</i>, Brown remains steadfast in his conviction that being a country star does not require a strict adherence to the old notions of genre. “I’m like a burnt CD from ’03 in a Mustang/You never knew what was coming,” he crows on “Fiddle in the Band,” a bluegrass barnstormer that’s as country as it gets for a manifesto about genre defiance. But country’s strict borders have loosened in the nine years since his breakthrough, and these days it’s Brown’s vulnerability that stands out—outlining a laundry list of fears on the arena-ready “I Am,” or documenting the wide-eyed questions he hears as a girl dad on the sweet ballad “Backseat Driver.”\n\nBrown takes a page from Jelly Roll’s book on “Haunted,” a duet with the fellow Tennessean that shows Brown at his most fearless, admitting that success isn’t enough to silence his demons. Penned at a writer’s retreat in London in what appeared to be a haunted hotel, Brown connected the bleak environs to his mental state. “What if we write a song called ‘Haunted’?” he remembers thinking, then took it one step further: “Then I was like, ‘It could just be about our depression.’ I always try to get dark with my writers, and sometimes they’re like, ‘Well, that’s too dark.’ I’m like, ‘Is it, though?’” Luckily, in Brown’s world, the only rule is that there are no rules.\n","short":"More genre-melding collaborations and compositions on album

Album","standard":"This sophomore album from Max McNown comes less than a year after his 2024 full-length debut, the viral success <i>Willfully Blind</i>. On that outing, the pop-folk singer-songwriter from Oregon crafted a collection of songs tailor-made for fans of fellow of-the-moment troubadours like Noah Kahan and Zach Bryan. <i>Night Diving</i> doesn’t mess with that formula, instead doubling down on the raw, heart-on-his-sleeve sound that made McNown a TikTok favorite. <i>Night Diving</i> opens with its title track, a brooding rendering of youthful regret that recalls the more somber sounds of The Lumineers. Another ballad, “It’s Not Your Fault,” offers absolution to an unknown subject, adding a sense of universality to the song’s titular message. And another highlight, “Roses and Wolves,” is the lone collaboration on the album, bringing McNown together with critically acclaimed country singer-songwriter Hailey Whitters for a duet about the last days of a doomed relationship.","short":"The Oregon newcomer’s second album doubles down on earnest songwriting."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/night-diving/1778758844","playParams":{"id":"1778758844","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10hjsM00M8pghNdZRwOShY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1778758844/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1682299543","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1682299543?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737728256241}}},"1779127207":{"id":"1779127207","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779127207?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ca/cf/8b/cacf8b06-f36e-7ef8-051a-8a4da8a804e5/3178c1ce-b234-403d-81df-b6051a1fc647.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"161a1e","textColor2":"0f1215","textColor4":"22272b","textColor1":"010304","bgColor":"6d7a86","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/10/f8/fb/10f8fb7d-0e8c-82db-b9d9-026e279149ff/bbb35c08-8bdb-4086-b858-f14da60e06c0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1c2228","textColor2":"121416","textColor4":"282d33","textColor1":"040608","bgColor":"7e93a7","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jojo/5519840","name":"NGL","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"JoJo","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/36/ec/05/36ec05ef-4603-e5b7-a35c-4b8df6540e42/4099964131369.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"1e292e","textColor2":"10181b","textColor4":"243136","textColor1":"080e12","bgColor":"7794a2","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"“Here’s what I know: I’ve never been good at playing games, but I’m great at telling the truth,” Joanna “JoJo” Levesque writes in the introduction to her 2024 memoir, <i>Over the Influence</i>. She underlines that assertion on her energetic fourth EP, where she takes stock of her last two-plus decades in the pop spotlight and shows how her versatile soprano can take on any beat thrown at it.\n\nJoJo made a splash in 2004 with the petulant “Leave (Get Out),” an airy pop-R&B cut that showcased her preternatural ability to deliver real-talking lyrics in a candy-sweet fashion. In the 20-plus years since, through professional and personal struggles, the Massachusetts singer has only sharpened that talent, as this eight-track release appealingly proves. “Nobody,” the groove-forward track that opens <i>NGL</i>, is defiant, with JoJo declaring, “Nobody gon’ love me like me/Settlin’ don’t make no sense” over synth horns and a beat that recalls the most bounce-minded new jack swing cuts.\n\n<i>NGL</i> finds JoJo unbound by others’ expectations; the anxiety-riddled “Too Much to Say” frames her declarations of being “imperfect but a real thing” in insistent guitar licks, while on the skittering “Porcelain” she explores her voice’s highest reaches as she notes how any troubles she’s had in the past have only made her more resilient in the present. The EP’s genre-shifting, which includes a stripped-down piano reimagining of “Porcelain,” shows how they’ve also made her more curious and confident as an artist. Once tied up in label red tape, she’s now free to use her voice in any context she deems appropriate, whether it’s the <i>TRL</i>-era throwback confection “Ready to Love” or the stretched-out

Release","standard":"Posthumous rap albums can often feel opportunistic: indiscriminate grab bags cobbled together for one last payday. But <i>Balloonerism</i>—the second album from the beloved musician since his death in 2018, released two days ahead of what would have been his 33rd birthday—is far from an assemblage of cutting-room floor scraps. Culled from a single week of extended jam sessions (according to close collaborators), the album is considered to be Mac Miller’s “lost project,” recorded between his 2013 album <i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> and his 2014 mixtape <i>Faces</i>—arguably the most pivotal year of his creative evolution. “It is a project that was of great importance to Malcolm, to the extent that he commissioned artwork for it,” read a statement from Miller’s estate confirming the official release in fall 2024, noting the unofficial bootleg versions that have circulated through the years.\n\nThere’s only one voice besides Miller’s across <i>Balloonerism</i>’s 14 deep and dreamy tracks—that of SZA, his longtime friend, who appears on “DJ’s Chord Organ,” a heady track credited to Miller’s production alter ego Larry Fisherman that borrows a chord organ once belonging to lo-fi folk hero Daniel Johnston. Otherwise, Miller goes his own way, probing life’s great mysteries with modesty and good humor. The rattle of a tambourine echoes through the album, produced in part by Thundercat, as do Miller’s preoccupations with death as a concept, a puzzle, a voyeuristic spectacle, and, finally, life’s ultimate trip. “What does death feel like?” he wonders repeatedly on “Rick’s Piano,” believed to have been recorded at Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La studio. And on the hushed and haunting epic “Tomorrow Will Never Know,” he looks down at himself from a distant God’s-eye view and arrives at the enlightened conclusion: “Living and dying are one and the same.”","short":"A pivotal “lost” album gets an official release, five years after his passing."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/balloonerism/1780891320","playParams":{"id":"1780891320","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ANFIaCb53iam0MBkFFoxY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780891320/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"419944559","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/419944559?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737720471895}}},"1781093862":{"id":"1781093862","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781093862?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Punk","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/xpresidentx/1304341944","name":"Problemas Del Primer Mundo - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"XpresidentX","artwork":{"width":3508,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c1/81/6e/c1816e56-8056-6daa-b35c-c69f6851e495/8435621697018.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3508,"textColor3":"3b345c","textColor2":"102d3a","textColor4":"2f4862","textColor1":"1f1334","bgColor":"acb4ff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/problemas-del-primer-mundo-ep/1781093862","playParams":{"id":"1781093862","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781093862/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1304341944","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1304341944?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737695441760}}},"1781663977":{"id":"1781663977","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781663977?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sunrot/1294466411","name":"Passages - EP","artistName":"Sunrot","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6c/71/ac/6c71aca4-83f7-1a43-0566-7c600b0591c9/656191964531.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c93723","textColor2":"f2422a","textColor4":"c13422","textColor1":"fc442c","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/passages-ep/1781663977","playParams":{"id":"1781663977","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781663977/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1294466411","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1294466411?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737696023449}}},"1782004310":{"id":"1782004310","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782004310?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7c/ce/44/7cce447d-ec46-33fb-a498-7373d4dc2268/ff221d82-bb6a-4af7-89f5-7bea9f0a6ac5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"caacad","textColor2":"f4c4b4","textColor4":"cda69a","textColor1":"f1cbcb","bgColor":"2f2f34","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ty-myers/1674345303","name":"The Select","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ty Myers","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1d/aa/6d/1daa6df2-687a-e403-93ef-be515ba6d0a6/196872607864.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0aa80","textColor2":"e5836b","textColor4":"bd6e5d","textColor1":"eacd96","bgColor":"1a1c28","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Many young artists are touted as being old souls, but few have the chops, confidence, and clarity of vision of Ty Myers. The Austin-based singer-songwriter is just 17 as he releases his debut, though you’d be forgiven for thinking him at least a decade older after hearing the soulful weariness of opener “Ends of the Earth,” or the scrappy wisdom of the melodic and tender “Let ’Em Talk.” Myers seems to find inspiration in virtuosity, naming Stevie Ray Vaughan and Chris Stapleton among his primary influences. You can hear those connections across <i>The Select</i>, like when Myers goes for broke on the loose and funky “Can’t Hold Me Down,” and in much of his guitar playing, which, like Vaughan’s did, tends toward blues while dipping into jazz. Myers also includes a cover of fellow SRV fan John Mayer’s “Man on the Side.” To boot, Myers is just as skilled at choosing collaborators, as Anderson East, Trent Dabbs, and Jessi Alexander are credited as co-writers.","short":"A teen guitar virtuoso with the chops and wisdom of someone twice his age."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-select/1782004310","playParams":{"id":"1782004310","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4tE4n1E0qtAfJTh8IPT9TN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782004310/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1674345303","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1674345303?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737716178818}}},"1782375874":{"id":"1782375874","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782375874?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bodyimage/1453536616","name":"The Rot","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"bodyimage","artwork":{"width":1600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2a/6b/48/2a6b4802-4036-acb5-97dc-c99a6f124e92/8721253347835.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1600,"textColor3":"dcb687","textColor2":"f8bb82","textColor4":"dea372","textColor1":"f6d29d","bgColor":"744332","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rot/1782375874","playParams":{"id":"1782375874","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ltkfj24OXsqB3QJxosqDq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782375874/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1453536616","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1453536616?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737696680746}}},"1782981170":{"id":"1782981170","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782981170?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","Country","Americana"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-17","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/d5/d4/7a/d5d47a77-188c-d4ac-8f07-605201882ad9/Jobe6786cd6-bb2b-4609-9316-b29912fd2dc8-183884564-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359577610_2023534924-Time1737051886616.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","362925"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c7c6b5"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"554a44","textColor2":"362925","textColor4":"5d534e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c7c6b5","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d8/37/ff/d837ff97-0e32-9ac4-d32b-213457b42776/924fda06-7782-471e-be7b-193837d5c003.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2d2e","textColor2":"1d1716","textColor4":"3f3a39","textColor1":"090808","bgColor":"c7c5c6","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/10/41/e5/1041e588-0938-09f8-e9cd-d1d1b53730b0/Job77c021aa-e735-482e-8387-73d39104acb3-183884563-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359577611_2023534923-Time1737050246853.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"524442","textColor2":"35281c","textColor4":"5b5044","textColor1":"2a1919","bgColor":"f2f1e4","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1e/19/a3/1e19a335-4884-2f1b-97ff-b99ba771323f/58f7f5fa-7613-466b-badb-45b3e71444e6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dddbd3","textColor2":"e7e2da","textColor4":"cac4bd","textColor1":"fefff6","bgColor":"5a4d49","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/willow-avalon/1579587659","name":"Southern Belle Raisin' Hell","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Willow Avalon","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fa/55/a6/fa55a678-f638-65ef-ec51-1e95164cfb36/075679624147.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"584d48","textColor2":"3e302b","textColor4":"625751","textColor1":"312420","bgColor":"f5f5eb","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A scan of her lyrics might suggest otherwise, but Willow Avalon first found her love for music while performing at the local Baptist church in her small Georgia hometown—hardly a natural habitat for hell-raisers of any kind. Instead, you hear that church choir influence in her voice, which splits the difference between Lainey Wilson’s warbling twang and Lana Del Rey’s dusky croon. Flourishes of soulful Southern gospel find their way, often sneakily, into most tracks on this debut album from Avalon, like the Parton-checking “Hey There, Dolly” with its down-home harmonies, and the feisty, quick-fire verses of the vice-laden “Something We Regret.” Lyrically, religious imagery tends more toward fire and brimstone, like on “Damned,” where Avalon likens a situationship to purgatory. Avalon is as confident and capable a songwriter as she is a vocalist, and this first full-length project from the young country up-and-comer is unusually assured. The more she raises hell, it seems, the higher her star rises.","short":"The Georgia singer-songwriter’s full-length debut is rowdy and confident."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/southern-belle-raisin-hell/1782981170","playParams":{"id":"1782981170","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1WYlyS9peUWJQTbUnFyqRD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782981170/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1579587659","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1579587659?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737716037765}}},"1783397147":{"id":"1783397147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783397147?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/antonio-pinto/80436219","name":"Flight Risk (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Antonio Pinto","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/20/a5/97/20a597fb-3f55-92d2-af45-4b88b8cf2001/780163665628.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"99b5cd","textColor2":"b4d5f3","textColor4":"90abc4","textColor1":"bfe2fe","bgColor":"020307","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/flight-risk-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1783397147","playParams":{"id":"1783397147","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1c1WvL11HUtrkeNmEVc7qB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783397147/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"80436219","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/80436219?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737657536596}}},"1783404289":{"id":"1783404289","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783404289?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/21/a4/db/21a4db0b-12c4-3e22-d909-a98000856254/ba7a37e6-4cc0-44b4-b53e-a9e1ae98a104.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c0be","textColor2":"cacfdb","textColor4":"b0b2ba","textColor1":"e2e0df","bgColor":"473f3a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/19/e4/6a/19e46a55-65ae-f561-0aed-97a00182dfbb/b98f46aa-99d3-42d2-a0ea-9c0c628c736c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d1d1","textColor2":"dfcccb","textColor4":"c0b1b0","textColor1":"f9f5f5","bgColor":"434345","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/93/d0/9e/93d09e60-ef04-2cd6-40bb-0b2a45911f11/d03dfb75-ef87-4181-b6e7-e9d828db337b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dad7d6","textColor2":"e6eef8","textColor4":"cbcfd5","textColor1":"f9f9f9","bgColor":"61534a","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/central-cee/1085149646","name":"CAN'T RUSH GREATNESS","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Central Cee","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/7f/ef/5a7fefe9-5b4c-c72b-2446-6d4a0bc1d819/196872591545.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdd0ce","textColor2":"cab6a9","textColor4":"a7988e","textColor1":"f9fbf8","bgColor":"1c2024","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I kind of prolonged my come-up,” Central Cee tells Apple Music. Off the success of record-breaking global hits “Doja” and “Sprinter,” not to mention the indisputable smash “Band4Band” with Lil Baby, nobody could have faulted the “Wild” West London native from hastily dropping an album to capitalize on any of those singles. But as he’d be happy to remind any of his fans, it was already an uphill battle just being a rapper out of Shepherd’s Bush, which makes his long-anticipated full-length debut, <i>CAN’T RUSH GREATNESS</i>, all the more momentous.\n\n“The first two projects were mixtapes,” he explains of his prior work. “The energy I put into them is what made it a mixtape, and the energy I premeditated to put into the album and the timing of everything is what the album is.” In line with that intent, Cee’s conflicted state of mind quickly comes to the fore on opener “No Introduction,” acknowledging and accepting the whirlwind of fame while concurrently craving a more tranquil life. Those changes manifest throughout the album, with him straddling diverging worlds on the drill dazzler “5 Star” and struggling with resonant pain on the plaintive “Limitless.”\n\nWhile the instantly gratifying “St. Patrick’s” indulges in familiar flagrant flexes, the album gets decidedly deeper than rap via tracks like “Don’t Know Anymore” and “Walk in Wardrobe,” with the latter’s late beat-switch raising the stakes. “It’s hard for me to rap in such a reflective wake,” he says. “I just want to look ahead at the light at the end of the tunnel and not really think about certain things.”\n\nWhile a substantial amount of the lyrical material skews intimately local, Cee’s worldwide reach reveals itself largely via collaborations with the likes of Lil Durk and Young Miko. Still, as good as it feels to hear him going bar for bar with 21 Savage on trap stunner “GBP,” his link with UK rap icon Skepta on “Ten” and reunion with <i>Split Decision</i> mate Dave on “CRG” just hit different, in the best way. “These songs aren’t really for the masses,” he says, “but just to touch the people, remind everyone that I’m human—that <i>they’re</i> human.”\n","short":"The wait’s over.

Even before “KEHLANI,” an ode to the US singer-songwriter, earned him a Grammy nomination in 2024, he’d won the admiration of Bring Me The Horizon’s Oli Sykes (who helped him secure his first record deal), while Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody regularly voiced support for Adetunji on his radio show. Securing Kehlani themselves for the remix of “KEHLANI” has led to more top-tier collaborations—Lil Baby appeared on the Chase & Status-co-produced single “Options” in October 2024—and this genre-blurring mixtape arrived primed to continue his ascent.\n\nAdetunji has honed his sound from 2023’s debut mixtape <i>ROCK ’N’ RAVE</i> to make a supremely self-assured and polished follow-up full of intimate lyrics. “I feel like my sound’s advanced a lot,” he tells Apple Music. “I’ve taken so many lessons from when I made that experimental project, but now it’s a lot better. My vocal style is very R&B, but I just blend with alternative sounds, so I’d call it alternative R&B.”\n\nHe’s also made the most of that voice, playing with sound to create the right vibe for each track. “I try to manipulate my voice to match certain sound frequencies whenever I’m making a song,” he says. “Sometimes I’ll speed the track up, then slow it down just to match the right frequency until it feels right. I want it to feel sonically right to me, energy-wise.”\n\nThese 10 tracks were written and produced by Adetunji, who worked with global names including Take A Daytrip, Chase & Status, and Danny Casio. Collaborators Lil Baby, Bryson Tiller, and, of course, Kehlani add guest vocals. It all makes for a mixtape that is unlikely to put an end to the exciting moments when Adetunji hears his own songs in the wild. “I think it’s funny whenever I hear ‘KEHLANI’ being played in someone’s car,” he says. “When I’m in the club, I’m just in the back, low-key, and they play this song so I’m just watching people reacting to it. And I’m like, ‘No one even knows I made this.’” Read on as he talks Apple Music through <i>A Jaguar’s Dream</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“KEHLANI”</b>\n“Me and the boys, like Daytrip, sat in a session in LA and went through all the songs to work out which ones flowed well into each other, but this had to be the first track. Kehlani is such an amazing person. When I was writing this song, I didn’t really think she’d call me up one day but, at the same time, I manifested it. When she called me, I was in a club and I was a bit panicky because I was looking for the file to send the song to her. She’s given me so much advice and she’s like a big sister to me in the industry, which has helped me a lot.”\n\n<b>“Too Many Women” (feat. kwn)</b>\n“I’d seen kwn around a couple of times and when I checked out her music, I was like, ‘This is amazing.’ She was actually on the remix shoot of the ‘KEHLANI’ video. Then I saw her again at Kehlani’s show at the Barclays Center in New York. I was like, ‘Yo, we got to do something.’ So I hit her up on Instagram. I’d put up a snippet of a demo version of ‘Too Many Women’ when I literally just had a hook. She asked for the song, so I sent it across to her. She did a verse to it and the song became what it is now, which is really exciting.”\n\n<b>“Break the System”</b>\n“This song has the line ‘People change, but I don’t wanna.’ I feel like whenever I’m dropping music, everyone thinks that I should do things a certain way or change things, but I just can’t. I still try things out on TikTok, but I think if something worked, why would I change it? I do read comments, but I just ignore them. I’d rather continue to do what I do. You’re all here because of something I did, so I’m going to continue in my own way. And if you rock with it, you rock with it. If you don’t, au revoir.”\n\n<b>“305” (feat. Bryson Tiller)</b>\n“This is one of my favorite songs on here because it came about really organically. I was in the studio with Danny Casio and Parked Up and I started mumbling the melody, then I put words to it afterwards. But it was always a manifestation about me going to Miami, because at that time I’d never been before. I wrote this two months after ‘KEHLANI,’ then I sent it to Bryson Tiller, hoping he would do something on it. I’d already shot the video in Miami when he got back to me with a verse. I was like, ‘Oh, guess we have to scrap the video.’ I met Bryson at his house in Miami and he even pulled up to the video.”\n\n<b>“Bitter”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Bitter’ on my own in a studio house in LA. Everyone had left the room and I was looking at this amazing view and I just started singing it. I came up with the hook really easily. The first part I wrote was only 30 seconds long, so we had it as an interlude. Then we sampled the same song to make a second part and it became something else. I love it because I felt like it’s a beautiful piece of work and it’s very experimental. A lot of the songs on this mixtape are around two minutes long. Once I’ve said what I needed to say, I don’t add more. I’m happy I’ve captured that emotion in that timeframe, so I don’t feel the need to go on.”\n\n<b>“Dirty Diana”</b>\n“Michael Jackson was definitely one of my biggest inspirations so I called this song ‘Dirty Diana’ for a bit of fun. I made it in Paris and revisited it months later, so it feels like a long progression of different sounds and elements, with strings, backing vocals, and big synths. Then we made it like a crescendo at the end, which feels like a long moment. It’s very, very experimental, while it has elements of ‘KEHLANI.’ So I felt like this is great to put on the album because it’s still from that world. It’s a nice closing chapter to that bit of that sound.”\n\n<b>“Bedroom”</b>\n“‘Bedroom’ isn’t about one person in particular. I would say it’s about many different situations that I’ve been in and how I’ve felt at those times. We did so many stacks on this track—I had all these different melody ideas and we put it together like a puzzle. I’d love people to hear that file one day, there’s a hundred takes of me doing different melodies. It was just me and Danny Casio in the room when we made it. At the start, it was pretty difficult going from my bedroom to a studio, because I wanted the familiar setup with the mic in front of the monitor. I needed everything to look like a bedroom, with my laptop and mouse. Everyone in the studio was quite confused because I would never record in the booth!”\n\n<b>“Attractive”</b>\n“I know I’m putting my feelings out there on this track, but I’m excited to get more in-depth. Some of my lyrics are fantasy and others are raw thoughts. If I’m feeling in love, I’m in love. If I’m feeling like, ‘Nah, I’m hurt,’ I’m not afraid to write in that mood, whether I regret it later or not. I’ve kept the same mindset from the start. I feel like I just focus, I got my plan so I stick to it and just make it happen. The universe will decide if it works or not.”\n\n<b>“Options” (feat. Lil Baby)</b>\n“I’m a big fan of The Weeknd and Michael Jackson, and every time you look at these guys’ careers, you see an era. That’s what I want to do—I feel like I want my audience to come along, especially people that followed me from the beginning. And I want to show that elevation through visuals and play with their perceptions. I want people to think, ‘Oh, is this his sound? Is this what he’s going to keep making?’ Because I like playing with people. And it’s just like you have no idea what’s about to happen. It’s a fun game for me. I loved working with Lil Baby—he’s amazing, he’s funny and a very smart individual. We met in London before I recorded that song and he showed me a lot of love and told me to keep going.”\n\n<b>“KEHLANI (REMIX)” (feat. Kehlani)</b>\n“It made sense to open and close the album with ‘KEHLANI’ and I loved what she brought to the remix. I just let her do her thing. She actually did two verses: one was more rap and the other was more melodic. I liked both of them, so I let her decide which one to use.

Named after a classic skateboarding trick, the seven-member boy group is partially composed of winners from the 2021 survival series <i>LOUD</i> (Kyehoon, Amaru, Keiju, and Donghyeon) and partially composed of new faces (Donghwa, Juwang, and Minje). With mini-album <i>Flip it, Kick it!</i>, the group joins the music company’s pantheon of boy bands, which has included 2PM, GOT7, and Stray Kids.\n\nKickFlip’s proper introduction comes in the form of “Mama Said,” a lead single that throws off the weight of parental expectation with playful pop ease (“Mama said what are you trying to become/I don’t wanna/I don’t wanna”). The theme of easygoing defiance continues in bouncy, pre-release bop “Umm Great” (“Who’s nagging again this time?/Telling me I can’t do it?/Fine, I’ll just let it slide”) and the Young K-penned power-pop B-side “WARRIORS” (“I really hate fixed answers/Tear up the answer sheet, you too”). The result? A K-pop debut that’s just as comfortable with hip-hop-inflected teen swagger as it is skater-boy pop punk.","short":"A K-pop debut as comfortable with hip-hop swagger as skater-boy pop punk."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/flip-it-kick-it-ep/1787193034","playParams":{"id":"1787193034","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787193034/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1780698712","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1780698712?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737493326174}}},"1787208653":{"id":"1787208653","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787208653?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-20","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/honey-dijon/355901599","name":"Dijon FM with Honey Dijon, Ep. 2 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Honey Dijon","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f9/63/eb/f963ebad-c776-9591-925a-64b50bb3c552/13e0ba1b-9f11-4e49-942a-deddc225da96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"454545","textColor2":"1b1619","textColor4":"484447","textColor1":"161616","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dijon-fm-with-honey-dijon-ep-2-dj-mix/1787208653","playParams":{"id":"1787208653","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787208653/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"355901599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/355901599?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737656538031}}},"1788289236":{"id":"1788289236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1788289236?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-23","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sinizter/1441657967","name":"WAR, LIFE, DEATH -

Coming off a string of near-monthly releases with producers ranging from Conductor Williams to Harry Fraud, the versatile Griselda affiliate delivers once more with his second project of 2025, <i>Permanent Ink</i>. Recorded with fellow Detroiter Roger Goodman of Royal House, the 13-track effort showcases a specific set of skills applied to yet another sonic side of the genre, one simultaneously more commercial and authentically regional. His street lingo backed up by street smarts, he brings intimate knowledge of the game on cuts like “All On My Side” and “It Hit Different,” mixing business with pleasure as is his wont. “Gargoyle Pelle” and “Stop Signs & Yields” blend him overtly into his city’s distinct palette of sounds, his hustler’s joy and survivor’s pain blurred throughout.","short":"The ever-versatile Detroit rapper brings it all back home."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/permanent-ink/1789168498","playParams":{"id":"1789168498","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nPxQaMbEooBdz9t9HTrs8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789168498/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"446885417","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/446885417?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737730240584}}},"1789220398":{"id":"1789220398","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789220398?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/2d/64/d8/2d64d8a9-c41a-f314-1c06-cdba6be2d24b/32398503-d796-4b49-bd39-697ecbf913cf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"39343e","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"4c3d49","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"bbafc4","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4b/76/e3/4b76e3fb-7cf0-abcf-b4f3-b0b7017c1e1a/1fa8ad92-46bc-419f-b40f-2cd8ecc7f8a6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1800,"textColor3":"32262a","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"413a44","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b8adc0","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/08/14/1b/08141b50-297b-ef30-b1fc-e517270113d3/97fc94ca-ce97-43fd-92ee-e60269867197.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"343139","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"45403f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c4babf","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/10/25/c0/1025c0fa-2ca8-f836-e689-71bad7d1cab6/0d30d78c-b587-4235-8753-0d5c28af8d74.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"363136","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"3b3741","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"cecad6","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/majid-jordan/684530590","name":"Winter Warmers: Majid Jordan (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Majid Jordan","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/83/1d/2a/831d2ae8-8754-de42-e8dc-d627d2fe956c/7af41ca3-81d1-49b7-8a7a-0494aaf9778e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3c4bc","textColor2":"81c3ff","textColor4":"679ccb","textColor1":"f4f5eb","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B duo take us on an atmospheric journey of their winter listening.","standard":"Fusing the intensity of year-round Bahraini sunshine with the chill of the Canadian elements, Drake-anointed R&B two-piece Majid Jordan distill a unique side of winter with their dark and close DJ mix. “I love putting together mixes because it feels like putting together an album or a world of music to enjoy rather than a single song,” producer Jordan Ullman tells Apple Music. “This mix was inspired by all of the music I have listened to since the release of <i>Life 2</i>.

Following in the tradition of his zodiac-inspired <i>Year of the Dragon</i> and the collaborative Q-Tip mixtape <i>The Abstract and The Dragon</i>, this EP offers a preview of his promised return to fire-breathing form. Beginning with the ferociously boastful intro “Letter to My Children,” he proceeds to ensure that everything remains raw. No matter what kind of beat enters his lair, he wields seemingly supernatural rap powers over the music, from the positively funky single “Do the Busabus Pt.2” to the stop-start clamor of “Keep Executing.” The oft explicit nature of his lyrics only serves to strengthen his arguments, adding heft to the gospel-tinged boom-bap take “National Treasure.” The sole vocal guest here, emerging singer YG Marley, honors his own legacy with Jah praise over the reggae-pop grooves of “Treasure & Gold.”","short":"Flipmode’s finest gives a sneak preview of the serpent’s

DJ Mix","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of dance and electronic music’s best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. This month’s edition, made for the gym, comes from none other than Melanie C, the millennial pop icon, fka Sporty Spice, who is now a solo artist and touring DJ. True to form, she describes her own fitness routine as “beast mode” and says it spans running, cycling, strength training, and dancing behind the decks. For this mix, she leans into the music that motivates her. “Being a Spice Girl means I can have some fun with mixes,” she says, like opening with a mashup of Soulsearcher’s “Feelin’ Love (Club Mix)” and Spice Girls’ “Who Do You Think You Are.” Another of her favorites, “Move,” by ESSEL and MERYLL, was one of her frequent tunes to play out in 2024. “Music is massively important to me,” she says. “It gets me going if I’m not feeling it, and keeps me going when it gets tough—in every area of my life, not just working out.”","short":"Slam it to the left!

Mini Album","standard":"In 2014, GOT7 burst onto the third-generation K-pop scene to quickly become known as a group of charismatic, occasionally acrobatic performers of hip-hop-infused idol hits. <i>WINTER HEPTAGON</i>, the group’s first comeback in almost three years, is a testament to how far the seven members have come over the past decade—both collectively and as individual artists, and after their 2021 departure from JYP Entertainment.\n\nThe nine-track mini album includes lead single “PYTHON,” a smooth, hip-hop-infused track about trying to escape a powerful and toxic attraction (“I left my guard down for a minute/I never play with feelings, but I thought you were committed”), sharing themes with the group’s 2015 hit “If You Do.” The song was co-written and composed by BamBam, GOT7’s Thai rapper-singer. <i>WINTER HEPTAGON</i> also features “Yours Truly,” a sentimental fan song composed by leader JAY B, with lyrical contributions from all of the members.\n\nPast those two tracks, each member takes writing lead on one of the seven other songs, bringing their distinct musical interests to the collection: “SMOOTH” (Jackson Wang), “Our Youth” (Young-jae), “REMEMBER” (Yugyeom), “Darling” (JAY B), “TIDAL WAVE” (BamBam), “OUT THE DOOR” (Mark Tuan), and “her” (Jinyoung).

Here, he leans in to the qualities that marked him out as such a compelling talent to begin with—melodic instrumentals, sharp wordplay, dexterous flows, emotional veracity—and ups his game. \n\nThe production is elevated: sleeker, more complex. “Diamond Blick” ornaments an otherwise ominous beat with sweet-toned flourishes reminiscent of early-2000s R&B, while skittering drums meet ruminative piano and soulful guitar licks on “Peepholes.” Collaborations with peers like Rylo Rodriguez, another leading figure in the Alabama hip-hop scene, sit alongside cuts featuring French Montana and Quavo—unambiguous indications of NoCap’s rapid rise through the ranks. \n\nThematically, women are a preponderance; often, the desire for success clashes with more primal needs: “And I know that it should be the money/But somehow I got you on my conscious,” he confesses on the moody ’90s-rock-influenced highlight “One More Summer.” And while NoCap’s raw honesty is still the most essential facet of his wide appeal, it’s the amalgamation of disparate musical inspirations and his versatile cadence that make <i>Before I Disappear Again</i> such an unpredictable and thrilling listen.","short":"The Alabama rapper clears his own bar on his dynamic second record."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/before-i-disappear-again-deluxe/1791218775","playParams":{"id":"1791218775","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/76wZY8c9VU9cn2rIy4MycL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791218775/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1237732480","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1237732480?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737716327266}}},"1791506006":{"id":"1791506006","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791506006?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/linkin-park/148662","name":"From Zero: A Cappellas","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"LINKIN PARK","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c8/2b/68/c82b6899-6bc1-a528-560e-0c82aa035b08/093624833819.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"2e212a","textColor2":"091416","textColor4":"312937","textColor1":"050a07","bgColor":"d27cb9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-zero-a-cappellas/1791506006","playParams":{"id":"1791506006","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1x6p39FFIESOq8q8B4oQXN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791506006/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"148662","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/148662?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737656894537}}},"1791518859":{"id":"1791518859","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791518859?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/1a/c9/5c/1ac95c6e-cf59-5fbb-9c51-95fbb6b0fac4/6feba1d5-a415-43fc-88b0-10a9f4ced2c5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c8c9c7","textColor2":"e7f2e0","textColor4":"c0c5b4","textColor1":"f2f7f7","bgColor":"231107","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zack-ryan/376307617","name":"Presence (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Zack Ryan","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6e/bc/dc/6ebcdcee-0706-4baf-6f3d-bd583b753c55/196872486605.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5d0ce","textColor2":"d4d6d0","textColor4":"b3b0a9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2f170c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","short":"Ryan provides a majestic and intense score to the Steven Soderbergh horror."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/presence-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1791518859","playParams":{"id":"1791518859","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZQNzB8XfqeMugRBdBwGxj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791518859/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"376307617","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/376307617?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737682242543}}},"1791639408":{"id":"1791639408","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791639408?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jason-aldean/63684710","name":"Whiskey Drink -

His first album, 2023’s <i>Amar</i>, established him as a bona fide star, but rapping is no longer his main focus. BigX is a proud father of two, and everything he does (rap included) is to give his children things he was never afforded. On 2024’s <i>TAKE CARE</i>, he makes clear where his priorities lie.\n\n“My kids is what drives me,” he tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “That’s the reason when I’m tired and I get up every day when I don’t want to get up, they’re the reason.” This album, as such, is for the next generation. Yes, he raps his ass off and showcases why he’s one of Texas’ most celebrated stars, but more important than acclaim and fame is making sure the mouths that rely on him are adequately fed. “My little boy, he made me realize, ‘Okay, life is for real. This is a real thing.’” \n\nThat seriousness makes its way onto <i>TAKE CARE</i>, like on “Therapy Session.” X showcases his signature Southern drawl over cheery piano chords, stinging handclaps, and soaring guitar solos. He lays out the stakes for the entire record, paying tribute to his two children: “My family rely/When I be away from ’em I cry/’Cause I love ’em the most, I’d hate for them ever to say that their daddy wasn’t right on they side,” he raps. “I feel like I see the whole world,” he says. “I really understand why we’re here.”\n","short":"One of Texas’ most celebrated stars is doing it for the
