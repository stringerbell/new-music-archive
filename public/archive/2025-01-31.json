Album and Interview","standard":"“This has been a healing album to make,” Chris Davids tells Apple Music. “It’s a collection of hopeful music made from a dark place.” For Davids and Liam Ivory, the British production duo better known as Maribou State, the road leading to their third album, <i>Hallucinating Love</i>, has indeed been a dark and tricky one. First coming to prominence with the emotive melodies and electronic warmth of 2015’s debut album <i>Portraits</i>, the duo went on to make their trademark a distinct blend of soulful vocals and dance-floor-filling songwriting. \n\nYet, in 2021, following a triumphant European tour for second album <i>Kingdoms in Colour</i>, Davids’ physical health began to decline, culminating in a serious operation for a rare brain condition in 2023. As he awaited his procedure and during his recovery, <i>Hallucinating Love</i> took shape, resulting in 10 tracks of resolute optimism that traverse everything from the swelling strings melody of opener “Blackoak” to the cabin folk stylings of “Peace Talk” and the driving electronic drum groove of “Eko’s.” “The experience of making the record was one of overcoming hopelessness,” Ivory says. “The music projects a brighter future.” Read on for Maribou State’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track. \n\n<b>“Blackoak”</b>\nChris Davids: “This is one of the first tracks we finished for the record and it became a benchmark for what we wanted the rest of the album to be. It began when we went on a writing retreat to Somerset and decided to make demos in two hours only, so we wouldn’t overthink the process. One day, we came up with this idea on a little Casio with our bassist Jonjo Williams, we sampled an Andreya Triana vocal that we loved and had the form of the track really quickly.”\nLiam Ivory: “We wrote it in a day and then it took something like a year and 25 demos to finish! Andreya thankfully tweaked and changed some of the vocals on a later session and then it was perfect.”\n\n<b>“Otherside” (with Holly Walker)</b> \nLI: “We came up with this idea on the same day as ‘Blackoak.’ We made a basic loop that we loved and then struggled to find a vocal that would work with it. Initially, it was a pop vocal sample as the hook but when we revisited the idea two years later on another writing trip, we took a vocal that the incredible singer Holly Walker had laid down for a song that didn’t make the cut on <i>Kingdoms in Colour</i> and that seemed to fit much better.”\nCD: “Two weeks before we had to hand the album in, I reworked the take of that vocal with Holly and then it all came together. It’s a beautiful last-minute addition.”\n\n<b>“II Remember”</b> \nCD: “When we were coming up with ideas for the album, we recorded lots of drum breaks on to tape with our drummer, and one of them became the basis for this track. A month later, I found a vocal sample that sat perfectly over the beat and that’s also when the middle eight came to me, which is actually just the reversed string part from ‘Peace Talk’—a track that comes later in the album.”\nLI: “The finishing touches came from some field recordings we made while walking around our local area in Walthamstow. You can hear someone talking from the market there before the middle eight comes in.”\n\n<b>“All I Need”</b> \nLI: “Another thing we did at the start of the album is a ‘sound harvest,’ where we went into the studio and recorded as many experimental and unique sounds we could to add texture to future tracks. One of the sounds we recorded was an Omnichord, and it formed the basis for ‘All I Need.’ Initially, we paired the track with the same Andreya Triana vocal sample from ‘Blackoak’ until we recorded with Andreya the following year and she laid down this perfect new part.”\n\n<b>“Dance on the World” (with North Downs)</b>\nLI: “This is the ultimate Frankenstein tune on the record! It spans the entire three years that we were working on the album, since it started on our first writing trip to Somerset as a piano-led bluesy track, then we took it to New York and it became a track that ended up feeling really out of place with our sound, so we admitted defeat. Later, though, we discovered another demo Chris had made that was more electronic and along the lines of a track like ‘Turnmills’ from our second record. Ultimately, we mashed them up together, rewrote the vocals and it all came together.” \n\n<b>“Bloom” (with Gaidaa)</b>\nCD: “We had a vocal session with the amazing singer Gaidaa in Amsterdam, and I chopped up one of the tracks we came up with to form the vocal melody for ‘Bloom.’ We were unsure if it should go on the record, though, until the end of the writing process when we scrapped quite a few tracks last minute and this idea resurfaced. We went back into the studio, rerecorded the parts and suddenly it was working really well.”\n\n<b>“Peace Talk” (with Holly Walker)</b>\nCD: “This first came from an idea that didn’t make it on to <i>Kingdoms in Colour</i> but that we always had an affinity for. We sent it to Holly Walker, and she put down the first vocal idea that came up and me and Liam loved it. It’s one of our favorite tracks she’s done with us. The incredible strings arranger Matt Kelly then recorded the strings parts and we fleshed out the end of the song with an experimental Aphex Twin synth part on the Moog Matriarch. We both really love the track because it merges lots of our favorite genres like folk, electronics, and heavy distorted guitar. It feels like the most original or accomplished track on the album.”\n\n<b>“Passing Clouds”</b> \nLI: “In the studio, while we waited to get set up in the live room, we played around on a Hammond B3 and piano and really liked what we spontaneously came up with. We then went on to make versions where we built the track up, or we left it as a quiet interlude, but finally we decided to go for something in between. It’s a moment to breathe on the record and the only idea on it that we played fully live and together.”\n\n<b>“Eko’s”</b> \nCD: “This was probably the first thing we wrote for the album back in 2020. We had just gotten some new bits of kit like a drum machine and laid down this idea, but then we didn’t work on it for three years until we started finishing the album and our drummer recorded the final drum part. It’s the first track I’ve ever sung on that we have used on a project.” \nLI: “Before ‘Blackoak’ this was the benchmark for the album, since as a demo it felt so forward-thinking and fresh compared to <i>Kingdoms in Colour</i>. It still stands out on the album.”\n\n<b>“Rolling Stone”</b> \nCD: “We began ‘Rolling Stone’ at the end of 2021 and it was completely different. It was fast-paced, like a lo-fi IDM, Burial-type track with vocals and when I showed it to Liam he was sure it should be the last track on the album. We hit a brick wall when it came to finishing it, though, until we worked with the producer North Downs and he said it felt much more like a tune for sitting around the campfire.

Album and Interview","standard":"On their sixth studio album, mystical Norwegian folk troupe Wardruna conjure a song cycle about the she-bear, or Birna. “Bears are an absolutely fascinating species, and it’s easy to understand why they have become such an important part of folklore in certain types of culture—in fairy tales, in lullabies, and in star signs,” Wardruna’s songwriter, co-vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist Einar Selvik tells Apple Music. “Why I chose the she-bear rather than the male bear is the fact that their annual rhythm mirrors completely the rhythm of Mother Earth in a way—the cyclic turns of life, death, and regeneration. That’s the story I wanted to tell on this record.”\n\nSince 2003, Selvik and his musical partner and co-vocalist Lindy-Fay Hella—along with an ever-expanding cast of backing musicians—have used Old Norse language and ancient traditional instruments to channel the majesty of the natural world. “Giving voice to the wild, I think, is important,” Selvik says. “I think a lot of us feel a deeper and deeper void between us and our surroundings. To be living so removed from nature, from the cycles of the Earth, is not healthy. But our society doesn’t really allow us to follow the rhythm of the seasons. We tend to have one tempo year-round; we eat everything year-round, neglecting the fact that we are cyclic beings. That’s one of the things bears can teach us. And not only bears, but nature: They help us remember that we’re part of something.” Below, Selvik discusses each song on <i>Birna</i>.\n\n<b>“Hertan”</b>\n“Hertan is the proto-Scandinavian word for ‘heart,’ and that is where we start this journey—with the pulse that beats in everything and that governs all of these movements within ourselves, and also in nature in various forms and beings. That’s, of course, the physical heart, but then you also have the metaphorical heart, the ship of emotion. That is what counsels our decisions and choices here in life and our emotions. It takes us through one of these cycles of death and rebirth. In enduring that process, we understand it and see it clearly, these movements and patterns and our place in them.”\n\n<b>“Birna”</b>\n“The word means ‘she-bear.’ It is a track that represents a dialogue between man and she-bear. It’s written in a playful way, like many of the old bear songs from traditions where there are a lot of bears in their culture. It addresses the somewhat problematic relationship we have had with bears throughout time. It acknowledges that our path together has been a tangled one. And then, the she-bear asks to lend its hide, which is something that has been used ceremonially or in many traditions to borrow the bear’s strength, to borrow its courage or whatever skill. It is said that bears have the strength of 12 men and the wits of 10, and that is often the skills we wanted to learn from them.”\n\n<b>“Ljos til Jord”</b>\n“Here, we start at the summer solstice, and we follow the bear’s movement towards the den. We see the birds migrate, we see the salmon swim upstream in the river to spawn where they were born and then die. All of these movements we see in nature. It is written in the lyrics that it’s almost like every year we’re invited to this wonderful, luscious feast, but at some point, the hostess of the party leaves, and we’re left to gather what we can to survive until she returns in spring.”\n\n<b>“Dvaledraumar”</b>\n“It means ‘Dormant Dreams,’ and this, of course, is the hibernation. The bear doesn’t really hibernate, per definition—it goes into a semi-hibernating state where it lowers its heart rate to between eight and 10 beats per minute. I chose nine beats per minute for conceptual reasons, and that is the pulse that leads you through this 15-minute dreamscape. The sounds you hear—they’re almost whalelike—they come from a lake that freezes in a very specific way in wintertime. We were lucky to have Jonna Jinton, the Swedish artist who has been recording these singing ice lakes for several years now, collaborating on this song with both the field recordings and some vocals toward the end.”\n\n<b>“Jord til Ljos”</b>\n“This was made as one track with ‘Dvaledraumar,’ and the title means ‘Earth to Light’ or ‘Womb to Light.’ It follows the same pulse as ‘Dvaledraumar,’ with the same instrumentation in a way, but it subtly transforms as the den is becoming smaller and smaller, and the birds are singing. It’s time to wake up and enter spring, to enter the life cycle of the year.” \n\n<b>“Himinndotter”</b>\n“This is the emergence of spring, but also coming into light, or enlightenment. You have journeyed together with this bear through this cycle. It’s a song very much about seeing these movements and cyclic patterns that we are a part of and realizing the repercussions of messing with these systems. It’s a lot about seeking connection, but also acknowledging that at this point, the shepherd of the forest—in this case, the bear—is no longer welcome in its homelands. The choir you hear is an all-female choir from Oslo, the Koret Artemis. They work a lot with traditional music from all over the world. I wanted it to feel like we’re in unison, that we are many people who think and feel the importance of this.”\n\n<b>“Hibjørnen”</b>\n“It means ‘The Den Bear,’ or ‘The Hibernator.’ It’s written as a lullaby because lullabies are very much connected to bears. Wherever there are bears, you have a lot of lullabies about bears because of their sleep. And the way they mother their cubs is so powerful. It’s the reason why we call some mothers ‘mother bear’ or ‘mama bear.’ Bears are badass moms. They give it all. So, it’s a lullaby from the bear’s perspective within the den.”\n\n<b>“Skuggehesten”</b>\n“It means ‘Shadow Horse,’ and we’re in the human realm again, not the bear realm. It’s basically a long set of metaphors and descriptions of when you’re in a dark place or when darkness rides you. It’s pretty aggressive in a way. At the same time, it’s emotional. It’s the type of song I really recommend you have a look at the lyrics. It, of course, is best if you know the original language because it’s not as poetic in the translation, but we always include English translations in our booklets.”\n\n<b>“Tretale”</b>\n“It means ‘The Voice of Trees.’ It’s basically a song about how your surroundings speak to you—or through you, potentially—if you listen. It’s the type of voice that whispers silently in your ear. You can’t necessarily hear it externally, but it speaks through you from within. A lot of the sounds you hear in the song, it’s me out in the forest shaking big and small trees, scraping on the bark of many different trees and twigs and all sorts of things—and the wind in many different types of leaves. So, the soundscape is very much trees. Trees and instruments, of course.”\n\n<b>“Lyfjaberg”</b>\n“It means ‘The Healing Mountain,’ and this song came out a few years ago. It was made after the last album was finished, but as a result of us having to postpone the record [due to the COVID-19 pandemic], that is why we released the song [in 2020]. We really wanted to release music, and a lot of people were waiting. We know Lyfjaberg from the old myths and the old Eddic poetry as a mythical place where, if you were able to climb this mountain, you would be healed of all your illnesses.

The experience snapped the English polymath (singer, dancer, songwriter, actor, force of nature) out of the intense brain fog she’d been stuck inside for years—so much so that she was moved to invent a word to describe the transcendent clarity, a portmanteau of “sex” and “euphoria” (which also sounds a bit like the Greek word used to celebrate a discovery: eureka!). <i>EUSEXUA</i>, twigs’ third studio album (and her first full-length release since her adventurous 2022 mixtape, <i>Caprisongs</i>), is not explicitly a dance record—more a love letter to dance music’s emancipating powers, channeled through the auteur’s heady, haunting signature style.\n\nThe throbbing percussion from that fateful warehouse rave pulses through the record, warping according to the mood: slinky, subterranean trip-hop on the hedonistic “Girl Feels Good,” or big-room melodrama on the strobing “Room of Fools.” On the cyborgian “Drums of Death” (produced by Koreless, who worked closely alongside twigs and appears on every track), twigs evokes a short-circuiting sexbot at an after-hours rave in the Matrix, channeling sensations of hot flesh against cold metal as she implores you to “Crash the system...Serve cunt/Serve violence.” Intriguing strangers emerge from <i>EUSEXUA</i>’s sea of fog, all of them seeking the same thing twigs is—sticky, sweaty, ego-killing, rapturous catharsis.","short":"The UK polymath’s heady love letter to dance music’s emancipating

Album and Interview","standard":"It was a series of paintings on the walls of a holiday villa where he was staying on the island of Elba, in Tuscany, that gave Ludovico Einaudi the idea for an album of summer portraits. Painted in oil on wood by the proprietor and regular visitor to the villa during the 1950s, the pictures depicted views from the house, capturing the surrounding natural landscape, with its blue skies, green hills, and shimmering sea in the distance. “They made me think of the summers that I’d spent in my childhood with my family—all the summers that I lived,” Einaudi tells Apple Music. “It reminded me of how the summer was a time when you would have many beautiful experiences, a time of long days, a moment of light.”\n\nNot that Einaudi’s sound is characterized by Mediterranean color and lightness. Rather, with its simple repeating chord progressions that share the post-minimalist world of Philip Glass, Max Richter, and Michael Nyman, the dominant mood of <i>The Summer Portraits</i> is one of melancholic nostalgia as Einaudi recalls sun-drenched days from a bygone era. “The world has changed,” he says. “The water is grey now where it used to be crystal-clear. So there’s a nostalgia for places that are not the way they were, for a world that was maybe more simple, more pure.”\n\nFor Einaudi, music and memory are closely linked—his titles often recall a specific time or place, or a feeling. The opening track, “Rose Bay,” is based on a sequence of chords that came to him when he was at the Sydney Opera House, waiting in the dressing room before going on stage to perform. “Sydney is also the place where my grandfather, the conductor and composer Wando Aldrovandi, lived for 30 years. My mother introduced me to music, and she was always talking about him, and about the fact that he left her when she was 12 years old.” Aldrovandi emigrated to Australia after refusing to work under a fascist government in Italy. “And so there was a sort of idea of distance and loss for her.”\n\nEach track takes us to a specific summer memory. There’s “Punta Bianca,” named after a white rock formation on the southern coast of Sicily, which Einaudi would visit during his summer holidays. Or “Jay,” fleeting memories of a bird that would come to his family house in the countryside outside Turin where he lives and works—“I always wonder if it’s one of the relatives of the bird that used to visit us when my mother lived here.” Elsewhere, “In Memory of a Dream” takes its name from a dream that Einaudi had about his Australian family: “ I woke up, and I completely forgot what it was about. But there was a nice feeling that stayed with me, and I decided to give it a title.”\n\nEinaudi prefers to compose at the piano. “Often I’ll keep playing an idea, and record it until I find a version that I like,” he says. On the orchestral tracks, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Robert Ames at Abbey Road Studios, he’ll start with an idea, then repeat it, building the work up by layering instrumental lines, one on top of the other. On “Pathos,” he started at the point of climax, taking the idea of a big crescendo, then working backwards to find the beginning of the piece. “Sequence” was inspired by listening to Baroque music, specifically Vivaldi and a recording of works by English Baroque composer John Eccles by the violinist Théotime Langlois de Swarte, who performs here. (Any passing resemblance to the main theme tune on Nicholas Britell’s hit soundtrack for <i>Succession</i> is coincidental.)\n\nAccompanying Einaudi on piano is his regular team of collaborators: Federico Mecozzi (violin/viola), Redi Hasa (cello), and multi-instrumentalist Francesco Arcuri. “I have arrived at my sound over many years,” Einaudi says. “At the beginning, it was something totally out of control, because I didn’t know much about it. And then with a studio, with having the time to explore different microphones and preamplifiers, I was able to understand, to focus on one piano sound that I started to like.” \n\nAs well as an upright, he has two Steinway grands at his home studio in Turin, one of which has been “prepared” by creating a second layer of felt on the hammers to soften the sound. “When The Beatles, say, made an album, they could change the guitars for different sounds if they wanted to. Pianists are not usually so fortunate. But me, I have three pianos to choose from—I’m lucky.”","short":"Ludovico Einaudi: “There’s a nostalgia for a maybe more simple

Album","standard":"After several years building a following on YouTube with his inventive cover songs (as well as a viral <i>America’s Got Talent</i> appearance alongside Journey’s Neal Schon), Georgia-hailing singer-songwriter Teddy Swims burst onto the global pop scene in 2023 with <i>I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1)</i>, which featured the chart-topping single “Lose Control” and showcased his innovative blend of country’s open-hearted melodicism and the soulful textures of vintage R&B. The sequel to that record finds Swims diving headlong into the latter genre more than ever before, with a few guests to accentuate his loverboy stylings; GIVĒON lends his impressive lower range to the slow jam “Are You Even Real,” while Coco Jones and GloRilla make for perfect foils on the swaggering, low-slung “She Got It?”\n\nBut as with its predecessor, <i>ITEBT (Part 2)</i> is above all a testament to Swims’ adventurousness; single “Bad Dreams” combines modern-production touches with a retro-rock sound favored by contemporaries like Black Pumas and Leon Bridges, while the sweeping chorus of “Guilty” finds Swims tipping a cowboy hat towards his recent work with artists like Thomas Rhett and Luke Bryan. Swims’ wide-ranging approach continues to ensure that there’s something for everyone in his music, even as he retains his sense of self throughout.","short":"Like any good sequel, it’s bigger, bolder, and more adventurous."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ive-tried-everything-but-therapy-part-2/1771020838","playParams":{"id":"1771020838","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6kvSdLjli85tMwW4jlCN0o"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771020838/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1462541757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1462541757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738320229758}}},"1771767801":{"id":"1771767801","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1771767801?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kane-brown/930928857","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9a/20/0c/9a200c84-ca24-7d44-e42e-68fbc1a72515/Job2e6276eb-3dab-4592-b00b-b77d2e4d3f9c-177714526-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347208472_1927635783-Time1729268902336.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","b3d8e8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"201912"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d0cdd3","textColor2":"b3d8e8","textColor4":"9cbfd0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"201912","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/78/47/7e/78477e6a-6809-acb6-167a-f0a838b4de8a/0e65ddcc-ff93-414d-908c-7b2c7c232cfa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c5cbd4","textColor2":"dead8d","textColor4":"b89581","textColor1":"eef0f4","bgColor":"223753","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e9/14/67/e914676e-1000-16ac-cc03-06ec3f1f9b30/Job0d3851c1-78b9-456b-bf96-170dd849c3a7-177714527-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_347208473_1927635782-Time1729270819301.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c7d9de","textColor2":"fbdfd4","textColor4":"d5c5bf","textColor1":"e9f7fa","bgColor":"405d6f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ea/6c/9d/ea6c9dc1-e09f-76cf-ba4d-afc452bc58f4/bc63eab9-c90e-423d-bcf3-cf11048a5a33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d7d6d7","textColor2":"e9f5f9","textColor4":"cbd7dd","textColor1":"f8f4f1","bgColor":"51606e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/b5/7b/0fb57b28-cca8-57ef-b0c9-7c9dc86c2cbb/9c3192f8-02b1-46f7-831c-ac8e648eaa40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ceced6","textColor2":"d4e0e4","textColor4":"b6c3ca","textColor1":"f3edf4","bgColor":"3c5260","hasP3":false}},"name":"The High Road","artistName":"Kane Brown","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ae/36/1a/ae361a2e-cea6-d47f-166b-1c015726846b/196872381474.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b1bec1","textColor2":"97c8e3","textColor4":"8aadbf","textColor1":"c8dde5","bgColor":"554333","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Since he skyrocketed to stardom with his 2016 debut full-length, Kane Brown’s strength has been his versatility—a vision of mainstream country broad enough to accommodate the sounds of R&B, hip-hop, and pop. But as the 31-year-old singer from Chattanooga, Tennessee, tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, his fourth album is the first one where he could really be meticulous. “I got thrown into all this,” he said. “This album I’m really excited about, because I actually took my time. I actually got to rewrite some lyrics. I feel like everything’s placed.”\n\nOn <i>The High Road</i>, the follow-up to 2022’s <i>Different Man</i>, Brown remains steadfast in his conviction that being a country star does not require a strict adherence to the old notions of genre. “I’m like a burnt CD from ’03 in a Mustang/You never knew what was coming,” he crows on “Fiddle in the Band,” a bluegrass barnstormer that’s as country as it gets for a manifesto about genre defiance. But country’s strict borders have loosened in the nine years since his breakthrough, and these days it’s Brown’s vulnerability that stands out—outlining a laundry list of fears on the arena-ready “I Am,” or documenting the wide-eyed questions he hears as a girl dad on the sweet ballad “Backseat Driver.”\n\nBrown takes a page from Jelly Roll’s book on “Haunted,” a duet with the fellow Tennessean that shows Brown at his most fearless, admitting that success isn’t enough to silence his demons. Penned at a writer’s retreat in London in what appeared to be a haunted hotel, Brown connected the bleak environs to his mental state. “What if we write a song called ‘Haunted’?” he remembers thinking, then took it one step further: “Then I was like, ‘It could just be about our depression.’ I always try to get dark with my writers, and sometimes they’re like, ‘Well, that’s too dark.’ I’m like, ‘Is it, though?’” Luckily, in Brown’s world, the only rule is that there are no rules.\n","short":"More genre-melding collaborations and compositions on album

EP","standard":"“Here’s what I know: I’ve never been good at playing games, but I’m great at telling the truth,” Joanna “JoJo” Levesque writes in the introduction to her 2024 memoir, <i>Over the Influence</i>. She underlines that assertion on her energetic fourth EP, where she takes stock of her last two-plus decades in the pop spotlight and shows how her versatile soprano can take on any beat thrown at it.\n\nJoJo made a splash in 2004 with the petulant “Leave (Get Out),” an airy pop-R&B cut that showcased her preternatural ability to deliver real-talking lyrics in a candy-sweet fashion. In the 20-plus years since, through professional and personal struggles, the Massachusetts singer has only sharpened that talent, as this eight-track release appealingly proves. “Nobody,” the groove-forward track that opens <i>NGL</i>, is defiant, with JoJo declaring, “Nobody gon’ love me like me/Settlin’ don’t make no sense” over synth horns and a beat that recalls the most bounce-minded new jack swing cuts.\n\n<i>NGL</i> finds JoJo unbound by others’ expectations; the anxiety-riddled “Too Much to Say” frames her declarations of being “imperfect but a real thing” in insistent guitar licks, while on the skittering “Porcelain” she explores her voice’s highest reaches as she notes how any troubles she’s had in the past have only made her more resilient in the present. The EP’s genre-shifting, which includes a stripped-down piano reimagining of “Porcelain,” shows how they’ve also made her more curious and confident as an artist. Once tied up in label red tape, she’s now free to use her voice in any context she deems appropriate, whether it’s the <i>TRL</i>-era throwback confection “Ready to Love” or the stretched-out sunshine-soul cut “One Last Time.” On <i>NGL</i>, JoJo is calling the shots with intention and honesty—as well as the pop savvy she displayed as a young teen on the come-up.","short":"Over eight honest tracks, the pop singer shows off what she’s learned."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ngl/1779127207","playParams":{"id":"1779127207","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4veaG4MuOfmgfq0r45Y5Z3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779127207/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5519840","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5519840?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738320082378}}},"1779994232":{"id":"1779994232","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779994232?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/drew-cagle-the-reputation/1575019386","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Bad Attitude","artistName":"Drew Cagle & The Reputation","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c3/5a/de/c35ade6a-e0b7-354f-4977-535c677d933a/198846914862.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"383838","textColor2":"5c1b13","textColor4":"7a463f","textColor1":"09090a","bgColor":"f4f3ef","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bad-attitude/1779994232","playParams":{"id":"1779994232","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6kKfnVQuRYGJazG8cWExbM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779994232/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1575019386","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1575019386?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738343137580}}},"1781663977":{"id":"1781663977","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781663977?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sunrot/1294466411","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Passages -

The Austin-based singer-songwriter is just 17 as he releases his debut, though you’d be forgiven for thinking him at least a decade older after hearing the soulful weariness of opener “Ends of the Earth,” or the scrappy wisdom of the melodic and tender “Let ’Em Talk.” Myers seems to find inspiration in virtuosity, naming Stevie Ray Vaughan and Chris Stapleton among his primary influences. You can hear those connections across <i>The Select</i>, like when Myers goes for broke on the loose and funky “Can’t Hold Me Down,” and in much of his guitar playing, which, like Vaughan’s did, tends toward blues while dipping into jazz. Myers also includes a cover of fellow SRV fan John Mayer’s “Man on the Side.” To boot, Myers is just as skilled at choosing collaborators, as Anderson East, Trent Dabbs, and Jessi Alexander are credited as co-writers.","short":"A teen guitar virtuoso with the chops and wisdom of someone twice his age."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-select/1782004310","playParams":{"id":"1782004310","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4tE4n1E0qtAfJTh8IPT9TN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782004310/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1674345303","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1674345303?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738343638155}}},"1782086853":{"id":"1782086853","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782086853?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Alternative","Punk"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/scr%C3%BCda/1618964115","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Fury Among Ruins","artistName":"Scrüda","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/06/8e/d0/068ed0df-f6a0-6894-acb3-f74ead98950f/artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcc","textColor2":"c9c9c9","textColor4":"a0a0a1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000002","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fury-among-ruins/1782086853","playParams":{"id":"1782086853","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0J0GM15Xi4wX1bNPo3dtvL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782086853/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1618964115","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1618964115?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1732707068703}}},"1782188661":{"id":"1782188661","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782188661?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-20","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jamie-xx/405563985","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e2/23/52/e223529a-fa7a-33c0-318b-a293af16f16c/d6bc5c12-8c4b-440d-8e67-8dd6430f4df5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"28231f","textColor2":"1f130e","textColor4":"362b25","textColor1":"0d0908","bgColor":"938b7e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f8/d6/7d/f8d67d56-2c7f-e209-9fb5-1d07b84e9dca/7d6e0486-54c3-4914-b99c-4d80ada6d73f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d9d9d9","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"cbcbcb","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"555555","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/eb/91/04/eb91041c-53ef-7378-5fa5-e65eec404548/87b4de06-24c4-489d-8bcd-17a4ae85c6bc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4c4c4","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"131313","hasP3":false}},"name":"In Waves (Deluxe)","artistName":"Jamie xx","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3d/71/8e/3d718e96-3a34-69bd-8d68-0798d5a8c180/889030041579.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"dedede","textColor4":"b2b2b2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jamie Smith’s 2015 debut solo album <i>In Colour</i> set the tone for an entire decade of left-of-center electronic music, but his long-awaited follow-up harbors zero pretension when it comes to trend-watching. Nine years later, <i>In Waves</i> sets its sights on the dance floor with glorious aplomb, the perfect complement to a string of body-moving singles that the iconic British producer has released in the preceding year and a half. “The collaboration element was helping me push things forward without having to think too much about myself on my own,” Smith tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.\n\nFrom there, the rest of <i>In Waves</i> came together in quick succession—and, suitably, the record’s rowdy and in-a-crowd feel was largely inspired by the solitude of the lockdown era, as well as dreams of how it would feel to play big tunes for huge audiences again. “I was starting to get excited about the idea of playing shows again,” Smith says.\n\nThe guest list for this party is overflowing: Along with a practical reunion of his main outfit The xx on the dreamy “Waited All Night,” house music auteur and recent Beyoncé collaborator Honey Dijon lends her distinctive incantations to the squelch of “Baddy on the Floor,” while experimental-leaning vocalists Kelsey Lu and Panda Bear throw in on the soul-streaked and woozy “Dafodil.” But at the center of <i>In Waves</i> is a truly assured sense of confidence from Smith, who’s returned here with a set of club-ready cuts that’s truly crowd-pleasing—all without losing the distinctive touch that’s brought him so much deserved acclaim to this point. “One of the most inspiring things is to go out clubbing,” he says. “And I think you can have quite profound thoughts even in an altered state on the dance floor.” \n","short":"The producer’s second solo album is a set of club-ready crowd-pleasers."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-waves-deluxe/1782188661","playParams":{"id":"1782188661","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782188661/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"405563985","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/405563985?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738304796846}}},"1783404289":{"id":"1783404289","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783404289?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/central-cee/1085149646","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e6/75/bc/e675bc5b-9502-3dad-cd66-90290a1fe33a/Jobfdbdbcc4-3861-4c05-8535-aac9e125e22a-184456953-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_360755306_2032238886-Time1737744269614.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d5bab8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c5c3c3","textColor2":"d5bab8","textColor4":"ab9694","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/01/82/d0018220-604b-b7e4-8ac9-984f7683cf67/f707e531-2887-475e-9417-60de6926846c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"afa89d","textColor2":"cbb6a4","textColor4":"a59485","textColor1":"d8cfc3","bgColor":"0c0b09","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/41/af/53/41af5377-99a5-b937-29ab-fa53f2e36fde/Job7d3828b0-c985-4b1b-8803-c9ec5a93b207-184456952-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_360755307_2032238887-Time1737743199892.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c4c0c1","textColor2":"d19273","textColor4":"a9765e","textColor1":"f3efef","bgColor":"070709","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/19/e4/6a/19e46a55-65ae-f561-0aed-97a00182dfbb/b98f46aa-99d3-42d2-a0ea-9c0c628c736c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d1d1","textColor2":"dfcccb","textColor4":"c0b1b0","textColor1":"f9f5f5","bgColor":"434345","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/39/7d/3c/397d3c6c-bbb3-b966-3b5a-f9cbd07837ad/429ad9a9-a0f8-4645-8e05-480c9802f50e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0a89f","textColor2":"c9b4a0","textColor4":"a39282","textColor1":"d8cfc4","bgColor":"0d0b0a","hasP3":false}},"name":"CAN'T RUSH GREATNESS","artistName":"Central Cee","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/7f/ef/5a7fefe9-5b4c-c72b-2446-6d4a0bc1d819/196872591545.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdd0ce","textColor2":"cab6a9","textColor4":"a7988e","textColor1":"f9fbf8","bgColor":"1c2024","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I kind of prolonged my come-up,” Central Cee tells Apple Music. Off the success of record-breaking global hits “Doja” and “Sprinter,” not to mention the indisputable smash “Band4Band” with Lil Baby, nobody could have faulted the “Wild” West London native from hastily dropping an album to capitalize on any of those singles. But as he’d be happy to remind any of his fans, it was already an uphill battle just being a rapper out of Shepherd’s Bush, which makes his long-anticipated full-length debut, <i>CAN’T RUSH GREATNESS</i>, all the more momentous.\n\n“The first two projects were mixtapes,” he explains of his prior work. “The energy I put into them is what made it a mixtape, and the energy I premeditated to put into the album and the timing of everything is what the album is.” In line with that intent, Cee’s conflicted state of mind quickly comes to the fore on opener “No Introduction,” acknowledging and accepting the whirlwind of fame while concurrently craving a more tranquil life. Those changes manifest throughout the album, with him straddling diverging worlds on the drill dazzler “5 Star” and struggling with resonant pain on the plaintive “Limitless.”\n\nWhile the instantly gratifying “St. Patrick’s” indulges in familiar flagrant flexes, the album gets decidedly deeper than rap via tracks like “Don’t Know Anymore” and “Walk in Wardrobe,” with the latter’s late beat-switch raising the stakes. “It’s hard for me to rap in such a reflective wake,” he says. “I just want to look ahead at the light at the end of the tunnel and not really think about certain things.”\n\nWhile a substantial amount of the lyrical material skews intimately local, Cee’s worldwide reach reveals itself largely via collaborations with the likes of Lil Durk and Young Miko. Still, as good as it feels to hear him going bar for bar with 21 Savage on trap stunner “GBP,” his link with UK rap icon Skepta on “Ten” and reunion with <i>Split Decision</i> mate Dave on “CRG” just hit different, in the best way. “These songs aren’t really for the masses,” he says, “but just to touch the people, remind everyone that I’m human—that <i>they’re</i> human.”\n","short":"The wait’s over.

Mixtape and Interview","standard":"From his Belfast bedroom—where he made breakthrough single “KEHLANI”—to recording second mixtape <i>A Jaguar’s Dream</i> in Los Angeles, Jordan Adetunji has been quickly forging a path towards international stardom. Even before “KEHLANI,” an ode to the US singer-songwriter, earned him a Grammy nomination in 2024, he’d won the admiration of Bring Me The Horizon’s Oli Sykes (who helped him secure his first record deal), while Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody regularly voiced support for Adetunji on his radio show. Securing Kehlani themselves for the remix of “KEHLANI” has led to more top-tier collaborations—Lil Baby appeared on the Chase & Status-co-produced single “Options” in October 2024—and this genre-blurring mixtape arrived primed to continue his ascent.\n\nAdetunji has honed his sound from 2023’s debut mixtape <i>ROCK ’N’ RAVE</i> to make a supremely self-assured and polished follow-up full of intimate lyrics. “I feel like my sound’s advanced a lot,” he tells Apple Music. “I’ve taken so many lessons from when I made that experimental project, but now it’s a lot better. My vocal style is very R&B, but I just blend with alternative sounds, so I’d call it alternative R&B.”\n\nHe’s also made the most of that voice, playing with sound to create the right vibe for each track. “I try to manipulate my voice to match certain sound frequencies whenever I’m making a song,” he says. “Sometimes I’ll speed the track up, then slow it down just to match the right frequency until it feels right. I want it to feel sonically right to me, energy-wise.”\n\nThese 10 tracks were written and produced by Adetunji, who worked with global names including Take A Daytrip, Chase & Status, and Danny Casio. Collaborators Lil Baby, Bryson Tiller, and, of course, Kehlani add guest vocals. It all makes for a mixtape that is unlikely to put an end to the exciting moments when Adetunji hears his own songs in the wild. “I think it’s funny whenever I hear ‘KEHLANI’ being played in someone’s car,” he says. “When I’m in the club, I’m just in the back, low-key, and they play this song so I’m just watching people reacting to it. And I’m like, ‘No one even knows I made this.’” Read on as he talks Apple Music through <i>A Jaguar’s Dream</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“KEHLANI”</b>\n“Me and the boys, like Daytrip, sat in a session in LA and went through all the songs to work out which ones flowed well into each other, but this had to be the first track. Kehlani is such an amazing person. When I was writing this song, I didn’t really think she’d call me up one day but, at the same time, I manifested it. When she called me, I was in a club and I was a bit panicky because I was looking for the file to send the song to her. She’s given me so much advice and she’s like a big sister to me in the industry, which has helped me a lot.”\n\n<b>“Too Many Women” (feat. kwn)</b>\n“I’d seen kwn around a couple of times and when I checked out her music, I was like, ‘This is amazing.’ She was actually on the remix shoot of the ‘KEHLANI’ video. Then I saw her again at Kehlani’s show at the Barclays Center in New York. I was like, ‘Yo, we got to do something.’ So I hit her up on Instagram. I’d put up a snippet of a demo version of ‘Too Many Women’ when I literally just had a hook. She asked for the song, so I sent it across to her. She did a verse to it and the song became what it is now, which is really exciting.”\n\n<b>“Break the System”</b>\n“This song has the line ‘People change, but I don’t wanna.’ I feel like whenever I’m dropping music, everyone thinks that I should do things a certain way or change things, but I just can’t. I still try things out on TikTok, but I think if something worked, why would I change it? I do read comments, but I just ignore them. I’d rather continue to do what I do. You’re all here because of something I did, so I’m going to continue in my own way. And if you rock with it, you rock with it. If you don’t, au revoir.”\n\n<b>“305” (feat. Bryson Tiller)</b>\n“This is one of my favorite songs on here because it came about really organically. I was in the studio with Danny Casio and Parked Up and I started mumbling the melody, then I put words to it afterwards. But it was always a manifestation about me going to Miami, because at that time I’d never been before. I wrote this two months after ‘KEHLANI,’ then I sent it to Bryson Tiller, hoping he would do something on it. I’d already shot the video in Miami when he got back to me with a verse. I was like, ‘Oh, guess we have to scrap the video.’ I met Bryson at his house in Miami and he even pulled up to the video.”\n\n<b>“Bitter”</b>\n“I wrote ‘Bitter’ on my own in a studio house in LA. Everyone had left the room and I was looking at this amazing view and I just started singing it. I came up with the hook really easily. The first part I wrote was only 30 seconds long, so we had it as an interlude. Then we sampled the same song to make a second part and it became something else. I love it because I felt like it’s a beautiful piece of work and it’s very experimental. A lot of the songs on this mixtape are around two minutes long. Once I’ve said what I needed to say, I don’t add more. I’m happy I’ve captured that emotion in that timeframe, so I don’t feel the need to go on.”\n\n<b>“Dirty Diana”</b>\n“Michael Jackson was definitely one of my biggest inspirations so I called this song ‘Dirty Diana’ for a bit of fun. I made it in Paris and revisited it months later, so it feels like a long progression of different sounds and elements, with strings, backing vocals, and big synths. Then we made it like a crescendo at the end, which feels like a long moment. It’s very, very experimental, while it has elements of ‘KEHLANI.’ So I felt like this is great to put on the album because it’s still from that world. It’s a nice closing chapter to that bit of that sound.”\n\n<b>“Bedroom”</b>\n“‘Bedroom’ isn’t about one person in particular. I would say it’s about many different situations that I’ve been in and how I’ve felt at those times. We did so many stacks on this track—I had all these different melody ideas and we put it together like a puzzle. I’d love people to hear that file one day, there’s a hundred takes of me doing different melodies. It was just me and Danny Casio in the room when we made it. At the start, it was pretty difficult going from my bedroom to a studio, because I wanted the familiar setup with the mic in front of the monitor. I needed everything to look like a bedroom, with my laptop and mouse. Everyone in the studio was quite confused because I would never record in the booth!”\n\n<b>“Attractive”</b>\n“I know I’m putting my feelings out there on this track, but I’m excited to get more in-depth. Some of my lyrics are fantasy and others are raw thoughts. If I’m feeling in love, I’m in love. If I’m feeling like, ‘Nah, I’m hurt,’ I’m not afraid to write in that mood, whether I regret it later or not. I’ve kept the same mindset from the start. I feel like I just focus, I got my plan so I stick to it and just make it happen. The universe will decide if it works or not.”\n\n<b>“Options” (feat. Lil Baby)</b>\n“I’m a big fan of The Weeknd and Michael Jackson, and every time you look at these guys’ careers, you see an era. That’s what I want to do—I feel like I want my audience to come along, especially people that followed me from the beginning. And I want to show that elevation through visuals and play with their perceptions. I want people to think, ‘Oh, is this his sound? Is this what he’s going to keep making?’ Because I like playing with people. And it’s just like you have no idea what’s about to happen. It’s a fun game for me. I loved working with Lil Baby—he’s amazing, he’s funny and a very smart individual. We met in London before I recorded that song and he showed me a lot of love and told me to keep going.”\n\n<b>“KEHLANI (REMIX)” (feat. Kehlani)</b>\n“It made sense to open and close the album with ‘KEHLANI’ and I loved what she brought to the remix. I just let her do her thing. She actually did two verses: one was more rap and the other was more melodic. I liked both of them, so I let her decide which one to use. I’m so excited we got a Grammy nomination [for Best Melodic Rap Performance, up against Beyoncé, Future, and others]. Honestly, I can’t wait to go. I feel like my song impacted culture. I’ve seen people do their first dance to ‘KEHLANI’ at their wedding, so I think that’s good enough for me.”","short":"Belfast’s alt-R&B star begins a new era: “My sound’s advanced a

Album","standard":"CMG’s Louisville connect EST Gee made the shift from mixtape marvel to certified hitmaker with seeming ease. Linking with the likes of 42 Dugg, Future, and Jack Harlow, he’s impacted the charts without having to compromise his core strengths and the experiences in which those were forged. That hood-borne integrity continues on <i>I Aint Feeling You</i>, its title yet another variant on his discography’s prevailing theme. Such ruthlessness dominates his verses, both when taking calculated aim on \"Slime” and in showing love for his environs on “The Streets.” Recognizing that trap-house politics and personal matters invariably intertwine in the lifestyle, he turns baby-mama drama into opportunities on “Crash” and surveys a veritable war zone from his particular point of view on the vengeful “RIP LU MIKE.”\n\nA genuine love for Southern rap helps to rightfully secure Gee’s own place within its legacy. To that end, he nods to regional hip-hop greatness on “Plug Motivation” and reconnects with Lil Baby for “Houstonatlantaville,” with no less than Travis Scott representing the first part of that tri-city trifecta. Drawing direct inspiration from a Lil Scrappy hit, “Do My Own Stunts” showcases Gee’s defiant individualistic streak via a string of flexes and threats. An auspicious reunion with his “5500 Degrees” cohort Rylo Rodriguez out of Alabama, the Veeze-infused “My Love” sets unflinchingly real-life storytelling against a snappy, soulful beat. That reflectively confessional approach carries through to the album’s “Outro,” a clear-eyed accounting of his imperfections and mistakes that makes him even more relatable.","short":"Louisville’s star traverses the South with flexes and threats."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-aint-feeling-you/1787098256","playParams":{"id":"1787098256","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3qn1Zm5fjWE320E3ddJXmL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787098256/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1387365020","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1387365020?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738347242294}}},"1787416072":{"id":"1787416072","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1787416072?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gwot-lik/1787171324","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Gwot Lik -

He drops one or two albums a year, each expanding his lyrical scope, laidback delivery, and excellent ear for beats. His crew runs deep, and 2024’s <i>Pinball</i> with producer Tony Seltzer featured many of his closest collaborators, like Earl Sweatshirt and Tony Shhnow. His 2025 effort, <i>Showbiz!</i>, is similar in the sense that it’s a deeply immersive effort, but the guest list is limited. MIKE’s world is nevertheless unmistakable, filled with weed smoke, knotty lyrics, and beats that continue to help forge a new golden age in New York. “Then we could be free” takes an old soul sample and highlights the bassline, giving MIKE’s unrelenting delivery a funky underbelly. “Lucky” features drums that explode like fireworks and synths that dance around MIKE’s voice, approximating his slippery flow without ever tying it down to a consistent rhythm. It’s loose but never sloppy.","short":"Beats and knotty lyrics that continue to help forge a new golden age in NYC."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/showbiz/1788674268","playParams":{"id":"1788674268","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3M1PhSsHmAlh79bAz9jBZs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1788674268/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1253023714","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1253023714?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738320811947}}},"1788885248":{"id":"1788885248","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1788885248?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-korda/29292907","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"All My Problems Are Soluble","artistName":"Chris Korda","artwork":{"width":4096,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/06/17/14/061714f7-9a01-097e-1a20-d5875e5d51c4/8718723275859.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4096,"textColor3":"c2987c","textColor2":"e1a270","textColor4":"b58666","textColor1":"f1b98c","bgColor":"04173f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-my-problems-are-soluble/1788885248","playParams":{"id":"1788885248","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3nIYwHuOTTzeTZ9hKAWdhd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1788885248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"29292907","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29292907?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736166440768}}},"1789168498":{"id":"1789168498","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789168498?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/boldy-james/446885417","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8f/9a/33/8f9a339b-6134-8dec-7ae1-93f1402fdfbe/c4731afe-351d-411c-b57e-7d6a188fe1fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e8ba51","textColor2":"fcb270","textColor4":"e79e65","textColor1":"fed557","bgColor":"935037","hasP3":false}},"name":"Permanent Ink","artistName":"Boldy James","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/58/83/ae/5883aedf-12d9-581a-13ac-486b02d28c6f/198846122236.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d68c15","textColor2":"ec7e34","textColor4":"c9682c","textColor1":"fcab17","bgColor":"3e1010","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Whether rocking with hip-hop heavyweights like The Alchemist over inventively sampled beats or spitting with lesser-known talents like RichGains and WhoTheHellIsCarlo, Boldy James can’t help but thrive over quality instrumentals.

Recorded with fellow Detroiter Roger Goodman of Royal House, the 13-track effort showcases a specific set of skills applied to yet another sonic side of the genre, one simultaneously more commercial and authentically regional. His street lingo backed up by street smarts, he brings intimate knowledge of the game on cuts like “All On My Side” and “It Hit Different,” mixing business with pleasure as is his wont. “Gargoyle Pelle” and “Stop Signs & Yields” blend him overtly into his city’s distinct palette of sounds, his hustler’s joy and survivor’s pain blurred throughout.","short":"The ever-versatile Detroit rapper brings it all back home."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/permanent-ink/1789168498","playParams":{"id":"1789168498","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5nPxQaMbEooBdz9t9HTrs8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789168498/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"446885417","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/446885417?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738300339100}}},"1789339154":{"id":"1789339154","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789339154?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/deadend/1733476118","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Butterfly Effect","artistName":"DEADEND","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1440,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e2/c8/a5/e2c8a5dc-b1f5-182e-10fb-078346a7b980/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1440,"textColor3":"bfbfbf","textColor2":"c6cfd7","textColor4":"a2aab2","textColor1":"eae9e6","bgColor":"141821","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-butterfly-effect/1789339154","playParams":{"id":"1789339154","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6wLWzifkwkOoHQfZ4Fqnqe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789339154/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1733476118","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1733476118?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738310178984}}},"1789359219":{"id":"1789359219","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789359219?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rust-fly/1789359349","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Another second chance","artistName":"Rust Fly","artwork":{"width":1417,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2f/07/c2/2f07c24f-b901-7788-4eac-7f92d8a66c44/0001050950970.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1417,"textColor3":"babaad","textColor2":"d4d4c6","textColor4":"acab9f","textColor1":"e4e7d8","bgColor":"100900","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/another-second-chance/1789359219","playParams":{"id":"1789359219","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2tcAgj5HRDS1cOxEByh85h"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789359219/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1789359349","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1789359349?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1736354108214}}},"1789392992":{"id":"1789392992","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789392992?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/thomas-polychuck/1504386594","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live Sessions EP - Single","artistName":"Thomas Polychuck","artwork":{"width":3750,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/05/c3/aa/05c3aa80-e079-4f55-991f-b215e349f5e4/605491113538.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3750,"textColor3":"b2bac4","textColor2":"c7d9ea","textColor4":"a3b1be","textColor1":"dae5f2","bgColor":"11100e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-sessions-ep-single/1789392992","playParams":{"id":"1789392992","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789392992/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1504386594","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1504386594?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1737605450112}}},"1789839611":{"id":"1789839611","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789839611?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":29,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yungeen-ace/1348100662","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"I Control My Destiny (Deluxe)","artistName":"Yungeen Ace","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/66/76/4e/66764e5b-d4ae-43b3-8d0b-971f466593c9/48877.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"abad96","textColor2":"b2c4b2","textColor4":"91a091","textColor1":"d2d4b8","bgColor":"11100e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Jacksonville-raised rapper Yungeen Ace has built a career around openness and vulnerability. He sings of trauma and tragedy, escaping the world that has spent so long trying to consume him, and the path towards recovery. On 2024’s <i>I Control My Destiny</i>, he sounds hopeful and inspired, his voice glowing even when recounting all the heartbreaks that have defined his life. On the opener, “Lately,” which features an Afrobeats-inspired beat and a chorus from vocalist RAYBEKAH, Ace sings of the work he’s done on himself, outlining the therapy that has helped heal the traumas he faces on regular occasions. Despite the strides he takes to remove the streets from his story, Yungeen Ace’s old life occasionally creeps back into the fold, like on “Dreams of War,” where he chastises an unnamed opp for not taking care of his soldiers. Even when he revisits these early days, though, there’s an empathy that infuses <i>I Control My Destiny</i>—a desire to see everyone conquer their demons.","short":"A statement of intent to overcome trauma and heartbreak."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-control-my-destiny-deluxe/1789839611","playParams":{"id":"1789839611","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7q5DOQS9NkIGll2NnKfRH6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789839611/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1348100662","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1348100662?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738345474786}}},"1790486703":{"id":"1790486703","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790486703?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hrishikesh-hirway/1539254262","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f9/0e/76/f90e7657-3730-19e8-2f31-8ab9608c694a/c8b84086-11b4-45c6-9e20-f4d313adee6a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c87444","textColor2":"f2864c","textColor4":"c56f40","textColor1":"f68d50","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Companion (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","artistName":"Hrishikesh Hirway","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/06/6e/9f/066e9f7d-f75a-6e30-00c4-720fc0d1b0b8/794043222566.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bb8e64","textColor2":"d3995a","textColor4":"af7f4a","textColor1":"e3ac7b","bgColor":"1d170b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Soundtrack","short":"The multi-talented artist gives the creepy thriller an equally eerie score."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/companion-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1790486703","playParams":{"id":"1790486703","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Y2lb2euCA6AKPDJwfpCYT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790486703/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1539254262","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1539254262?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738271622268}}},"1790659615":{"id":"1790659615","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790659615?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jeff-mills/5207761","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Star Child -

Much like the first installment of his <i>PA’L CORA</i> EP series, which contained both a Peso Pluma team-up and a bachata hybrid, this follow-up volume continues to push his sound in a worthwhile way. The largely collaborative effort finds him linking with an array of interesting and notable figures, beginning with salsa icon Marc Anthony on the riveting title track and closing with revered rapper Snow Tha Product on the potent “Llórame un Río.” He turns piano balladeer on the boozy solo number “A Solas con la Botella” and gets decidedly more playful opposite alternative artist Jonaz on “Botox

His 2025 follow-up is a joyful victory lap for how far he’s come and an honest reckoning with the steps he has to take to continue improving as a man and person. “Pop Out” is a turn-up anthem that goes back to his days hustling on the corner. His eye for detail remains as sharp as ever, years removed from those days. Elsewhere, on “Learning,” he takes stock of his missteps, vowing to do better next time around.","short":"A follow-up to 2023’s For Her is a victory lap and a

Release","standard":"Ahead of their Coachella debut, Korea-based septet XG released <i>XDM Unidentified Waves</i>, a remix album featuring alternate versions of some of the group’s most popular songs. The eight tracks are reimagined through different genres—including Jersey club, house, and trance—by XG executive producer JAKOPS, aka Simon Junho Park. All are imbued with the kind of dance-party energy that would fit right in on a festival field. Here, XG’s low-key trap-beat track “GRL GVNG” becomes an exultant house bop, and the whisper hook of debut single “TIPPY TOES” becomes more abstract and distorted as it builds to a drop beat. It’s all in the pursuit of further defining “X-pop,” the self-described sound for the internationally minded group. All of XG’s members—Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya, and Cocona—are Japanese, but the group is based in Korea, and sings and raps mostly in English. Around the release of XG’s debut EP, <i>NEW DNA</i>, singer Chisa told Apple Music’s Brooke Reese, “I would describe XG's sound as a mixture inspired by R&B and hip-hop, but we also have a lot of original flavors included in there as well.”","short":"Club-ready remixes of the K-pop group’s biggest songs."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/xdm-unidentified-waves/1791750109","playParams":{"id":"1791750109","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1z3VCBUJBHkpDHtzOZP205"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791750109/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1609409493","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1609409493?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738333908555}}},"1791792124":{"id":"1791792124","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791792124?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-31","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-red-clay-strays/1483812664","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Red Clay Strays Live AF from Callaghan's - EP","artistName":"The Red Clay Strays","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/a3/0f/7ba30fea-f8c0-1324-682b-c8f72724ae9f/196872786736.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdbbab","textColor2":"e1a580","textColor4":"bd8868","textColor1":"f6e5d4","bgColor":"2e1406","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-red-clay-strays-live-af-from-callaghans-ep/1791792124","playParams":{"id":"1791792124","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791792124/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1483812664","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1483812664?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1738300639554}}},"1791802502":{"id":"1791802502","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791802502?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-01-24","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bigxthaplug/1482508209","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"TAKE CARE (DELUXE)","artistName":"BigXthaPlug","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/39/ef/9f/39ef9f3c-0cd1-9ad9-1bf6-a9b49ccb8557/199041477657.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6bfbc","textColor2":"cf9b76","textColor4":"a88163","textColor1":"f5e9e5","bgColor":"0c1617","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Texas standout BigXthaPlug’s career skyrocketed shortly after he emerged in 2022, becoming Dallas’ next great hope by 2024. His first album, 2023’s <i>Amar</i>, established him as a bona fide star, but rapping is no longer his main focus. BigX is a proud father of two, and everything he does (rap included) is to give his children things he was never afforded. On 2024’s <i>TAKE CARE</i>, he makes clear where his priorities lie.\n\n“My kids is what drives me,” he tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “That’s the reason when I’m tired and I get up every day when I don’t want to get up, they’re the reason.” This album, as such, is for the next generation. Yes, he raps his ass off and showcases why he’s one of Texas’ most celebrated stars, but more important than acclaim and fame is making sure the mouths that rely on him are adequately fed. “My little boy, he made me realize, ‘Okay, life is for real. This is a real thing.’” \n\nThat seriousness makes its way onto <i>TAKE CARE</i>, like on “Therapy Session.” X showcases his signature Southern drawl over cheery piano chords, stinging handclaps, and soaring guitar solos. He lays out the stakes for the entire record, paying tribute to his two children: “My family rely/When I be away from ’em I cry/’Cause I love ’em the most, I’d hate for them ever to say that their daddy wasn’t right on they side,” he raps. “I feel like I see the whole world,” he says. “I really understand why we’re here.”\n","short":"One of Texas’ most celebrated stars is doing it for the

Over the past 14 years, Abel Tesfaye has experienced what you might call pop’s glow-up of the century: When he emerged from obscurity as the faceless voice behind 2011’s noir-ish <i>House of Balloons</i> mixtape, nobody could have guessed that he’d be headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show a decade later. But that moment onstage triggered what Tesfaye has since described as a breakdown, inspiring a period of intense reflection on his life and career—and <i>Hurry Up Tomorrow</i>, his sixth studio album.\n\nTesfaye has called <i>Tomorrow</i> the final chapter in the trilogy he began with 2020’s <i>After Hours</i>, the album that launched him into a new stratosphere of pop success, and continued with 2022’s high-concept <i>Dawn FM</i>. Continuing the narrative of its semi-autobiographical narrator’s journey through a dark night of the soul, <i>Tomorrow</i> doubles as an allegory about fame’s power to destroy: The curtain rises, and it’s all downhill from there. He longs for a time “when my blood never tasted like wine,” he wails over the night-drive synth-pop of “Take Me Back to LA,” and diagnoses fame as a disease on the glittering “Drive.” He’s ready to leave it all behind on “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with French duo Justice: “No afterlife, no other side,” he sings, sounding entranced by the thought.\n\nIts 22 tracks play out like the swan song to end all swan songs, joined by a murderer’s row of guests: Future lends a layer of scuzz to the deceptively sweet R&B slow-burner “Enjoy the Show,” Anitta taps in for the nocturnal baile funk of “São Paulo,” and frequent collaborator Lana Del Rey makes an appearance on “The Abyss,” where ominous lyrics like, “What’s the point of staying? It’s going up in flames” hit even harder after LA’s devastating fires in January 2025. Tesfaye has dropped repeated hints that this album won’t just close out the trilogy, but also his existence as The Weeknd. If that’s the case, “Without a Warning” encapsulates the arc of an artist who never let success get in the way of his ambition: “Take me to a time/When I was young/And my heart could take the drugs and heartache without loss/But now my bones are frail/And my voice fails/And my tears fall without a warning/Either way, the crowd will scream my name.”\n","short":"An exit interview for a project
