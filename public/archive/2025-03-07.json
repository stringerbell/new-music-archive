Album and Interview","standard":"Noah Lennox used to feel as though his solo work as Panda Bear was, in his words, “disparate and separate” from the music he’d make with Animal Collective. But now, over two decades on, it seems more like one continuous project. “Playing drums in AC, singing in AC, writing songs for AC, doing features, doing remixes, doing this record where I’m collaborating with all these different people or getting these different flavors from different people,” Lennox tells Apple Music, “it all kind of feels like part of the same creative wave.”\n\n“This record” is <i>Sinister Grift</i>, the first Panda Bear album to feature contributions from all three of his Animal Collective bandmates—David “Avey Tare” Portner, Brian “Geologist” Weitz, and Josh “Deakin” Dibb—not to mention collaborations with Patrick Flegel (aka Cindy Lee) and SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE’s Rivka Ravede. Recorded at his home studio in Lisbon and in his hometown of Baltimore, it’s meant to feel like a contemporary take on an early rock ’n’ roll record, with Lennox opting to illuminate the natural qualities of the music, rather than distort or deliberately obfuscate them, as he did on 2019’s <i>Buoys</i>. “It still feels very contemporary, very plug-in, very digital audio workstation to me,” he says. “There’s echoes of older music that I love in there, but there’s no retro-ness to it, I hope. I’m not a big fan of that kind of thing.”\n\nFront to back, the album is meant to mirror what Lennox calls the “playful menace” at the heart of its title—an idea he’d had before he’d written a single lyric. Before falling into the abyss of its second half, the music feels effervescent even when the songs themselves are anything but. “‘Sinister grift’ is this lie that we tell ourselves, that if we’re just careful enough or if we’re ‘good people,’ we can somehow avoid suffering or regrets, mistakes, hurting ourselves or people—this very inevitable part of living,” he says. “I like contrast. I feel like the light is lighter when it’s put against darkness, or things are funnier when they’re addressing something really dark. But it really started just because I liked the title. I like how it sounded, I like how it looked on paper. It sounds kind of dumb, but sometimes things start really simply like that.” Here, Lennox takes us inside a few songs from the album.\n\n<b>“Praise”</b>\n“It kind of started as a song thinking about my son—the anecdote about him not picking up his phone is very real. But then it became a song more about fatherhood and then a song about parenthood. There’s this fire driving the relationship, where it feels like no matter what the kid does, he’s not calling you back. If he’s maybe being a little difficult or acting up, there’s this sense that there’s an underlying force, that unbreakable thing that drives the relationship.”\n\n<b>“Anywhere but Here”</b>\n“I stole pretty wholesale the idea from a [The] Louvin Brothers song called ‘Satan Is Real,’ where there’s a vocal refrain, and then he preaches or tells the story for a second. I’m a huge fan of that record, but that song specifically. I thought it would be cool to try to do my own version of that. I think my original idea was to ask my daughter Nadja to do the spoken-word part, which she wrote. But then I asked Dean Blunt to do it, and he was down, but he couldn’t. Ultimately, I was so excited about getting my daughter onto the thing and, lucky for me, she was down to do it eventually—as long as I paid her.”\n\n<b>“Ends Meet”</b>\n“This song always reminds me of ‘Monster Mash.’ It’s a song about appreciating life, including the more difficult things. The ‘Monster Mash’-iness comes from the sense that there’s something coming to get you—these difficult things in life are going to happen to you, no matter what you do. But it’s said in this very playful way, which I hoped was fun. I find that telling a joke is a way to enter into a difficult conversation. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.”\n\n<b>“Just as Well”</b>\n“I’m a huge reggae fan, huge dub fan, and I’m always looking for a way to do something that feels reggae without explicitly being reggae, and there’s a couple attempts on this record. I’d say ‘Just as Well’ is one and the other ‘50mg,’ which feels a bit like a cross between a reggae track and a country track to me. I feel like this song is maybe the best attempt I’ve made at doing something that feels like an impression of reggae. It’s something that I feel like is always in me, but doing a version of it that feels genuine is difficult.” \n\n<b>“Ferry Lady”</b>\n“There’s a lot of percussion in it, but it’s not actually a drum kit playing, unlike most of the other songs. It feels kind of like the gateway to the second half of the record to me. It’s in between the lightness and the dark, the ferry from one side of the record to the other. It’s about any type of relationship that has ended and hasn’t ended like you thought it would, about people growing apart.”\n\n<b>“Venom’s In”</b>\n“‘Venom’s In’ is about having a reality thrust upon you in life and not wanting it. It feels like the character in the song can tell that change is coming and wants to stop it, but knows it’s impossible. So the venom is already in the body, the change is going to happen. It’s a pretty desperate song to me—it feels very low.”\n\n<b>“Elegy for Noah Lou”</b>\n“That one represents the original vision for the record, insofar as I thought we were going to do these straight-ahead recordings: guitar, bass, drums, singing, and I would play everything. The original idea was to spend months following the recordings, abstracting those forms or blurring them. But as we worked with the arrangements, we got the structures and the tone of the stuff really right, so a lot of the stuff felt like it was done, like it didn’t need to grow into anything else. So that idea of blurring everything we left behind, except you hear it a little bit in this wasteland section of the record. ‘Elegy for Noah Lou’ is where it kind of feels like the song is sort of there, but it’s muted and more like an impression of the song than a song.”\n\n<b>“Defense”</b> \n“I was a huge fan of Patrick [Flegel]’s, from Women forward. He had played some shows with the rest of the AC guys at some point, had stayed at Josh’s place coming through Baltimore once or twice.

Over shuffling hi-hats and a rubbery bassline she sings, “Whoever said that it’s better to have loved and to lost/Than to not have loved at all/Should just shut up forever.” Alongside co-producers Rostam and Jenn Decilveo, the LA-based indie rock star takes aim at the lovers and lust-hungry obsessives throughout. On “Love Makes You Do Crazy Things,” guitars screech and shout before SASAMI rolls through with a metal-worthy solo during the introduction. “Bet it all on you, now I gotta leave town,” she sings, exposing the dark underbelly that exists beneath the surface of pop music’s romanticism. The album finds her moving away from the experimental songwriting of previous records like 2022’s <i>Squeeze</i>, instead turning in a streamlined and diamond-sharp ode to the parts of love that suck.","short":"Her third album is a diamond-sharp ode to the parts of love that

Album and Interview","standard":"Two decades into their career, UK metalcore stars Architects know that name recognition isn’t always an asset. “We’re aware that it takes a lot more to get people’s attention on your 11th album,” songwriter and drummer Dan Searle tells Apple Music. “We recognized that we had to aim really, really high if we wanted to grab people’s attention.” The result is <i>The Sky, the Earth & All Between</i>, an album that explodes with punishing breakdowns, bubbling electronics, and Sam Carter’s impressive scream/sing/scream acrobatics. “We felt strongly that there was another gear we had uncovered,” Searle says. “We experimented a lot on the last couple albums, and that had opened a lot of doors. Suddenly, I could see this world for us to head into. There was this prophecy in our heads about what we could achieve.”\n\nWith kinetic singles that take on tribalism (“Whiplash”), mortality (“Blackhole”), and disgruntled fans (“Seeing Red”), Searle realized early on that the record didn’t have a unifying lyrical theme. “I spent five months trying to think of an album title that would put a nice little bow on it, that was memorable and poetic, so I ended up using a lyrical reference,” he says. “I just felt like it suited the mood and aesthetic of the album.” Below, he discusses each song.\n\n<b>“Elegy”</b>\n“I don’t think we’ve ever had a song like this before. Thematically, it’s about defiance. It’s about overcoming obstacles, overcoming doubt—other people’s doubt. I think this might not even have existed in reality, but we had created this mindset where people doubted us. So, it just felt like the right thing to open the album with a statement of defiance: ‘Fuck you if you doubted us. We’re still here.’ It’s complete bravado—a bit of a chest-out, standing-tall statement of belief and intent.”\n\n<b>“Whiplash”</b>\n“This song is about tribalism, the world we live in today. I don’t really gravitate towards writing songs that are political statements these days. Looking back at our previous work, we’ve become different people. So, I try not to do that anymore because I just don’t know how I’m going to feel next year. This song is a bit broader: It’s such a divided world right now, and there’s so many forces contributing towards that. So, it’s a bit of a cynical commentary on how we’re incapable of treating each other with respect when we have a difference of opinion and see the world a different way.”\n\n<b>“Blackhole”</b>\n“This one revisits some themes from our older stuff a little bit. It’s pondering mortality and the battles that we face day to day—and how those battles look when they’re silhouetted by the backdrop of dying, by how insignificant so much of our suffering is in the face of inevitability. Obviously, all of us see friends or family get sick, and this stirs up all sorts of thoughts and feelings within us. When we wrote that song, that had come up in our lives. I was asking myself, ‘What’s this all about? And why am I wasting my time suffering over nothing?’”\n\n<b>“Everything Ends”</b>\n“This is about acknowledging that no matter how much I’m suffering in a particular moment, that suffering will end. That could be dying, but it could also be when you’re in a bad space and it feels like it’s forever. And then you wake up one day, like, ‘Oh, I feel kind of better. And I don’t know when that started happening.’ A lot of it is conversational in the sense that I’m almost communicating with my partner in the song. There’s a little bit of excuse-making and apology. I’m aware that when I’m suffering, the person that has to bear the brunt of that is my wife. And that’s probably the same for everyone—their partner gets the worst of it. So, the song is a reminder that no matter how bad things get, the sun will rise again.”\n\n<b>“Brain Dead”</b>\n“This is a collaboration with House of Protection, and I feel like this is probably the most fun song on the record. It was definitely written in that spirit. I had this idea for a song called ‘Brain Dead’ for a while, and it suited this hardcore punk aesthetic that we delved into on this song. I was thinking about modern life and the way we anaesthetize ourselves, whether it’s through phone addiction or alcohol or weed or brainwashing ourselves with news media or whatever. So many of us are unconsciously just giving up our lives, and we kind of yearn to be numbed and not have to feel too much. Would we rather just be dumb and ignorant? There’s a part of me that would. So, it’s a tongue-in-cheek hardcore anthem for stupidity.”\n\n<b>“Evil Eyes”</b>\n“On this song, I’m anthropomorphizing my own inner dialogue of anxiety as something that’s outside of me. It’s sort of like me saying, ‘I’m going to overcome this; I’m overcoming this.’ But the verses are about me just being furious at the anxiety and trying to attack it and venting my frustration at dealing with these feelings all the time. But ultimately, the song is quite a positive one. There is some defiance, but it’s more about me overcoming myself and overcoming the self-destructive qualities that I have, so I can live another day.”\n\n<b>“Landmines”</b>\n“This is about me knowing that I need to do things to be a better person, a better husband, a better dad, a better human being—but ignoring those things, setting them aside, making excuses, and carrying on living in a less-than-desirable way. It’s about being self-destructive, and it’s about knowing you’re doing it and carrying on anyway. I feel as though I see that everywhere. It’s like when we know we’ve got to do something, but we don’t do it. And we all experience that. We know what’s good for us, but we so often don’t do it. And we make excuses all the time. We justify our apathy. It’s part of being human.”\n\n<b>“Judgement Day” (feat. Amira Elfeky)</b>\n“I think this is a bit of an old-man song in a way. It’s about digitally induced dread, this experience of living under the cloud of what the internet shows me and the way that it distills all the terrible things that are happening in the world into a neat little package for me every day. So, I’m asking, ‘How natural is that? Are we really wired to deal with that?’ I really feel for young people, and I can’t imagine what it’s like to grow up under that cloud. I’ve got young kids, and I wonder what it’s doing to them. I’m not sure it’s a good thing.”\n\n<b>“Broken Mirror”</b>\n“I suppose this is a little bit like ‘Everything Ends’ in the sense that I think the song is me getting mad at myself about being a bad partner. I’m probably a little bit hard on myself at times, and when I feel that I’ve gone too far lyrically and I’m being too brutal on myself, Sam usually reads the lyrics and says, ‘No, that’s exactly what it should be like.’ So, I guess Sam probably experiences this maybe even more than me. But I was just trying to examine who I am and how I operate within the framework of a human relationship and how much I ask another person to tolerate.”\n\n<b>“Curse”</b>\n“Our producer told me, ‘You can only have one old-man song on this album,’ but I was freaking out about getting old. I’m going gray. I’m reaching that point in my life where the signs of aging are very clear. We can laugh about it, and we ought to just accept it, of course. But it’s weird because my brother died when he was 28, and for a long time, that fueled this total acceptance of aging. I had about eight years of not caring that I’m another year older because Tom died when he was 28. So, every year beyond that is a gift. And then, suddenly, that fuel just ran out. I was like, ‘Oh, fuck. I’m going to be 40, 50, 60…’ But I know I should just make the best of it and enjoy the ride.”\n\n<b>“Seeing Red”</b>\n“Before this record, we did a couple of albums that were less heavy. The internet gave us a bit of a hard time about it, and we took it personally. So, I had this idea that we should write a heavy song about fans wanting us to be heavy, but we should make it fun and a bit of a joke. I think it’s probably one of the first songs we’ve ever written where I had lyrics before anything else. One of the first lines is, ‘I felt it when they said, “We only ever love you when you’re seeing red.”’ That very much set the tone. For all the heavy themes on this record, a lot of it was made in the spirit of fun—especially this song.”\n\n<b>“Chandelier”</b>\n“It’s hard to know how to end an album, but this was very much a purpose-built album-closer. It’s got a little bit of the same DNA as ‘Elegy,’ so it felt like a good way to bookend the album. At first, it felt like quite a bleak song lyrically, but after we finished it, I just had this complete 180 where, suddenly, the lyrics were speaking more of how beautiful life is and how it’ll still be beautiful without us. The world continues to evolve after our light goes out, so we’re just here to enjoy it as best we can and witness it and try to understand it. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. And that’s OK.”","short":"“It takes a lot more to get attention on your 11th album.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sky-the-earth-all-between/1774393621","playParams":{"id":"1774393621","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2W82VyyIFAXigJEiLm5TT1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774393621/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"182821355","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/182821355?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741340846346,"RTCI":0}}},"1774753384":{"id":"1774753384","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774753384?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/destruction/7024320","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Birth Of Malice","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Destruction","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b1/aa/f0/b1aaf098-4185-7326-72e8-5132ed4922c3/810170320378.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"21a777","textColor2":"ff2322","textColor4":"cc2121","textColor1":"28cb8e","bgColor":"05191a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/birth-of-malice/1774753384","playParams":{"id":"1774753384","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1LyLH8iSQkTZTgDZNcXwvd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1774753384/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"7024320","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/7024320?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741344262287,"RTCI":0}}},"1775966071":{"id":"1775966071","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1775966071?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/everything-is-recorded/1229251135","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/48/11/05/48110517-74e9-836c-d39f-a152847687c4/291087d9-317c-4bc9-ab65-fc63f3bea46a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5b5b6","textColor2":"c6c0c6","textColor4":"a29da2","textColor1":"dedee0","bgColor":"121211","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/0e/62/060e622c-2d78-34bd-f5d7-e05e3b0c2a05/929c12ff-84e3-4ffc-bcce-18dd9307f691.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b0937f","textColor2":"cbab95","textColor4":"a88e7d","textColor1":"d5b098","bgColor":"1c1c1e","hasP3":false}},"name":"Richard Russell Is Temporary","artistName":"Everything Is Recorded","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ed/17/ab/ed17abbf-ac9e-70ca-fd25-5047fa220175/191404149072.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b29b87","textColor2":"e1a987","textColor4":"ba8d72","textColor1":"d7bba1","bgColor":"1d1e20","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"For his third album under the banner of Everything Is Recorded, producer and XL Recordings founder Richard Russell had nothing smaller than the very existence of humanity on his mind. On <i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i> he taps a lengthy, wide-ranging list of collaborators—including Florence Welch, Bill Callahan, Sampha, Oscar-nominated actor Samantha Morton, and Kamasi Washington—to strip down their sounds and face life’s fragility head-on.\n\nWhile that existential uncertainty hangs over much of the sparse landscape of <i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i>, unifying its many voices, so does the prospect of life beyond Earth. “‘Spirit,’ I think, is probably the simplest way of [saying] it,” said Russell. “So, when David Bowie passes away, everyone’s distraught because it turns out he’s temporary—but we shouldn’t be too surprised by that. We know that what he’s done is permanent. The influence of it, the love, the inspiration is there forever.”\n\nThat ideal comes to the fore on the Callahan collaboration “Norm,” which pays tribute to the late cult-hero comic Norm MacDonald, and samples him riffing on mortality during a 2011 performance: “When the fuckin’ sickle of death is over my goddamn neck, I’m gonna be so cowardly. I’m afraid of going on Ferris wheels,” MacDonald cracks in irascible fashion, before Callahan swoops back in to note that his “voice and face live on” even after his 2021 death. Sampling his honesty about life’s last chapters was a reminder, Russell says, that “the humor is so important to everything—the humor is the sanity, just in life generally.”\n\n<i>Richard Russell Is Temporary</i> is a rare feat, an all-star album that feels born from a collective spirit of creativity and curiosity. “I don’t want to speak for any of my collaborators,” Russell says. “I got the feeling they were really enjoying participating in this project. Maybe that’s because they’ve all got their own careers, and your career comes with pressure—you’ve got to think about everything. In a situation like this, you don’t have to, because I’ve got to think about it. So, you get to come in the room and do it.”","short":"An all-star album born from a spirit of creativity and

Album and Interview","standard":"For their second album, Canadian metalcore phenoms Spiritbox found inspiration at home. In fact, vocalist Courtney LaPlante and guitarist Mike Stringer’s home island of Victoria, British Columbia, <i>was</i> the inspiration. “When we were trying to get this band off the ground, we were feeling really stuck and hopeless,” LaPlante tells Apple Music. “I was thinking back to that time, and it brought back this subconscious dread, because we’re near all the scary tectonic plates on the West Coast. Since we were little kids, everyone’s been telling us about how ‘the big one’ is coming.”\n\nOf course, a massive earthquake at sea would cause a massive tsunami. “A tsunami is a horrible natural disaster that can’t be helped, but imagine if the entire ocean was a tsunami, not just one small part of it,” LaPlante offers. “It felt like such an over-the-top, perfect example of the drama you feel when you’re depressed. And that was my mental state at the time. But even saying I was depressed is embarrassing to me because I’ve achieved the life I’ve always wanted to achieve, so it feels like a moral failing to be depressed. In that way, the album became a score for my life.” Below, she comments on each song.\n\n<b>“Fata Morgana”</b>\n“When Michael and [producer] Dan [Braunstein] were making this at our house, I was frantically cleaning the bathroom while our puppy was taking a nap, because I knew I only had about 30 minutes before he’d wake up. But I could hear everything they were doing, and Michael just started playing this hypnotizing riff. Right away, I knew it was the intro track and the mission statement for the whole record. I started writing in my head right there in the bathroom. I thought, ‘My god, I cannot wait to walk out onstage to this song.’ The other fun fact about this one is that the vocal pattern was inspired by Busta Rhymes.”\n\n<b>“Black Rainbow”</b>\n“One of the reasons I wanted to call this song ‘Black Rainbow’ is because the director [Panos Cosmatos] that made <i>Beyond the Black Rainbow</i> is from our island. He moved here as a teenager, like I did, and I’ve just always felt a bit of camaraderie with anyone that’s left the island—people like Pamela Anderson and Nelly Furtado. But that movie was very disturbing to me, and it’s basically about someone dropped into something where they become completely disoriented. Which is how I feel sometimes.”\n\n<b>“Perfect Soul”</b>\n“This song feels very pop to me, though I never intended it to be that way. It’s very sincere and dramatic. It’s a song about someone who’s kind of saying, ‘You’ve taken everything from me. There’s nothing more to take, so just leave me here.’ It’s a relationship that’s so far gone that there’s nothing we can do to repair it. Instead of having a traditional breakdown like we’d normally do, this one is cool because Michael uses an EBow on his guitar and takes a full minute to bend a note. It’s a bit of an homage to one of his favorite artists, Cloudkicker, and it’s one of my favorite parts of the album.”\n\n<b>“Keep Sweet”</b>\n“I moved to the island from Alabama when I was 15. In Alabama, I was around people that were very conservative and extremely traditional. More so than the friends I made in Canada, I think I was exposed to how religion is used to subjugate women. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of ‘keeping sweet,’ which is something that exists throughout different types of Christianity and other religions. It basically just means that women need to maintain their femininity, which in our society is softness, kindness, and empathy—but also humbleness and meekness. It’s kind of a mantra that’s repeated to us. We’re socialized to be complacent, which is what the song is about.”\n\n<b>“Soft Spine”</b>\n“I don’t really know the people that are part of my peer group. I don’t go to parties and meet people and hang out and stuff. But there’s so many nasty people in the music industry, and they probably know who I am, but they probably don’t know that I think they’re bad people and I don’t want to know them. This song is saying ‘fuck you’ to them. It’s my fantasy of having the leverage and power to negatively impact their wallets. I can’t beat anybody up or kick anyone’s ass, but the narrator in the song can, and they’re not scared to do it.”\n\n<b>“Tsunami Sea”</b>\n“I love this song so much. Before there were lyrics, I knew this one would be the title song. But I wanted to think of a more intimate reason for the album to be called <i>Tsunami Sea</i> that I could use for this song—rather than just the big, bold, theatrical idea of a natural disaster destroying everything. Here, it’s a metaphor to explain panic attacks or when you’re so sad and depressed and low, and you can’t stop crying. I thought about how many teardrops it would take to fill up a whole ocean of tsunamis. I’m using that to destroy everything and drown myself rather than deal with my problems.”\n\n<b>“A Haven with Two Faces”</b>\n“Conceptually, the haven with two faces is our town. It makes you unique and creative and different because you have to overcome a lot to get off the island and be an artist, but at the same time, it really hinders you because you just feel misunderstood. It’s extra weird living here because of the physical isolation combined with the normal isolation that you might feel. It’s got that small-town feeling, but then you can’t drive out of it. At the same time, it’s a beautiful place to grow up.”\n\n<b>“No Loss, No Love”</b>\n“On this song, I’m imagining a person in the middle of the ocean on a life raft. It’s after the tsunami has destroyed everything. They have no food, no drink. Everything they love is gone. But it’s the eye of the storm, so everything seems calm and safe. It’s like a person who feels secure in their mental health even though they stopped taking their medication. It’s that false clarity you feel when you’ve been deep, deep down and now all your endorphins and serotonin are shooting back up. The person on the raft thinks they see an abundant island, a safe place to get off, but it’s actually dangerous.”\n\n<b>“Crystal Roses”</b>\n“This is a gentler version of the scariness of ‘No Loss, No Love.’ You’re floating across the ocean, thinking, ‘Whatever will be will be.’ All these mystical elements of the supernatural world are beckoning the raft this way or that way. Michael wrote this because he wanted to make something completely out of left field, and the drum loop just put me in a trance. One of the things I’ve been wanting to do for a couple years now is to use a live formant to pitch my voice up and down in real time. I like it because it takes any gender out of my voice. Is it a guy? A girl? Is it me? You can’t tell.”\n\n<b>“Ride the Wave”</b>\n“When I heard Michael and Dan working on the chorus, I knew I had to get my Jimmy Eat World on. I love that band, but our bass player, Josh [Gilbert], is the ultra-mega Jimmy Eat World stan. When he joined the band, that’s one of the ways we really bonded. He knows all the lore, so I’ve learned more about Jimmy Eat World in the last two years than I had ever known in my life. One of the things I love about that band is that the harmony vocal is just as important as the melody. So, the chorus of this is my voice and Josh’s voice together, and the harmony isn’t just supportive.”\n\n<b>“Deep End”</b>\n“This song was originally called ‘Deep Dish.’ We wrote the first half years ago, when we were working on our <i>Rotoscope</i> EP. Afterwards, we went out and celebrated with deep-dish pizza at a spot down the road from the studio. Towards the end of the meal, we were like, ‘What are we going to name the song?’ We looked at our food and agreed: ‘Deep Dish.’ And this song is the final goodbye for the album. It’s about a person making all these excuses for their own shortcomings, tying themselves down with it and admitting defeat. It’s a very sad song, but it’s uplifting musically. It’s got my favorite riff that Michael has ever made.”","short":"Canadian metalcore phenoms Spiritbox find inspiration at home."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tsunami-sea/1779147456","playParams":{"id":"1779147456","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/79sg58t1vRpcxudpP9uPtg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779147456/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1293047384","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1293047384?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741345800087,"RTCI":0}}},"1779161702":{"id":"1779161702","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779161702?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/this-gift-is-a-curse/405256386","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Heir","artistName":"This Gift Is A Curse","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/90/8d/da/908dda39-0f89-f249-c0af-c707af731923/822603005752.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9ae8f","textColor2":"dbc4ab","textColor4":"b6a28d","textColor1":"f3d3ad","bgColor":"241917","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heir/1779161702","playParams":{"id":"1779161702","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/44Hy9Mt7f130Ad4MlivcBd"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779161702/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"405256386","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/405256386?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741344259566,"RTCI":0}}},"1780425069":{"id":"1780425069","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780425069?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hypermass/1028977032","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Apparition Day - EP","artistName":"Hypermass","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/55/e3/9e55e3d5-5339-cbbb-bca1-57cc049d3a88/198846954882.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"312f30","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor4":"434343","textColor1":"050404","bgColor":"dedede","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/apparition-day-ep/1780425069","playParams":{"id":"1780425069","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780425069/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1028977032","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1028977032?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741252324640,"RTCI":0}}},"1780518314":{"id":"1780518314","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780518314?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/banks/2775067","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b6/d7/48/b6d748ce-3a52-4271-69c1-479935ff3a68/62deac6c-2ce5-48e5-8b1e-cbad9ca1f5d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d5d0ca","textColor2":"f8e6d7","textColor4":"d6c5b8","textColor1":"f7f3ed","bgColor":"4c433b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/09/0a/59/090a5973-6903-8f74-5779-1aaffffe7321/1d445461-e60a-4ecd-acac-8393cf4863d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ddccc5","textColor2":"f9e7d4","textColor4":"dbcbb9","textColor1":"fce9e2","bgColor":"615a4e","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b2/9d/27/b29d27d0-8663-d573-50c6-bec546182e22/70380d62-a337-49dc-8f26-9e795a00ff9c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a5a0a0","textColor2":"d2c1b8","textColor4":"a89b94","textColor1":"cdc7c6","bgColor":"040407","hasP3":false}},"name":"Off With Her Head","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"BANKS","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e0/66/1e/e0661ecf-dc4e-59c4-2374-308cec726686/5034644292793.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b19c80","textColor2":"cdba91","textColor4":"a89877","textColor1":"d9bf9c","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Even when she’s rejecting therapists’ advice and flipping the bird to exes’ exes, BANKS sounds positively revitalized on her fifth studio album <i>Off With Her Head</i>. Jillian Banks’ follow-up to 2022’s <i>Serpentina</i> largely jettisons the smoky balladry that marked its predecessor in favor of sharp, skipping electro-pop—representing something of a full-circle back to her star-making 2014 debut, <i>Goddess</i>. The callback is more than skin-deep, as BANKS brings back several key collaborators from her early days—including UK dance impresarios like Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Lil Silva, as well as moody alt-R&B auteur SOHN—to pitch in when it comes to <i>Off With Her Head</i>’s sonically multifarious production. A few new friends join in, too: Sampha’s unmistakable vocals mark the pulsing pop of “Make It Up,” while the ascendant rap superstar Doechii brings her fiery personality on “I Hate Your Ex-Girlfriend” with unmistakable lyrical bon mots like “Wrap a bow around your coffin like it’s Christmas.”","short":"Sharp electro-pop that recalls her star-making 2014

Album","standard":"On their ninth album, Knoxville deathcore squad Whitechapel bring their triple-guitar onslaught to a concept album about religious extremism. As a thematic successor to 2008’s <i>This Is Exile</i>, <i>Hymns in Dissonance</i> examines evil through the eyes of a fanatic gathering followers for his cult. After the hellish introductory combo of “Prisoner 666” and the title track, parts of the remaining songs—minus tribal interlude “Ex Infernis”—are meant to be hymns sung by the cult’s members. Their goal? To open a portal for their leader’s unholy ascent. Lyrically, Whitechapel vocalist Phil Bozeman has written the hymns as representations of the seven deadly sins. Meanwhile, the band’s hyper-staccato attack fully embodies all the diabolic discord the title promises.","short":"The Knoxville deathcore squad’s concept album about religious extremists."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hymns-in-dissonance/1781939814","playParams":{"id":"1781939814","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7lnkxd7w0YcE18CZ6COEJj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781939814/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"127084107","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/127084107?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741344562302,"RTCI":0}}},"1782132166":{"id":"1782132166","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782132166?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/crown-magnetar/1324870952","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Punishment - EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Crown Magnetar","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/c2/0b/cbc20b3e-a624-2df2-6843-e2be045ff83e/199066067505.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a19c8d","textColor2":"d9b6a8","textColor4":"b1958a","textColor1":"c5bfac","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"A short blast of corrosive death metal from the Denver combo."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/punishment-ep/1782132166","playParams":{"id":"1782132166","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782132166/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1324870952","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1324870952?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741300368309,"RTCI":0}}},"1782159448":{"id":"1782159448","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782159448?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rebecca-black/426285675","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6d/a0/07/6da007a3-f200-0cfa-5a13-2385f4d80cdf/Jobf4b12a4c-a209-4945-b0ad-73df63412bb7-182008993-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_355991702_1995821089-Time1734559618140.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","171109"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"354558"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"262728","textColor2":"171109","textColor4":"2d2a28","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"354558","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/f7/a0/16f7a024-deff-4af6-8b25-717f10e418ce/c0d05837-3037-4842-a103-27fc7685d2fc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dad0b0","textColor2":"f8cbb7","textColor4":"dab39d","textColor1":"f8f0ce","bgColor":"615236","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8c/87/f0/8c87f0c7-a766-ea27-dd2c-359a49ed8b35/Job64160b77-7bfd-4361-a3d4-95e521fed16e-182008992-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_355991703_1995821088-Time1734557172326.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","27190d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"354558"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"262929","textColor2":"27190d","textColor4":"3d342e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"354558","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2d/d1/e1/2dd1e13f-4f47-7563-54c9-66488fe9a473/dac444ce-f004-473f-8881-4bc36f067a7d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4dcdb","textColor2":"f9f5e7","textColor4":"d6d8d1","textColor1":"f6faf4","bgColor":"4a6377","hasP3":false}},"name":"SALVATION","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Rebecca Black","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b0/cb/b0/b0cbb07e-c9f2-ae87-fc2f-3a677034b65b/1963622671357_cover.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f2a26","textColor2":"351a0b","textColor4":"48362d","textColor1":"150c02","bgColor":"96a4b5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP and Interview","standard":"Rebecca Black continues to rewrite her myth in real time. Since becoming famous overnight as a teenager with her 2011 viral smash “Friday,” the Los Angeles singer has spent nearly a decade proving she’s more than a novelty. If her 2023 debut album, <i>Let Her Burn</i>, was an untamed exploration of sound, <i>SALVATION</i> is where she sharpens her vision. The EP’s title came to Black on a subway ride in London, sparking a fascination with salvation—not just as a religious concept, but as a personal reckoning. “<i>SALVATION</i> is based around this idea of letting some of the less-safe, less-poised, less-sweet versions of myself into my world,” she tells Apple Music. She amplifies, and sometimes even embraces, those once-buried versions of herself with newfound fearlessness, declaring on the title track, “I love being disgusting,” before a defiant retort: “I don’t need you to save me/I already saved myself.”\n\nLeaning into Black’s self-described “unhinged” instincts also unlocked bolder production choices, from layering a perky chorus over walloping techno on “Sugar Water Cyanide” to the whip-cracking, laser-strobing rave of “TRUST!” Yet, for all its bravado, <i>SALVATION</i> also demands a deeper vulnerability. “Tears in My Pocket” finds intimacy in fragility, while “Do You Even Think About Me?” digs into unresolved heartbreak. Where the latter lingers in longing, “Twist the Knife” bites back, its sweeping orchestration fueling Black at her most vengeful and dramatic. “As I was letting these more dangerous parts of myself be shown, it almost felt like a protective mechanism,” she says. “Because if I make it larger than it is, it feels less naked.” Read on as Black breaks down <i>SALVATION</i>’s core tracks.\n\n<b>“Salvation”</b>\n“It felt really energizing to explore this really sexy, really unafraid, very direct version of myself that I hadn’t before. The song is all about taking ownership of the version of yourself you are, regardless of whether anybody else understands. I like juxtaposition. There’s a bit of rapping happening—that, against a super melodic, ultra-harmonized chorus that feels to-the-bones of the pop that I grew up with in the mid-2010s, was really nostalgic for me. It felt right, given it’s basically a song about being gay as fuck.”\n\n<b>“TRUST!”</b>\n“‘TRUST!’ felt daring. It felt like the least seriously I had ever taken myself. Genuinely, if I had known three years ago that I would have a song where the chorus is, ‘Ooh, la la, get me going like ga ga ga,’ I would’ve been so afraid that people would’ve gone, ‘Is this bitch fucking stupid? She thinks she can do “Friday” and then do this, and we’re going to treat it seriously?’ That felt like a moment of freedom where there was something really exciting and invigorating. It felt like a banger instantly.”\n\n<b>“Sugar Water Cyanide”</b>\n“I forget what [co-writers Jesse Saint John, Nightfeelings] and I were listening to or how we landed on the idea, but it was the first time in a while that I had started writing a song without a lot of prior thought around it. I wanted to make something that felt really visceral, and really sexy, and really fun. I knew that I wanted to take a big risk sonically that day. We landed on this juxtaposition of this very sugary-sweet verse with this truly deathly chorus. It felt like the most emblematic version of me I could put in a song. Lyrically, it felt so fun to create an energy that wasn’t the story of meeting someone or an experience. It was just about a feeling and trying to put words to that in the most Rebecca way possible.”\n\n<b>“Tears in My Pocket”</b>\n“‘Tears’ felt like such an informative first song for the rest of the project. Something else I wanted to explore was minimalism and space and silence in songs. It was the first time I felt like I had successfully done that without losing energy, because I didn’t want [this project] to be soft. I wanted to create something bright and in your face, and that has the same level of impact—maybe even more—as a song that has a thousand elements of production. This was probably the first time I left a session on the day with an almost-finished song. That was also a big practice for me, learning not to touch whatever we first landed on.”","short":"The onetime viral star continues to rewrite her myth in real

Album","standard":"Buffalo producer ILL Tone Beats was never much for a producer tag. And it’s not because his sample-heavy beats are so immediately identifiable like those of, say, a Timbaland or Swizz Beatz. But the company Tone most frequently keeps—the MCs of Griselda Records and the Black Soprano Family collective—happen to have a way of announcing themselves in the space one might normally reserve for a producer tag (Cue Westside Gunn’s “Boom-Boom Boom-Boom!”).\n\nMaking a name for himself is hardly ILL Tone’s concern, though. He’s already an integral part of one of rap’s most inventive and exciting movements. He reaffirm this position across <i>The Outcome</i>, a project that features the very best of MCs like Benny the Butcher, Conway the Machine, Elcamino, Rome Streetz, and Flee Lord. Those are, of course, hometown heroes, but he’s also got an AZ verse and an interlude with Ghostface Killah talking crazy. So the people who actually need to know who ILL Tone is already do: They’re the ones he’s been making neoclassical hip-hop with for years now.","short":"ILL Tone Beats furthers his claim as one of the

Album","standard":"The Baltimore native spent his teenage years training to become an opera singer; later, he spent time in Philadelphia’s neo-soul scene and released his debut EP, 2016’s <i>blisters</i>, on the experimental electronic label Tri Angle. Since then, serpentwithfeet’s sacred/profane music has had the scope to take in his big ideas and sweeping influences, though his third album, 2024’s <i>GRIP</i>, nudged his “pagan gospel” music into much freakier territory. That album embraced turn-of-the-century R&B à la Timbaland and Darkchild to tell a strobe-lit love story that unfolded in the shadows of the club. A year later, the nine new tracks of <i>GRIP SEQUEL</i> showcase serpent at his most vulnerable (literally, in the case of “SEAGULL,” where he romps naked on the beach). “My heart, the ocean, mostly unexplored/My body, cold metal, longing to be forged,” he sings on the hushed, impressionistic “WANDERER.” That classical training shines through on “WRITHING IN THE WIND” over understated piano and a faint Jersey club beat, as he exhales, “A mangled heart writhing in the wind/Let me mend it.”","short":"Nine tracks that show a more vulnerable side of the 2024 “pagan gospel”

EP","standard":"The vocalist/DJ Blane Muise came of age in the South London club scene before debuting as Shygirl in 2016. In the years to follow, her bawdy blend of pop, rap, and forward-thinking electronics became beloved by club kids worldwide, though as her profile had risen, she’d admittedly grown disengaged from the scene herself. Her first <i>Club Shy</i> EP, released in February 2024, was a conscious return to the dance floor, with 15 euphoric minutes of pure serotonin release. A year later, <i>Club Shy Room 2</i> plays out like an after-party that finds Shygirl leaning further into her hip-hop and grime influences alongside a formidable girl gang. That includes reggaetón maverick Isabella Lovestory, R&B luminary Jorja Smith, and the California rapper Saweetie, who makes herself at home on the raunchy “Immaculate,” which the pair debuted last year on Charli xcx and Troye Sivan’s Sweat Tour. Indeed, in a post-<i>Brat</i> landscape, the intersection of pop and club music feels as vital as ever, but Shygirl’s been about this life.","short":"An after-party that leans into hip-hop and grime influences."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/club-shy-room-2-ep/1790433888","playParams":{"id":"1790433888","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790433888/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"456494592","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/456494592?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741371008203,"RTCI":0}}},"1790456398":{"id":"1790456398","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1790456398?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jason-isbell/254571412","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bd/42/5a/bd425a51-52c2-82d9-40a2-e7801d76e9b0/99c519eb-a616-4a8c-bdb5-0f68dbc1eed3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3bdb9","textColor2":"ebe7e6","textColor4":"bcb9b8","textColor1":"f4ede6","bgColor":"000002","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/20/e4/b1/20e4b138-5259-14e4-4652-8b5f3af4b1bd/653bebaf-5e43-42fb-961f-9de9ee3d7a88.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cca77c","textColor2":"f0c48e","textColor4":"caa579","textColor1":"f3c791","bgColor":"322b29","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/43/5f/20/435f2056-370c-2760-99f0-8d6bfcf5bf1e/dcfe4702-9227-4bec-9e38-1a5d2ff382f9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2a37f","textColor2":"f0bd8a","textColor4":"c49b72","textColor1":"eec89b","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false}},"name":"Foxes in the Snow","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Jason Isbell","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c7/78/9d/c7789d58-674c-5e75-fac5-81606c952f82/199066511251.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"aba290","textColor2":"cdaa7f","textColor4":"a48866","textColor1":"d6cab4","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Released in the wake of his divorce from singer-songwriter Amanda Shires, 2025’s <i>Foxes in the Snow</i> is Jason Isbell’s first solo acoustic album, and his first album without The 400 Unit since his 2013 breakthrough <i>Southeastern</i>.

Invigorated by touring life, Godwin dreamt up a handful of new tunes to follow his acclaimed 2023 record <i>Family Ties</i>, writing while on the road and recording what would become this EP with bandmate Al Torrence. The tracks serve as a snapshot of Godwin’s evolving artistry, retaining the vivid and thoughtful perspective of earlier material while exploring more narrative forms of storytelling.\n\nThe EP opens with its title track, a sketch of rural romantic longing with an understated, dynamic vocal. Godwin gets an assist from Ernest on “Dead To Rights,” a yearning love song about unexpected romance, with gently dizzying guitars mimicking the disorientation that comes with falling hard and fast. Closing out the EP is the Scott Avett (The Avett Brothers) collaboration “Hammer Down,” a touching cover of the 2005 <i>What Comes After the Blues</i> cut by Magnolia Electric Co., a project of the late, beloved songwriter Jason Molina, whose influence is felt across this understated collection. Godwin and Avett hew closely to the raw spirit of the original on their tribute, fleshing out the arrangement with piano and a rhythm section without sacrificing the song’s vital intimacy.","short":"Seven songs from the road that explore vivid, narrative storytelling."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonely-mountain-town-ep/1792333248","playParams":{"id":"1792333248","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792333248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1441994025","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1441994025?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741371428279,"RTCI":0}}},"1792459444":{"id":"1792459444","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792459444?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cordelia/1693073467","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"everything hurts (i love you)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Cordelia","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/1d/4a/aa1d4a77-b245-82b7-ef3f-eb38b2f1b0cf/199066592847.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfbbb6","textColor2":"cdcbc4","textColor4":"aaa8a1","textColor1":"e7e3dd","bgColor":"221a17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything-hurts-i-love-you/1792459444","playParams":{"id":"1792459444","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1EhPMK0IEVLDQ3uby7GtWS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792459444/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1693073467","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1693073467?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741370248344,"RTCI":0}}},"1792545383":{"id":"1792545383","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792545383?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fridayy/1491583681","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/34/44/19/344419c8-81a2-4adf-ceeb-af8abd3e5427/Job90d3b282-5c9b-4938-947d-1e30427b12a8-186909049-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_365755699_2070082920-Time1740689988261.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cabbb4"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"aca090","textColor2":"cabbb4","textColor4":"a39c94","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/25/57/ab2557e6-5763-829e-2e66-7660b4e79ed2/bb737910-b24a-43cf-a49e-763129bdfff2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a6a5ab","textColor2":"cda898","textColor4":"a7897d","textColor1":"cccad1","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/84/69/198469d6-5e33-6bb5-a77a-104fea22d883/Jobeba55931-5e7f-4b90-adda-a447859e866c-186909050-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_365755698_2070082921-Time1740691502162.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cbc1aa"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"aba99a","textColor2":"cbc1aa","textColor4":"a4a18d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b8/de/58/b8de5858-81fa-f165-5dda-77eaa424e2f1/5adc0dc4-2734-481a-86c2-d4e10e06efb2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cac7be","textColor2":"c5f4db","textColor4":"a6cfb9","textColor1":"f2eae0","bgColor":"293c34","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/29/c8/66/29c866c1-c761-ef70-9215-149e86c55ed0/94be33bc-3cdf-4e86-9995-ab178474fe77.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"7ca6b4","textColor2":"82bdd0","textColor4":"6897a6","textColor1":"9cd0e1","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Some Days I’m Good, Some Days I’m Not","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Fridayy","artwork":{"width":5000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b8/4b/51/b84b512d-9e6f-4c35-2194-e143ac41aa34/25UMGIM05457.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5000,"textColor3":"bec1be","textColor2":"cec1a9","textColor4":"a5a18c","textColor1":"ede9e8","bgColor":"032119","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Philadelphia-hailing singer, songwriter, and producer Fridayy has been anything but short of work since performing a song-making chorus on DJ Khaled’s devotional 2022 hit “GOD DID.” Besides releasing his self-titled debut in 2023, Fridayy worked with Chris Brown, GloRilla, Polo G, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Tee Grizzley, and even Will Smith, to name but a few. Yet “GOD DID” is what the general public knows him for. It’s a powerful song with equally powerful collaborators (Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, JAY-Z, John Legend), but with <i>Some Days I’m Good, Some Days I’m Not</i>, one of hip-hop’s favorite chorus artists is out to prove there’s plenty more to love.\n\nLike the voice of Fridayy himself, <i>Some Days I’m Good, Some Days I’m Not</i> is both inherently gospel and R&B, the singer splitting his time between devotions to significant other and to higher power. You can hear how enamored he is with a particular woman’s body on “Baddest in the Room,” but then also about how grateful he is for his gifts on “Look to You.” He yearns to inspire on songs like “Sun Comes Down,” “Desert,” and “Better Days,” while tracks like “Shotgun,” “Saving My Love,” and “One Call Away” exist very clearly to make hearts flutter. The project’s 21 tracks present a surprisingly harmonious dichotomy, one that Fridayy distills on “February ’23,” when he raps, “We at the club, they shaking ass while we give God the glory.”","short":"Get to know the “GOD DID” singer for what else he can do."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/some-days-im-good-some-days-im-not/1792545383","playParams":{"id":"1792545383","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6CyD8cVpx9f8uJT9ZpJHRG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792545383/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1491583681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1491583681?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741345976598,"RTCI":0}}},"1792666546":{"id":"1792666546","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792666546?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lady-gaga/277293880","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b3/10/b8/b310b881-11d0-5022-2778-2aa1fa3ee34b/Job24a69080-f65d-4603-8c4a-d62937049df2-187464329-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366977505_2078765147-Time1741331326345.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c8c8c8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"c8c8c8","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a3/a1/aa/a3a1aa8c-4624-fff5-3604-45a7df0ba9f3/7fd7d818-cd12-4920-86bb-6d6eee2aaec7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d5d5d5","textColor2":"e9e9e9","textColor4":"cbcbcb","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"525152","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/85/96/e5/8596e5c9-ea5d-f074-14ab-0def74d49a41/Job55a60f4d-834e-43b4-b0ac-bc65708cbd78-187464330-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366977506_2078765148-Time1741332248310.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cecece","textColor2":"dadada","textColor4":"b8b8b8","textColor1":"f6f6f6","bgColor":"2f2f2f","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/e4/d4/88/e4d4887f-7a84-a450-7947-c93d5eec002f/2da1ab3c-ed37-414b-be4b-7c469524ab55.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d4d4","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"cdcdcd","textColor1":"f6f6f6","bgColor":"4d4c4c","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f1/50/a0/f150a02f-4df5-b12b-7b7f-e61588e591cb/7d31d60b-173a-43dd-934c-bb0f477f8b8b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"242322","textColor2":"141312","textColor4":"2c2c2c","textColor1":"0a0806","bgColor":"8e9091","hasP3":false}},"name":"MAYHEM","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Lady Gaga","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/11/d1/be11d187-1aeb-99f3-01c5-597ed65cdb6a/25UMGIM07433.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d0d0","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"bdbdbd","textColor1":"f7f7f7","bgColor":"353535","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“That is who Lady Gaga is to me,” Lady Gaga tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of creating <i>MAYHEM</i>. “Maybe to someone else, it might be the Meat Dress or something that I did that they remember as me. But for me, I always want to be remembered for being a real artist and someone that cares so much.” In that vein, Gaga set out to make her latest album—which she calls her “favorite record in a long time”—its own thing. “<i>ARTPOP</i> was a vibe. <i>Joanne</i> was a sound. <i>Chromatica</i> had a sound. All different. <i>The Fame Monster</i> was more chaotic. <i>The Fame</i> was theatrical pop. <i>Born This Way</i>, to me, had more of a metal/electro New York vibe to it,” she says. “I actually made the effort making <i>MAYHEM</i> to not do that and not try to give my music an outfit, but instead to allow myself to be influenced by everything.”\n\nIndeed, <i>MAYHEM</i> traverses—and oftentimes melds—the various flavors of Mother Monster’s career, from the disco scene of her earliest work to her singer-songwriter era and back again. The opening tracks, singles “Disease” and “Abracadabra,” revisit dance-floor Gaga to thrilling fanfare. The spirited “Garden of Eden” follows the trend of what she calls “2000 throwbacks.” With its sparkly synths, “LoveDrug” might be seen as the brighter and shinier elder sibling of her early cut “LoveGame.” She even specifically admits the “electro-grunge influence” seeps its way in—especially apparent in “Perfect Celebrity,” “Vanish into You,” and “The Beast.” The latter even shows shades of <i>Joanne</i>, but “Blade of Grass” and her Bruno Mars duet “Die with a Smile” really put her former folk-pop-rock persona on display.\n\nIt’s also all incredibly personal to her. “The album is a series of gothic dreams,” she says. “I say it’s like images of the past that haunt me, and they somehow find their way into who I am today.” Below, Gaga takes us through several tracks, in her own words.\n\n<b>“Abracadabra”</b>\n“I think I didn’t want to make this kind of music for a long time, even though I had it in me. And I think ‘Abracadabra’ is very much my sound—something that I honed in [on] after many years, and I wanted to do it again. I felt like being stagnant was just death in my artistry. And I just really wanted to constantly be a student. Not just reinvent myself, but learn something new with every record. And that wasn’t always what people wanted from me, but that’s what I wanted from me. And it’s the thing that I’m the most probably proud of, if I look back on my career, is I know how much I grew from record to record and how authentic it all was. The thing that was most important to me was being a student of music, above everything else.”\n\n<b>“Perfect Celebrity”</b>\n“It’s super angry: ‘I’ve become a notorious being/Find my clone, she’s asleep on the ceiling.’ It’s almost comical, this idea that any time I’m in the room with anyone, there’s me—Stefani—and Lady Gaga asleep on the ceiling, and I have to figure out which body to be in. It’s kind of intense, but that song, that was an important song on this album because it didn’t feel honest to me on <i>MAYHEM</i> to exclude something that had that kind of anger in it because then it felt like I was trying to be a good girl or whatever and be something that I’m not actually. Part of my personal mayhem is that I have joy and celebration, but I’m also sometimes angry or super sad or really celebratory or completely insecure and have no confidence.”\n\n<b>“Shadow of a Man”</b>\n“That song is so much a response to my career and what it always felt like to be the only girl in the room a lot of the time. And to always be standing in the shadow of a man because there were so many around me that I learned how to dance in that shadow.”\n\n<b>“The Beast”</b>\n“In that record, it is me or someone singing to their lover who’s a werewolf, but what I believe about this is, this record is also about [my fiancé] Michael [Polansky] and I, and that this song is also about me and being Lady Gaga. What the beast is, who I become when I’m onstage, and who I am when I make my art and the prechorus of that song is, ‘You can’t hide who you are. 11:59, your heart’s racing, you’re growling, and we both know why.’ It’s like somebody that is saying to the beast, ‘I know you’re a monster, but I can handle you, and I love you.’”\n\n<b>“Blade of Grass”</b>\n“Michael asked me how I would want him to propose to me one day. We were in our backyard, and I said, ‘Just take a blade of grass and wrap it around my finger,’ and then I wrote ‘Blade of Grass’ because I remembered the way his face looked, and I remembered the grass in the backyard, and I remember thinking he should use that really long grass that’s in the center of the backyard. Those moments, to me, at a certain point I was into the idea of fame and artifice and being the conductor of your own life when it came to your own inner sense of fame. I had to fight a lot harder to make music and dance a little bit later into my career because my life became so different that I didn’t have as much life around me to inspire me.”","short":"“It’s a series of gothic dreams”: Gaga invites MAYHEM into your life."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mayhem/1792666546","playParams":{"id":"1792666546","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MHUaRi9OCyTN02SoyRRBJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792666546/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"277293880","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/277293880?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741370692644,"RTCI":0}}},"1792810282":{"id":"1792810282","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792810282?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jim-jones/16668076","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/68/6c/9d/686c9d8b-6411-ce40-244c-d32d5bec608d/1c6774ea-b9fa-4a4c-9c07-6a1e1d9b6101.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a39693","textColor2":"c9b39d","textColor4":"a39280","textColor1":"c9b9b4","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false}},"name":"At the Church Steps","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Jim Jones","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fa/4c/57/fa4c5766-9926-7b73-aadd-b8f782f5ed05/cover_4062851108799.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8cbd4","textColor2":"f3b1b2","textColor4":"c58e9d","textColor1":"f6fdf6","bgColor":"0e024c","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Two decades into his career, Jim Jones finds himself exactly where he expected to be. Back up to 2004, when Jones was riding high as a member of Cam’ron’s Dipset crew, the Bronx MC unleashed his solo debut, <i>On My Way to Church</i>. On his eighth solo album, 2025’s <i>At the Church Steps</i>, he’s finally arrived. Sure, enough time has passed between the two records to raise a human from birth to legal drinking age, but Jones sounds in vintage form. The line from his debut to its spiritual sequel is nearly straight: On opener “Jomo” he travels on back to mid-2000s Harlem, where The Diplomats made their name, cueing up a soul-heavy vocal chop courtesy of Statik Selektah. It’s a beat that would have sounded nice on <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i> from 2003. On the cut and throughout the album, he’s contemplative, celebratory, and mournful in equal doses. On that opener, he raps, “I done put so much work in, I could have died on the job.” Despite it all, the blessings remain bountiful for one of New York’s perennial rap figures.","short":"A spiritual

Album","standard":"G-DRAGON (aka Kwon Ji-yong, or 권지용) is often called the “King of K-Pop” for his massive influence on the industry, both as a member of BIGBANG and as a solo rapper and artist. Debuting as a member of one of K-pop’s most successful groups of all time in 2006, G-DRAGON would go on to become a celebrated songwriter and performer, a fashion icon, and a global symbol of Korea’s music industry. When G-DRAGON made his solo debut in 2009 with <i>Heartbreaker</i>, it became the best-selling album by a Korean soloist at the time.\n\n<i>Übermensch</i> is G-DRAGON’s third solo studio album, coming more than a decade after his last full-length album, 2013’s <i>Coup d’Etat</i>. While <i>Übermensch</i> may be G-DRAGON’s solo outing, it begins with “HOME SWEET HOME,” a raucous pop-rock track featuring BIGBANG co-members TAEYANG and DAESUNG and dedicated to the group’s fans. Elsewhere on the album, G-DRAGON taps Anderson .Paak (“TOO BAD”), Nile Rodgers (“TAKE ME”), and LunchMoney Lewis (“GYRO-DROP”) as musical collaborators.\n\nDrawing inspiration and its name from the 1883 work <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, <i>Übermensch</i> is G-DRAGON’s attempt to transcend his previous efforts as a musical artist. It’s a tall order, given G-DRAGON's expansive, pioneering musical work leading up to the release of the 2025 album, though one the Korean artist seems up for in <i>Übermensch</i>. “A limited edition of the second generation, a masterpiece of the century,” G-DRAGON raps in self-assured “POWER.” “Do not waste your time, yeah, it’s gotta be me/Prove ’em all wrong, I’ve got all the receipts.”","short":"The BIGBANG member and “King of K-Pop” aims for a

Album","standard":"Jennie Kim debuted as a K-pop performer in BLACKPINK in 2016 and released her first solo song, the finger-snapping “Solo,” two years later. But it wasn’t until her debut solo album, 2025’s <i>Ruby</i>, that she got a more profound chance to self-reflect through her music. “The greatest part of this solo project for me was that I had time with myself,” JENNIE tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I really got to dig deep inside of who I am and what I am.”\n\nThe 15-track, primarily English-language album was JENNIE’s first music release since leaving YG Entertainment as a soloist to launch her own label, Odd Atelier, and it’s a declaration of her musical identity as a solo singer and rapper. The album’s name, <i>Ruby</i>, is a reference to the alter ego (Jennie Ruby Jane) that the musician created for herself when she moved to New Zealand by herself as a child to learn English. “When I was like 11,” she says, “I knew that I wanted to create this identity for myself, like ‘Jennie’ wasn't doing justice for me, and I was like, ‘I want a longer name.’”\n\nThe persona has carried over into adulthood and her creative expression on <i>Ruby</i>. From the hip-hop-driven swagger of tracks like “like JENNIE,” “ExtraL,” and “Damn Right” to confessional-style songs like “F.T.S.,” “twin,” and “start a war,” JENNIE opens up about fame, protecting the ones she loves, and staying true to herself. She taps an eclectic cadre of established and rising Western musicians for help, including Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis (“Damn Right”), Doechii (“ExtraL”), Dominic Fike (“Love Hangover”), FKJ (“JANE”), and Dua Lipa (“Handlebars”). “Now, I'm not afraid to challenge myself,” JENNIE says of what she learned in the album-creation process. “Understanding my value was the biggest lesson.”","short":"The BLACKPINK star offers a declaration of her musical identity."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ruby/1795979743","playParams":{"id":"1795979743","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1vWMw6pu3err6qqZzI3RhH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795979743/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"913944","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/913944?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741372049239,"RTCI":0}}},"1796056421":{"id":"1796056421","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796056421?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chace/207633892","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/13/12/23/1312232d-8dc7-2a11-0a39-d888531d7b12/e70a2f8f-643c-409b-83a8-fd0ae963fc5a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"869cd0","textColor2":"83a4fa","textColor4":"6f8ace","textColor1":"a0bbfd","bgColor":"1f2120","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/1d/67/60/1d676002-dae0-3fb5-b397-1168977f569b/f3677023-0d7c-402c-ba9e-f95873d0e96f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"708bce","textColor2":"648df1","textColor4":"5575c5","textColor1":"87a8fc","bgColor":"161717","hasP3":false}},"name":"Anti-People Pleaser, Pt. 1 - EP","artistName":"Chace","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5c/48/79/5c487992-6236-f56a-f5f1-3c8c6c57f784/4099964157796.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"27231c","textColor2":"1f170f","textColor4":"362d20","textColor1":"0c0a0a","bgColor":"928767","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","short":"The first half of a high-key electronic pop debut from the Chinese artist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anti-people-pleaser-pt-1-ep/1796056421","playParams":{"id":"1796056421","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796056421/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"207633892","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/207633892?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1741371196784,"RTCI":0}}},"1796056431":{"id":"1796056431","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796056431?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-02-28","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/koe-wetzel/1139953953","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Live from the Damn Near Normal Tour","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Koe Wetzel","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2a/30/2f/2a302f2b-45c5-8f47-7f45-7630da485e3f/196872866087.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3b3b","textColor2":"2f2f2f","textColor4":"505050","textColor1":"151515","bgColor":"d5d5d5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A Koe Wetzel show must be seen to be believed, but this 13-track collection of performances from the rough-and-tumble country star’s Damn Near Normal Tour is still a potent listen for those looking to enjoy Wetzel’s electric live energy at home.

Then four studio albums into her career, the country singer-songwriter had long since proven herself, and took a chance on rawer, more personal material in the wake of her 2022 divorce. As this follow-up attests, that heightened vulnerability unlocked new creative depths for Ballerini. Her most sonically diverse release yet, <i>PATTERNS</i> is also the fullest embodiment of Ballerini’s capabilities. Ballerini co-produced the album alongside previous collaborator Alysa Vanderheym, a songwriter and producer who has worked with a bevy of Nashville artists, including Jelly Roll, Little Big Town, and The Cadillac Three. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a gauzy, pleading midtempo ballad that makes use of more traditional country instruments like mandolin and dobro alongside prominent synthesizers, for production that’s reminiscent of Kacey Musgraves’ <i>Golden Hour</i>. “Sorry Mom” is especially potent, with Ballerini confronting a laundry list of filial indiscretions—a “lack of stickin’ to the Bible,” an abandoned college degree—before acknowledging, “I turned out all right.” “Beg for Your Love” is gentle but confident, as Ballerini takes stock of what she deserves in a relationship, like “a kiss” or “a morning call.” Other highlights include the Noah Kahan collaboration “Cowboys Cry Too” and the moody and melodic “Deep.”","short":"Ballerini’s 2024 LP gets the deluxe

Album","standard":"The lead rapper and main dancer in K-pop girl group BLACKPINK, Thai member LISA rose to worldwide fame as the first non-Korean artist at YG Entertainment. In 2021, she made her solo debut with the two-track release <i>LALISA</i>, finding particular success with swagger-driven “MONEY.” The song boasts of LISA’s exorbitant, idol-built wealth, a theme that continues on follow-up album <i>Alter Ego</i>. The 2025 collection marks a new chapter in LISA’s career, as it was the first released after she left YG Entertainment as a solo artist and launched management company Lloud.\n\nAs is the case with many K-pop releases, <i>Alter Ego</i> is not just an album—it’s an entire concept. For her solo album debut, LISA slips into five different comic booklike personalities (Roxi, Kiki, Vixi, Sunni, and Speedi), each with their own backstory, look, and dedicated album track. On “Rockstar” (Roxi) and “Lifestyle” (Speedi), LISA boasts about life as a global pop star, while “FXCK UP THE WORLD” (Vixi) allows the superstar a chance to play the villain: “Walked in causing havoc/Yes, that is a habit.” The romantic, France-set “Moonlit Floor” (Sunni) samples Sixpence None the Richer’s 1998 hit “Kiss Me,” swapping “beneath the milky twilight” for “under the Paris twilight.”\n\nThe high-concept framework doesn’t keep LISA from collaborating. The Kiki-inspired “New Woman” sees her teaming up with Spanish superstar ROSALÍA for airy electropop empowerment, while British singer-songwriter RAYE and American rapper Doja Cat are on board for the disco-infused, ’80s-inspired breakup track “Born Again.” LISA taps South African singer Tyla for “When I’m with You,” American rapper Megan Thee Stallion for one of two album versions of “Rapunzel,” and American rapper Future for one of two album versions of “FXCK UP THE WORLD.” The result makes for an album that, while grounded in the K-pop industry and crafted by a Thai artist, feels even more culturally expansive.","short":"The BLACKPINK star’s solo debut is culturally and conceptually

is a restless talent—a prodigiously accomplished DJ and in-demand producer who has achieved fame while still in his teens. The son of a musician, Chace learned to drum at just two years of age—a gift he later honed at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. After graduating, he pursued electronic music full-time. His style embraces elements of the past, present and future, incorporating underground house, UK garage and skittering trap with old-school funk and ripples of disco. Already a star in his native China, he has made inroads into the global dance scene and performed at the world-renowned electronic festival Tomorrowland."},"artwork":{"width":1294,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/AMCArtistImages211/v4/b5/77/34/b57734b7-b850-a923-0393-4c8292c54c8a/ami-identity-67060d2fba0ae1df4a08da13448d8e86-2025-03-07T07-46-24.697Z_cropped.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1294,"textColor3":"a3a182","textColor2":"d3bd9d","textColor4":"ac9b81","textColor1":"c8c59e","bgColor":"101010","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chace/207633892"}},"215465914":{"id":"215465914","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/215465914?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["Soundtrack"],"name":"Volker
