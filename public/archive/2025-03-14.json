Silver Screen</i>, the singer stamps out one of the oldest clichés in the book. Over shuffling hi-hats and a rubbery bassline she sings, “Whoever said that it’s better to have loved and to lost/Than to not have loved at all/Should just shut up forever.” Alongside co-producers Rostam and Jenn Decilveo, the LA-based indie rock star takes aim at the lovers and lust-hungry obsessives throughout. On “Love Makes You Do Crazy Things,” guitars screech and shout before SASAMI rolls through with a metal-worthy solo during the introduction. “Bet it all on you, now I gotta leave town,” she sings, exposing the dark underbelly that exists beneath the surface of pop music’s romanticism. The album finds her moving away from the experimental songwriting of previous records like 2022’s <i>Squeeze</i>, instead turning in a streamlined and diamond-sharp ode to the parts of love that suck.","short":"Her third album is a diamond-sharp ode to the parts of love that suck."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4b/59/ad/4b59ad6e-3977-2f82-82a2-059bb4b40169/887828053568.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcdcd","textColor2":"e1e1e1","textColor4":"bebebe","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"303030","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blood-on-the-silver-screen/1765309413","playParams":{"id":"1765309413","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6jfOmBdOak7W53fjqGfgMH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1765309413/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1437464884","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1437464884?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741948349762}}},"1770797771":{"id":"1770797771","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770797771?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mia-wray/892496456","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e4/59/8d/e4598d23-0572-7f67-1e43-90c352fd6c74/Job7a835c85-14d0-4f2d-bec7-7fea0f6cb33e-187884479-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367881927_2085347409-Time1741876764844.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","040101"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5b5d47"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"1e1b15","textColor2":"040101","textColor4":"1e1b15","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5b5d47","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/16/b3/18/16b31859-5079-c468-4d01-c693c097ef81/Job422ccb94-fa44-45e3-b158-d4573fb6e05b-187884480-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367881806_2085347410-Time1741877677870.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","14090a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"5b5d47"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"1e1c16","textColor2":"14090a","textColor4":"2c221d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"5b5d47","hasP3":false}},"name":"hi, it's nice to meet me","artistName":"Mia Wray","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The incredible intimacy of Mia Wray’s debut album is clear from the opening title track. Detailing the discovery of her queer identity, the Queensland songwriter rejoices in finally coming face to face with her true self. A musically snappy co-write with G Flip and Aidan Hogg, the song exemplifies the autobiographical, lyric-driven pop that Wray does so well. That theme of personal affirmation recurs throughout the album, with “Get Out My Way” seeing her take up the reins of her own fate and “Not the Same as Yesterday” celebrating the best sex she’s ever had and waking up next to the love of her life. The strength of new love also powers “What If” and the clubby outlier “The Way She Moves,” on which Wray goes full disco diva. Several ballads recount the gradual journey of showing herself to the world at large (“Fake a Smile,” “Everybody Knows”), while Wray has described “Not Enough” as a proper gay-awakening anthem. “Even if it breaks my heart/I wanna hold your hand/Don’t wanna hide who I am,” she sings during the heartland-sized chorus, before driving it home with a handclapped breakdown.","short":"The young songwriter celebrates queer love and self-affirmation."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/35/df/61/35df61f1-5b93-febe-c7cb-5e760b556165/24SYMIM15510.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1f1c16","textColor2":"170709","textColor4":"2e201c","textColor1":"040101","bgColor":"888768","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hi-its-nice-to-meet-me/1770797771","playParams":{"id":"1770797771","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5bVSpRtlZwFwDAd6G7Siav"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1770797771/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"892496456","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/892496456?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741950416677}}},"1773845877":{"id":"1773845877","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773845877?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sun-ra/72824","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/81/24/a2/8124a289-3ed5-a35d-2629-135896570b31/e53af9b1-bb23-446e-8fe5-ef6bcfd4341b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2b6b2","textColor2":"e4bbb2","textColor4":"ba9995","textColor1":"eddfd6","bgColor":"14111f","hasP3":false}},"name":"Uncharted Passages","artistName":"Sun Ra","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ff/05/86/ff0586fc-e17c-4dfe-418d-54365e42b16c/107828.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"373730","textColor2":"181c19","textColor4":"414038","textColor1":"0c100f","bgColor":"e3d1b3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/uncharted-passages/1773845877","playParams":{"id":"1773845877","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1zqyNSERUszQpi0F8vHbvs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1773845877/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"72824","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/72824?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741923215267}}},"1776734584":{"id":"1776734584","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1776734584?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coheed-and-cambria/15031628","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/64/73/b0/6473b081-693d-af50-6225-6eed9eab99cb/53ba8496-63d2-48b3-b7be-20d2bfe1d7ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"27292b","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"2d3133","textColor1":"0d0c0b","bgColor":"909fad","hasP3":false}},"name":"The Father of Make Believe","artistName":"Coheed and Cambria","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“It won’t get any easier as I start to get old,” Coheed and Cambria godhead Claudio Sanchez sings on “Yesterday’s Lost,” the nearly hymnal opening track to <i>The Father of Make Believe</i>. Indeed, the long-running emo-prog band’s 10th studio album has a personal and reflective quality that comes with watching the world change around you as the years go by. The fists-in-the-air anthem “Meri of Mercy” is a tribute to his late grandparents, while the tender acoustic ballad “Corner My Confidence” is a highly romantic zoom-in that Sanchez composed during the band’s second S.S. Neverender cruise in 2023.\n\nBut don’t mistake these sentimental moments as a sign that Coheed and Cambria’s ambition has slowed, as <i>The Father of Make Believe</i> is as forceful of a rock record as anything else in their discography. As evidenced on the pedal-to-the-metal “Goodbye, Sunshine” and the pounding “Someone Who Can,” they’re making rock music for the cosmos here, taking their listeners into uncharted territory as always, while delivering the melodic gifts that they’ve been blessed with since the very beginning.","short":"The emo-prog vets get reflective on their 10th album."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d3/0f/8e/d30f8ee7-d4b3-8027-d9a3-b0b41a8ad85c/00198704213359_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"54262d","textColor2":"351019","textColor4":"5c282f","textColor1":"2a0e16","bgColor":"fc898b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-father-of-make-believe/1776734584","playParams":{"id":"1776734584","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7fj1TOW6bJglJWQ8MqxNUH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1776734584/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"15031628","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15031628?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741950093366}}},"1779147456":{"id":"1779147456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1779147456?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/spiritbox/1293047384","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/df/63/3c/df633ca8-83b7-69fe-5e9a-7bd549183647/Jobf60ac43e-28c3-42c0-b2ca-8b1a07e0868a-185124265-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362167949_2042999567-Time1738693036579.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","edeaef"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"121113"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cfcfcf","textColor2":"edeaef","textColor4":"c1bfc3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121113","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/34/c1/8f/34c18f54-d9a9-7624-fc1c-25ae71801c14/8fe77fa6-de89-48e6-917d-1fd793c82da9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"afafaf","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"202020","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0c/72/ef/0c72ef1e-3db8-9b0f-ab40-9937a3853d32/Job56a099e6-b1ef-4856-bab0-880a6bd282b4-185124264-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362167948_2042999568-Time1738691696524.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cfcfcf","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"cfcfcf","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"131113","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/e0/6a/f5/e06af545-0b33-2a9e-9aa4-b046fa42b700/4e588ee1-dc46-4690-94e0-c9d7a23da165.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b8c5b8","textColor2":"d8e9d8","textColor4":"b8c5b8","textColor1":"d8e9d8","bgColor":"363637","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/57/fe/e4/57fee421-704a-014a-af15-f944e9d2a62d/3a81a77b-8f8d-448d-b573-beab602d478c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3c3c3","textColor2":"f0f0f0","textColor4":"c3c3c3","textColor1":"f0f0f0","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false}},"name":"Tsunami Sea","artistName":"Spiritbox","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"For their second album, Canadian metalcore phenoms Spiritbox found inspiration at home. In fact, vocalist Courtney LaPlante and guitarist Mike Stringer’s home island of Victoria, British Columbia, <i>was</i> the inspiration. “When we were trying to get this band off the ground, we were feeling really stuck and hopeless,” LaPlante tells Apple Music. “I was thinking back to that time, and it brought back this subconscious dread, because we’re near all the scary tectonic plates on the West Coast. Since we were little kids, everyone’s been telling us about how ‘the big one’ is coming.”\n\nOf course, a massive earthquake at sea would cause a massive tsunami. “A tsunami is a horrible natural disaster that can’t be helped, but imagine if the entire ocean was a tsunami, not just one small part of it,” LaPlante offers. “It felt like such an over-the-top, perfect example of the drama you feel when you’re depressed. And that was my mental state at the time. But even saying I was depressed is embarrassing to me because I’ve achieved the life I’ve always wanted to achieve, so it feels like a moral failing to be depressed. In that way, the album became a score for my life.” Below, she comments on each song.\n\n<b>“Fata Morgana”</b>\n“When Michael and [producer] Dan [Braunstein] were making this at our house, I was frantically cleaning the bathroom while our puppy was taking a nap, because I knew I only had about 30 minutes before he’d wake up. But I could hear everything they were doing, and Michael just started playing this hypnotizing riff. Right away, I knew it was the intro track and the mission statement for the whole record. I started writing in my head right there in the bathroom. I thought, ‘My god, I cannot wait to walk out onstage to this song.’ The other fun fact about this one is that the vocal pattern was inspired by Busta Rhymes.”\n\n<b>“Black Rainbow”</b>\n“One of the reasons I wanted to call this song ‘Black Rainbow’ is because the director [Panos Cosmatos] that made <i>Beyond the Black Rainbow</i> is from our island. He moved here as a teenager, like I did, and I’ve just always felt a bit of camaraderie with anyone that’s left the island—people like Pamela Anderson and Nelly Furtado. But that movie was very disturbing to me, and it’s basically about someone dropped into something where they become completely disoriented. Which is how I feel sometimes.”\n\n<b>“Perfect Soul”</b>\n“This song feels very pop to me, though I never intended it to be that way. It’s very sincere and dramatic. It’s a song about someone who’s kind of saying, ‘You’ve taken everything from me. There’s nothing more to take, so just leave me here.’ It’s a relationship that’s so far gone that there’s nothing we can do to repair it. Instead of having a traditional breakdown like we’d normally do, this one is cool because Michael uses an EBow on his guitar and takes a full minute to bend a note. It’s a bit of an homage to one of his favorite artists, Cloudkicker, and it’s one of my favorite parts of the album.”\n\n<b>“Keep Sweet”</b>\n“I moved to the island from Alabama when I was 15. In Alabama, I was around people that were very conservative and extremely traditional. More so than the friends I made in Canada, I think I was exposed to how religion is used to subjugate women. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of ‘keeping sweet,’ which is something that exists throughout different types of Christianity and other religions. It basically just means that women need to maintain their femininity, which in our society is softness, kindness, and empathy—but also humbleness and meekness. It’s kind of a mantra that’s repeated to us. We’re socialized to be complacent, which is what the song is about.”\n\n<b>“Soft Spine”</b>\n“I don’t really know the people that are part of my peer group. I don’t go to parties and meet people and hang out and stuff. But there’s so many nasty people in the music industry, and they probably know who I am, but they probably don’t know that I think they’re bad people and I don’t want to know them. This song is saying ‘fuck you’ to them. It’s my fantasy of having the leverage and power to negatively impact their wallets. I can’t beat anybody up or kick anyone’s ass, but the narrator in the song can, and they’re not scared to do it.”\n\n<b>“Tsunami Sea”</b>\n“I love this song so much. Before there were lyrics, I knew this one would be the title song. But I wanted to think of a more intimate reason for the album to be called <i>Tsunami Sea</i> that I could use for this song—rather than just the big, bold, theatrical idea of a natural disaster destroying everything. Here, it’s a metaphor to explain panic attacks or when you’re so sad and depressed and low, and you can’t stop crying. I thought about how many teardrops it would take to fill up a whole ocean of tsunamis. I’m using that to destroy everything and drown myself rather than deal with my problems.”\n\n<b>“A Haven with Two Faces”</b>\n“Conceptually, the haven with two faces is our town. It makes you unique and creative and different because you have to overcome a lot to get off the island and be an artist, but at the same time, it really hinders you because you just feel misunderstood. It’s extra weird living here because of the physical isolation combined with the normal isolation that you might feel. It’s got that small-town feeling, but then you can’t drive out of it. At the same time, it’s a beautiful place to grow up.”\n\n<b>“No Loss, No Love”</b>\n“On this song, I’m imagining a person in the middle of the ocean on a life raft. It’s after the tsunami has destroyed everything. They have no food, no drink. Everything they love is gone. But it’s the eye of the storm, so everything seems calm and safe. It’s like a person who feels secure in their mental health even though they stopped taking their medication. It’s that false clarity you feel when you’ve been deep, deep down and now all your endorphins and serotonin are shooting back up. The person on the raft thinks they see an abundant island, a safe place to get off, but it’s actually dangerous.”\n\n<b>“Crystal Roses”</b>\n“This is a gentler version of the scariness of ‘No Loss, No Love.’ You’re floating across the ocean, thinking, ‘Whatever will be will be.’ All these mystical elements of the supernatural world are beckoning the raft this way or that way. Michael wrote this because he wanted to make something completely out of left field, and the drum loop just put me in a trance. One of the things I’ve been wanting to do for a couple years now is to use a live formant to pitch my voice up and down in real time. I like it because it takes any gender out of my voice. Is it a guy? A girl? Is it me? You can’t tell.”\n\n<b>“Ride the Wave”</b>\n“When I heard Michael and Dan working on the chorus, I knew I had to get my Jimmy Eat World on. I love that band, but our bass player, Josh [Gilbert], is the ultra-mega Jimmy Eat World stan. When he joined the band, that’s one of the ways we really bonded. He knows all the lore, so I’ve learned more about Jimmy Eat World in the last two years than I had ever known in my life. One of the things I love about that band is that the harmony vocal is just as important as the melody. So, the chorus of this is my voice and Josh’s voice together, and the harmony isn’t just supportive.”\n\n<b>“Deep End”</b>\n“This song was originally called ‘Deep Dish.’ We wrote the first half years ago, when we were working on our <i>Rotoscope</i> EP. Afterwards, we went out and celebrated with deep-dish pizza at a spot down the road from the studio. Towards the end of the meal, we were like, ‘What are we going to name the song?’ We looked at our food and agreed: ‘Deep Dish.’ And this song is the final goodbye for the album. It’s about a person making all these excuses for their own shortcomings, tying themselves down with it and admitting defeat. It’s a very sad song, but it’s uplifting musically. It’s got my favorite riff that Michael has ever made.”","short":"Canadian metalcore phenoms Spiritbox find inspiration at

WAY","artistName":"Dorothy","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When rock singer Dorothy Martin started thinking about her fourth album, she struggled to come up with a title. “I had no good ideas for what I was going to call it,” she tells Apple Music. “I was really beating my head against the wall. And the title is such an important part, so I prayed about it.” As many of her fans know, Martin became a person of faith while in rehab in 2020. “It’s very much tied to my recovery journey—doing a 12-step program and believing in a higher power,” she says. “One day I was reading the story of the Road to Damascus in the Bible, and it said that Saul was persecuting those who belonged to ‘the way.’ When I read those words, they just popped off the page. I got chills, and I even teared up. It just sounded so powerful.”\n\nShe immediately texted her producer, Scott Stevens, and her trusted group of songwriters known as the 4 Horsemen—Stevens, Blair Daly, Marti Frederiksen, and Zac Maloy—who have worked with the likes of Mick Jagger, Carrie Underwood, and Aerosmith. “I said, ‘Guys, I want to name the album <i>The Way</i>,’” she recalls. “‘I know we don’t even have a song yet, but that’s my final answer and I’m sticking to it.’” The result is an album that’s a little bit country and a little bit rock ’n’ roll—with plenty of religious fervor and a cameo from Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash thrown in for good measure. Below, Martin discusses each track.\n\n<b>“I COME ALIVE”</b>\n“The first rock ’n’ roll piece of music I remember hearing as a child was ‘The Great Gig in the Sky’ by Pink Floyd. There’s this epic, powerful, gospel-sounding female vocal in the beginning where she just lets loose. That’s what I was feeling here. When Scott isolated the strings on this song, I wanted to take people to church. I’m just wailing—there are no lyrics. I just let it rip for several bars, and Scott pieced it together. I don’t know if I can do it live. I’m going to give it the old college try, but we’ll see what happens.”\n\n<b>“THE DEVIL I KNOW”</b>\n“This is one of the heavier songs on the record. We put sirens and gunshots and chaos in the background because it’s about being in a fight—a spiritual fight. The first lyrics are, ‘It’s spiritual warfare, it’s a living nightmare,’ and I think everyone can relate to that in some way. You never know what someone’s going through. Everyone’s trials and tribulations are different, but we’re all in this human body having these experiences. It’s tough when you’re in that spot, but if you dig down deep inside yourself, there’s something that won’t let you fall all the way. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” \n\n<b>“MUD”</b>\n“That’s the first single we put out. It’s got a trap beat in there. Scott took his sweet time showing it to me because he wasn’t sure if I’d like it. But when he played it for me, I loved it. It’s the wild card of the album. It’s the craziest beat, but it somehow works. And the vocal delivery is all about swagger. It’s a hype-you-up kind of song. If I was on a sports team, I’d want to listen to that before I went out and played a game. It’s also the first time I’ve ever done a metal-type scream on a record. It was a magic moment in the studio, so we ran with it.”\n\n<b>“TOMBSTONE TOWN” (feat. Slash)</b>\n“I’m so glad Slash agreed to do this. I sent him several songs and said, ‘Take your pick.’ But I was hoping he’d choose this one because it just felt like the right fit with his aesthetic and his playing. The song itself is based on a true story about a really crappy betrayal. I’m a pretty forgiving person, but I got to channel my frustration into this song. When we shot the music video, you can tell the song is pretty angry. There’s another scream in there, too, because it’s all about revenge. But the bigger message is, ‘He’s not worth your time. Keep your head up and walk away.’” \n\n<b>“BONES”</b>\n“This is a personal favorite of mine. We were walking around the studio singing the chorus because it was stuck in all of our heads. So, it’s very catchy, but the message is beautiful. It’s about baptism and being reborn. And I love the way Scott was able to create this Southern Gothic landscape—you can see it in your mind when you’re listening to the music. I already have an idea for a video.”\n\n<b>“UNHOLY WATER”</b>\n“It’s very similar to ‘THE DEVIL I KNOW’ in the messaging. It’s got a real Southern rock feel with the slide guitar. It’s about a very traumatic experience from my earlier years in LA, when I was in my early twenties. When I look back at how I was feeling when I sang that, I can see that it’s basically another spiritual warfare type of song.”\n\n<b>“HAUNTED HOUSE”</b>\n“I wrote this with Kylie Sackley, Danny Myrick, Marti Frederiksen, and Scott Stevens in Nashville. It’s got a little more of a country twang to it, and it’s about deliverance. It’s about struggling with your personal demons. It’s about saying, ‘I know I messed up. I know I have issues.’ And it’s a cry for help. It’s like your head is the haunted house, and you can’t get out. Sometimes we tell ourselves scary stories, but I’ve learned that feelings are not facts, and this too shall pass. I’ve learned to take it one day at a time. Had I not gone through the things I had gone through, I wouldn’t be able to write a song like this.”\n\n<b>“PUTTIN’ OUT THE FIRE”</b>\n“I wrote this in Nashville with Scott Stevens and the awesome country singer Gavin Lucas. We wanted something with a little more of a Southern rock or country flair to it, and we did this in a day. I feel like it’s got a little bit of a pop element to it, but it’s still got those great guitars. I guess I’ve taken a page out of Taylor Swift’s book because I’ve been writing a lot of breakup songs, but hey—maybe they’ll help someone. It’s for the greater good.”\n\n<b>“SUPERHUMAN”</b>\n“It’s one of the first songs we wrote, and it has one of my favorite guitar riffs on the record. To me, it’s total ear candy. Again, I teamed up with the 4 Horsemen and Scott Stevens. It feels really big to me. It’s about being empowered and filled up with the Holy Spirit and being on a high that’s supernatural—that no drug, no person, and no worldly thing could ever give you. It’s got to come from a higher power, and that’s why it’s called ‘SUPERHUMAN.’ It’s like a love song to the creator of the universe. It’s another personal favorite of mine, and it feels good to listen to.”\n\n<b>“THE WAY”</b>\n“This song was a gift from Blair Daly. I didn’t have to do a dang thing. I gave him the title of the record, and he sat down at the piano and this came out. I started crying when I heard it. It feels like a love letter to our fans. It feels like I’m reaching my hand out to people who are struggling. They could be walking around looking completely normal, like nothing’s wrong, and you have no idea what they’re going through. And sometimes they need to hear a song that gets them to break and be vulnerable. It certainly did that to me in the studio. I’m glad it worked out, because it would’ve been strange to not have a song called ‘The Way’ on an album titled <i>The Way</i>.”","short":"A little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll, and plenty of religious fervor."},"artwork":{"width":3703,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/94/e8/c3/94e8c3b6-cd92-0758-4256-fc87cd2749f1/24UM1IM02453.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3703,"textColor3":"caae9d","textColor2":"decbaf","textColor4":"b6a68e","textColor1":"f7d5c1","bgColor":"17120e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-way/1780414484","playParams":{"id":"1780414484","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/358tJVvVgfUhwcjpLDnZPk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780414484/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"952845940","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/952845940?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741947450389}}},"1781871697":{"id":"1781871697","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781871697?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Contemporary Jazz","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1495889041-636155596-264066510","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Anthem","artistName":"44th Move, Alfa Mist & Richard Spaven","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/8b/c8/d58bc8d3-d70d-24b7-4ea4-f8e528441060/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"483c33","textColor2":"023109","textColor4":"325837","textColor1":"1d0e04","bgColor":"f3f2f0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anthem/1781871697","playParams":{"id":"1781871697","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7CTKP2Zz7Zfqoake0lB5ei"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781871697/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1495889041","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1495889041?l=en-US"},{"id":"636155596","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/636155596?l=en-US"},{"id":"264066510","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/264066510?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741949245218}}},"1783029153":{"id":"1783029153","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783029153?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twin-shadow/387194050","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a3/cb/53/a3cb534a-393c-42b7-60e6-3a24b2b112af/f1c6ed3f-89b2-475a-af5c-1aca967656d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0c0bc","textColor2":"eeeeea","textColor4":"c0c0bc","textColor1":"eeeeea","bgColor":"080805","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/46/10/d04610e8-9c63-ec70-027c-721b97cb9d1a/97a5e90c-a5b2-4b57-b0fc-eeb869226acd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c0c3cb","textColor2":"e4e6f1","textColor4":"bdbfc8","textColor1":"e7ebf4","bgColor":"242426","hasP3":false}},"name":"Georgie","artistName":"Twin Shadow","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The cover art for the sixth album from indie-pop dynamo George Lewis Jr.—aka Twin Shadow—features the handwritten signature of his father Georgie, who passed away from cancer in 2024. It’s a poignant visual cue for what is undoubtedly the most nakedly personal and reflective album of Twin Shadow’s career. Where so much of his discography exists in a never-ending summer of ’84 where Prince and Springsteen are jostling for the top of the charts, <i>Georgie</i> strips Lewis’ songcraft down to the core. The glistening guitars and neon-tinted synth textures remain, but the tracks are almost entirely devoid of drums or beats and left to freely float in a sea of melancholy and simmering resentment—the bittersweet serenade “Good Times” is really a chronicle of the bad ones and an indictment of fair-weather friends who never seem to be around when you need them the most. But on tracks like “You Already Know” and “Permanent Feeling,” Lewis’ intimately soulful voice displays a Bon Iver-esque ability to transform even the most skeletal songs into full-blooded, heart-pumping hymns.","short":"The indie-pop dynamo strips down and levels up."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/74/f7/ac/74f7acb5-7139-10ff-46a1-022ef6156eea/3663729350534_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacbc9","textColor2":"91a8db","textColor4":"7487af","textColor1":"fdfffc","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/georgie/1783029153","playParams":{"id":"1783029153","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6dB2gOge494Mw2Qfm66wAV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1783029153/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"387194050","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/387194050?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741937033316}}},"1784282312":{"id":"1784282312","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784282312?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/derya-yildirim-grup-simsek/1177092441","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/db/65/96/db659645-440b-3fbb-5c71-3b2837c62c3c/bcf36e2c-018d-45e7-9276-6321234612d7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d9bba6","textColor2":"eec29f","textColor4":"cfa785","textColor1":"fbdbc8","bgColor":"513b20","hasP3":false}},"name":"Yarın Yoksa","artistName":"Derya Yildirim & Grup Simsek","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Leon Michels produces the wildly inventive Turkish psych-folk outfit."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ff/75/fc/ff75fc9c-9b4e-a212-be1c-a369bb322d95/50864.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5baaf","textColor2":"d979b4","textColor4":"af6494","textColor1":"f5e4d6","bgColor":"081314","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/yar%C4%B1n-yoksa/1784282312","playParams":{"id":"1784282312","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5l7ypUMco5BLsIYBjIYWay"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784282312/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1177092441","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1177092441?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741934488194}}},"1784893223":{"id":"1784893223","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1784893223?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nebulae-waves/1677500568","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/be/b6/5c/beb65c5c-732d-ac47-3cf7-bd2651281dce/Job8082d478-9b17-4dcd-9dfd-b493a79c2101-183751010-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359309330_2021433130-Time1736902387522.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9bf2fe"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cbc8c9","textColor2":"9bf2fe","textColor4":"81c6d0","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/75/94/d3/7594d31f-d72a-3cd5-0b4f-2fc650ef4533/Job36d211cd-71ec-438e-97f7-9cd7aac6e8b7-183751011-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359309327_2021433131-Time1736903814322.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","d8d8dd"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbd1cf","textColor2":"d8d8dd","textColor4":"b2b2b6","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Hamptons -

Now, the Pennsylvania-born athlete turned singer-songwriter has fleshed out the project with 11 new tracks. He uses these new tunes both to deepen <i>Relapse</i>’s themes of heartache and substance abuse as well as to shake up its original sequence, which is rearranged somewhat here and makes space for a fuller portrait of Zeiders’ style of country music.\n\nHighlights of the new material include “Everything Comes to Go Away,” a soulful cut co-written by teenage wunderkind Ben Goldsmith, and “Love in Letting Go,” a tender duet with Lanie Gardner. Of course, <i>Relapse</i> favorites like “Intoxicated” and “Betrayal” are on the record, too, cast in a more potent light when flanked by songs like “Can a Heart Take,” a brooding and melodic power

These days, Charley Crockett seems to sublimate his restless wanderlust into endless touring and prolific recording; <i>Lonesome Drifter</i>, co-produced by Shooter Jennings, is his 16th record in nine years. Its dreamy outlaw ballads and honky-tonk numbers tell a story about hustling in America (“That old-time feeling just up and walked away/Left me with these interest rates,” he sings on “Game I Can’t Win”), and meanwhile, a story of his years spent on the road. “My age is showing in a motel mirror,” he confesses over organ chords on “Under Neon Lights.” And the wistful “Life of a Country Singer” is a ballad of a liminal existence that unfolds in-between spaces, somewhere between dusk and dawn, and between right and wrong. “There’s a long, long line of country singers, singing songs about livin’ late at night,” he drawls, admitting “I ain’t the first one, or the best—but I’m different.”","short":"The Texan’s 16th album in nine years tells a story about hustling in

Gaga","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“That is who Lady Gaga is to me,” Lady Gaga tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of creating <i>MAYHEM</i>. “Maybe to someone else, it might be the Meat Dress or something that I did that they remember as me. But for me, I always want to be remembered for being a real artist and someone that cares so much.” In that vein, Gaga set out to make her latest album—which she calls her “favorite record in a long time”—its own thing. “<i>ARTPOP</i> was a vibe. <i>Joanne</i> was a sound. <i>Chromatica</i> had a sound. All different. <i>The Fame Monster</i> was more chaotic. <i>The Fame</i> was theatrical pop. <i>Born This Way</i>, to me, had more of a metal/electro New York vibe to it,” she says. “I actually made the effort making <i>MAYHEM</i> to not do that and not try to give my music an outfit, but instead to allow myself to be influenced by everything.”\n\nIndeed, <i>MAYHEM</i> traverses—and oftentimes melds—the various flavors of Mother Monster’s career, from the disco scene of her earliest work to her singer-songwriter era and back again. The opening tracks, singles “Disease” and “Abracadabra,” revisit dance-floor Gaga to thrilling fanfare. The spirited “Garden of Eden” follows the trend of what she calls “2000 throwbacks.” With its sparkly synths, “LoveDrug” might be seen as the brighter and shinier elder sibling of her early cut “LoveGame.” She even specifically admits the “electro-grunge influence” seeps its way in—especially apparent in “Perfect Celebrity,” “Vanish into You,” and “The Beast.” The latter even shows shades of <i>Joanne</i>, but “Blade of Grass” and her Bruno Mars duet “Die with a Smile” really put her former folk-pop-rock persona on display.\n\nIt’s also all incredibly personal to her. “The album is a series of gothic dreams,” she says. “I say it’s like images of the past that haunt me, and they somehow find their way into who I am today.” Below, Gaga takes us through several tracks, in her own words.\n\n<b>“Abracadabra”</b>\n“I think I didn’t want to make this kind of music for a long time, even though I had it in me. And I think ‘Abracadabra’ is very much my sound—something that I honed in [on] after many years, and I wanted to do it again. I felt like being stagnant was just death in my artistry. And I just really wanted to constantly be a student. Not just reinvent myself, but learn something new with every record. And that wasn’t always what people wanted from me, but that’s what I wanted from me. And it’s the thing that I’m the most probably proud of, if I look back on my career, is I know how much I grew from record to record and how authentic it all was. The thing that was most important to me was being a student of music, above everything else.”\n\n<b>“Perfect Celebrity”</b>\n“It’s super angry: ‘I’ve become a notorious being/Find my clone, she’s asleep on the ceiling.’ It’s almost comical, this idea that any time I’m in the room with anyone, there’s me—Stefani—and Lady Gaga asleep on the ceiling, and I have to figure out which body to be in. It’s kind of intense, but that song, that was an important song on this album because it didn’t feel honest to me on <i>MAYHEM</i> to exclude something that had that kind of anger in it because then it felt like I was trying to be a good girl or whatever and be something that I’m not actually. Part of my personal mayhem is that I have joy and celebration, but I’m also sometimes angry or super sad or really celebratory or completely insecure and have no confidence.”\n\n<b>“Shadow of a Man”</b>\n“That song is so much a response to my career and what it always felt like to be the only girl in the room a lot of the time. And to always be standing in the shadow of a man because there were so many around me that I learned how to dance in that shadow.”\n\n<b>“The Beast”</b>\n“In that record, it is me or someone singing to their lover who’s a werewolf, but what I believe about this is, this record is also about [my fiancé] Michael [Polansky] and I, and that this song is also about me and being Lady Gaga. What the beast is, who I become when I’m onstage, and who I am when I make my art and the prechorus of that song is, ‘You can’t hide who you are. 11:59, your heart’s racing, you’re growling, and we both know why.’ It’s like somebody that is saying to the beast, ‘I know you’re a monster, but I can handle you, and I love you.’”\n\n<b>“Blade of Grass”</b>\n“Michael asked me how I would want him to propose to me one day. We were in our backyard, and I said, ‘Just take a blade of grass and wrap it around my finger,’ and then I wrote ‘Blade of Grass’ because I remembered the way his face looked, and I remembered the grass in the backyard, and I remember thinking he should use that really long grass that’s in the center of the backyard. Those moments, to me, at a certain point I was into the idea of fame and artifice and being the conductor of your own life when it came to your own inner sense of fame. I had to fight a lot harder to make music and dance a little bit later into my career because my life became so different that I didn’t have as much life around me to inspire me.”","short":"“It’s a series of gothic dreams”: Gaga invites MAYHEM into your life."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/11/d1/be11d187-1aeb-99f3-01c5-597ed65cdb6a/25UMGIM07433.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0d0d0","textColor2":"dfdfdf","textColor4":"bdbdbd","textColor1":"f7f7f7","bgColor":"353535","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mayhem/1792666546","playParams":{"id":"1792666546","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MHUaRi9OCyTN02SoyRRBJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792666546/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"277293880","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/277293880?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741960032399}}},"1792913254":{"id":"1792913254","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792913254?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joyce-santana/930526504","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ad/17/2b/ad172baa-44b8-09f5-e730-5b25447b89e5/e1419a36-8797-4db9-b5c5-45fde381b071.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1e1e1e","textColor2":"202020","textColor4":"383838","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"989898","hasP3":false}},"name":"Nada Personal","artistName":"Joyce Santana","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"More than a decade into the Latin rap game, Puerto Rico’s own Joyce Santana rightfully perseveres. Having endured wave upon wave and dodged fad after fad, his very presence at this stage in his career makes him a rare artist in a fickle music industry. Judging by the quality and potency of <i>Nada Personal</i>, with its sleek yet streetwise sound and an impressive guest list featuring Álvaro Diaz and Yandel, the Rimas Entertainment signee clearly has what it takes to last. From the hometown-honoring opener “El Gigante de Carolina” to the rugged send-off of the title track, he centers himself as a rapper with an undeniably lyrical craft. Even relatively lighter fare like “Tu Ciudvd,” a provocative plea to an elusive part-time lover, benefits from his overall approach, raising the pressure along with the tempo on its back half. As has been the case throughout his discography, he remains a stellar collaborator, whether with Feid on the thumping “Ferxxoko” or with Tainy on the maximalist “Omerta.”","short":"With over a decade in the game, the Puerto Rican rapper endures."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/34/55/953455b1-cb13-50d1-3fe3-75edf5db90ab/199066631447.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1d1d1d","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"1d1d1d","textColor1":"030303","bgColor":"868686","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nada-personal/1792913254","playParams":{"id":"1792913254","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4WgRPX4DY0lwubpMYKuTzN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792913254/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"930526504","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/930526504?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741944556747}}},"1794141236":{"id":"1794141236","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794141236?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music","Avant-Garde Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1502856182-1490716066","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"dream brigade","artistName":"Phillip Golub & Lesley Mok","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4c/08/51/4c08517a-edf9-537b-9f20-2eef3e893593/111985.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3e3835","textColor2":"2e2e35","textColor4":"58575b","textColor1":"0e0705","bgColor":"fffcf5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dream-brigade/1794141236","playParams":{"id":"1794141236","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5woggMVL8uCOGtTGEu3Nli"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794141236/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1502856182","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1502856182?l=en-US"},{"id":"1490716066","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1490716066?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741923083553}}},"1794159562":{"id":"1794159562","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794159562?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=927827-447857020","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Double Cup","artistName":"Slim Thug & Propain","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3376,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5b/cb/97/5bcb97b5-bdbb-ebd2-eff5-5983b2d08039/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3376,"textColor3":"afa896","textColor2":"d8c0b8","textColor4":"ad9a94","textColor1":"dbd2bb","bgColor":"020202","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/double-cup/1794159562","playParams":{"id":"1794159562","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3EeVgPEafTpyLiHp9suJgx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794159562/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"927827","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/927827?l=en-US"},{"id":"447857020","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/447857020?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741945660883}}},"1794214841":{"id":"1794214841","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1794214841?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Big Band","Music","Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=3491522-267997801","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/58/3f/c0/583fc008-3010-ec10-8f70-10327c81c8c3/Jobc66f8941-b473-4c0d-9d3c-1d81a23aa97a-185072701-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362049057_2042093626-Time1738625075761.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","313131"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3c3c3c","textColor2":"313131","textColor4":"5a5a5a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7b/59/91/7b59912b-c2e7-f85a-a41a-7913de8e6b7a/Job7c6e541a-0051-4033-bb4f-1a12875b87ad-185072700-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362049056_2042093623-Time1738623852070.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","121212"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"383838","textColor2":"121212","textColor4":"414241","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"name":"Interaction (feat.

But it wasn’t until her debut solo album, 2025’s <i>Ruby</i>, that she got a more profound chance to self-reflect through her music. “The greatest part of this solo project for me was that I had time with myself,” JENNIE tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I really got to dig deep inside of who I am and what I am.”\n\nThe 15-track, primarily English-language album was JENNIE’s first music release since leaving YG Entertainment as a soloist to launch her own label, Odd Atelier, and it’s a declaration of her musical identity as a solo singer and rapper. The album’s name, <i>Ruby</i>, is a reference to the alter ego (Jennie Ruby Jane) that the musician created for herself when she moved to New Zealand by herself as a child to learn English. “When I was like 11,” she says, “I knew that I wanted to create this identity for myself, like ‘Jennie’ wasn't doing justice for me, and I was like, ‘I want a longer name.’”\n\nThe persona has carried over into adulthood and her creative expression on <i>Ruby</i>. From the hip-hop-driven swagger of tracks like “like JENNIE,” “ExtraL,” and “Damn Right” to confessional-style songs like “F.T.S.,” “twin,” and “start a war,” JENNIE opens up about fame, protecting the ones she loves, and staying true to herself. She taps an eclectic cadre of established and rising Western musicians for help, including Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis (“Damn Right”), Doechii (“ExtraL”), Dominic Fike (“Love Hangover”), FKJ (“JANE”), and Dua Lipa (“Handlebars”). “Now, I'm not afraid to challenge myself,” JENNIE says of what she learned in the album-creation process. “Understanding my value was the biggest lesson.”","short":"The BLACKPINK star offers a declaration of her musical identity."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ec/13/67/ec13677e-f7b4-acc2-b59b-ea8533b1a374/196872890983.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c5ab8b","textColor2":"f1b175","textColor4":"c18f60","textColor1":"f5d3ac","bgColor":"03080b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ruby/1795979743","playParams":{"id":"1795979743","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1vWMw6pu3err6qqZzI3RhH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795979743/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"913944","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/913944?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741948453980}}},"1796016188":{"id":"1796016188","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796016188?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/diepzeebeest/1575232004","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Detox - Single","artistName":"Diepzeebeest","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b5/aa/54/b5aa542f-fc6c-4ec0-1048-6244c8d9c6a0/8718723280525.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"3a3920","textColor2":"272727","textColor4":"42432a","textColor1":"1c1b1b","bgColor":"b0b537","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/detox-single/1796016188","playParams":{"id":"1796016188","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796016188/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1575232004","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1575232004?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1739394362194}}},"1796260306":{"id":"1796260306","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796260306?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"1960-12-16","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jaki-byard/2687031","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Blues For Smoke (2025 Remaster)","artistName":"Jaki Byard","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6e/99/77/6e99774d-b3e9-09c9-d04d-62be6435a04d/113014.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"202e33","textColor2":"151b20","textColor4":"2f414a","textColor1":"010304","bgColor":"9adaf3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/blues-for-smoke-2025-remaster/1796260306","playParams":{"id":"1796260306","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796260306/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2687031","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2687031?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741943957506}}},"1796273415":{"id":"1796273415","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796273415?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carly-pearce/206684981","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b6/17/bd/b617bd4b-b7ee-003a-195b-287b09fb98fb/f5ef76ce-3cb2-4ce1-a2e5-1c7cb1043561.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"da9d8a","textColor2":"f6a698","textColor4":"d89584","textColor1":"f7b19f","bgColor":"634e36","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/30/26/90/30269022-adc7-56da-bc00-16ab31fcf60f/d2df07e0-8097-4073-a9c9-48deb24723e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"da9d86","textColor2":"f99181","textColor4":"da8376","textColor1":"f9b196","bgColor":"604d47","hasP3":false}},"name":"hummingbird: no rain, no flowers (deluxe)","artistName":"Carly Pearce","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Album","standard":"Carly Pearce’s fourth studio album opens with an admission: “Country music made me do it, and I’ll do it till I die.” The award-winning singer-songwriter goes on to list a string of “its,” including taking it “way too far” and letting “the wrong boy” kiss her. Of course, it’s those very moments that Pearce so deftly documents, establishing herself as a major songwriting force in the genre with her evocative, often gut-wrenching accounts of hard times and heartache. On <i>hummingbird</i>, there is no shortage of such moments, though this follow-up to 2021’s <i>29: Written in Stone</i> feels sonically lighter and more spacious than its predecessors, a vibe hinted at by the record’s delicate title.\n\nPearce co-produced the LP alongside Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, marking her first time in a producing role. Standouts include “things I don’t chase,” a slow-burn torch song for “the stubborn kind” of man Pearce just “don’t chase,” as well as the head-over-heels infatuation of “trust issues.” Chris Stapleton joins Pearce on the aching duet “we don’t fight anymore,” a ballad about a love whose spark is long burnt out. \n\nThis deluxe edition adds five new tracks, including two raw, acoustic live performances: “oklahoma” and “things i don’t chase,” both of which Pearce recorded as part of a live series for Vevo. New song “no rain” nods to the deluxe edition’s subtitle, the oft-quoted mantra “No rain, no flowers,” which reminds that life’s more beautiful experiences are often born from hardship. Pearce rounds out the project with two more previously unheard songs, the searching and tender “if looks could kill” and the clear-eyed exploration of new love, “heart first.”","short":"Five rare tracks round out the deluxe version of her fourth studio album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a9/78/46/a97846cf-c811-a839-c800-1304f48d3485/25BMR0006253.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dfd0a7","textColor2":"feb0ac","textColor4":"e49e98","textColor1":"f8eebe","bgColor":"7a5949","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hummingbird-no-rain-no-flowers-deluxe/1796273415","playParams":{"id":"1796273415","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4COdErCzwv0rQAFH594bol"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796273415/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"206684981","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/206684981?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741950399828}}},"1796371425":{"id":"1796371425","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796371425?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1761188514-1761188515","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Jolene 04 - EP","artistName":"Danny Parton & Mike Parton","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/92/4b/56/924b56da-f143-f94f-1b49-f8a493386ff4/4250101481369_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"33322d","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"33322d","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fffbe1","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jolene-04-ep/1796371425","playParams":{"id":"1796371425","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796371425/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1761188514","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1761188514?l=en-US"},{"id":"1761188515","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1761188515?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741950191197}}},"1796815590":{"id":"1796815590","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796815590?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-12","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/native-alien/1796815591","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Universal Language","artistName":"Native_Alien","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fe/c9/46/fec94628-8ae9-c2b4-ca01-f22d12afe3ec/8718723280907.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"cbcdd3","textColor2":"fe595f","textColor4":"cb4853","textColor1":"feffff","bgColor":"010626","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/universal-language/1796815590","playParams":{"id":"1796815590","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1LGoWqHO2tZiuRv39GRXR5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796815590/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1796815591","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1796815591?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741922942292}}},"1796948109":{"id":"1796948109","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796948109?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kentheman/1215390804","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c8/bb/d0/c8bbd0de-a1a2-6ad0-d91a-e9f2c70489f7/f2c9d37c-4155-425f-a462-336c1d09443f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d78b57","textColor2":"f5553d","textColor4":"d84936","textColor1":"f3a766","bgColor":"671d18","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0c/14/d9/0c14d9ba-f5b4-b90a-a632-5443c025f841/aaff2b27-dd19-4622-95a8-a8dec4a9b0ed.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b6bcb8","textColor2":"e0d4c6","textColor4":"c0b7aa","textColor1":"d4dbd8","bgColor":"41403b","hasP3":false}},"name":"Kinda Famous","artistName":"KenTheMan","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"KenTheMan releasing her <i>Kinda Famous</i> on March 4, 2025, was both a cheeky allusion to her signature calculator-speak branding—type in 304 and turn it upside down—and a guarantee that fans would get the same bossed-up baddie they enjoyed across projects like 2020’s <i>4 da 304’s</i> and 2023’s <i>Back to 304’n</i>.

That day isn’t coming anytime soon though, so you’d be wise to buy in now while she’s only <i>Kinda Famous</i>, because if a song like “Gimme More” is any indication, the woman we know as TheMan is coming for everything due to her.","short":"If you don’t know the Houston MC yet, here’s a perfect place to start."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b2/73/19/b27319a1-aa10-bd4c-758e-bace75b6215c/199041984148.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1b1a19","textColor2":"020203","textColor4":"1b1a19","textColor1":"020203","bgColor":"807973","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kinda-famous/1796948109","playParams":{"id":"1796948109","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/20ViMp0RQoeldbJVe4WeoN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796948109/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1215390804","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1215390804?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741953374930}}},"1796964167":{"id":"1796964167","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796964167?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/icewear-vezzo/514871285","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"UNDEFEATED - EP","artistName":"Icewear Vezzo","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Fully back on his independent grind, Detroit mainstay Icewear Vezzo continues to flourish and succeed on his own merits. In a crowded scene of Michigan rap contenders, his name stays in the upper echelon off the strength of his work. The EP-length <i>UNDEFEATED</i> exemplifies his ethos, with a foundation in unapologetic street talk and backed with trunk-rattling productions. Nodding back to his Green Guyz days as well as to a certain Lil Yachty single, “MINNESOTA” hits like a brick with its purp-skewed trap-house chronicles. Buoyed by a beat sampling a romantic ’80s electro-funk gem, “GOOD TO ME” flips the narrative to break down what he’s looking for in a baddie, citing loyalty above nearly all else. Naturally, he gives the project’s handful of guest spots to homegrown stars, with both Big Sean and Skilla Baby flawlessly flexing over “WORTH SOMETHING” and GT bringing his A-game to “RICHER THEN I EVER BEEN.”","short":"The Detroit rap star still thrives on his independent grind."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/57/58/af/5758af5f-7fbf-b4cc-688a-58fc3e11058f/50392.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2f2f2f","textColor2":"1d1d1d","textColor4":"464646","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ececec","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/undefeated-ep/1796964167","playParams":{"id":"1796964167","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0CLVJq9JGSbGABvSbWR09Z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796964167/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"514871285","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/514871285?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741936984973}}},"1797113407":{"id":"1797113407","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797113407?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=322454840-290998171","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Elecno Posse -

Then four studio albums into her career, the country singer-songwriter had long since proven herself, and took a chance on rawer, more personal material in the wake of her 2022 divorce. As this follow-up attests, that heightened vulnerability unlocked new creative depths for Ballerini. Her most sonically diverse release yet, <i>PATTERNS</i> is also the fullest embodiment of Ballerini’s capabilities. Ballerini co-produced the album alongside previous collaborator Alysa Vanderheym, a songwriter and producer who has worked with a bevy of Nashville artists, including Jelly Roll, Little Big Town, and The Cadillac Three. \n\nThe record opens with its title track, a gauzy, pleading midtempo ballad that makes use of more traditional country instruments like mandolin and dobro alongside prominent synthesizers, for production that’s reminiscent of Kacey Musgraves’ <i>Golden Hour</i>. “Sorry Mom” is especially potent, with Ballerini confronting a laundry list of filial indiscretions—a “lack of stickin’ to the Bible,” an abandoned college degree—before acknowledging, “I turned out all right.” “Beg for Your Love” is gentle but confident, as Ballerini takes stock of what she deserves in a relationship, like “a kiss” or “a morning call.” Other highlights include the Noah Kahan collaboration “Cowboys Cry Too” and the moody and melodic “Deep.”","short":"Ballerini’s 2024 LP gets the deluxe treatment with a stack of bonus tracks."},"artwork":{"width":5987,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/06/3e/cf/063ecffc-3b86-26bb-3560-64d1e95d4fc2/199066947043.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":5987,"textColor3":"47312d","textColor2":"3f241e","textColor4":"644841","textColor1":"1a0605","bgColor":"fbdbce","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/patterns-deluxe/1797653864","playParams":{"id":"1797653864","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/426ni1U6MsUtpxmvtXgLhn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797653864/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"382270241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/382270241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741949851100}}},"1797676022":{"id":"1797676022","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797676022?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Jazz","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joe-pass/1134996","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Virtuoso (Remastered 2025)","artistName":"Joe Pass","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a8/8e/24/a88e2462-6fa8-8a66-5120-839893c4afbe/24CRGIM45645.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"c3c4ca","textColor4":"9c9da2","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/virtuoso-remastered-2025/1797676022","playParams":{"id":"1797676022","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797676022/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1134996","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1134996?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741929557755}}},"1797916425":{"id":"1797916425","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797916425?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=453607970-1621590425","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Cold & Lonely -

With a couple of threatening exceptions (the Conway-featuring “Money Magnet,” the 03 Greedo and Styles P guest spots on “True Lies”), the mood is low-key and light, the rap equivalent of easy listening or lounge music.

In the pantheon of pop music, that might not sound so special—but it was a relatively unexplored subject for the girl group that had previously sung about being “FEARLESS,” “ANTIFRAGILE,” and spending the “Perfect Night” with one’s crew. In the groovy, low-key title track “HOT,” the members will do anything for love: “Even if I turn to ash, I’m happy/So tonight, hold me in your arms/Bonnie and Clyde it, oh.” In “Come Over,” they beckon someone closer on the dance floor and, in “Ash,” they spur a lover to “light the flame.”\n\nThe fiery imagery evoked throughout <i>HOT</i> stands in contrast to the relative sonic softness of the album, which is a shift from the old-fashioned hip-hop embraced in LE SSERAFIM’s third mini-album, <i>EASY</i>, and the club bangers the members vogued along to for fourth mini album <i>CRAZY</i>. The album includes writing credits from 13, the Korean music production team behind “FEARLESS” and “ANTIFRAGILE,” as well as HYBE founder Bang Si-hyuk, aka “Hitman” Bang. Member Yunjin has credits on “HOT,” “Ash,” and “So Cynical (Badum),” and Eunchae and Chaewon also contributed to the writing of “So Cynical (Badum).”","short":"Their fifth mini album is all about love."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5a/02/ba/5a02bafc-78ab-686b-8f79-a11702632b02/198704375187_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"332b1f","textColor2":"232328","textColor4":"494039","textColor1":"080908","bgColor":"e2b37d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hot-ep/1799278610","playParams":{"id":"1799278610","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799278610/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1616740364","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1616740364?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741950021611}}},"1799309360":{"id":"1799309360","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799309360?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":34,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1281676587-598718469","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/47/43/4c/47434cd4-469e-7ec3-a874-099fa57a807f/07193641-cb57-43e7-9224-05e670ff56d5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2aba1","textColor2":"d0c8c0","textColor4":"a8a19a","textColor1":"ded4c9","bgColor":"060604","hasP3":false}},"name":"STABBED & SHOT 2 (Deluxe Edition)","artistName":"Benny the Butcher & 38 Spesh","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In 2018, Benny the Butcher and his fellow New York street spitter 38 Spesh teamed up for <i>Stabbed & Shot</i>, an album that became a fan favorite as Benny found himself on a bigger stage thanks to his affiliation with the Griselda boys from his hometown of Buffalo.

Despite sharing the stage with Spesh, Benny opens up his diary and allows his fans to look in. It’s this honesty that’s helped shape his special year. On “High Stakes,” he outlines his psyche, spitting: “This my life inside a rage/Let me show y’all what it’s like behind the stage/Because in rap, the pay cycle ninety days/Between that, the streets

best DJs to deliver the perfect set for your next workout.

I’ve even added a walk-out song, so if you’re a yoga teacher, you don’t have to worry about hitting the next track as your class comes out of Savasana. You can just let it flow.”\n\nAmong her favorite tracks: “Virgo Rising (Reimagined),” which she created after taking a hiatus from music during the pandemic (“It felt like I was finding my sound again”), and Rising Galaxy’s “Forgiveness Moves in Waves,” which she has been playing in her own yoga classes for years. “It has layer upon layer of dreamy synths and ethereal keys.

The pop-rock queen had felt the itch to write new music for years, but had struggled to find a sound that reflected where she was now. Then came “Purple Irises,” a sweet pop-country duet with Shelton that lets go of insecurities and goes all in on love. The seed was planted for <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani’s fifth solo album.\n\nWhile making the warm and unabashedly enamored <i>Bouquet</i>, Stefani found herself echoing the music she grew up on in the ’70s. “I always picture myself in the back of the station wagon and my parents driving to church, and all the great soft rock that was on,” she says. “Anything from Hall & Oates to Chicago to Fleetwood Mac.” Garden symbolism abounds: Tears of past heartbreaks water the soil, yielding fields of late-blooming flowers. Despite the cowboy hat she dons on the cover, it’s not quite a country album, but some nods to ranch life sneak in. “I drive you crazy, you drive the truck,” she sings on the title track, and on “Marigolds,” she recalls dressing like a cowgirl to catch Shelton’s eye upon first meeting.\n\nIt’s been nearly three decades since her band, No Doubt, became a household name with their third album, <i>Tragic Kingdom</i>, but the process of writing <i>Bouquet</i> brought Stefani back to the feeling of taking a leap of faith to find her voice. Naturally, she’s got a flower metaphor for that. “Every time you plant that seed, you have this hope, but you don’t know if it’s going to bloom,” she said. “You don’t really have control. All you can do is everything you can to help.”","short":"Gwen adds a full set of acoustic versions and videos to her 2024 album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/85/ef/5d/85ef5d8f-364c-ccff-9e7f-c2fd56d4c398/25UMGIM10671.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d2ac84","textColor2":"ec812c","textColor4":"c86b26","textColor1":"f9d2a1","bgColor":"37160f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bouquet-deluxe/1799886125","playParams":{"id":"1799886125","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0rTqvDgJ5Ec2zuuQrxVP1W"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799886125/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"108717","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/108717?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741958521628}}},"1800007047":{"id":"1800007047","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800007047?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-09-13","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/snow-patrol/5327254","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"The Forest Is The Path (Extended Edition)","artistName":"Snow Patrol","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody says the band’s eighth album was a process of two extremes. The first was the group’s initial attempt at making the record, an undertaking that hit a dead end and left the indie-rock trio from Northern Ireland wondering where to go next. “It was genuinely nobody’s fault,” Lightbody tells Apple Music. “It was a constellation of things but it was a chaotic mess and we were very stressed. We were also on a deadline—technically, the record should’ve come out a year earlier. We now know never to work to a deadline again, because that’s no way to make art.”\n\nLightbody and bandmates Nathan Connolly and Johnny McDaid regrouped and gave it another go. In Stormzy and Adele producer Fraser T. Smith, they found a collaborator who made the creation of <i>The Forest Is the Path</i> feel like a comparative walk in the park. “The second time we made it was so calm and it all filtered down from the way Fraser not just works in the studio, but lives his life—calm and chill, sweet and funny,” Lightbody says. “There was so much laughter and silliness. It took five months the first time and five weeks the second time.”\n\nYou can almost hear the relief lighting up <i>The Forest Is the Path</i>, a record of space and breadth, where the band’s long-established melodic knack has room to recline over expansive, atmospheric instrumentation. All the Snow Patrol hallmarks are present and correct—stirring pop-rock sing-alongs, poignant balladry, and uplifting contemplatives delivered by a band that sounds like it has a new lease of life. “I firmly believe this is the start of something,” states Lightbody. “We’re 30 years into a career. We’ve never been here before, we’re in uncharted territory no matter what we do.” Read on as Lightbody guides us through Snow Patrol’s new dawn, track by track.\n\n<b>“All”</b>\n“Fraser and I went in together for the first time to write in October, November 2022 and we’d never met. He was the first outside person I’d written a song with for Snow Patrol. It’s a kind of blind date. You arrive in a room, and the intention is to write a song in a day. I walked in and Fraser had the guitar around him and was like, ‘Hi, nice to meet you. What do you think of this?’ I hadn’t taken off my coat yet and we were already in it. I was like, ‘Oh, that sounds great!’ I started singing something, took my coat off and started writing words down and we had the song in an hour.”\n\n<b>“The Beginning”</b>\n“When Johnny and I got together in earnest to write the record, it was ‘The Beginning’ that we started with. I had been writing a lot of lyrics over the last three or four months, in notepads and notes on my phone. I had that line ‘I wanna be in love/Without being loved in return.’ It just sprung up from there. Johnny came up with the piano part and I started singing the melody over that and working on the lyrics. He worked more on the music, him and his team. Will Reynolds is credited on this song and one or two others on the record, he’s one of Johnny’s guys and he came up with that incredible wonky, woozy guitar part in the chorus.”\n\n<b>“Everything’s Here and Nothing’s Lost”</b>\n“‘The Beginning’ was done on the first day we were writing in Somerset and this was done the second day. Johnny and I were just sparking off each other. I came up with a little melody and it happened pretty quickly. I wandered around the garden, writing the lyrics, and it was beautiful sunny day. When I came back in, Johnny had that really massive chorus. It was even bigger originally but it was so big that people’s ears would’ve been blown off because they’d be turning up the quiet bit of the song and then we would pulverize them with a loud bit.”\n\n<b>“Your Heart Home”</b>\n“This was recorded by me at home on GarageBand, and then I sent it to Fraser and Scott, who engineered the record, and they brought it into glorious Technicolor. I’m half-decent at GarageBand, but I’m not a producer. My production is more about the ideas of what the song needs than the actual technical ability of manifesting that. When we all got together in the studio on this one, it really started to shift and move and grow. It was not what I was expecting it to be and I love that.”\n\n<b>“This Is the Sound of Your Voice”</b>\n“It’s a slightly strange melody for us. The first time I played this to someone I really trust and love and work with quite a lot, he went, ‘It’s just like a West End musical melody.’ I hadn’t even thought of that. Johnny put in so much intricate detail into this song. There were 200 strands of audio on it. Johnny does it so beautifully where everything is played, everything is real, everything is an authentic sound—he does an awful lot of found sounds. I think that’s why it doesn’t overload everything and everything finds its place in the song and some things come in and out. Johnny did a beautiful job, as did Nathan. The guitars are so beautiful and incredible all the way through.”\n\n<b>“Hold Me in the Fire”</b>\n“Johnny and I wrote it in his house. Right from day one, it sounded like a rock song that was going to expand outwards and we’d just have to get out of its way and let the balloon inflate. But when we got in to record it the first time, it didn’t do that. It felt like we were adding and nothing was happening. It’s a hard puzzle to fix because you’ve got to keep taking it apart and putting it back together again, and sometimes it just doesn’t ever fit together right. This is the thing about going in with Fraser: Everything we put on [with him], it felt like it was expanding, it felt like it was inflating in a very good way. Everything was floating up into the sky and it started to make a lot of sense. Fraser helped an awful lot. And Nathan’s guitars on it are just absolutely scorching.”\n\n<b>“Years That Fall”</b>\n“This was me in the house in Bangor. I wrote it on GarageBand and it actually was an unusual little thing to begin with, not the rock song that it turned into. There was a lot of that version we drew from, but in the studio, this absolute monster appeared. This small, rock, chuggy, indie-ish thing just went off somewhere else. It was really exciting.”\n\n<b>“Never Really Tire”</b>\n“Jesus Christ, the work that Johnny McDaid put into this—again, another 200-plus pieces of the song. And the way things come in and out, you can just play any section of the song and there’ll be something different happening. Right from the start, I had this vision of an eagle flying over a forest canopy. It can see the tree line rise and fall and undulate like waves in the deep ocean and that’s what I wanted this drum part to be. I was explaining it to Ash [Soan, drummer], thinking, ‘He’s going to think I’m fucking insane,’ and he went, ‘Yep, got it.’ We were like, ‘We’ll play this whole thing live as a spontaneous thing, see what happens.’ It was one of the most extraordinary experiences I’ve had in the studio. That vision that I’d had for this song just came to life.”\n\n<b>“These Lies”</b>\n“I’d been numb for the year since my dad died. This was late 2020. I didn’t cry or I couldn’t feel anything. I thought I was broken. I thought that was it, forever. It was a couple of days before the anniversary, and I read a Rumi poem and burst into tears. The tears came like a torrent. A year’s worth of tears were just pouring onto the floor. And then, the next day I was exhausted. I went to sleep. The next day, I woke up and I was like, ‘I feel connected to something.’ I felt like, ‘I need a pen and a piece of paper right now,’ and I wrote a song about my dad. And then a song that followed about 10 minutes after that was ‘These Lies,’ which obviously wasn’t about him, and that came out in a flow state as well. It was just like all these things were trapped in there behind the tears that wouldn’t release.”\n\n<b>“What If Nothing Breaks?”</b>\n“This is all Johnny’s production. It went through many different forms. It started as a Motown song with a Motown beat, and it had a different chorus. It wasn’t quite working, something felt wrong about it. Johnny was playing around the chords of it and I was singing it in a different way and it felt like, ‘Oh, this is the place for this song, feels like it needs to be here.’ Then I came in one day and he was like, ‘What about these for the chords for the chorus?’ and I started singing the chorus as it became, and the song just came to life.”\n\n<b>“Talking About Hope”</b>\n“I’m proud of the lyrics on this record. I’ve allowed myself to be open to whatever happens rather than trying to force my way to the words, which sometimes has to happen if you’re staring at a blank page for months on end. This time around, there was no writer’s block. This song came from a true place, especially the verses. I love the lyrics and the verses. I don’t really say that about my own lyrics very often.”\n\n<b>“The Forest Is the Path”</b>\n“Michael Keeney deserves a big mention on this record. He produced Foy Vance’s <i>Joy of Nothing</i>, which for me is the greatest album by a Northern Irish artist, and produced many other things besides. He wrote and produced some of the strings on this record. We were in his studio and Nathan was playing that lead line. I recorded it on my phone and took it home and built the song around it on GarageBand. I sent that to Fraser and the thing that goes the whole way through the song, Nathan’s guitar, that’s the recording on my phone. I find that a quite nice way to finish a record—the spontaneity captured in one moment without having to go, ‘OK, well let’s go and set up the microphones.’ It was just like, ‘Oh, I love that, can I use that?’”","short":"Five new songs and a remix amplify the indie-rockers’ eighth album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6d/3b/30/6d3b3005-aeab-43a7-f599-b01ac0bc0f70/25UMGIM41100.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"15b896","textColor2":"fcb304","textColor4":"d69611","textColor1":"0adea9","bgColor":"402248","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-forest-is-the-path-extended-edition/1800007047","playParams":{"id":"1800007047","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800007047/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5327254","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5327254?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741948723072}}},"1800066147":{"id":"1800066147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800066147?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":30,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance","African","Afrobeats"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cooly-g/317936764","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"In Waves Radio Presents The Floor with Cooly G, Ep. 7 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Cooly G","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9d/f0/46/9df04609-1198-e650-4bbc-a4d6b713e078/c4a64309-ea0f-49e7-83fb-d8c1801fc6f3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"f53524","textColor4":"c42a1d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-waves-radio-presents-the-floor-with-cooly-g-ep-7-dj-mix/1800066147","playParams":{"id":"1800066147","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800066147/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"317936764","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/317936764?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1741923114143}}},"1800107085":{"id":"1800107085","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800107085?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Ambient","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-14","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/highland-park-sleep-collective/1460730985","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8d/30/42/8d30428c-2057-a60a-5c65-bcefef2a7213/fa69caf5-fa9a-49a9-ac6b-e4d44640d3d0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cdafcb","textColor2":"f5cbb2","textColor4":"ceaea8","textColor1":"f4ccde","bgColor":"303a81","hasP3":false},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ff/c5/1f/ffc51fff-0ebb-19fc-ee7b-11b211ed1b52/2174e50a-14d4-41cc-a4f6-035561857546.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"a9ccdb","textColor2":"b5cfd1","textColor4":"9bb2c2","textColor1":"c6eff0","bgColor":"333e87","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/32/0b/17/320b17e3-9521-4139-3870-f07a656c4720/529b1660-af75-4445-ac74-e64c1c844e0a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9b0a1","textColor2":"e9b58e","textColor4":"c49d8c","textColor1":"efcca8","bgColor":"333e87","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/32/be/83/32be83a0-ad86-4157-f388-186e952c1c87/40209b82-f4ca-4428-9498-1530fec8a5ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c8a4a0","textColor2":"e4b29d","textColor4":"c09b98","textColor1":"efbea7","bgColor":"303b85","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0c/5d/49/0c5d490a-3f8a-336f-2589-40e71564fc01/c7e57f90-3ed9-4e17-95ec-3022d533fb84.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"bea493","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"be8c80","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"262b73","hasP3":false}},"name":"World Sleep Day 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Highland Park Sleep Collective","editorialNotes":{"short":"A mix that honors ambient giants and observes the peaceful power of nature.","standard":"This World Sleep Day, do yourself a favor and take things down a notch—rest, relax, unwind. To support you in this endeavor, we had Highland Park Sleep Collective—the LA outfit made up of producer Tim Anderson and Poolside’s Filip Nikolic—craft a restorative DJ mix of soft, sleepy soundscapes. “We leaned on friendship and fandom,” Anderson says, explaining that they started with artists they either know personally (Orpheo McCord, Anders Rhedin) or have long been obsessed with (Brian Eno, Ana Roxanne). “Ultimately, we hope people find this mix relaxing and imaginative, something to sleep and dream to, or be inspired by.”\n\nLike ambient music, sleep music is an art. “You want to make sure the music is appealing but also in the background of our consciousness,” he says. “We always try to create a mood that feels nice and soft. If it checks those boxes for us, it usually works for others.” He believes listeners are often more in tune with these genres than they think. “Everyone relaxes to some form of wellness music, whether it’s white noise, ocean sounds, or even lo-fi hip-hop,” he says. “I can open my window and listen to the best ambient [music] on earth: the sound of wind, birds, or even a plane passing overhead.

The abundance of love songs contained within, including “Dame Tu Calor” and “Te Quiero A Ti,” contrasted with the modernized corridos of their prior work, endearing themselves further to what soon became a massive fanbase. Revisiting that aesthetic with another five years’ worth of experience under their belts, both musically and presumably in matters of the heart, Pedro Tovar’s group makes this sequel truly worthy of its predecessor’s imprimatur.\n\nTo call <i>Vibras de Noche II</i> a return to form would undermine just how far Eslabon Armado has come creatively. There’s evident nuance in the instrumental arrangements on songs like “Eres Arte <3” and “NO VOY A JUGAR,” showcasing not only artistic growth but greater aspirations. Tovar’s voice feels somewhat more lived-in as well, his delivery on “OTRAS 24 HORAS” and the deliberately messy “TE ODIO!” both particularly arresting. Bearing a world-weariness that’s fundamentally relatable, “KE DIABLOS HICE II” calls back to 2022’s <i>NOSTALGIA</i>.\n\nA rare guest on this explicitly intimate outing, freshly viral sensation Macario Martínez brings a genuinely devastating energy to the dour “Esa noche.” At times, things reach a point where listeners may feel like they’re eavesdropping, particularly during interludes and non-musical segues like the ones at the tail end of “M & D.” On the other hand, the album isn’t entirely fixated on romantic themes, with the vibrant corrido “El Alegre” extolling the virtues of quality time with the boys.","short":"A worthy sequel to the group’s groundbreaking 2020

the blend of clever rhymes with deep, philosophical musings that have punctuated early releases like 2020’s <i>Oh the Places You'll Go</i> mixtape and 2022’s <i>she / her / black bitch</i> EP. Lead cut “STANKA POOH” finds the Top Dawg Entertainment artist wrestling with her artistic mortality and role as a Black woman in music. She raps: “Let’s start the story backwards/I’m dead, she’s dead, just another Black Lives Mattered/And if I die today I die a bastard/TikTok rapper, part-time YouTube actor.”\n\nObviously, Doechii aims to be bigger than viral clips and TV shows so small they can fit on your computer screen. On <i>Alligator Bites Never Heal</i>, Doechii asserts herself as one of rap’s most impressive bar-for-bar MCs. “DENIAL IS A RIVER” is a classic narrative cut in the style of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” while “NISSAN ALTIMA” is an electro-rap thriller designed to keep the dance floor hot and heart rates up. She sums it up simply enough when she raps: “All beef gets smoked/I’m a real fly bitch, you in coach.”","short":"The Tampa rapper adds “Anxiety” to an already incredible
