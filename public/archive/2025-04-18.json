Album","standard":"Tunde Adebimpe’s solo debut faced a long, hard road to fruition. In the wake of TV on the Radio going on hiatus in 2019, Adebimpe’s efforts were stalled by the pandemic, label disinterest, and, most tragically, the death of his sister Jumoke. By happenstance, <i>Thee Black Boltz</i> arrives in the midst of TV on the Radio’s reunion campaign, and if lead single “Magnetic” had been released under the TVOTR banner, no one would bat an eye: The song boasts a minimalist electro-punk sound that harkens back to the band’s early-2000s days in the Brooklyn DIY scene, and a buzzing energy that will satisfy anyone who regularly dials up the band’s raging performance of “Wolf Like Me” on Letterman when they need an instant adrenaline boost.\n\nBut <i>Thee Black Boltz</i>  is, naturally, a much more personal statement than TVOTR’s definitive life-during-wartime addresses. It’s distinguished not just by its open displays of grief (see: “ILY,” aka “I Love You,” a tender acoustic elegy for Jumoke), but in its defiant embrace of joy: “Somebody New” channels the pure discotheque ecstasy of mid-’80s New Order, while the stuttering synth-pop of “The Most” wraps its heartwarming sentiments in twinkling psychedelic flourishes and a mid-song flip of Wayne Smith’s dancehall classic “Under Me Sleng Teng.”","short":"The TV on the Radio singer tunes into his own personal frequency."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thee-black-boltz/1776991687","playParams":{"id":"1776991687","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0MuAR8zcmZyGAwJcnkCpV1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1776991687/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"42056930","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/42056930?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744992536340}}},"1780380016":{"id":"1780380016","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1780380016?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/87/ed/c5/87edc5c4-0ac8-da69-cbce-6329b364479f/c3495903-9f31-4a0f-bc65-6f06922d38ef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9aa2a7","textColor2":"dba695","textColor4":"b0877c","textColor1":"c0c7ca","bgColor":"020c1b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/23/33/cd/2333cdaf-ff87-ff44-99da-b30c3adf6aab/db5d4bd4-34a5-46c3-b346-fb464c973bd4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2a303b","textColor2":"231916","textColor4":"3d3431","textColor1":"0a1423","bgColor":"a9a29d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5c/44/d3/5c44d33f-66ad-4a12-85f8-f67ba1358822/5c86b192-0b43-410b-af87-d2c3cfef278c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"443f3b","textColor2":"222220","textColor4":"45423e","textColor1":"211e1c","bgColor":"d2c5b7","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/davido/254654363","name":"5ive","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Davido","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cd/0c/91/cd0c917a-e1a0-2592-a3a1-529796e19ea9/196872682564.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"442623","textColor2":"432403","textColor4":"604325","textColor1":"200000","bgColor":"d5c0af","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Five is freedom, unbound by borders/Rising by lifting others/The artist, the father; the man walking two worlds.” These words, written and performed by Nigerian poet Alhanislam, not only form part of the overture to Davido’s fifth studio album, but also offer insight into the mind and methodology of an artist who’s been at the forefront of African music for over a decade.\n\nDavido frames 2025’s <i>5ive</i> as something of a victory lap, not just for his own pursuits, but for the entire contemporary African soundscape. “This is definitely about celebrating the longevity and how far we’ve come,” he tells Apple Music. “It’s been a long, long journey. Afrobeats is in an amazing place. Everybody’s doing well, all the way from South Africa to Ghana to Nigeria. For us to have risen and taken this culture and the music to such heights—we have our own categories at the Grammys, at the Billboard Awards; we have our own festivals selling out more than the festivals in America. It’s crazy. Because of the nature of the whole genre, everybody’s messing with the culture. So every album is to push Afrobeats further.” \n\nHere, he’s as intentional as ever about eliminating gaps between cultures and sounds altogether, employing even more of the sonic fusions that permeated his 2023 album <i>Timeless</i>. The distinctive log drum of South Africa’s amapiano again features heavily here, along with fusions incorporating Caribbean and Latin styles—woven together with the red thread of Afrobeats and clever nods to African classics. “I love bringing different worlds to mine,” Davido explains, and he does so here through collaborations with Victoria Monét, Shenseea, Tayc, and Dadju; recurring guest stars Chris Brown, Musa Keys, and producers Shizzi, Marvey Muzique, and DJ Maphorisa; rising Jamaican star 450; and homegrown Nigerian heroes like ODUMODUBLVCK, Omah Lay, and Chike. Here, he talks through key tracks from <i>5ive</i>. \n\n<b>“Anything”</b>\n“This is a song you play before you run the Olympics. That’s a song you play before you get on a soccer pitch, the finals, Champions League. That’s a song you play before you do a final exam as a lawyer—it’s an inspirational song just to motivate you to action. Apart from inspirational stuff that we’re talking about on the record, it also kind of solidifies my longevity in the game and how long I’ve been here and how long I’ve still been able to do it. I’ve seen artists come and go and I’m still able to be here.”\n\n<b>“Be There Still”</b>\n“Shout-out to [co-producer] DJ Maphorisa; shout-out to South Africa; shout-out to my boy [co-producer] Marvey Muzique. I’ve always had a strong place in my heart for South Africa, because apart from Nigeria, South Africa was one of the countries to accept my music and push me, put money in my pocket, book me. ‘Be There Still’ is definitely about my longevity in the game, how long we’ve been here. Anywhere the money is going to be, anywhere success is going to be, I’m going to be there. Anywhere you see good things, anywhere you’re looking for n***as at the top, you’re going to see me.”\n\n<b>“Offa Me” (feat. Victoria Monét)</b>\n“If you ask me, it’s going to be one of the biggest records on the album. Victoria Monét—I met her at the 2024 Grammys, and she won three awards that night. She was on fire. And I feel like this record is the perfect matchup of what she does and what I do.”\n\n<b>“R&B” (feat. Shenseea & 450)</b>\n“I love the Caribbean, and I’ve done a lot of shows there. ‘R&B’ is produced by my boy Jonn P. I know people know Shenseea, but a lot of people back home might not have heard of 450. But he’s the new guy. He’s the new hot guy going crazy; he’s amazing. I’m excited to show him to Africa and to the world and just mix our worlds together.”\n\n<b>“Awuke” (with YG Marley)</b>\n “Shout-out to Jamaica, YG Marley. Like I said, I love bringing the two worlds together. What I loved about that record was the process, the making of the song and the making of the video. YG came to Nigeria for the first time; [it was his] first time being in Africa, him and his uncles, and I think his brother. I love when these artists come to my home and I show them, like, ‘Yo, this place is not that bad.’ You know what I’m saying? It’s kind of lit. And every time they come, they end up not even wanting to leave.”\n\n<b>“Holy Water” (feat. Victony & Musa Keys)</b>\n“Me and Musa Keys together [on 2023’s ‘UNAVAILABLE’]—we probably have the biggest songs of our career. For me, apart from collaborating with these people, they’re actually family. Musa ended up laying some ideas on the beat, and then me and Victony finished up the song. They’re just two strong, hardworking individuals that are going crazy right now. There’s nothing wrong in learning stuff from the newer generation. Look how Drake has done it. Even DJ Maphorisa, he’s still tapping in with the new producers. So I’ve never had a problem, and that’s probably why I’ve lasted so long, because a lot of people have a problem with tapping in. Just because I’ve done stadiums around the world, it doesn’t mean I don’t have a listening ear or don’t mean I still can’t learn. So I’m always open, and I never feel too big, because the music is bigger than all of us. What we’re trying to attain is bigger than all of us.”\n\n<b>“Nuttin Dey”</b>\n“This is a typical Nigerian record—it’s like my version of ‘Every Little Thing Gonna Be Alright’ [Bob Marley’s 1977 hit “Three Little Birds”]. When we say ‘nuttin dey’ in my country, it means ‘no problem.’ It’s like, ‘We’re good; everything is chill, everything is nice.’ So that’s the vibe of that record. And shout-out to Selebobo, an OG music producer from Nigeria that hasn’t been active in a while, and I met up with him in America. And then we got back in the studio and did that.”\n\n<b>“Titanium” (feat. Chris Brown)</b>\n“You know what’s crazy? Chris Brown has been on my last four albums. That’s my brother. When you do music with your brothers, with your family that you both care about, nah, it’s always going to work. Just that moment with me and him in South Africa performing to the biggest crowds of our careers [in 2024]…it’s crazy.\n\n<b>“Lately”</b>\n“You know when you sing depressing songs, but the songs are so good you have to dance? It’s really talking about a lot of things I was going through—a lot of smiling through sadness—and it was really talking about, ‘God, please save me. I have to be strong for everybody.’ And I’ve been in those type of situations where I’m not really strong mentally at that point, but then I have to act like everything is okay, for everybody else to be okay. It’s really a depressing record that bangs heavy.”\n\n<b>“Funds” (feat. ODUMODUBLVCK & Chike)</b>\n“I remember when they first played me the sample [of Brenda Fassie’s 1997 hit ‘Vuli Ndlela’] and I was like, ‘How we’re going to flip this?’ I’m not really a big fan of sampling music, but sampling Brenda Fassie is legendary. It was just amazing to see how we could just bring two worlds together. I’m Yoruba, and then Chike is Igbo, and then you bring in Brenda Fassie’s [South African] spice into that too—nah, I always knew it was going to <i>go</i>.”\n\n<b>“With You” (feat. Omah Lay)</b>\n“I remember when Kai Cenat came to Nigeria [in 2024], he was on a livestream, and then I took him out in my car. And when he was in the car, he was like, ‘Oh, what song is this?’ And it was Omah Lay’s song playing. I think the next day Omah Lay tweeted, ‘Wow, I thought Davido hated me.’ I’m like, ‘Hated you? Why would you think I hate you? I love your music. What you talking about?’ He was like, ‘Oh,’ he didn’t know. So I was like, ‘Yo, we got to get in studio.’ I don’t put no ego before my music. And I know this one is top three for me. So shout-out to Omah Lay. I feel like that’s going to be a big record for us.”\n","short":"Davido toasts to evolution: “This is about celebrating how far we’ve

Album","standard":"Long before shoegaze and grunge became the rock music favored by young listeners in the mid-2020s, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, quartet Superheaven were reimagining the ’90s genres for a more modern age. The band quickly built an audience with their 2013 and 2015 albums, <i>Jar</i> and <i>Ours is Chrome</i>. After a lengthy hiatus, they reemerged with 2025’s self-titled third album, a project that finds them in the middle of a shoegaze renaissance, though with a newfound perspective. “Cruel Times” plays with the crunching guitar fuzz of alt-rock giants like Dinosaur Jr. and Built to Spill, while “Humans for Toys” is a heavy headbanger built around chugging chords mostly heard on metal ballads. As the band’s once-preferred sound became a fan favorite among a new crop of musicians, Superheaven cleverly adjusted their POV, creating a wider landscape of rock stylings than ever before.","short":"The shoegaze revivalists return after a decade-long hiatus."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/superheaven/1782953369","playParams":{"id":"1782953369","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3PAgZaonECR1PGhRg3YBVX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1782953369/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"899726705","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/899726705?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744966719367}}},"1785985202":{"id":"1785985202","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1785985202?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b2/16/83/b21683bd-d2ce-02e2-8bc5-86de905d48d6/Jobee72d3d9-f5f5-41df-82f3-40d152636b93-184314782-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_360449413_2029951785-Time1737580945902.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f2d915"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"443427"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d4d8d8","textColor2":"f2d915","textColor4":"d3c020","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"443427","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/64/32/91/64329193-92ad-1de0-3b06-8a06175c1786/f4625da1-14ce-4640-a211-1921ceb46efc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"8998a0","textColor2":"ccb391","textColor4":"a59074","textColor1":"a8bdc8","bgColor":"0d0200","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/d7/e6/a0/d7e6a01c-6238-34d7-9599-228c075ecdb8/Job15896eeb-247c-4d70-8332-a4de1adea6f5-183785435-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_359376494_2021921434-Time1736943651900.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cad3c8","textColor2":"9bdbef","textColor4":"8fc2d0","textColor1":"e4f0e5","bgColor":"605d55","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/70/e9/ab/70e9abf0-791b-5403-c622-db6ac6243c2f/acbfdaf4-14f7-4d1c-a434-c0ee1fee5970.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3d5dc","textColor2":"c6e9fd","textColor4":"b2cedd","textColor1":"dbf1fc","bgColor":"61625d","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/21/15/6f/21156f84-bf71-380a-e519-98e8b7cdd8e7/e6c463a5-0628-48cf-81eb-1bc0d4c6b109.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a9a4a0","textColor2":"d4b49c","textColor4":"ad9380","textColor1":"cfc8c4","bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trousdale/1534241692","name":"Growing Pains","artistName":"Trousdale","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/71/b9/28/71b92806-2eaf-ee3d-7260-a79edb4db6c6/199066303610.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0cbd2","textColor2":"e6ddda","textColor4":"c9c1bd","textColor1":"c7e9f5","bgColor":"545149","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Trousdale is one of the more delightfully uncategorizable acts to break into country music in recent memory. Composed of friends-turned-collaborators Quinn D’Andrea, Georgia Greene, and Lauren Jones, the Southern California-based trio first found acclaim posting an eclectic assortment of cover videos online, attracting fans with unorthodox takes on songs by the Eagles, ABBA, and everyone in between. On this sophomore outing, the group shows off their songwriting and arranging chops across a dozen tracks, crafting a sound that lands somewhere between HAIM and The Chicks. \n\nThe album opens with its title track, a rollicking two-stepper with harmonies for days. On “Over and Over,” the trio experiments with singing in unison, pulling off that deceptively tough feat with brightness and joy. The soaring harmonies of “Death Grip” recall Little Big Town or Nickel Creek, while “Don’t Tell Me” once again finds the group singing as a unit, this time adding subtle harmonies that create texture and depth.

As he releases this follow-up, Pardi is also on the cusp of turning 40, and the resulting music finds him in a more contemplative place than on past releases. While there’s no shortage of booze or bad ideas across the album’s 17 tracks, Pardi also dips into more serious territory, like exploring parenthood on the tear-jerking ballad “She Drives Away” and pushing the party too far on the down-and-out “Gamblin’ Man.”\n\n“I feel like this album is less party and a lot of soul, but it’s still party and dancing,” he tells Apple Music. “There’s lots of layers to this album, I think. There’s some big songs that are going to feel more personable to the listener than my other albums.” Other highlights on <i>Honkytonk Hollywood</i> include opener “Boots Off,” a cheeky, retro ode to knocking boots, and penultimate track “Who I Don’t Wanna Be,” a gritty, melodic exploration of regret and redemption. Pardi closes the collection with “Kinda Wanna Keep It That Way,” a slinky, soulful celebration of going against the grain. Below, he shares insight into several key tracks. \n\n<b>“Boots Off”</b>\n“I didn’t have a bootjack, and regardless, if you got nice boots, they’re not vented, so your feet get hot. If everything gets a little swollen or whatever, it’s a little harder to get the boots off. And then I thought about, well, we were trying to get it on, and I’m over here trying to get my boots off. I can’t get my boots off quick enough. That’s how I came up with that whole hook. And it was funny: I was like, ‘Man, we were just trying to get it on. You’re stuck trying to get your boots off.’ Made for a good song.”\n\n<b>“Gamblin’ Man”</b>\n“‘Gamblin’ Man’ is a hard song. It’s about loss, more than just losing a girl. It’s about losing yourself into something that took everything and just making mistakes. And my favorite line in ‘Gamblin’ Man’ [is], ‘Yeah, they keep on bringing them drinks.’ It’s talking about [how when] you [are] gambling, you get the free drinks. It don’t cost you any money, but they sure ain’t free. I love that line, and it’s like you can put that to anything. Yeah, a little bit too much of it, it comes with a cost.”\n\n<b>“She Drives Away”</b>\n“We always try to sell the drink and the beer and the good time and dancing, and this is my first dad song and a parent song. There’s so many parents out there and so many newborn babies, and it’s nice to have a little theme song for the girl dads out there. I’m still thinking I might see it at some weddings, some father-daughter dances.”","short":"From Mr. Saturday Night to Girl Dad: “There’s lots of layers to this album.“"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/honkytonk-hollywood/1786260133","playParams":{"id":"1786260133","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1eDL4Z6TcdCDul9hip9WiS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1786260133/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"371085834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/371085834?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744985509249}}},"1789543295":{"id":"1789543295","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789543295?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/17/16/1c/17161c4c-bb60-f3cc-830e-db96ee42dc13/Job058172f7-3289-49bf-8252-4d1d1fe04333-185188759-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362299576_2044107449-Time1738765750131.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"3c190a","textColor2":"191a1b","textColor4":"462515","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fd5000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0f/5d/dc/0f5ddcc4-f982-5223-57c7-a9a0b3bc4a9f/7b735606-0a3a-4e05-985e-828f30430b3b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dfd5da","textColor2":"e9d8f7","textColor4":"d3bdda","textColor1":"f8f6f7","bgColor":"7c5267","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/08/58/2b/08582b7e-58bf-af34-159a-2ced21cf585f/Job31c5eff9-1e93-4ed4-b41d-7cfee202c428-185141789-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362203326_2043324437-Time1738709968804.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"321000","textColor2":"181a1b","textColor4":"462515","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fd5000","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/94/fc/bc/94fcbc70-67aa-8cb1-5f50-83311caa0e3e/29d54888-6b3b-4e1c-a119-79c92399954d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ded1ce","textColor2":"f9d5c8","textColor4":"e4b8a8","textColor1":"f1f5f8","bgColor":"904224","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1c/7e/81/1c7e81e6-09a3-6a71-e89a-c4069a817ec5/2b4a7a23-7e3b-4c0b-86db-87237da3f3f9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"39170a","textColor2":"110703","textColor4":"3c180a","textColor1":"0d0502","bgColor":"eb5f29","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1033453223-610120875","name":"Send A Prayer My Way","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Julien Baker & TORRES","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/ce/a8/71cea801-d939-0b28-fdbb-93ab563d5acc/191401210874.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"321000","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"462414","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fe5100","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"This first joint project from boundary-pushing indie artists Julien Baker and TORRES is many years in the making. The two initially met at a show in 2016 and kept in touch, and during the pandemic lockdown they talked about making a collaborative country record—specifically, a queer country record. Five years later—and on the heels of Baker’s <i>other</i> indie all-star team-up in boygenius—<i>Send a Prayer My Way</i> makes good on that long-gestating idea and marks the latest entry in an exciting and energizing series of country releases from queer artists, like Chappell Roan and Fancy Hagood, unafraid to take up space in a traditionally conservative and gatekeeping genre. TORRES, aka Mackenzie Scott, tells Apple Music that trust was essential to the pair’s writing and recording processes. “We both just followed our gut instinct on this one,” Scott says. “And both of our gut instincts said to let the other person do their thing and not try and interfere too much, and not try to control the process so much that we were creating an environment where we were trying to make the other person do something that they didn’t want to do.”\n\nCo-produced with Sarah Tudzin of Illuminati Hotties, <i>Send a Prayer My Way</i> opens on a quiet note with “Dirt,” a delicate ballad about heartbreak and regret accented by mournful fiddle from Balmorhea’s Aisha Burns. The playfully titled “The Only Marble I’ve Got Left” livens up the mood, with Baker and TORRES serving up a darkly sweet love song about trying to stay sane in a world gone mad. “Downhill Both Ways” is a mesmerizing showcase of the pair’s harmonies, as Baker’s soft lilt counters TORRES’s sturdy tone. “Tuesday” digs into the more difficult side of the queer experience, as TORRES sings of falling for a girl whose “mama caught wind that her daughter’s friend might be of the wrong persuasion.” \n\nAnd it wouldn’t be a country record without a drinking song or two, with “Bottom of a Bottle” checking all the boxes: lost faith, a lost woman, and an empty glass bottle. Scott, whose original demo was slower and more mournful, was worried Baker might not be into it. The fact that her worries were unfounded turned out to be a vote of confidence in the strength of their collaboration. “She took it and ran with it,” Scott says. “God, she transformed the song. The piano especially—the piano that you hear on the song is Julien. It breaks my heart.”","short":"Two indie giants team up to honor and subvert country-music conventions."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/send-a-prayer-my-way/1789543295","playParams":{"id":"1789543295","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7wVTqZ02NOssDk9xfo9Imf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789543295/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1033453223","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1033453223?l=en-US"},{"id":"610120875","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/610120875?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744985214284}}},"1789576747":{"id":"1789576747","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789576747?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alot/1062768851","name":"Latinos En Nueva York -

Four albums and 18 years after <i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i>, <i>SABLE, fABLE</i> is a document of finding peace—joy, even—and a testament to the work it’s taken to get there. “This record, as much as that first record, if not more, was really just a keystone for healing and growing away from this time period where I felt trapped,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Once COVID wiped out the tour plans for 2019’s <i>i,i</i>, Vernon, like pretty much everyone, used the time to take stock, and he came to understand, among other things, that touring might not be the healthiest thing for him. So he made songs.\n\n“It really was like, ‘Okay, I’m not well and I won't make it if I don't do something to change this pretty drastically and stop the whole touring engine,” Vernon says. “There was a sense of relief and an incredible grief to say goodbye to the team that we built. I was like, ‘Let me just get these songs done and just sneak them out there so I can just get them off my chest,’ because that’s what I really needed: to finish them, to learn what was inside them.” The first of these songs, written at the beginning of lockdown, “THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS” is a snapshot of that lonely, uncertain time, but it feels bigger and more hopeful than that to Vernon with five years of hindsight. “In the short term, it makes you feel better, but it’s also a way to lean into your grief and lean into your pain and lean into your guilt,” he says. “I think eventually when I hear that song now, I feel clean from everything that I was dealing with when I had to write it and after I wrote it. But it takes years for things to take shape and for internal things to budge.”\n\nFrom there, the album begins to let more light in with songs like the evidently more hopeful “Everything Is Peaceful Love” (“It’s just all about celebrating this moment right here and just sort of trying to express that heart-leaping-out-of-your-chest feeling”) and “If Only I Could Wait,” featuring vocals from Danielle Haim of HAIM, which Vernon considers nothing less than his favorite American rock band. The album splits the difference between the immediacy of <i>For Emma</i> and the often inscrutable maximalism of <i>22, A Million</i> and <i>i,i</i>. It was during the album’s long gestation that Vernon’s profile was boosted by his work with Taylor Swift, even as his own project remained in the shadows, Vernon exercising a patience and restraint and creating a healthier perspective that was nothing less than career-saving, if not life-saving. \n\n“We are insanely beautiful creatures,” he says. “And so I think where I’ve got to with the simplicity of this music, it was just like, I just want to give it to you. I just want to have it be my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind’—just boom, here it is. We’re not going to hide, we’re not going to put it behind any drapery. We’re going to just give it to you as much as humanly possible.”\n","short":"Justin Vernon returns with “my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind.’”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sable-fable/1791161215","playParams":{"id":"1791161215","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3L3UjpXtom6T0Plt1j6l1T"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791161215/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"273428126","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/273428126?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744966634903}}},"1791279584":{"id":"1791279584","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791279584?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/human-rebellion/1593792531","name":"Alien Radio - EP","artistName":"Human Rebellion","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fd/11/de/fd11de88-f248-fafd-49b6-742dc9bb195d/8718723278041.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfcfce","textColor2":"ceccc7","textColor4":"a8a7a1","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"11100b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/alien-radio-ep/1791279584","playParams":{"id":"1791279584","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791279584/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1593792531","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1593792531?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744949730196}}},"1791584338":{"id":"1791584338","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791584338?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sieren/510513451","name":"Emergence","artistName":"Sieren","artwork":{"width":4284,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f8/b4/49/f8b449a0-47c0-2447-c0a4-6c795d257e70/4062548109689.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4284,"textColor3":"382c26","textColor2":"2d1f10","textColor4":"534633","textColor1":"0b0000","bgColor":"ebdfc1","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/emergence/1791584338","playParams":{"id":"1791584338","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0cw1jXcFM6cmW3oApTbx8g"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791584338/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"510513451","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/510513451?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744947615998}}},"1791694356":{"id":"1791694356","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791694356?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/avery-friedman/1776990693","name":"New Thing","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Avery Friedman","artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/16/6f/6c/166f6c40-939a-4bd8-45f9-bd20e86b0279/5050580842984.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"a6988f","textColor2":"d6b3aa","textColor4":"ae948e","textColor1":"ccb8ab","bgColor":"0d191d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-thing/1791694356","playParams":{"id":"1791694356","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7s0JL3zSGMkKcUBj7F8NAl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791694356/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1776990693","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1776990693?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1743920490470}}},"1791887824":{"id":"1791887824","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791887824?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Folk","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/eb/b7/99/ebb7993b-2028-016c-738d-8a60a8d416ed/25017c7c-db64-4430-b635-d40279a477a9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9da09c","textColor2":"d6a389","textColor4":"ad836e","textColor1":"c3c7c3","bgColor":"080603","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=271874135-1457130373","name":"What Did the Blackbird Say to the Crow","artistName":"Rhiannon Giddens & Justin Robinson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5b/14/2f/5b142fbc-6c1d-29b5-36c2-19a8ecd8247e/075597896770.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"323334","textColor2":"1f2128","textColor4":"43464c","textColor1":"09090a","bgColor":"d6dadd","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Though they disbanded over a decade ago, Carolina Chocolate Drops remain an important touchstone in American old-time and roots music. The launching pad for multi-hyphenate Rhiannon Giddens—whose mile-long list of accolades includes not just a Pulitzer Prize but a MacArthur Genius Grant and a string of Grammys—the band found vital intersection points between the Americana music of the day and African American traditions. This reunion between Giddens and fellow former Chocolate Drop Justin Robinson picks up some of the conversational threads left at the band’s hiatus, while showcasing how both artists have evolved and expanded their perspectives in the intervening years.\n\nA mix of instrumental and vocal tunes, <i>What Did the Blackbird Say to the Crow</i> was inspired in large part by Piedmont fiddler and Black string-band pioneer Joe Thompson, who mentored the Carolina Chocolate Drops until his passing in 2012. With Giddens on banjo and Robinson on fiddle, there is no shortage of virtuosity on display, though the pair favors the narrative and thematic needs of each song, particularly the traditional numbers, which were arranged by Thompson. Highlights include a rousing take on “John Henry,” which crackles with an electricity typically only heard in live performances (the pair recorded much of the LP live and outdoors), and “Marching Jaybird,” an Etta Baker tune the pair was able to record at the late Baker’s own home.","short":"The former Carolina Chocolate Drops pick up where the band left off."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-did-the-blackbird-say-to-the-crow/1791887824","playParams":{"id":"1791887824","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/27X6vmJ0YmKi9ydl0aM65m"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791887824/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"271874135","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/271874135?l=en-US"},{"id":"1457130373","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1457130373?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744985331245}}},"1792436986":{"id":"1792436986","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792436986?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hieroglyphic-being/73111707","name":"Dance Music 4 Bad People","artistName":"Hieroglyphic Being","artwork":{"width":1434,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/dd/fd/24/ddfd24b2-2e85-5925-b09d-5be3590bd178/51864.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1434,"textColor3":"381b05","textColor2":"170e08","textColor4":"421f06","textColor1":"0a0907","bgColor":"ef6200","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dance-music-4-bad-people/1792436986","playParams":{"id":"1792436986","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6PuN8mmEo3GGOmGkEYwigY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792436986/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"73111707","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/73111707?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744950561853}}},"1792871690":{"id":"1792871690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792871690?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Classical Crossover","Music","Classical","New Age","Nature","Worldwide","Worldbeat","Jazz","Smooth Jazz"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/76/62/e4/7662e4f1-a1d2-996e-f2ae-8df3f4bf09e3/Job606710fc-4561-48ff-b080-c221a4eae8d3-185178907-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362277478_2043948431-Time1738755607334.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","c0dfae"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c2bfaf","textColor2":"c0dfae","textColor4":"a1ba93","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cc/7f/6b/cc7f6b76-b49e-51f8-d353-1386ecc9cd0e/a5911b4d-a723-423a-84d8-7cfaf7265e95.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a99f9c","textColor2":"d6b398","textColor4":"b0947f","textColor1":"cdc2bd","bgColor":"17151a","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/df/fc/50/dffc5056-48eb-5a28-3730-b95505f7e2ca/Job468923c1-e74d-47b5-b089-d5d02adae182-185178906-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_362277477_2043948432-Time1738754734328.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","cfc1ab"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bfbeb2","textColor2":"cfc1ab","textColor4":"aca290","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=240003-1792855944-212934991","name":"Stewart Copeland: Wild Concerto","artistName":"Stewart Copeland, Kingdom Orchestra & Troy Miller","artwork":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/aa/c7/4f/aac74fbc-bef9-8933-ca74-7378eeeb4c86/5059449207193.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bbaea7","textColor2":"d3c3ac","textColor4":"b1a493","textColor1":"dfcfc4","bgColor":"2b2a31","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"If ever there was a sign that former Police drummer and film composer Stewart Copeland had been given free rein to go wild then it’s here in this 12-movement Concerto, in which the soloists are plucked from the animal kingdom. Drawing on the extensive archive of British sound recordist and environmentalist Martyn Stewart, Copeland samples birdsong and animal calls from around the world—from the whistling of white-throated sparrows to the laughs of hyenas—and fuses them with the traditional instruments of a 30-piece orchestra, with Copeland on percussion. “A true ornithologist would hear this and say, ‘Wait a minute: what’s that red-breasted nuthatch doing so close to its predator, all singing nicely together?’” Copeland tells Apple Music Classical. “These animals would probably be eating each other in the real world.”\n\nPlayful humor runs abound in Copeland’s jazzy work, where you’ll hear the comical chorus of frogs alongside elephantine brass, and a sax that sounds as throaty as a Galapagos seal in one track and howls like a wolf in another. The work’s overall narrative is loosely inspired by the epic journey of the Arctic tern, which migrates every year from its breeding grounds in the North Pole to Antarctica: you can almost feel the temperature drop as the tropical “Screaming Piha” of the fifth movement gives way to the freezing winds and shivering tremolo strings of “Penguins in the World of Antarctica.” But there is more going on here than simple storytelling.\n\nWhat interests Copeland is the way in which we make sense of the sounds we hear. “When you have a bird singing like the white-throated sparrow, it goes ‘tweet, tweet, tweet,’” he says. “It has articulation. It has contours. It goes up and down. It has a rhythm of sorts, although it’s not a consistent rhythm that you could dance to, but those elements are sort of implied. If you put a flute next to that sparrow, or a trombone next to that howling wolf, your ear connects the atonality of the animal with the tonality of the musical instrument; your mind joins them together. And that’s what this album is all about, that fun thing that the brain does with sound and attaching melody to it.”\n\nBuilt up over six decades, Martyn Stewart’s sound archive comprises more than 30,000 hours of material including more than 3,500 bird species alone. How did Copeland go about choosing which animals to include in his musical menagerie? “First, there are the background sounds,” he explains—ambient noises such as a huge flock of birds taking off, or the sound of the howling wind, which create atmosphere. Then there are the rhythmic sounds: “in the redwoods, there’s one bird that just goes, ‘whoop, whoop, whoop.’” And then, adds Copeland, there are “the divas of the animal kingdom, like the sparrow or the wolf who have a lead melody, which in music we call the top line. And breaking it down into those three categories is sort of my method.”\n\nWorking with “found sounds” is nothing new for Copeland—you’ll hear the clack of billiard balls and hoot of car horns in his score for Francis Ford Coppola’s <i>Rumble Fish</i>, and barking dogs evoking the dog-eat-dog world of Oliver Stone’s <i>Wall Street</i>. And while orchestration is something Copeland’s still getting used to (“I have to squint a little bit harder than people who have been looking at dots their whole lives”), the musical ideas come easily to him. “Once the imagination takes over, and the juices start flowing, the music arises,” he says. “I don’t know where it comes from; it just sort of appears, and I’m very thankful for that.”","short":"Stewart Copeland on making music with the “divas of the animal

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Fancy Hagood can do it all. The Nashville-based singer-songwriter’s 2021 debut <i>Southern Curiosity</i> was a surprising and inventive mix of rootsy folk pop and queered, left-of-center country that remains delightfully uncategorizable. On this sophomore album, though, Hagood goes all in on ’90s country, channeling genre legends like Brooks & Dunn and Reba McEntire to infectious effect. There’s a stacked roster of co-writers, too, including Nashville mainstays Caitlyn Smith and Mindy Smith as well as actor and musician Mary Steenburgen.\n\n<i>American Spirit</i> opens with “Ever Really Ready,” a Jarrad K (Ruston Kelly, Lucie Silvas) co-write about opening up to love after heartbreak. It’s a sweet, wistful song with ample room for Hagood to show subtler shades of his versatile voice. The title track uses the metaphor of an American Spirit cigarette to explore the darker edges of a secret romance, telling of “white lies in a talking town.” Hagood taps Michelle Branch to join him on “Isn’t That Life,” a laid-back, rootsy number well suited to Branch’s rich and agile voice. And on “The Chase,” Hagood gets an assist from all-star folk act Watkins Family Hour, the long-running side project of siblings and Nickel Creek members Sean and Sara Watkins.\n\nOn this deluxe edition, Hagood adds five new tracks, including the closing Mindy Smith and Maia Sharp collaboration, “Where Rainbows Never Die.” That one is a cover of beloved bluegrass outfit The SteelDrivers, who, famously, once boasted Chris Stapleton as lead vocalist. Stapleton co-wrote “Where Rainbows Never Die” for the band’s 2010 album <i>Reckless</i>, and Hagood is one of a handful of vocalists working in Nashville today who can fill the space left by the country superstar’s larger-than-life voice. Other highlights from The Last Drag additions include the Tom Petty-esque “High On You,” which Hagood co-wrote with critically acclaimed Nashville songwriter Caroline Spence, and “The Mountains,” a sweetly hopeful ode to dreamers who get by “on a prayer and the stars in [their] eyes.”","short":"The Nashville genre-bender goes all in on ’90s country on his second album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-spirit-the-last-drag/1797657471","playParams":{"id":"1797657471","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5hSvIpAkDp9nH2ER2vUoXP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797657471/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"859825960","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/859825960?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744985587282}}},"1797858576":{"id":"1797858576","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797858576?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/d1/ee/61/d1ee61ea-b7c2-769b-7948-ae8199eafcc8/27ce7831-52a6-4d6c-91d2-ab20a41aac1b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b19f90","textColor2":"dfb399","textColor4":"b5967f","textColor1":"dabeae","bgColor":"0f2316","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hope-darst/401473983","name":"In The Mighty Name","artistName":"Hope Darst","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/da/79/0dda795a-ae60-ec2b-2dd9-0407f3c9b963/196872896213.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"babbbb","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor4":"a7a8a8","textColor1":"e8e8e8","bgColor":"040a08","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Songs of praise in a glorious live setting from the Nashville artist."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-the-mighty-name/1797858576","playParams":{"id":"1797858576","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4NGCMiRdOYidxN21uvc6XP"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797858576/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"401473983","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/401473983?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744953195315}}},"1798418656":{"id":"1798418656","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798418656?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-lily/1403002091","name":"Enterprise Exploitation Goals -

In a tale as old as rock ’n’ roll, though, their bond dimmed in a fog of miscommunication and weariness. By 2019, the band had been indefinitely decommissioned as they worked on solo projects and contended with personal upheaval, including Vincent losing his partner to cancer in 2020 and Holman living with OCD. However, when Blur sounded them out towards the end of 2022 about a support slot at Wembley the following summer, it catalyzed the gentle steps Holman and Vincent had been taking towards a reunion. Beginning to write together again, they changed their name to SOFT PLAY, having reflected on criticism they’d regularly faced as two white males trading under the name Slaves. \n\n<i>HEAVIER JELLY</i>, the deluxe version of <i>HEAVY JELLY</i> with six extra tracks, is the sound of a band revitalized by recovering the joy and love in their friendship. “We’re obviously older and have gone through some shit, and in a way life is totally different now,” Holman told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in May 2024. “But we found the original recipe and it just feels like super fun again. We’re not thinking about anybody else—we’re just enjoying having a laugh together and making some tunes, and it feels like good stuff’s coming out of that.”\n\nNowhere is that more obvious than on “Punk’s Dead.” When they announced their new name on social media in December 2022, it raised anger in some corners of the comments sections, and here, against pummeling riffs, they turn an amusing flamethrower on themselves as well as people whose punk fundamentalism became reactionary foot-stamping. “I don’t like change,” spits Holman, mocking the outrage. “Punk’s dead/Pushing up daisies/Come and get a load of these PC babies.” To pour a bit more fuel on the ire, they then invite Robbie Williams to sing the middle eight while some of their critics read out their Instagram comments to the sound of a crying child. \n\nThis is the duo’s heaviest-sounding record to date, embracing a childhood love of nu metal on “Mirror Muscles,” a tale of feeling intimidated and inadequate in the gym. It’s also their most vulnerable. Holman examines his OCD on “Worms on Tarmac” and “Isaac Is Typing…” while folk-rock closer “Everything and Nothing” is a heart-grabbing study of grief. However heavy the jelly gets, though, there’s always that playful humor to leaven the taste. Speaking to Lowe about writing “Act Violently”—a profane outburst of excessive rage inspired by the pair almost being knocked over by an e-scooter—Vincent said, “You have to give yourselves permission to write the song, and it was similar back in the day when we wrote [2014 single] ‘Where’s Your Car Debbie?’: You see a wry smile from the other guy and you think, ‘Can we actually get away with this?’ And then, when you’re in a good place—which we weren’t before now—we can give each other permission to write the song.”","short":"The playful punks give HEAVY JELLY extra weight with six new tracks."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heavier-jelly/1800251529","playParams":{"id":"1800251529","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Rz31xgqFQGTlkABzhv7Qo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800251529/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1001361901","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1001361901?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744952997960}}},"1800792041":{"id":"1800792041","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800792041?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":28,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alcatrazz/220048269","name":"All Night Long Live In Japan 2019 - The Complete Concert","artistName":"Alcatrazz","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0b/03/29/0b03290f-8328-f3d8-cbbc-0a3c5ce92a7d/5034644533032.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bac5c1","textColor2":"e8908d","textColor4":"bb7a77","textColor1":"e7eee9","bgColor":"072420","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-night-long-live-in-japan-2019-the-complete-concert/1800792041","playParams":{"id":"1800792041","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5bTq5ddyzBiKchkvDtllZo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800792041/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"220048269","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/220048269?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744947657911}}},"1800832417":{"id":"1800832417","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800832417?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e5/01/35/e5013501-b5a9-c7fe-9a1c-f7bdd3f3be26/Job28d9d349-9ce4-413a-b562-3a1f2004affd-187751881-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367595731_2083262379-Time1741718541231.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","0e0500"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"69420b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"331b00","textColor2":"0e0500","textColor4":"351d00","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"69420b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e4/73/73/e4737366-627c-4e12-c91a-12ff6e905239/97dc7e61-35c7-429d-a4c8-bf76db622a71.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dcccbf","textColor2":"f7e5ba","textColor4":"e0c69a","textColor1":"f2ede8","bgColor":"844b1d","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/62/a2/76/62a276f3-1984-d713-ba1d-0151b1ae165b/Job72baff33-78bc-401e-9d53-cd2958f836c9-187751882-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367595730_2083262380-Time1741719798821.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","0d0400"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"69420b"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"372103","textColor2":"0d0400","textColor4":"382103","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"69420b","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/5d/60/e5/5d60e593-6e39-9c0d-93f8-addb5831dcf9/5c99eed1-8d1a-4076-af40-6416166c4b97.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"302414","textColor2":"15110c","textColor4":"302416","textColor1":"15110a","bgColor":"9e6f3d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jp-saxe/663417013","name":"Articulate Excuses","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"JP Saxe","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/45/e9/8d/45e98dba-dbf0-68bc-246c-c367685eace3/196872953497.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"341d00","textColor2":"0d0500","textColor4":"361f00","textColor1":"0a0300","bgColor":"de8800","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Throughout his career, LA-via-Toronto singer-songwriter JP Saxe has struck a delicate balance between soul-baring sensitivity and self-lacerating humor. But he doesn’t so much juxtapose gravity and levity as fuse them to reflect the perpetually unsettled sensation of being alive and extremely online in the 2020s, where the churn of relentless doomscrolling leaves you unsure of whether to laugh or weep. <i>Articulate Excuses</i> is the first of two mini albums Saxe is unveiling over the course of 2025, after deciding to divide his large stockpile of songs into separate works organized by theme. And judging by this first installment, he’s been spending a lot of time reflecting on his worst behaviors and the cultural influences that encourage them. \n\nThe opening piano hymn “SMARTPHONE MAKE ME DUMB” is a Sunday-morning plea for salvation from the myriad vices—social-media addiction, drinking, meaningless sex—that force him to admit, “My subconscious is a fucking monster.” But <i>Articulate Excuses</i> isn’t all sad-sack introspection: Saxe may inhabit the role of a manipulative ex-boyfriend on “LET A GINGER MAKE YOU CRY,” but the song’s playful, ping-ponging R&B beat lends his villainous portrayal a cartoonish quality. And with “SOFT ASS BITCH,” Saxe interrogates the inability of men to express their true feelings before scaling a Coldplay-sized emotional peak that could make any grown man cry.","short":"A

Deluxe Edition","standard":"Perhaps more so than any other Irish band of their generation, Fontaines D.C.’s first three albums were intrinsically linked to their homeland. Their debut, 2019’s <i>Dogrel</i>, was a bolshy, drizzle-soaked love letter to the streets of Dublin, while Brendan Behan-name-checking follow-up <i>A Hero’s Death</i> detailed the group’s on-the-road alienation and estrangement from home. And 2022’s <i>Skinty Fia</i> viewed Ireland from the complicated perspective of no longer actually being there. \n\nOn their fourth album, however, Fontaines D.C. have shifted their attention elsewhere. <i>Romance</i> finds the five-piece wandering in a futuristic dystopia inspired by Japanese manga classic <i>Akira</i>, Paolo Sorrentino’s 2013 film <i>La Grande Bellezza</i>, and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn’s three <i>Pusher</i> films. “We didn’t set out to make a trilogy of albums but that’s sort of what happened,” drummer Tom Coll tells Apple Music of those first three records. “They were such a tight world, and this time we wanted to step outside of it and change it up. A big inspiration for this record was going to Tokyo for the first time. It’s such a visual, neon-filled, supermodern city. It was so inspiring. It brought in all these new visual references to the creative process for the first time.”\n\nRecorded with Arctic Monkeys producer James Ford (their previous three albums were all made with Dan Carey), <i>Romance</i> also brings in a whole new palette of sounds and colors to the band’s work. From the clanking apocalyptic dread of the opening title track, hip-hop-inspired first single “Starburster,” and the warped grunge and shoegaze hybrids of “Here’s the Thing” and “Sundowner,” it opens a whole new chapter for Fontaines D.C., while still finding time for classic indie rock anthems such as “Favourite”’s wistful volley of guitars or the Nirvana-like “Death Kink.” “Every album we do feels like a huge step in one direction for us, but <i>Romance</i> is probably a little bit more outside of our previous records,” says Coll. “It’s exciting to surprise people.” The deluxe edition includes three new tracks: “It’s Amazing to Be Young,” “Before You I Just Forget,” and a live version of “Starburster/In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song).” Read on as he dissects <i>Romance</i>, one track at a time. \n\n<b>“Romance”</b>\n“This is one that we wrote really late at night in the studio. It just fell out of us. It was one of those real moments of feeling, ‘Right, that’s the first track on the album.’ It’s kind of like a palate cleanser for everything that’s come before. It’s like the opening scene. I feel like every time we’ve done a record there’s been one tune that’s always stuck out like, ‘This is our opening gambit...’”\n\n<b>“Starburster”</b>\n“Grian [Chatten, singer] wrote most of this tune on his laptop, so there were lots of chopped-up strings and stuff—it was quite a hip-hop creative process. It’s probably the song that is furthest away from the old us on this album. This tune was the first single and we always try and shock people a bit. It’s fun to do that.”\n\n<b>“Here’s the Thing”</b>\n“This was written in the last hour of being in the studio. We had maybe 12 or 13 tracks ready to go and just started jamming, and it presented itself in an hour. [Guitarist Conor] Curley had this really gnarly, ’90s, piercing tone, and it just went from there.”\n\n<b>“Desire”</b>\n“This has been knocking around for ages. It was one of those tunes that took so many goes to get to where it was meant to sit. It started as a band setup and then we went really electronic with it. Then in the studio, we took it all back. It took a while for it to sit properly. Grian did 20 or 30 vocal layers on that, he really arranged it in an amazing way. Carlos [O’Connell, guitarist] and Grian were the main string arrangers on this record. This was the first record where we actually got a string quartet in—before people would just send it over. So being able to sit in the room and watch a string quartet take center stage on a song was amazing.”\n\n<b>“In the Modern World”</b>\n“Grian wrote this song when he was in LA. He was really inspired by Lana Del Rey and stuff like that. Hollywood and the glitz and the glamor, but it’s actually this decrepit place. It’s that whole idea of faded glamor.”\n\n<b>“Bug”</b>\n“This felt like a really easy song for us to write. That kind of buzzy, all-of-us-in-the-same-room tune. I really fought for this one to be on the record. I feel like, with songs like that, trying to skew them and put a spin on them that they don’t need is overwriting. If it feels right then there’s no point in laboring over it. That song is what it is and it’s great. It’s going to be amazing live.”\n\n<b>“Motorcycle Boy”</b>\n“This one is inspired by The Smashing Pumpkins a bit. We actually recorded it six months before the rest of the album. This tune was the real genesis of the record and us finding a path and being like, ‘OK, we can explore down here...’ That was one that really set the wheels in motion for the album. It really informed where we were going.”\n\n<b>“Sundowner”</b>\n“On this album, we were probably coming from more singular points than we have before. A lot of the lads brought in tunes that were pretty much there. I was sharing a room with Curley in London, and he was working on this really shoegaze-inspired tune for ages. I think he always thought that Grian would sing it, but when he put down the guide vocals in the studio it sounded great. We were all like, ‘You are singing this now.’”\n\n<b>“Horseness Is the Whatness”</b>\n“Carlos sent me a demo of that tune ages and ages ago. It was just him on an acoustic, and it was such a powerful lyric. I think it’s amazing. We had to kind of deconstruct it and build it back up again in terms of making it fit for this record. Carlos had made three or four drum loops for me and it was a really fun experience to try and recreate that. I don’t know how we’re going to play it live but we’ll sort it out!”\n\n<b>“Death Kink”</b>\n“Again, this came from one of the jams of us setting up for a studio session. It’s another one of those band-in-a-room-jamming-out kind of tunes. On tour in America, we really honed where everything should sit in the set. This is going to be such a fun tune to play live. We’ve started playing it already and it’s been so sick.”\n\n<b>“Favourite”</b>\n“‘Favourite’ was another one we wrote when we were rehearsing. It happened pretty much as it is now. We were kind of nervous about touching it again for the album because that first recording was so good. That’s the song that hung around in our camp for the longest. When we write songs on tour, often we end up getting bored of them over time but ‘Favourite’ really stuck. We had a lot of conversations about the order on this album and I felt it was really important to move from ‘Romance’ to ‘Favourite.’ It feels like a journey from darkness into light, and finishing on ‘Favourite’ leaves it in a good spot.”","short":"Three bonus tracks make the band’s fourth album even more lovable."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/romance-deluxe-edition/1803604510","playParams":{"id":"1803604510","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803604510/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1341828470","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1341828470?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744966658431}}},"1803661354":{"id":"1803661354","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803661354?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1050083719-675265030-1609116776","name":"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage (Original Game Soundtrack) -

Back then, it was practically unheard of for a rapper with no major-label deal to be making such big waves (he’d left his former label, Warner Bros., in 2009). But there was something comforting about the red-eyed Pittsburgh rapper’s laidback mode of rapping about the staples of college dorm-room chatter: weed, women, cars, parties… Did we mention weed? Today, <i>Kush & Orange Juice</i> is considered a “blog era” classic—a throwback to a chiller, simpler time.\n\nAlmost exactly 15 years later, its sequel arrives like a visit from a friend from long ago who’s grown up and gotten richer, but otherwise mostly stayed the same. The 23 terminally chill tracks of <i>Kush + Orange Juice 2</i> feature more of the Taylor Gang touchstones you know and love: jet-ski races, beach picnics, fat joints, drop-tops, crab rolls, hot-boxing Ferrari F8s. He’s joined by a loaded roster of guests who haven’t changed much in the past decade and change, either: Curren$y, Smoke DZA, Chevy Woods, Terrace Martin. “I been doing the same thing since I was 19,” Khalifa crows on “I Might Be,” which might be tragic were those things not so timelessly appealing. Throughout the tape, a radio DJ (broadcasting on a station known as W-E-E-D) offers salient advice: “Don’t stay in the house, man. Jump in the car. Ride around with the homies and the homegirls, and put on some of that Wiz Khalifa, y’all.”","short":"After 15 years, a sequel arrives like the return of an old

Album","standard":"<i>The Firstfruit</i>, the debut solo album from NCT rapper MARK, is achingly personal. “After nearly a decade of being an NCT member,” MARK told listeners on his Apple Music 1 radio show on your MARK, “I feel very, very honored to release a solo album with just my voice, with just my ideas, and just based on me.” Loosely divided into sections based on the four cities—Toronto, NYC, Vancouver, and Seoul—the K-pop artist has called home, <i>The Firstfruit</i> tells the story of MARK’s life up until the album's 2025 release. \n\nThe 13-track collection begins in Toronto, where the rapper was born and spent the early years of his life. MARK sets the scene in acoustic, spoken-word opener “Toronto’s Window”: “I never thought that I could dream in detail, you know?/Always thought that/All I really had to do was to just be faithful and that’s it.” The artist’s faith is a theme throughout the album. “I was born and raised in a Christian family, and so I would always listen to gospel music,” MARK tells Apple Music, recalling sleeping under his mother’s piano as she played in church. While the album’s title is a reference to its role as his first major solo release, it’s also biblical in nature. “In the Bible, it says the first of the first fruits are considered the most important, and it holds the most significance,” explains MARK.\n\nFalsetto-laced pop-funk track “1999” is the album’s lead single. The song’s title is a reference to MARK’s birth year, but it also evokes the rebirth he feels as a solo artist. “Writing the lyrics for this one was actually really, really hard. I think I had about five drafts,” he says. “The song really focuses on that feeling of being reborn, the subject of rebirth. And you can take it literally, but it’s really just figuratively speaking, like a new understanding.” MARK moved from Toronto to NYC when he was in elementary school, a moment sonically recreated in ambient skit-track “Flight to NYC.” “Righteous” and “Fraktsiya,” a rap collaboration with LEE YOUNG JI, round out the album’s New York chapter.\n\nIn “Raincouver,” “Loser,” and “Watching TV” (feat. Crush), MARK’s focus moves to Vancouver. “In my heart, I think Vancouver feels the most home to me,” he tells Apple Music. “I’ll kiss the rain drops, oh,” MARK croons in the sentimental, easy-listening track “Raincouver.” He would stay in the city until 2012, when he passed an SM Global Audition and moved to Seoul to become a K-pop trainee. With “+82 Pressin’,” <i>The Firstfruit</i> shifts location for a final time. The confident hip-hop track, which also features MARK’s NCT co-member HAECHAN, is a reference to the country code needed to call South Korea. “200,” “Journey Mercies,” “Mom’s Interlude,” and “Too Much” round out <i>The Firstfruit</i>’s Seoul story. “This is the city where my musical journey really begins,” says MARK.","short":"The NCT rapper’s solo debut is a map of his life’s

This edition was curated by the producer Wuki, who describes it as “pure adrenaline—something that hits like a pre-workout shot to the soul.” Wuki himself is very active (running, shadowboxing, he does it all) and says music is key to his workouts. “Half the time, the music <i>is</i> the workout,” he says. “If the track hits right, you’ll push harder without even noticing.” Among his favorite tracks: “Pump Up the Jam” by Technotronic and Endor, which he says “feels like a reward for making it that far—you’re flying by that point,” and his own remix of Journey’s “Separate Ways (Worlds Apart).” “That one is pure superhero energy,” he says. “When it drops, I swear I could jump over a building and squash my haters on the way down. No better way to end a session.” ","short":"Wuki says this mix is “pure adrenaline—a pre-workout shot to the

DJ Mix","standard":"The Rap Life playlist is home to hip-hop’s heavy hitters and its vanguard, which means that the Rap Life DJ mix has everything in hip-hop you need to hear right now. This month, the mix was put together by turntablist extraordinaire DEEJAY T-JR., who made history recently for becoming the first woman to win three consecutive DMC DJ Championships.\n\n“Song selection, arrangement of tracks, creativity, transitions, turntablism, and style were all important elements in creating this mix,” T-JR. says. “Each track was chosen not just for its sound, but for how it weaves into the theme of ‘hitting hard.’ The mix flows in a way that maintains high energy while showcasing the creativity and craftsmanship behind it.” Spoken like a true mixmaster. The Rap Life DJ mix is the culture in action, so enjoy this set and check back each month for more one-of-a-kind mixes.","short":"Canada’s top turntablist delivers Dugg, Dolph, Durk, and Drake."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rap-life-april-2025-dj-mix/1807178145","playParams":{"id":"1807178145","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807178145/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1734354584","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1734354584?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744999619798}}},"1807182313":{"id":"1807182313","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807182313?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2024-12-13","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/groove-armada/1727137","name":"Groove Armada at fabric, Dec 13, 2024 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Groove Armada","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2f/3b/98/2f3b984c-4328-78c5-c932-d77e6c3c3723/20389043-8066-4c57-a4fd-0274052b1e94.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1981b","textColor2":"f32a82","textColor4":"c22168","textColor1":"f1bf22","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/groove-armada-at-fabric-dec-13-2024-dj-mix/1807182313","playParams":{"id":"1807182313","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807182313/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1727137","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1727137?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744731133077}}},"1807186423":{"id":"1807186423","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807186423?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ab/3d/23/ab3d2325-1781-ea9b-6758-ce5c84c777f9/96d04483-a9fa-46aa-92e7-3a4d13239e66.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b7b0a5","textColor2":"acbecd","textColor4":"92a1ad","textColor1":"d9d0c4","bgColor":"2e2e2d","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/too-%24hort/145173964","name":"SIR TOO $HORT, VOL. 1 (FREAKY TALES)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Too $hort","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/eb/7a/e3/eb7ae35c-3b87-6925-7240-cc31d0887a80/199316037548_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cacaca","textColor2":"c3c3c3","textColor4":"9e9e9e","textColor1":"fafafa","bgColor":"090909","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"If you’re of a certain age, the phrase “freaky tales” will forever conjure the voice of one Todd Anthony Shaw, née Too $hort, making good on the declaration that he was <i>Born to Mack</i> way back in 1987.

Bitch”), and game-spitting in the Oakland tradition (“The Budget,” “Sucka Shit”). “These are the tales I tell so well,” he told us on the original “Freaky Tales,” but if you’re just now getting

On cuts like the unfiltered “UNDER OATH,” he doles out truths on his own terms, laying waste to those who fail to live by the hood code or, perhaps worse, flaunt it without regard. \n\nHe dismisses pocket watchers and cautions the opps on the ominous “KATTA CLIPS,” proudly standing on his principles for the existentially broader “KEEP CALLIN MY NAME.” That clear commitment to street-level ethics extends to some of his invited guests too, namely EST Gee on “DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR” and Polo G on “WHO WANT WAR.” As locked in with his contemporaries as he is, Mozzy also recognizes the Californian hip-hop lineage that precedes him on “PAC PROUD” and “HELLA HYPHY.”\n","short":"One of Sacramento’s finest returns with an honor-bound album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/intrusive-thoughts/1807647757","playParams":{"id":"1807647757","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0tjWYspyQvDrgVk4ExxCKX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807647757/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"418259765","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/418259765?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744953004119}}},"1807926682":{"id":"1807926682","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807926682?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-11","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/06/88/26/06882607-03f1-0534-e0a9-69a72f98e624/Job624cc2bf-7bcc-4dee-b906-34635e47a5ff-190066366-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372165409_2118817459-Time1744346956706.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2e3136"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"313131","textColor2":"2e3136","textColor4":"57595d","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/07/5a/3f/075a3f28-a951-343d-a476-b97bd4f55405/01d32f07-d4e5-40ef-a21e-ba81eb9806bd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bac6d9","textColor2":"d1d9e9","textColor4":"b5bdcd","textColor1":"d8e4f8","bgColor":"444b5f","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3e/ad/0e/3ead0ea5-eca7-9294-3590-bbab6d247cec/Jobf90cf31d-8f3f-45b9-b87a-cc7b341feaa5-190066367-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372165408_2118817460-Time1744347874276.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"323232","textColor2":"2d3335","textColor4":"565b5c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fcfcfc","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ken-carson/1434801023","name":"More Chaos","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Ken Carson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/dd/95/d7/dd95d756-d9f9-7d77-c1a5-ab1c2fce3a73/24UM1IM12406.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"323332","textColor2":"3d1b29","textColor4":"634954","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"fdfffe","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"At the bleeding edge of the 2020s’ rage rap movement is the Opium collective—the Atlanta-based cabal of brooding rappers and producers led by Playboi Carti who favor powerful distortion, belligerent energy, Satanic imagery, and gratuitous angst. If the scene’s high-water mark was Carti’s pandemic-era paradigm shift, 2020’s <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, just behind it was Ken Carson’s third album, 2023’s <i>A Great Chaos</i>, whose maximalist squall delivered on the title’s promise while fitting into the long lineage of blustery Atlanta rap.\n\n“I’m the lord of chaos! I’m the lord of the mosh!” Carson declares to open <i>More Chaos</i>, his fourth album and <i>A Great Chaos</i>’s feverishly anticipated follow-up. If its predecessor cranked the mayhem and distortion to 11, here the 25-year-old rapper/rock star turns the knobs to 12, running vintage ATL trap through the 2025 deep fryer. Tried-and-true motifs appear by way of abstract singsong blurts and yelps: Rick and Balenci, goth women, rock star shit.

Roughly one year later, on the eve of a much buzzed-about Las Vegas installment, he drops this EP-length release that links to his 4th Rope brand. \n\nFollowing the secular gospel opener “FISHSCALE FRIDAY,” he slips into Flygod mode for the rugged boom-bap reboot “EINSTEIN KITCHEN.” Stripped of the guest list that hopped into the ring on the preceding <i>12</i>, he appears to holler even louder over the choral soul of the Harry Fraud-produced “GORO.” Helmed by Denny Laflare, the piano-driven “DAVEY BOY SMITH” nods to a long-departed Hall of Famer while Gunn rattles off a referential barrage.","short":"The wrestling-fixated Griselda impresario shows us the ropes."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heels-have-eyes-ep/1809011562","playParams":{"id":"1809011562","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809011562/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829760702","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829760702?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1744990401515}}}},"artists":{"44984":{"id":"44984","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/44984?l=en-US","attributes":{"genreNames":["Jazz"],"name":"Miles Davis","editorialNotes":{"standard":"There are not many artists whose careers can be divided into segments, each one worthy of discussion and analysis, each one with its own small catalog of albums that show progress and innovation in their respective sub-genres.
