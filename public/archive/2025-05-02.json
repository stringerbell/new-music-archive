You Asked For A Picture","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Blondshell","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"After the reception to her 2023 self-titled debut as Blondshell, it’s no surprise that Sabrina Teitelbaum’s follow-up, <i>If You Asked for a Picture</i>, came together while she was quite literally on the move. “I was touring a lot, so I was in a lot of new places and just writing about what was going on,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I didn’t have the intention of making an album, but when I got home, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m going to start demoing these songs.’” The resulting 12 tracks may have come together casually, but <i>If You Asked for a Picture</i> is a fuller and richer evocation of the Blondshell sound, pairing spiky ’90s alternative rock sounds with acerbic couplets. \n\nAlong with longtime studio collaborator Yves Rothman (Kim Gordon, Yves Tumor), Teitelbaum adds subtle sonic flourishes to her winning sound—peep the Ronettes-recalling backbeat of “23’s a Baby” and the dream pop of closer “Model Rockets”—but her cutting and personal songwriting style remains the project’s hallmark. Who else could write an introspective exploration of living with OCD, as Teitelbaum does on the explosive “Toy,” and sneak in a withering line like, “I’ve been running this ship like the Navy/But it’s more like a Wendy’s”? As Teitelbaum’s songwriting continues to mature, Blondshell’s balance of the devastating and the deeply funny continues on as one of indie rock’s most thrilling high-wire acts.","short":"Sabrina

proper LP since 2020’s <i>The Way It Feels</i>. Adding 10 new tracks, the pair comprising Maddie Font and Tae Kerr take stock of how their lives have changed in the intervening years. Both Font and Kerr have since become mothers, and songs like the clever “Chasing Babies & Raising Dreams” and “What A Woman Can Do” explore the many roles modern women play. Opening track “Fall in Love & Find Out” finds the duo revisiting the single life, serving up a twangy last-call anthem with shades of ’90s country and early Miranda Lambert. Fan favorite “Heart They Didn’t Break” is heavy on the pair’s richly rendered harmonies, which here sound more mature and complex than on earlier releases. “Kissing Cowboys” goes full-on honky-tonk with its two-step beat and cheeky lyrics, and “Sad Girl Summer” takes heartbreak and turns it into heartening empowerment. <i>Love & Light</i> closes with its title track, a poppy, buoyant kiss-off with crossover potential. Co-writers on the album include Luke Dick, Laura Veltz, Devin Dawson, and Barry Dean.","short":"The duo’s first full-length since 2020 takes stock of how far they’ve come."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/70/ba/67/70ba67e9-d057-b159-8781-7c5f62869faf/25UMGIM05426.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7d0cc","textColor2":"ecbf87","textColor4":"d7a774","textColor1":"d8f2f4","bgColor":"85482c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-light/1792956620","playParams":{"id":"1792956620","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6HX6IOpNWjIVoctAFCe1CW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792956620/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"895526551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/895526551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746170561988}}},"1795108181":{"id":"1795108181","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795108181?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tucker-wetmore/1486724646","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/e5/e4/c2/e5e4c2b0-0bfa-2a16-38ab-6c85d6c2712a/Job147dead1-5594-4972-9f8f-8c0eb2a4681c-190051234-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372134027_2118536317-Time1744331535814.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e3ad64"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"121210"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3ae80","textColor2":"e3ad64","textColor4":"be9257","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"121210","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4d/4c/93/4d4c9314-1a65-4be3-98a1-f65321ba03a4/6ddaf95f-bf1b-4163-a95c-cf72909c9f01.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ada585","textColor2":"c9be9a","textColor4":"a2997c","textColor1":"d6cda5","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/70/53/57/70535746-5187-0741-fa35-a1270cf0f191/Job3b1b16cf-2f98-4d5e-9176-0e9d10e8273c-190812953-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_373680717_2131156660-Time1745354401341.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"baa065","textColor2":"db843e","textColor4":"b77137","textColor1":"dfc078","bgColor":"26221c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/dd/c2/d9/ddc2d9f2-184e-e557-4a22-cf7cd66e7bc1/40520474-fa76-4479-966b-e533e0595ed6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dfcda2","textColor2":"fad69b","textColor4":"e0bd88","textColor1":"f9eabc","bgColor":"785b3d","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/49/98/52/49985254-7493-af14-c2f4-5c0abae2a4b5/8366869d-c8d1-4ecf-96a3-09734433245b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b3ab9c","textColor2":"c9c8c2","textColor4":"a7a6a0","textColor1":"d8cfbd","bgColor":"1e1d1a","hasP3":true}},"name":"What Not To","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Tucker Wetmore","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The title track of Tucker Wetmore’s debut album, <i>What Not To</i>, holds poignant significance for the Washington-born singer-songwriter. As the “Wind Up Missin’ You” hitmaker tells Apple Music, “What Not To” is an advice song in reverse and is inspired by Wetmore’s difficult experiences with his estranged father, whose actions he believes serve as examples of how not to live a loving and fulfilled life. The wrenching tune is also imbued with hard-earned compassion for the man who abandoned Wetmore’s family, with a gut-punch of a lyric at the song’s bridge: “Momma said you don’t pray no more/Breaks my heart, so I do it for you.” “I obviously don’t talk to my dad often, and I haven’t talked to him in years,” Wetmore says. “One of the last conversations we had was him telling me that he don’t pray no more. And that’s when I said, ‘That’s all right, I’ll do it for you.’ And then we parted ways.”\n\nWhile “What Not To” is the beating heart of the album, it is anything but a maudlin affair, with Wetmore peppering in some more upbeat tunes like the moody but playful “Brunette” and the slick, melodic “Drink Alone.” Other highlights include opener “Whatcha Think Is Gonna Happen?” which pairs a soul-searching lyric with brooding production, and, of course, Wetmore’s biggest hit, “Wind Up Missin’ You,” a sweet and soulful tune about the excitement of new love.","short":"The Washington singer-songwriter’s debut is poignant and soulful."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/37/e9/2c/37e92c32-397a-9e0c-2af3-ab5de03d5a7f/25UMGIM11522.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfad65","textColor2":"dd9351","textColor4":"b87d47","textColor1":"e5cf76","bgColor":"27241f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-not-to/1795108181","playParams":{"id":"1795108181","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7IEXNrjznoPOllZ2TusbIl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795108181/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1486724646","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1486724646?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746170992513}}},"1796032497":{"id":"1796032497","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796032497?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Blues-Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jon-allen/695435376","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Seven Dials","artistName":"Jon Allen","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/69/bb/94/69bb9434-9e74-5685-8fff-a78edc910351/8717931351201.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"b2b3b4","textColor2":"d9af85","textColor4":"b19070","textColor1":"dadada","bgColor":"13161d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/seven-dials/1796032497","playParams":{"id":"1796032497","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3Eost3vxl7sx8kERtw7dxF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796032497/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"695435376","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/695435376?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171047075}}},"1796212327":{"id":"1796212327","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796212327?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/car-seat-headrest/725086732","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/45/72/b34572a6-8f44-4c4e-6f4d-d4f9a7c83a65/55bd4b1a-ee0d-4ca1-8030-594c0ca782a0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dad5cf","textColor2":"ebe5df","textColor4":"d0c8bd","textColor1":"f7f6f5","bgColor":"655437","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Scholars","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Car Seat Headrest","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Will Toledo’s music as Car Seat Headrest has always <i>felt</i> like opera whether he called it that or not—at least, few other indie bands have made the droll monotonies of being an outcast sound so grand. A concept album nominally about a med-school student who discovers her secret powers to heal patients by literally absorbing their pain (yep!), <i>The Scholars</i> is both Toledo and his band’s most conventionally “big” album (soaring choruses, dramatic turns, multi-part songs) and its most cryptic, tucking all those big, obvious gestures into the folds of a story that feels just out of reach by design. \n\nThe short songs hit hardest (“The Catastrophe,” “Devereaux”), but the long ones are where they get to make their weird stadium-sized dreams come true. Case in point, the 19-minute centerpiece “Planet Desperation”: Toldeo howls, “When I get to the pearly gates, will I see you on the inside pointing at me/Mouthing ‘There he is, officer—there’s the prick I warned you about.” Then they get to sound like The Who. Then a little bit like Genesis. Then the hand-drum section comes in.

Every new album, every new tour, it is very much like a new baby. It’s a new existence that you have to live with, that you want to love. And it takes a lot of effort to do that.”\n\nThe angelic choir that opens <i>Skeletá</i> might seem ironic for a band that openly preaches the virtues of Satan, but such is the upside-down church of Ghost. The soaring “Peacefield” kicks off the Swedish band’s sixth album before giving way to the deadly “Lachryma,” a tale of crying vampires bolstered by a killer metal riff and ’80s synth sounds, as if King Diamond went New Wave 40 years ago. (“That’s one of my favorite songs ever,” Forge says.)\n\nThe insanely catchy lead single, “Satanized,” wrestles with inner demons and heresy as Latin chants and a throbbing bassline guide the way to an inverted epiphany. Triumphant guitars break through the somber piano that opens “De Profundis Borealis,” a propulsive track that, like many of the songs on <i>Skeletá</i>, sees “new” vocalist Papa V Perpetua—Forge in his latest papal guise—addressing a listener experiencing inner turmoil. “Cenotaph” rides what sounds like a sawed-off Metallica riff into a colorful, twinkling vocal melody with ’70s classic-rock guitar stabs. “Marks of the Evil One” beckons Forge’s favorite antihero, Lucifer, for another stomping, jubilant curtain call. Closer “Excelsis” offers a sober meditation upon death not unlike Type O Negative’s “Everything Dies”—only this one has a vocal line like an award-winning Broadway musical.\n\nUltimately, <i>Skeletá</i> is proof positive that Ghost is still making infectious, devilishly appealing music nearly 20 years after Forge first hatched his concept. “My career is not really different from any other band,” he tells Apple Music. “Sooner or later, you’ll hit that point where a new record won’t really have any great relevance. And it’s hard to say when that is. It just happens. And when it’s a fact, it’s already a fact. And I am a firm believer that we haven’t really hit that yet.”","short":"Nearly 20 years in, the Swedish metal vets still hail Satan in grand style."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/79/43/d8/7943d8ce-0a53-cca2-bcfb-8377c16bacdc/24CRGIM46415.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6b5b8","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor4":"a3a2a5","textColor1":"dddddd","bgColor":"1b1726","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/skelet%C3%A1/1796483834","playParams":{"id":"1796483834","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PFJKjBqXpYrRcdClhfcnX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796483834/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"600730426","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/600730426?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746163798322}}},"1797412881":{"id":"1797412881","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797412881?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eric-church/123055194","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/6d/43/db/6d43dbcf-db8d-e31b-9af4-387d88391507/Job7f394ef7-4c83-4a8b-bdaa-59ad75b7bcb6-190418262-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372893895_2125207790-Time1744821770822.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e1a652"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"01030d"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"be923e","textColor2":"e1a652","textColor4":"b68848","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"01030d","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/a0/ab/0aa0abd5-cb4e-bb38-9c26-0c78a35baa8e/42595a21-6289-4d9a-8fe1-35e8a9ed2eb7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c4c0","textColor2":"dad0c5","textColor4":"bcb3a9","textColor1":"e8e6e2","bgColor":"443e39","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/31/c2/fe/31c2feba-a535-04d8-3139-1f707562cce8/Job7fe2edf3-e079-4c70-a67e-baef5c278e01-190418263-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372893894_2125207789-Time1744823133322.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"6f95a7","textColor2":"dea63b","textColor4":"b38732","textColor1":"88b8cd","bgColor":"0b0b0e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c5/21/43/c5214340-cd1d-6ebd-a41c-50595c4d6809/c6b9a21d-71a4-45a5-8bc1-cddca2173d7e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cebb86","textColor2":"a8bceb","textColor4":"92a3ca","textColor1":"f2d996","bgColor":"3c4049","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/db/93/b0/db93b00c-503e-95d0-e9c3-20429c8ab7d5/f6cfb2d7-de13-4194-bf40-1773f0e6e0bb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b4c0c3","textColor2":"efdeae","textColor4":"c3b691","textColor1":"dceaee","bgColor":"14161a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Evangeline vs. The Machine","artistName":"Eric Church","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Though its tracklist is compact in comparison, Eric Church’s follow-up to his ambitious 2021 triple album <i>Heart & Soul</i> is no less potent than its predecessor. <i>Evangeline vs. The Machine</i>, produced by longtime collaborator Jay Joyce, finds country music’s favorite Chief fearlessly commenting on current events and sharing vulnerable moments, doing so with all the style and swagger that fans have come to love and expect. Church tells Apple Music he believes <i>Evangeline vs. The Machine</i> is “the most creative album” he’s ever made, thanks in part to his decision to bring an orchestra into the recording studio. The resulting sound is rich and often surprising, with an expansive nature that mimics the big, complex themes Church explores in his lyrics.\n\n“There’s a tension that strings and vocals provide that you can’t get from a guitar, you can’t get from a keyboard, just because of the mechanism of the way they’re moving their arms,” he says. “There’s a tension. They can create drama. And a lot of this record has drama. I think that it almost sounds like a soundtrack. It sounds like a movie soundtrack.”\n\nOpening track “Hands of Time,” an ode to the healing power of music and a rebuke of outgrowing youthful abandon, takes that cinematic feel and infuses it with the kind of crunchy heartland sound that made songs like “Drink in My Hand” and “Springsteen” smash hits. “Johnny” refers not to Cash but to the hell-fighting hero of Charlie Daniels’ classic “The Devil Went Down to Georgia,” with Church pleading for the fictional fiddler to grab his bow and “send him to hell again.” Church wrote the emotional ballad, which makes the most of Church’s orchestra, after the 2023 Covenant School shooting in Nashville, which claimed the lives of three children and three adults. “Darkest Hour” also finds Church responding to recent events, as he released the poignant song ahead of the album to raise funds for victims of Hurricane Helene in 2024. And “Evangeline” is Church’s personification of the creative muse, who is ever at odds with the machine of capitalism. Below, Church shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“Bleed on Paper”</b>\n“‘Bleed on paper,’ that is selling your soul. You’re never going to get that back. A lot of young artists, they don’t know that. They don’t have a choice. And I think that that’s what gets hard. Staying true to [yourself] is the biggest challenge, I think for not just country music, but for music as we go forward in this river that is just so flooded with crap. How do you swim in that? And I think that that’s the hardest thing. If I was a young artist right now, that would be a challenge.”\n\n<b>“Johnny”</b>\n“The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life as a parent was dropping my kids off the day after the shooting. They went to school and everybody thought it was good to go back to school and get the kids. And I understood that, but that’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. And I sat in the parking lot a while. I was about to drive back home, and ‘The Devil Went Down to Georgia’ came on. There’s that line, ‘Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard/Hell’s broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards/And if you win, you get a shiny fiddle made of gold/If you lose, the devil gets your soul.’ And I remember that line hit and I was like, ‘God, we need Johnny, because the devil’s not in Georgia, he’s here. He’s everywhere and he’s winning.’”\n\n<b>“Darkest Hour”</b>\n“In ‘Darkest Hour,’ first time we went through it, in the back half of that song, there’s a flute. And it’s a flute that sounds like a baby elephant is throwing his trunk from the right to the left. The track was going really well, and all of a sudden that came in and I lost it. I stopped the entire orchestra. I said, ‘Was that a flute?’ And then there’s a girl that was playing and I said, ‘No, that’s great.’ I said, ‘I didn’t see that coming.’ And so it’s just one of those things where you have these moments that I would never have conceived, I would never have thought about, but you’re actually going to these people who are really talented people and you’re playing the song and you’re going, ‘Okay, now you paint on this picture.’”\n\n<b>“Evangeline”</b>\n“Evangeline, to me, in this record represents creativity, and the machine is the things we deal with now that push against or round off that creativity. Evangeline is the muse for creativity in this album. And everything in our world right now is going to push against that. And it does, even for people who are pretty creative: ‘It can’t be this long, this is the only snippet that you can put on YouTube.’ So everything that you have commercially with what the machine is, it pushes against that. And that’s a fight. And this record’s a fight in that way. I’m trying to let this record, which is the most creative I’ve ever done, be a beacon for that creativity.”\n","short":"“This record has drama.” Chief takes the biggest swing of his career."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/06/c3/35/06c33526-87ee-d731-6099-77b594716ae5/25UMGIM26812.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"8d9aa3","textColor2":"deba4a","textColor4":"b1953d","textColor1":"b0c1c9","bgColor":"00000a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/evangeline-vs-the-machine/1797412881","playParams":{"id":"1797412881","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4wJxbo5ycw2j1cDM0LOiMl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797412881/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"123055194","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/123055194?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746174223063}}},"1798226213":{"id":"1798226213","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1798226213?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/liam-mour/987018325","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"All Set Let's Swim -

He titled his 2023 sophomore album <i>Ultrapure</i>, a word he made up to try to articulate the feeling of transcendence that can accompany moments of intense beauty or pain. That record retained the grungy roots of its predecessor, 2021’s <i>Sunflower</i>, while spreading out a bit sonically, making space for some of Maroney’s weirder musical impulses to shine through. On his third full-length, <i>JIMMY</i>, Maroney realizes a fuller artistic vision by reconciling his folkier roots with his more psychedelic inclinations, making for an engaging, often surprising listen. Narratively, the record digs into his split adolescence: After his parents divorced when he was a teenager, he spent half of his time in Knoxville, Tennessee, with his father and half in Florida with his mother, seeming to inhabit two different characters in the process. \n\n<i>JIMMY</i>, named for an eclectic Floridian neighbor, is an attempt at integration, as evinced by the trippy cover art, which finds Maroney’s face literally split down the middle. The record opens with its title track, a noisy and plaintive intro that sounds like the inside of a perpetually buzzing brain. “Tomatoes” pairs a tight pop melody with fuzzed-out guitar and a strange, playful little breakdown about picking out a plot at a graveyard. “Real Good Swimmer” is urgent and hallucinatory in its invocations of rivers and seas, while “Sunsetter” takes similarly natural imagery and dips into existential anxiety. Maroney closes the project with “Be Yourself,” an impassioned garage-rocker whose title also serves as the album’s thesis statement.","short":"His third album integrates his folkier roots with his psychedelic inclinations."},"artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0c/38/40/0c384024-0015-379f-62f6-2d04d6ae5905/075679619976.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1424,"textColor3":"c8c3c0","textColor2":"f1d7b7","textColor4":"c2ac92","textColor1":"faf4f0","bgColor":"030000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jimmy/1801610220","playParams":{"id":"1801610220","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2tyjGt1FsGclG9gVFmOXqR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801610220/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"418604503","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/418604503?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746206407293}}},"1801611607":{"id":"1801611607","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801611607?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/isaiah-falls/1607911349","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/87/7f/e8/877fe8bc-d3f7-02fc-813e-3be23f2538e6/Job44eb8068-97df-455e-81e1-ee7c291dc5e7-191550971-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375080237_2142604313-Time1746114955836.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","de8f6c"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0a0809"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b28d7e","textColor2":"de8f6c","textColor4":"b57559","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0a0809","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/da/e5/01dae562-930e-ceee-4d38-3985be5b8d9e/44871828-56e1-4f65-991d-882c34765caa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9966e","textColor2":"d2b18e","textColor4":"ac9175","textColor1":"e4b786","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d0/51/2e/d0512e9e-64f9-86b8-45d0-64d178cb6c28/Jobe92fed42-a7f0-40b9-8e50-2b7c311f9487-191550972-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375080236_2142604314-Time1746116038556.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","daa07a"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"0a0809"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"bca998","textColor2":"daa07a","textColor4":"b18264","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0a0809","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9a/12/28/9a122839-225d-39bd-7371-8a577b405112/28b1d10b-a14a-4e36-9d31-23728031c17c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c87c56","textColor2":"ef774e","textColor4":"c76745","textColor1":"f09263","bgColor":"262424","hasP3":true}},"name":"LVRS PARADISE (SIDE A)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Isaiah Falls","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“You ever been to paradise, baby?” Isaiah Falls asks on “FOR LVRS ONLY,” the sensual opener to <i>LVRS PARADISE (SIDE A)</i>.

Empowered by the success of their prior Marshmello team-up “HARLEY QUINN,” group leader Jesus Ortiz Paz (aka JOP) and his cohorts embraced the opportunity to infuse their style with seemingly disparate genres like Jersey club, resulting in a risk-taking album that will forever stand out in their high-quality discography. Yet not long thereafter came <i>MALA MÍA</i>, a surprise joint-EP release with Grupo Frontera that inherently hinted at a potential pivot away from the dance-floor thump. By the time the riveting corrido “Por Esos Ojos” arrived a couple months later, it became clear that JOP intended for their next project to change course once more.\n\nThat said, anyone who’d dare presume that <i>111XPANTIA</i> is somehow backtracking or retreating from the boldness of <i>PERO NO TE ENAMORES</i> simply fails to understand the breadth of Fuerza Regida’s artistry. While the self-described Jersey corridos side of their work is conspicuously absent here, what remains are a dozen tracks that burst and blossom with fearless lyricism and intricate arrangements. Evoking the iconically cinematic Nino Rota score, opener “GodFather” distills mafioso-epic intensity into an unapologetically sordid account of luxe hedonism. JOP sounds arguably more profane than ever on the riveting crime-story corrido “ayy weyy” and the sexually explicit “peliculiando.” Electronic elements play a subtler role than before, present as a warming drone at the start of “caperuza” and via synth bass swells underneath the lush “Nocturno.”","short":"JOP steps off the dance floor refreshed and ready for corridos glory."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/51/0a/a3/510aa39f-7a41-b53c-70a0-6a0df60645bb/196872995978.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c90000","textColor2":"f80001","textColor4":"c70001","textColor1":"fb0100","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/111xpantia/1804142476","playParams":{"id":"1804142476","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1JpJzuM4uncCfCimVozkmy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804142476/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1275690475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1275690475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171693778}}},"1804371924":{"id":"1804371924","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804371924?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryce-vine/667593422","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Motel California","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Bryce Vine","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/db/bf/b7/dbbfb73e-dedf-0b6a-e6d9-1ae27776694e/751238020802.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"3f2400","textColor2":"321f00","textColor4":"593900","textColor1":"130600","bgColor":"f29f02","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/motel-california/1804371924","playParams":{"id":"1804371924","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3OzRJkcJrwfhLZOLUK8FIM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804371924/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"667593422","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/667593422?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171145641}}},"1804379699":{"id":"1804379699","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804379699?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["House","Music","Dance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ashee/526052044","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Dustin's Falsetto -

EP","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"HARDY","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"The singer-songwriter born Michael Hardy grew up in Mississippi, living life like a country song; then he moved to Nashville to pen hits for the likes of Florida Georgia Line and Morgan Wallen before branching out as an artist in his own right. These days, his hand is all over country radio—if there’s a slick-sounding country hit whose verses tumble cleverly into hooks, chances are that HARDY’s name is somewhere in the credits. \n\nWhere his solo work has often split the difference between his two passions, rock and country, the title of his third EP leaves no room for ambiguity—this is <i>COUNTRY!</i>, goddamnit! Hence the buck on the wall of his grandpa’s hunting cabin, the girlfriends with guns, the cold ones cracked at 5 pm sharp. But HARDY’s got a knack for getting meta with it too: On “Favorite Country Song,” he runs through a list of hits from Merle Haggard, Keith Whitley, and Hank Williams Jr. before declaring his all-time favorite as the sound of wind in the pines, crickets in the creek, and whippoorwills singing of summer.","short":"The Nashville songwriter reaffirms his allegiance to his genre of

The Beach, In Every Life","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Gigi Perez","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Gigi Perez pours her life experience into her work. After the viral success of her 2024 single “Sailor Song”—an open plea for queer romantic connection that topped the UK singles chart and went platinum in several other countries—her self-produced debut album plays like unabashed memoir. “Sugar Water” opens with a nod to Perez’s birthplace of Hackensack, New Jersey before recounting schoolyard taunts and even the texture of her childhood Barbie’s hair. Her sister Celene’s death in 2020 sits at the center of “Fable,” with both that song and the closing title track featuring voicemails left by Celene. Perez also unpacks that family tragedy on the darker “Survivor’s Guilt,” while the album’s title was inspired in part by Perez sleeping on the beach after her sister died. \n\nThe emotive singing and busker-style folk balladry of Perez’s earlier releases is very much at play, though lilting strings interweave with the acoustic guitar on “Crown” and the especially surprising “Twister” adds Auto-Tune and a programmed beat. But again, the lyrics are most often the star here, with the singer-songwriter revisiting her intense religious upbringing alongside love, loss, and other weighty themes.","short":"There’s more to this confiding young songwriter than her viral hit."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/54/11/b5/5411b5e4-30e7-8853-a7d7-75b3700b810c/25UMGIM53543.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"363636","textColor2":"2e2d2e","textColor4":"585758","textColor1":"040404","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/at-the-beach-in-every-life/1807389775","playParams":{"id":"1807389775","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/58vZavXqh1P5uoTXteudWl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807389775/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1553802745","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1553802745?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746205147789}}},"1807395137":{"id":"1807395137","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807395137?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-04-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shaboozey/914125510","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/16/be/23/16be23fd-c786-81e3-aa50-f47eca34e1ff/Job487810af-1fd8-4f32-9b0d-56b9722acf98-190023976-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372082351_2118123148-Time1744307647519.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e0d7c6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"421717"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"d1cac8","textColor2":"e0d7c6","textColor4":"c3b2a3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"421717","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/97/80/d3/9780d372-c665-31a6-35df-f66a01ee7e4e/5af846c3-a0a6-4bbc-b076-f79048e65843.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292928","textColor2":"1b1c1b","textColor4":"383835","textColor1":"08090b","bgColor":"aca99e","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c2/5c/01/c25c01b5-9a46-693d-90cf-74ecbab9cdec/Job741edc29-8ba4-4726-b973-21e205190b9f-190023977-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_372082352_2118123149-Time1744311400550.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cdc5be","textColor2":"ebe7d9","textColor4":"cdc0b3","textColor1":"ebeee7","bgColor":"57211c","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d8/c0/19/d8c01907-35eb-8905-32e8-6d50c7a9e63e/d682c395-455b-478c-9da4-253137f7e19d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ccc3b9","textColor2":"dfdad0","textColor4":"c3b9b0","textColor1":"ebe5db","bgColor":"543932","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/3f/9e/a5/3f9ea5bf-faf0-0778-5c05-9e4d0b4e0a20/b3aa3ca4-a345-4390-b77e-a84e5902a35e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ccc1bb","textColor2":"d4bba9","textColor4":"b79a8b","textColor1":"efebe5","bgColor":"411716","hasP3":true}},"name":"Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going: The Complete Edition","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Shaboozey","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition","standard":"Shaboozey has long been inspired by the romantic notion of the outlaw: “The guy who’s standing against a whole bunch of folks and it’s like, ‘We’re going to take them down.’ Yeah, you can try!” the musician tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. The obsession is less quaint than it sounds. Having pored through old western films, dime-store pulp novels, and gunslinger ballads à la Marty Robbins, the Virginia native noticed that old-school cowboy culture and hip-hop share a preoccupation with all things American renegade. \n\nThe conversation around country music’s Black roots will sound familiar to anyone who tuned in to Beyoncé’s <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>, which featured Shaboozey on two tracks. (“Beyoncé’s been such a big part of being Black in America,” he said, still in awe of the opportunity. “At every point in our lives, she has had some sort of cultural impact.”) But the 29-year-old singer/rapper has been staking his territory in the space between hip-hop and country for a decade, redefining what it means to be a modern country star.\n\nHis third album, <i>Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going</i>, plays out like a classic American road movie, opening with steel guitar, the gallop of horse hooves, and Shaboozey with his foot on the gas, fresh out of smokes and headed nowhere in particular. On tracks like “Let It Burn,” his rich baritone is equal parts Willie, Waylon, and woozy blues rap à la Future. Elsewhere, he channels Imagine Dragons’ arena-ready roots rock, where breakup banger “Annabelle” hits the sweet spot between Fleetwood Mac and Post Malone. But the star-making moment is “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the breakaway hit of 2024’s Stagecoach Festival: a Southern-fried riff on a 20-year-old J-Kwon club classic with TGIF vibes.","short":"The 2024 country-rap juggernaut tacks on a six-pack of extra songs."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/35/a5/3b/35a53b45-f944-7a00-717d-a3778f7afb6c/199316020885_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0c9c8","textColor2":"d69392","textColor4":"ba7b79","textColor1":"f1f6f4","bgColor":"4a1a18","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/where-ive-been-isnt-where-im-going-the-complete-edition/1807395137","playParams":{"id":"1807395137","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7h7fjoD137eLq9B3KHWXtW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807395137/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"914125510","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/914125510?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746174799313}}},"1807446195":{"id":"1807446195","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807446195?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/credit-00/405016050","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Put The Funk Back In 2 Techno -

His most substantive project to date, the 12-track <i>Enero</i> reflects his skilled pen as much as the effortless cool of his vocal delivery. From edgy corridos like “rascacielos” and “solecito” to more romantic cuts like the sentimental single “sirena,” he fits in perfectly with the moods and mores of the prevailing subgenres. He goes from modern courtship on the tender and vulnerable “linda muñequita” to the pouty, sad, sierreño-styled slouch of “adivinando” with ease. Relationships in various stages of collapse dominate the discussion here, encompassing the crestfallen desperation of “boletos” as well as the slowly simmering rage of “nada en común.”","short":"The

Lean","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"What’s in a name? In the case of Yung Lean, what initially registered as a sardonic take on post-ironic internet rap tropes was, in fact, a riff on the Swedish rapper’s given name: Jonatan Leandoer Håstad. In the decade-plus since he broke through with 2013’s “Ginseng Strip 2002,” Lean has evolved past his position as Scandinavia’s foremost cloud-rap interpreter, embracing sincerity, transparency, and, more recently, post-punk. (On 2024’s <i>Psykos</i>, his first full-length collaboration with Drain Gang CEO Bladee, they channeled Joy Division and The Cure for songs about psychosis and ego death.) The title of his fifth solo album says it all: <i>Jonatan</i> is Lean at his rawest, a homecoming after a long, dark night of the soul.\n\nLead single “Forever Yung” plays out like a funeral for his former self: Phoenixes rise from the ashes, masks are taken off, a rickety one-note bassline rattles ahead. A handful of bruised love songs crackle with manic energy and magical-realist details: On “Paranoid Paparazzi,” he raps about pills and lullabies in a voice that sounds like he’s just rolled out of bed, and “Babyface Maniacs” could be the theme song of a future <i>Badlands</i> remake: “Infamous murderous couple ridin’ through the drylands/Sugarcane kisses and shotguns, candy cane violence.” But at the emotional crux of <i>Jonatan</i> are heavy yet hopeful ballads that put chaos in the rearview—like “Swan Song,” on which Lean singsongs, “I wanna know what it feels like to come down from the trip of a lifetime.”","short":"The Swedish MC's homecoming after a long, dark night of the soul."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/da/4f/68da4f1d-841c-7997-1b28-eb9a41425a68/199350376238.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"e0e0e0","textColor4":"b4b4b4","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"050505","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jonatan/1809966728","playParams":{"id":"1809966728","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/09N3Yw1yNAMNNXSUqnoV6l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809966728/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"472502104","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/472502104?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171100245}}},"1810052292":{"id":"1810052292","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810052292?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sara-barone/1450527936","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Exterritorial (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)","artistName":"Sara Barone","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d4/47/77/d447775e-d326-83fe-d18e-fd183ccd30bc/810123166404.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d1d1","textColor2":"d6c1a1","textColor4":"b3a086","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"271b1d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/exterritorial-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film/1810052292","playParams":{"id":"1810052292","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5PXAH4SGFXGHoUtOX3v7LY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810052292/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1450527936","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1450527936?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171400189}}},"1810084863":{"id":"1810084863","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810084863?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=324818538-405286240","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Andor: Season 2 - Vol. 2 (Episodes 4-6) [Original Score]","artistName":"Brandon Roberts & Nicholas Britell","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e7/4e/ac/e74eacac-ae19-1e9f-0298-bc3ebd73f6a9/25UMGIM59238.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c1c2c4","textColor2":"d1cfc8","textColor4":"a8a7a2","textColor1":"f0f0f2","bgColor":"04070b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/andor-season-2-vol-2-episodes-4-6-original-score/1810084863","playParams":{"id":"1810084863","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6LslS0wAyFP0pdh7z0v0Hb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810084863/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"324818538","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/324818538?l=en-US"},{"id":"405286240","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/405286240?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171444995}}},"1810289467":{"id":"1810289467","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810289467?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-03-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nav/1200089113","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"OMW2 REXDALE (DELUXE)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"NAV","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Rexdale is a neighborhood in Toronto, situated in the Etobicoke district, where NAV, the son of Punjabi parents, was born and raised. On the rap star’s fifth album, <i>OMW2 REXDALE</i>, the prodigal child returns to the place that gave him his grit, determination, and hustle. It marks his first project since <i>Demons Protected by Angels</i> in 2022 and finds NAV tapped into the subjects and production styles he introduced on his early projects. In that sense, these heartbroken and love-hungry songs are a return to NAV’s origins too. On opener “SINKING,” he finds himself trapped and alone, rapping, “No one hears my cries for help/My heart is slowly sinking, I’m all alone in this world.” Elsewhere, though, things get better as NAV outlines his rise from scrappy Toronto upstart to one of the biggest rappers in North America. On “BURBS,” he puts it simply enough, rapping, “Walk in the store, I spend a lot, what I’m makin’ is absurd.” The cash is all the sweeter because success was so hard-earned. He adds, “Used to spend all day in the projects, now I’m tucked up in the burbs.”","short":"The Toronto rapper reconnects with the spirit of his early work."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/04/1b/55/041b5509-482d-4376-b9e8-5e352f510985/25UMGIM59884.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdbab0","textColor2":"e2ddd0","textColor4":"b4b1a6","textColor1":"ede9dc","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/omw2-rexdale-deluxe/1810289467","playParams":{"id":"1810289467","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5E7Q6PZEvJQIGMYADlFra9"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810289467/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1200089113","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1200089113?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746205869698}}},"1810293734":{"id":"1810293734","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810293734?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-06-07","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aurora/947171999","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"What Happened To The Heart?

(Extended)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Coco Jones","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album in Spatial Audio","standard":"Coco Jones’ debut album <i>Why Not More?</i> is a hard-fought culmination of years of work with her talents on full display since childhood. However, her transition from Disney teen actor to singer during the 2010s was rocky, with a robust discography of singles and EPs under her belt before she eventually parted ways with her first label. “I got signed when I was 14 and dropped when I was 16, and it was disappointing because I had this feeling that as soon as I get that one opportunity, it’ll all grow like rapid fire,” Jones tells Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis. “It did not go that way. I think that was when, inwardly, there was a shift in me, and it went from certain to foggy and unsure what I was going to get in return for all of this effort.” \n\nDespite navigating an often turbulent industry, Jones has laid the groundwork over the last couple of years, starting with the success of her 2023 breakout EP <i>What I Didn’t Tell You</i>, which introduced fans—old and new—to a grown-up Coco and not only cemented a Grammy for her somber track “ICU,” but solidified her as a rising star and one of the faces of the new generation in R&B. Those accolades, along with headlining her first solo tour in 2023, all readied her for this moment.\n\n<i>Why Not More?</i> finds the South Carolina native more comfortable trusting her instincts than on its predecessor, and showing the different sides to her musicality. “I’ve been asking myself this during the album: ‘Should I do this? Can I? Is this allowed? What do people think if I do that?’ And I really loved the theme of ‘why not more?’” she explains. “Why can’t I just lean into all the things? Really, what is the answer to the ‘why not more,’ and is that enough, that answer? No, because it’s all rooted in fear. I can’t live like that. I got to jump.” And she does. She isn’t afraid to push boundaries across the album’s 14 tracks, traversing a spectrum of genres seamlessly while keeping R&B at the center. \n\nJones samples Britney Spears’ hit song “Toxic” on the seductive “Taste,” continues the pop energy on the acoustic track “Hit You Where It Hurts,” and delves into the trap-soul soundscape with an assist from Future on “Most Beautiful Design,” while the title track has Jones teaming up with YG Marley to deliver a reggae-influenced song. “I don’t even feel like there is a formula at this stage of music. It’s just whatever catches catches. And that’s outside of all of us,” she says. “So you might as well, in the meantime, do what you love to do instead of trying to always be doing what you think is going to work.” \n\nHer growth isn’t just reflected in the music but in the themes and storytelling as well. While love and relationships are a core part of <i>Why Not More?</i>, Jones also brings empowerment and self-love to the forefront (“By Myself”), embraces her sexuality and sensuality (“AEOMG,” “On Sight”), and lets herself get braggadocious and egotistical (“Keep It Quiet”).\n","short":"Coco Jones: “I don’t even feel like there is a formula at this stage of music.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f5/e6/24/f5e6241b-127b-be0e-dc14-46575212de1b/25UMGIM60553.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"383a43","textColor2":"1b1c15","textColor4":"484a43","textColor1":"070815","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/why-not-more-extended/1810575444","playParams":{"id":"1810575444","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2wnTULzFN2hm32986KHwm6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810575444/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"401400095","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/401400095?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746206353820}}},"1811158376":{"id":"1811158376","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811158376?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dag-vagle/1516046952","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Under the Crescent Moon - EP","artistName":"Dag Vagle","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ab/47/df/ab47dfec-59de-bf5e-f992-6c8aaccc3273/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"292c26","textColor2":"181818","textColor4":"3b3e38","textColor1":"020202","bgColor":"c4d7b9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/under-the-crescent-moon-ep/1811158376","playParams":{"id":"1811158376","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811158376/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1516046952","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1516046952?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746171006207}}},"1811177766":{"id":"1811177766","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811177766?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/apple-music-resident-dj/1614019615","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/01/e8/7c/01e87c53-f8c0-aa45-b6ef-29c5651cd255/6ccea4c4-a5f4-4ee1-8134-f3d9b1f18a4f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"d2b76a","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a69963","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"282828","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/59/fb/0659fb27-2884-9eee-33f5-559aab1e2028/5f17a5f1-2d74-4a50-9c27-86d0efbffba2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"b4a867","textColor2":"d2bd74","textColor4":"aa995f","textColor1":"ded07e","bgColor":"0b0b0b","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/e3/a1/cee3a175-8f20-3f8d-7332-eacd6d860307/06453ce1-61d6-4a6a-8069-d80bbab13745.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"c9b370","textColor2":"d5be77","textColor4":"b09e63","textColor1":"f4d987","bgColor":"1e1c15","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b3/4d/bc/b34dbc70-64e6-a829-3a28-4c631a7107d1/7115ab72-d0fa-44d2-a565-7c62123d3b13.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c3bc79","textColor2":"c9b772","textColor4":"a2945c","textColor1":"f2e996","bgColor":"070707","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/00/06/520006f4-0347-ab0d-ff71-7b7da7a2295a/035172bd-4b70-422e-86e1-fd472c3ae3ef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cbb167","textColor2":"eccd72","textColor4":"c4ab62","textColor1":"f5d577","bgColor":"252525","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/96/a7/dc/96a7dc22-e5c8-38a0-0443-8cfd7592ac31/2b9d2fa4-da71-4268-b131-e1c4df1b08c3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"c4af6d","textColor2":"d6be78","textColor4":"af9c63","textColor1":"f0d684","bgColor":"141311","hasP3":true}},"name":"Today's Hits: May 2025 (DJ Mix)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Apple Music Resident DJ","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"You already know Today’s Hits—the playlist that keeps up with the most popular songs in pop, hip-hop, R&B, and more—but you’ve never heard it like this.

The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\n\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”","short":"The pop power couple tack eight extra tracks onto their joint
