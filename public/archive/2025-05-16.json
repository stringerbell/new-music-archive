Album and Interview","standard":"“I wanted something that was very direct, stripped of any nuances—like a big fucking punch to wake people up.” That’s what Behemoth ringleader Adam “Nergal” Darski tells Apple Music when asked about the controversial title of the band’s 13th album. While the Polish extreme-metal squad has always dealt in blasphemy and anti-Christian themes—a habit that has landed Nergal in court in his very Catholic homeland—<i>The Shit Ov God</i> might be the apex of their profanation. “I wanted to give people something that in 50 years, even if they don’t remember the band name, they will fucking remember the album title,” he says. “I know it’s controversial, and I did it very deliberately. And it’s already the most talked-about title—next to <i>The Satanist</i>—that we’ve ever had.”\n\nAs for the idea behind it? “It’s a very common thing to say, ‘You are what you eat,’” he says. “If you are what you digest—religion in this case, but it can be politics, the media, food—and you keep fucking scrolling all day and process all that garbage, you become that. And of course I’m quoting Jesus: ‘This is my body; this is my blood. Eat it. Drink it.’ It’s instant blasphemy, but I think it’s really well put together.” Here Nergal walks through each track on the album.\n\n<b>“The Shadow Elite”</b>\n“I’m super fucking proud of the track, and it’s a great live opener as well. It’s one of the songs that I call a mission statement, and it has this Manowar kind of ‘yes, we are!’ togetherness. All the fucking misfits and outsiders and anarchists and satanists, all of you out there who feel left out, let’s come together, because we are the shadow elite and we have a voice, and this is our voice. Being an outsider is not something to be ashamed of. We go against the current, and this is a badge of honor for us to wear.”\n\n<b>“Sowing Salt”</b>\n“I love the choruses on this one, that ‘march forth,’ with all this chanting and almost semi-singing. That’s something I’ve been fond of lately, adding some semi-singing notes to my brutal voice. It’s not clear vocals, but it’s also not entirely a scream. And I’m quite proud of the lead that I laid down at the end of the song. Lyrically, well, in ancient times, if you were a conqueror taking over your enemy’s land and you wanted to defeat them ASAP, you would sow salt instead of grain so nothing can bloom out of the soil. Like the song, it’s absolutely unapologetic, an uncompromising takeover.”\n\n<b>The Shit Ov God”</b>\n“I wanted to have a song that’s like this giant marching Godzilla or something like that, with a very anthemic but rhythmic chorus like ‘God hates us all’ by Slayer. For the lyrics, I was in an airport somewhere listening to Einstürzende Neubauten, and they had this song that used capital letters at the start of each line, and if you add all those capital letters together, they would make another word. Kind of like Nick Cave’s ‘Loverman’: ‘M is for murder,’ blah blah blah. I know there will be controversy: It’s already the most commented-upon thing we’ve done in many years.” \n\n<b>“Lvciferaeon”</b>\n“I don’t want to call it a ’90s black metal vibe, but I love the drive of the song. It has a really big, powerful, anthemic chorus. Personally, I think it’s one of the best choruses that I wrote ever. It’s proper singing, just me but with multiplied vocals. The lyrical concept refers to Baphomet, the king of Antioch, and the Templars. Lucifer has been one of the most used leitmotifs in Behemoth’s records and lyrics. It’s one of the archetypes that I always felt strongly associated with. To me, Lucifer stands next to Prometheus and Icarus. It’s a manifestation of human freedom.” \n\n<b>“To Drown the Svn in Wine”</b>\n“I stole that first line from Whitman, the poet: ‘O captain! My captain! Your fearful trip is done.’ And then I continued on my own: ‘Raise anchor and sail ahead. Behold thee, this flower immortal that dares to bloom in hell.’ It’s not a prophecy, but the promise of the end. Usually I don’t know what I’m writing about when I begin, because I never sit down with an intention. It’s automatic writing. As I put them together, I see what’s coming out. But this time, I knew right away. It’s about the passing of my father. He died two years ago. I’m dealing with this fact that the man who made me is no more. It’s probably one of the most emotional lyrics I ever wrote.” \n\n<b>“Nomen Barbarvm”</b>\n“It’s maybe the hidden gem of the record. It’s a very melodic song, very uptempo. Me and [guitarist] Patryk [Sztyber, aka Seth] share a lead section, and I think it’s a brilliant riff. The song is a banger, and I believe this album has the most bangers of all Behemoth albums. In the past, we wrote songs that were meant to play live and songs that were not meant to play live. This time, I wanted everything to be playable live, and this was written with that perspective. My friend Benek [Babalon] wrote the lyrics for this chorus, and I’m jealous because he did a great job. It’s maybe one of the catchiest choruses in Behemoth’s history.” \n\n<b>“O Venvs, Come!”</b>\n“Lucifer is back, just in a different form. The planet Venus has always been associated with [the Sumerian goddess] Inanna, with connections to Lucifer and the Morning Star and so forth. This song has a Bathory kind of vibe that might bring reflections from ’90s Behemoth or early-2000s Behemoth. When I was collecting ideas for this album, I came across this Catholic prayer. I thought if I inverted it and gave it this mocking nature, it might make a cool Me and That Man song. But when I started fucking around with the words, it became way too cool for Me and That Man.” \n\n<b>“Avgvr (The Dread Vvltvre) ”</b>\n“In antiquity, to augur was the skill of reading the omens through observations of the birds. There were wise men and sages who would do this in ancient Rome. They were treated as oracles. The idea was brought to me by Benek Babalon, the dude who, for two records now, he’s polishing my English, so to say. He’s young, he’s very well read, and he’s fluent in five or ten languages. He’s Jewish, he’s a massive Behemoth fan, and he’s a brilliant brain. So I use his brain to make Behemoth sound even more distinct and beautiful. The song has big choruses and a crazy breakdown, and it ends with Patryk’s acoustic guitars. It’s an evil ending that just kind of lingers on. The way it sustains, it sounds like it could be continued.” \n","short":"“Instant blasphemy” from the lightning-rod extreme-metal

Album and Interview","standard":"“I’ve always wanted to be a musician that has a big reach and influence on a large amount of people,” Sleep Theory vocalist Cullen Moore tells Apple Music. “To be able to give something to someone that they feel they can relate to and can enjoy listening to whether they’re interested in metal music or pop music.” Sleep Theory’s highly relatable lyrics about interpersonal relationships are a large part of what made the Memphis band’s 2023 breakout EP, <i>Paper Hearts</i>, so successful.\n\nTheir full-length debut, <i>Afterglow</i>, doubles down on this perspective (and Moore’s impressive vocal prowess) with hit singles “Stuck in My Head” and “III” while tackling anxiety and personal stagnation on “Paralyzed” and “Numb,” respectively. Musically speaking, Moore and his bandmates—guitarist Daniel Pruitt, bassist Paolo Vergara, and drummer Ben Pruitt—combine metalcore and R&B while taking the next logical lyrical step.\n\n“I feel like it’s a good continuation of where we left off with <i>Paper Hearts</i>,” Moore says. “<i>Paper Hearts</i> was the broken heart. <i>Afterglow</i> is the part where, even though you’ve been brokenhearted, you still have feelings for the person. It’s the remnants of what was.” Below, he comments on each track.\n\n<b>“Static”</b>\n“This was one of those songs where we couldn’t figure out a good subject [for the lyrics] at first. But then, it finally came to me: I was driving home from the studio, like, ‘Loud static, can’t get peace, talking, too much noise.’ I literally sent that in a text message to the band. Everything came so quickly for us that it seemed like there was no peace, no quiet time. It’s not a bad thing—I’m grateful for it—but we’re still getting used to it. So, ‘Static’ is about adapting to this new life of ours.”\n\n<b>“Hourglass”</b>\n“You can’t let some things catch up to you. In the second verse, it says, ‘You can’t stop, it’s closing in around you/Look back and it rips you away.’ I guess maybe you could tie it into your anxieties. You’ve got to keep going. You can’t stop.”\n\n<b>“III”</b>\n“This was written about a specific somebody that, if you listen to the lyrics, you can tell I’m not very fond of. They’re no longer in my life. Sometimes you give people opportunities, you give people chances to do cool stuff, but they’ll go and soil it. People say that bad stuff comes in threes, but what we like to think is that the person who is the topic of this song is the worst of all three. Whether it’s tornadoes, tsunamis, war, famine—I don’t care what it is: I would much rather deal with the other two than deal with this person.”\n\n<b>“Fallout”</b>\n“It’s about dealing with someone who has their claws in you somehow. They make you feel as if you’re the crazy one, but you’re in a constant back-and-forth with that person. In the first verse, it says, ‘Do you remember how it felt each time you looked at me/The way you hated what you see?/I never told you it’s a feeling I remember too/It’s how I feel when I see you.’ So, you both have the same feeling, and it’s a constant pull back and forth between the victim and the instigator.”\n\n<b>“Stuck in My Head”</b>\n“It’s as simple as it sounds: You’ve got somebody who’s stuck in your head. No matter what you do, no matter where you go, no matter how you do it, no matter how you try to get away from it, you just cannot get said person out of your head. It could be in a good way or a bad way. You might be driving down the street, and the person’s not with you. But the song you and said person listened to comes on, and it’s bringing back memories like an annoyance.”\n\n<b>“Gravity”</b>\n“This one was written back in 2021, far before Sleep Theory was the band that it is. It was just myself and our producer that wrote this one. You and another person are interested in each other, but they’re in a relationship. They know their relationship is failing, and you know that you’ll be better than the person that they’re with. You’re not trying to convince them to leave their person, but you’re alluding to the fact that you are better than said person. It’s like your classic R&B, ‘Will he love you the way that I do?’ She wants something new. She knows that she likes you, and you know that you like her, but the dude is just in the freaking way.”\n\n<b>“Afterglow”</b>\n“It’s a ballad. It’s a little bit deeper and a lot more heartfelt and meaningful than ‘Stuck in My Head,’ but it’s essentially the same thing. It’s like you’re caught in the afterglow of what you used to have with whoever it is that you can apply the song to. Whenever a light goes out or a star explodes, there’s an afterglow for a split second. Even though it’s over and done, the light that was there, you’re still caught up in the afterglow.”\n\n<b>“Numb”</b>\n“It’s about feeling as if you’re stuck in a place or a routine that you can’t get out of. You’re stuck in the same back-and-forth, and you just feel numb. You’re looking for a change in life, but you feel stagnant. You just want to feel something again, but everything that you try to do doesn’t give you that spark.”\n\n<b>“Parasite”</b>\n“This is about a person who’s a leech, a person who won’t let go of things and who will deny, deny, deny that they are an issue. They’re stuck on just trying to be a part of what you have—or trying to take what you have. They always victimize themselves. They’ll say everybody else is the issue, but they don’t want to see that they’re the issue. So, we’re telling them to accept the fact that they’re the parasite they are. Instead of acting like you’re not, just lean into it.”\n\n<b>“Just a Mistake”</b>\n“It’s about the fear of being alone. You’re in a relationship with a person, but you’re trying to get away from them. You both know you’re not good for each other, you both know that you’re sick of each other, but you always come back. You know it’s toxic, but you like the toxicity behind it, and you can’t get away from it. In the bridge, it says, ‘You keep saying it’s over tomorrow, but you always follow me home/We both hate it, you’re making me crazy, but it’s better than being alone.’”\n\n<b>“Paralyzed”</b>\n“When we were writing this, we were thinking of sleep paralysis, the demon sitting on your chest at night. Even if you’re paralyzed by the fear inside, the pain is only temporary. It’s talking about your inner anxieties, the fact that you’re terrified of what you are and what you could let yourself be. You’re being held down by your own insecurities.” \n\n<b>“Words Are Worthless”</b>\n“This is another ballad. You’re chasing after someone and you’re trying to find the words to speak to them and say the things that you need to say, but sometimes the words that you use aren’t enough to really get through. You find out that words are worthless. It says, ‘If I could keep you from falling to pieces/I’d be saving myself in the process/We’ll collapse every word.’ Sometimes you find out that no matter what you say, no matter how you say it, the words are worthless.”","short":"The Memphis band’s full-length debut doubles down on relatability."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/afterglow/1789607708","playParams":{"id":"1789607708","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5VFCZaivqUDRJq34ylEbt5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1789607708/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1624884753","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1624884753?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747418359339}}},"1791547576":{"id":"1791547576","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791547576?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/cc/55/8a/cc558aee-091b-f25e-b65a-93c79198a509/b5f854fe-fde3-44e3-a061-f7124a6e3b3f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"1e1e1d","textColor2":"0f0f0e","textColor4":"252423","textColor1":"070707","bgColor":"7c7a78","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/m%C3%B8/511617296","name":"Plæygirl","artistName":"MØ","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/cc/bf/beccbf6f-7b37-4cb5-5648-6c13bd68a32a/196872794625.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":6000,"textColor3":"dad3cd","textColor2":"f7ede5","textColor4":"d8d0c9","textColor1":"faf1e9","bgColor":"5c5c5c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pl%C3%A6ygirl/1791547576","playParams":{"id":"1791547576","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7gT1PWuFHJMn0gFxHKZROu"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1791547576/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"511617296","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/511617296?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747398986676}}},"1792447165":{"id":"1792447165","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1792447165?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e0/be/ac/e0beac87-935f-4301-51d3-208907918c44/e84e4e98-fd39-4314-ba91-e573bda7111e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"312f2e","textColor2":"1a1c21","textColor4":"3f3f3f","textColor1":"09090d","bgColor":"d4c8b5","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/64/6b/0a646b7a-0ab1-b5f2-6330-0b946595b71c/f076dde7-ab14-46b0-9a07-a70cc64a2c32.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cad3d4","textColor2":"c6e3f9","textColor4":"aac3d8","textColor1":"eef7f4","bgColor":"3b4252","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/spill-tab/1440467280","name":"ANGIE","artistName":"spill tab","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/33/db/5f/33db5fe2-06c6-d626-b1e0-7fe677bfe106/5056556152217_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"adb4ac","textColor2":"c5d3cb","textColor4":"a0aca6","textColor1":"d4ddd3","bgColor":"101012","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Having spent five years signposting the direction of her musical journey with a consistent flow of subtly evolving EP releases, LA-based singer-songwriter Claire Chicha—aka spill tab—has arrived at her destination: her debut album, <i>ANGIE</i>. “I think I’ve always had this goal where I’m trying to represent myself the fullest of my ability in a two-minute song, and I think I’ve been realizing through the process of EPs that that’s not possible,” Chicha told Apple Music 1’s Hanuman Welch. “I do feel like this album, as much as I possibly could, represents not only where I’m from, but where I want to go and the music that I’m listening to now, the music that I’ve been listening to for the past 10 years.” \n\nChicha’s work draws inspiration from myriad sources, blending her appreciation for R&B, electropop, rock, jazz, and more into a unique wash of dreamlike alt-pop, roughened round the edges with unexpected synth embellishments as showcased on tracks like “Athlete” or the bold distortion that scuffs through “De Guerre.” “It speaks to the conversation between the digital and organic and the destruction and the rebuilding that comes with just feeding a sound back and forth, from an analog synth into a computer back into a pedal,” said Chicha, who co-wrote and produced the bulk of the record with John Hill (FKA twigs, Charli xcx) and Solomonophonic (SZA, Remi Wolf). “Those conversations, musically, are what make me the most excited about musicmaking.

Album","standard":"Lido Pimienta doesn’t put out music very often—she averages one album roughly every five years—but the Colombian-born, Toronto-based auteur ensures that every release is a game-changing, 180-degree heel turn that rewards your patience and alters your perception of her artistry. Even in a discography that spans the electronic avant-pop experiments of 2016’s Polaris Music Prize-winning <i>La Papessa</i> and the Afro Colombian roots-music explorations of 2020’s <i>Miss Colombia</i>, <i>La Belleza</i> (Spanish for “the beauty”) is distinguished by its sheer audacity. Inspired by the film scores of Czech composer Luboš Fišer, <i>La Belleza</i> sees Pimienta dive headlong into the world of classical music, with the help of Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra, producer/string arranger Owen Pallett, and a backing choir that veers between Gregorian chants and castrati trills. \n\nBut Pimienta uses these European musical traditions in service of deeply personal meditations on love and identity, paying tribute to her homeland on the harp-plucked lullaby “Mango,” addressing the reconciliation with her almost-ex-husband on the stirring serenade “¿Quién Tiene La Luz (El Perdón),” and smuggling Caribbean rhythms into the orchestra pit on “El Dembow del Tiempo.” But even non-Spanish-speaking listeners will get easily swept up in <i>La Belleza</i>’s overwhelming emotional power. Pimienta was already a force of nature, but when backed by the earthquaking militaristic march of “Aun Te Quiero,” she sounds truly omnipotent.","short":"The Colombian Canadian agitator shakes up the orchestra pit."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/la-belleza/1795916981","playParams":{"id":"1795916981","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1yrLDmQpBtegl8j11u08vk"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1795916981/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"389475023","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/389475023?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747435031070}}},"1796227222":{"id":"1796227222","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796227222?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/haken/363702196","name":"Liveforms: An Evening With Haken (Live in London 2024)","artistName":"Haken","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/52/78/e152787e-fcf6-65e9-f512-a102c34db2c4/196872621228.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"443126","textColor2":"562312","textColor4":"764631","textColor1":"170905","bgColor":"f7d1aa","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/liveforms-an-evening-with-haken-live-in-london-2024/1796227222","playParams":{"id":"1796227222","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0eE2ZynDLL8R55NWXNm1TG"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796227222/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"363702196","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/363702196?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1746699377261}}},"1796262988":{"id":"1796262988","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796262988?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2b/31/c5/2b31c5c1-3384-beb6-c0f1-b7b9e2891d82/Job315c6d02-dd66-486a-83c6-b9fd949e9377-192508619-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377054584_2161033696-Time1747244200905.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e4a984"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"bab5b6","textColor2":"e4a984","textColor4":"b8886b","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f8/14/2e/f8142e95-2691-cdb8-fc62-881688cb0858/df4029fa-a502-47e7-b79e-c73576843b30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"44403c","textColor2":"311b1a","textColor4":"514040","textColor1":"211a15","bgColor":"d1d5d9","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3c/80/0f/3c800f7c-2879-fa10-8c7a-098e70fb1e18/Jobaa6050d9-4d39-4a17-98b1-b2793256562f-192508618-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377054583_2161033695-Time1747243223043.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"b8b3b6","textColor2":"e0d0c8","textColor4":"b5a8a1","textColor1":"e4dee3","bgColor":"0b0704","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ad/3c/fc/ad3cfce3-098c-b601-d30f-0ee8053a484b/5bd940ae-4a70-4f3d-b709-58e5df7b1d13.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2b2929","textColor2":"1b0e08","textColor4":"342a25","textColor1":"0f0d0e","bgColor":"9b9897","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rico-nasty/1158173683","name":"LETHAL","artistName":"Rico Nasty","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1425,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/71/84/95/718495da-8e6b-ae80-f239-d8d1d21b551e/075679636836.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1425,"textColor3":"b9b4b7","textColor2":"e8ad88","textColor4":"bc8b6e","textColor1":"e5dfe4","bgColor":"0a0605","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When Rico Nasty proclaims, “I don’t sound like anyone, these bitches sound like me” on <i>LETHAL</i> highlight “BUTTERFLY KISSES,” she has a point. She’s one of the earliest luminaries of the rap-meets-metal marriage that has surfaced over the last decade-plus, and she’s arguably the best at merging those worlds too. The Prince George’s County, Maryland, native has blended a unique variety of chaotic rage-rap since her entry into the music industry in the mid-2010s, and she backs it up with mosh-heavy live shows, mercurial hairdos, and eccentric fashion sense. \n\nBut since feeling restricted by her persona after the release of 2022’s <i>Las Ruinas</i>, she switched things up: She left the major-label system, signed to indie outfit Fueled by Ramen (the label that exalted bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! At the Disco), and enlisted Imad Royal (The Chainsmokers, Panic! At the Disco) as the executive producer for her next record. \n\nMany of her fans already associate her with creating on her own terms, but <i>LETHAL</i><> is even more freewheeling than usual. “SOUL SNATCHER” finds her mutating between a half-dozen rap voices while boasting about her sexual prowess, “SMOKE BREAK” is full of guttural metal screams, “PINK” glows with bubbly femininity, and “CRASH” is a catchy pop-rock cut. The album is sonically unpredictable, but her unbridled confidence and chameleonic versatility hold everything together. \n\nRico Nasty takes time for reflection as well: “SMILE” is a tender ode to her teenage son, and “YOU COULD NEVER” is a career retrospective that shows her earnestly proud of all she’s persevered. “When I reflect back, I know I’m blessed/I’ma be myself, you could be the rest,” she says on the latter. It’s an approach that’s proven effective for Rico, time and time again.","short":"Sonic unpredictability held together by unbridled confidence."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lethal/1796262988","playParams":{"id":"1796262988","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0HkRlQCLTYsr1K5cD33Gr4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1796262988/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1158173683","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1158173683?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747414839085}}},"1797151472":{"id":"1797151472","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1797151472?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/dc/1c/85/dc1c8542-262b-c3ce-ae83-6daf43032266/Joba6c6acb6-252f-4da4-8c9b-1e188b828073-188385822-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368900763_2093092812-Time1742491716581.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","201714"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"020001"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"372004","textColor2":"201714","textColor4":"4c2f12","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"020001","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/43/da/9c/43da9caa-97ae-3e4f-162a-2a77e097f444/858c2e02-4cfd-406b-ac95-cb0f170498b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"312816","textColor2":"24170d","textColor4":"4e3a1c","textColor1":"000105","bgColor":"f6c459","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/82/35/1f/82351f99-c04f-d212-1e5c-b3161b29d919/Job5b13a4cf-eb37-4caa-8bef-3751428a761d-188385823-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_368900764_2093092813-Time1742493994611.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","3a1300"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"020001"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"381f04","textColor2":"3a1300","textColor4":"612c01","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"020001","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2c/43/81/2c43811a-b505-6838-8365-15600f1395dc/1eee76e0-b8b8-4fcf-8de4-11ff50ee646a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"342311","textColor2":"211b0b","textColor4":"3f3016","textColor1":"130b05","bgColor":"b78342","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cautious-clay/1064628701","name":"The Hours: Morning","artistName":"Cautious Clay","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/9d/9e/7b9d9e39-9933-bcbf-a810-bdf7e455ca57/24CRGIM47947.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"331d00","textColor2":"020000","textColor4":"351d00","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ff9100","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Cautious Clay’s discography is charmingly unpredictable.

Album","standard":"The musician born Omar Banos emerged in the mid-2010s as a teenage old soul: His first brush with virality was for his slide-guitar cover of Santo & Johnny’s dreamy 1959 hit “Sleepwalk,” recorded in his high-school bedroom. A decade later, the 26-year-old singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist has amassed a die-hard fanbase for his vibey, lo-fi pop in which he draws from doo-wop, psych rock, and norteño and often lapses into Spanglish (as on his breakout single, 2017’s “Lo Que Siento”). “When I was first putting out music, I was always just trying to release—I didn’t necessarily have a timeline or an idea of what I wanted to do,” Cuco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But as everything became a little more established, I feel like taking the time to put together projects that felt cohesive would be worth taking the time.”\n\nHis third album, <i>Ridin’</i>, is a love letter to his hometown of Los Angeles—specifically, its Mexican American car culture. It’s also a callback to the old Chicano soul music he’s loved since he was little. “ICNBYH” feels beamed in from an AM radio broadcast circa the early ’70s, with its easygoing swirl of brass and woodwinds. Far from the Ableton experiments of his teenage bedroom, here he’s joined by a team of first-rate instrumentalists, from The Roots’ trumpeter Dave Guy (who appears on “My Old Friend”) to producer Thomas Brenneck, who’s worked with everyone from Amy Winehouse to Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. “It could be riding with the whips, riding for your people, riding through the motions of life,” Cuco says of the album’s title. Still, it’s built to be played in the car with the windows down.","short":"A love letter to LA’s car culture, built to be played with the windows down."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ridin/1799068738","playParams":{"id":"1799068738","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0inrolEzAhWvavaePiAp7O"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799068738/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1457270880","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1457270880?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747445810617}}},"1799246695":{"id":"1799246695","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799246695?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/giant/1596495229","name":"Stand And Deliver","artistName":"Giant","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/80/0a/47/800a47f8-f511-d45d-3b4e-2ce39be84f32/199066835760.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d1c0ad","textColor2":"dca477","textColor4":"b6835f","textColor1":"fff0d9","bgColor":"1b0201","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stand-and-deliver/1799246695","playParams":{"id":"1799246695","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7ivnsIt41NZEURYrccDtOW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799246695/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1596495229","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1596495229?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747395044565}}},"1799727544":{"id":"1799727544","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1799727544?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/82/76/3e/82763e11-4494-9f28-865f-7400d6425053/Jobf0725de9-5c75-44f2-8015-b8901d6548b1-187351490-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366732699_2076964405-Time1741207138666.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f65f03"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2d1811"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c97036","textColor2":"f65f03","textColor4":"ce5106","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2d1811","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/12/81/47/128147ba-e851-da5c-26cc-f07ced8366f1/7a57a77e-a762-418e-b1cf-9a1c70baa887.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac8658","textColor2":"df8750","textColor4":"b36d40","textColor1":"d6a66d","bgColor":"060504","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/47/06/f3/4706f353-e5dd-025c-4842-055d15495a47/Job13397f26-9a9a-48ba-8ddd-e3407b8a0eb7-187351489-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_366732700_2076964406-Time1741206027238.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"c67840","textColor2":"f7690e","textColor4":"cd570e","textColor1":"ee934d","bgColor":"240f0d","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/bd/d8/6f/bdd86f64-04cd-e7c4-d39f-7cf9600bdf75/5fef0c80-96f8-453a-afdb-eac5aefe4991.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e3d3cf","textColor2":"f3eceb","textColor4":"dfccc7","textColor1":"f9f5f5","bgColor":"8e4b38","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/15/40/96/15409681-f233-280a-de46-93585119ab09/6ff4758c-df3a-4c58-8110-a17a23d17057.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c39f8d","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"a38e8a","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"050305","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blake-shelton/189204","name":"For Recreational Use Only","artistName":"Blake Shelton","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/45/55/4d/45554d7b-e299-f557-7482-9b1ce9a06e8f/4099964159899.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"ca7632","textColor2":"f8740a","textColor4":"ce600a","textColor1":"f28f3c","bgColor":"280f0b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"The Oklahoma native was arguably the most visible country musician of the 2010s, thanks to a record-breaking string of Billboard Country Airplay No. 1s and a 12-year stint as a coach on <i>The Voice</i>, during which he met his wife, Gwen Stefani. But as Blake Shelton tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, filming two seasons of <i>The Voice</i> per year left him feeling out of the loop as far as the Nashville scene. “By the time that those 12 years went by, all of a sudden it was like, man, I’ve gotten old now,” the 48-year-old singer admits. “You finally start looking at a chart, and you’re like, who the hell is Morgan Wallen? Who’s Luke Combs? It was like there was this whole new generation of artists who had taken over country music, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m one of the old guys now.’”\n\nNearly 25 years after breaking through with his 2001 debut single, “Austin” (and four years after his last full-length, 2021’s <i>Body Language</i>), Shelton wondered whether there was still room for him on the country charts. “If I do put out a new record, are they going to play it? Are the fans waiting on it?” he recounts thinking. “Those are natural, normal things to think if you’re being honest with yourself, and I try to be.” \n\nOn his 13th studio album, <i>For Recreational Use Only</i>, he puts those feelings into songs that sound like the Blake Shelton you know—a sincere storyteller who prides himself on his performance—but still swings for the fences here and there. Lead single “Texas” is a lost-love number that nods to George Strait’s “All My Ex’s Live in Texas” and channels the minor-key melodrama of Ronnie Milsap’s “Stranger in My House.” And “Let Him in Anyway,” co-written by HARDY, allows Shelton to get existential, grappling with grief, God, and the afterlife.\n\nLooking back at his early career, Shelton remembers being elated and terrified at once, worried his success would disappear overnight. “I loved it so much that I couldn’t be comfortable that it wouldn’t be gone someday,” he says. “It was all I ever wanted to be: one of the guys that I was hearing on the radio. I didn’t even know how to do it, and the fact that it was happening, it was like, I want to hang on to this forever.

On <i>FOREVER</i>, the low-tech post-punk minimalism and Soundcloud-rap graininess of old gives way to pure ’90s alt-rock nostalgia and Warped Tour worship, with the yearning melodies and high-octane riffs of tracks like “seventeen” demonstrating why he was tapped to open stadium shows for blink-182 in the summer of 2024.\n\nBut <i>FOREVER</i> also sees EKKSTACY moving beyond the in-your-face/heart-on-sleeve approach of pop-punk and immersing himself in the gauzy textures of shoegaze and dream-pop: “head in the clouds” echoes the slow-motion guitar surges on the classic Smashing Pumpkins album cut “Mayonnaise,” while the closer “keep my head in down” is a twinkling, twangy lullaby that travels down Mazzy Star’s lost highway.","short":"The electro-emo hero lives out his ’90s alt-rock fantasies."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever/1800323940","playParams":{"id":"1800323940","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52iIfDstVzVMMAuOsFJ2YA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800323940/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1504423866","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1504423866?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747395094232}}},"1800504135":{"id":"1800504135","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800504135?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7f/8e/68/7f8e682a-793b-329e-f0bc-a5cb57244dfe/0ae87800-fccd-4cdf-a9fe-63fd8c5f8dfa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c4b6b4","textColor2":"f4c4b4","textColor4":"c69c90","textColor1":"f1e3e1","bgColor":"100001","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/56/b4/35/56b4355e-e27a-83d9-a656-512515d8ee17/039f2968-9379-4bf8-acff-17f639b343ef.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"242423","textColor2":"232323","textColor4":"40403f","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b7b4af","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/d9/89/ab/d989ab3d-2e9e-318a-143f-d2a83b5cb037/c910f6b1-2d55-4cd1-a874-83d8f6567e5b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4c4c49","textColor2":"272523","textColor4":"4e4d49","textColor1":"242423","bgColor":"edeae1","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/damiano-david/1767322404","name":"FUNNY little FEARS","artistName":"Damiano David","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/96/42/0e/96420e54-8ae8-20f7-7ca8-70afaccebd7d/196872958799.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c4c3b8","textColor2":"ece8e4","textColor4":"bfbcb9","textColor1":"f2f0e3","bgColor":"0b100a","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“Italian pop drama” is how Damiano David describes <i>FUNNY little FEARS</i>—with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. As you’d expect from Måneskin’s lead singer, David hasn’t done things by half for his solo debut album, collaborating with Labrinth, Suki Waterhouse, and d4vd to create an imposing sound. <i>FUNNY little FEARS</i> swings from stadium-ready swaggers like “Next Summer” to angst wrapped in the happy melody of “Tango.” But those fears, however funny and little, are never far from the surface.\n\n“I think my biggest fear is loneliness,” David tells Apple Music’s Travis Mills. “I really don’t cope well when I’m traveling too much, and I’m never going back home or have my girlfriend or my close friends around. I start overthinking and hurting myself with my own thoughts.”\n\nDavid’s main purpose with the album is to get over the things that hold him back. “I’m still the frontman of Måneskin, and it’s a big part of myself, but it’s not my 100%,” he says. “And for me, it’s very important that people understand that. I’ve found myself very stuck in my dynamics, fears, and habits, and this album was a way to break it down. At the end of it all, I consider myself healed for most of it. It’s like, ‘Yes, you’re scared, but everybody’s scared. It’s not a big deal. You can fight through it.’”\n\nDespite the instant crowd-pleasing appeal of tracks like “Next Summer,” David reveals he has a spontaneous approach to songwriting and doesn’t fall into the trap of chasing hits. “I consider it a stadium ballad. Lighters up,” he says. “It’s weird for me because I am never really aware of what I’m doing, where I’m going, and what I’m talking about. I discover it later when I have the song in front of me. I never go in the studio with the idea: ‘Today, we have to make a ballad. Today, we have to make a hit.’ For me, it's like a big game. Let’s write a song. If we do it, it’s already a miracle because we got into a room where there’s nothing and we get out with a song. It’s already magic. It doesn't have to be a hit.”\n\nThere’s a definite energy shift throughout the album where David goes from self-doubt to contentment with the beautiful love song “Angel.” It’s something he acknowledges, too. “I’m a way happier person,” he says. “If you compare myself with myself one year ago, I smile way more.”","short":"Måneskin’s charismatic lead singer finds “pop drama” on his solo debut."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/funny-little-fears/1800504135","playParams":{"id":"1800504135","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4xc5MKpCUw1LREm6cnBtOa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800504135/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1767322404","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1767322404?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747405750769}}},"1800532611":{"id":"1800532611","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800532611?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0b/e3/73/0be3737b-d0df-f65d-0944-42e3f2c73b22/Job7077c356-5e79-449b-b9b3-c1393fc1f86b-187886480-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367887303_2085386599-Time1741879186664.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fab6cb"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"464649"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"dac0ca","textColor2":"fab6cb","textColor4":"dda1b3","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"464649","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/09/c0/81/09c08114-907d-40db-b9a4-7b6b4a3b0393/cba65531-efd6-40e7-b557-b4df1d62a88d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3b3b3b","textColor2":"1d1e1e","textColor4":"414143","textColor1":"161513","bgColor":"cfd1da","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f0/bd/f6/f0bdf64c-c0ca-1434-4d91-a34de2b5013e/Job483f8548-f29f-41ef-af92-96ed3e4cd1e7-187886481-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_367887304_2085386088-Time1741880290616.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f7d0d5"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"464649"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cccdd3","textColor2":"f7d0d5","textColor4":"d3b4b9","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"464649","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/77/b3/1e/77b31e73-3482-3f3f-3b17-585c23b03b12/601bd72f-0287-4d31-ac24-efb677bdbf50.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d2a7b7","textColor2":"efb0c9","textColor4":"d09db2","textColor1":"f2bdd0","bgColor":"515155","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0e/fe/ed/0efeeda8-89b0-2670-ae14-6653efaac7e9/bc87dec5-b42e-4481-b28e-84000c57c13b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9bfa9","textColor2":"eeccd6","textColor4":"c9adb5","textColor1":"efe2c7","bgColor":"323134","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sleep-token/1153723033","name":"Even In Arcadia","artistName":"Sleep Token","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/45/76/46/457646e0-7bba-770b-f18c-12f7b479dca6/196872847215.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c3b9bf","textColor2":"d5d6db","textColor4":"b8b9bd","textColor1":"e3d6dd","bgColor":"434345","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Will you listen?” Sleep Token vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Vessel asks on “Look to Windward,” the opening track from the band’s fourth album. Once again, the masked British phenoms seamlessly blend genres as the song goes from <i>Kid A</i>-era Radiohead to modern R&B to cinematic strings to an explosive metal riff. By now, fans have come to expect these kinds of dramatic shifts from the anonymous group, but <i>Even in Arcadia</i> isn’t just more of the same. It’s an expansion, the widening of an already impressive palette.\n\n“Emergence” offers the gospel refrain “Go ahead and wrap your arms around me” before Vessel raps over a loop of a trilling guitar and then weaves in and out of a beefy nu metal riff. “Dangerous” is probably the closest Sleep Token has come to pure Deftones, a band they’ve referenced, sonically and melodically, on previous albums. “Past Self” takes a more straight-ahead R&B approach, but with a vocal melody that echoes back on itself to create a disorienting stereo effect.\n\nMelancholy single “Damocles” references classic Greek mythology and seems to address Vessel’s personal struggles with fame and staying anonymous: “Nobody told me I’d get tired of myself/When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell.” “Caramel” might have a similar theme (“Wear me out like Prada, devil in my detail,” Vessel sings), but does it with a syncopated xylophone rhythm that drops into another Chino Moreno-like vocal melody over a tsunami of distorted guitars and a purgative nu metal beatdown.\n\n“Provider” channels neo-soul master D’Angelo as Vessel manages to rhyme “ICU” with “I see you” before the full-metal bridge kicks in. Closer “Infinite Baths” unfurls like an extended meditation in the eye of the storm until the inevitable screaming metal barrage—the longest and most ferocious on the album—takes over. And then it fades into the shadows again, just like the band itself.\n","short":"A daring expansion of the mysterious UK band’s already sprawling palette."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/even-in-arcadia/1800532611","playParams":{"id":"1800532611","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800532611/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1153723033","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1153723033?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747398624547}}},"1800602631":{"id":"1800602631","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800602631?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/no-raza/686993516","name":"Tyrona","artistName":"No Raza","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/50/53/35/50533576-cd18-3a97-5c31-544a9cb7ed7d/4059473914389_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b78953","textColor2":"e38233","textColor4":"b96a2a","textColor1":"e1a967","bgColor":"110906","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tyrona/1800602631","playParams":{"id":"1800602631","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1kBixXoGsCKhQi4pHwW5rC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1800602631/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"686993516","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/686993516?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747395105822}}},"1801520741":{"id":"1801520741","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801520741?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/james-righton/200303454","name":"Untold: The Liver King (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)","artistName":"James Righton","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d8/86/52/d8865254-78f3-8dc4-a886-f26145308962/810123165735.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d3d1d1","textColor2":"fac188","textColor4":"cfa072","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"261e1b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/untold-the-liver-king-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film/1801520741","playParams":{"id":"1801520741","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7yc0ANLJBkgECWZ7Gtfyqe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801520741/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"200303454","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/200303454?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747369179952}}},"1801683602":{"id":"1801683602","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1801683602?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/37/a1/ce/37a1ce4d-197a-068a-a3d4-f02891df155a/1f9f7c48-163e-4f12-9dc2-cc8c1e5a8ecd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cb6bc3","textColor2":"e85db5","textColor4":"be4a9c","textColor1":"f785e7","bgColor":"190037","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/50/d5/20/50d5209b-f6f5-48dc-ee2d-69ce419c2e15/61761e81-cfc1-4b3c-9821-afc040874021.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"e1ccd4","textColor2":"f2eaed","textColor4":"dcc4cd","textColor1":"f8f4f6","bgColor":"832d4f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/00/f3/db/00f3db8f-6b5c-c844-e491-68d27b10aec3/53fbaeb8-7a6d-4f25-854d-aa53974a8205.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"da7e89","textColor2":"fb7fa7","textColor4":"dd6989","textColor1":"f899a6","bgColor":"661311","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/arcade-fire/23203991","name":"Pink Elephant","artistName":"Arcade Fire","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/08/dd/f7/08ddf748-8c27-c083-bebd-f610d33c1b27/196872846362.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"edbdcd","textColor2":"fed9b7","textColor4":"f2b2a2","textColor1":"f8e7ed","bgColor":"c0134f","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"If you’re surprised that <i>Pink Elephant</i>, the first album by Arcade Fire in three tumultuous years, begins with a cinematic three-minute drone that summons the deep-space sounds of Morton Subotnick, check the credits. Alongside Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, Daniel Lanois—a fellow Canadian who has applied a near-magical touch to records by U2, Bob Dylan, and Brian Eno for nearly half a century—co-produced the band’s seventh album, speckling it with stereo delays and assorted abstractions. In fact, that opener, “Open Your Heart or Die Trying,” is but one of three instrumentals on this 10-track record. Where “Beyond Salvation” embeds scrambled samples amid a fantastic glissando, “She Cries Diamond Rain” is a celestial hum.\n\nThese wordless pieces from the famously righteous Montreal-based outfit suggest a band trying to reimagine its future in the present, trying to feel its way forward after personnel and personal complications since 2022’s <i>WE</i>. The title track is a web of misgivings, Butler looking at the world and making mental traps of everything he encounters. During first single “Year of the Snake,” Lanois calls back to several of the techniques he used to make <i>The Joshua Tree</i> feel both anxious and epic as Chassagne and Butler deliver a fraught duet about where they head from here. “If you feel strange, it’s probably good,” they repeat, alternately delivering that last line like it soothes or stings. \n\nThey experiment with a handful of new modes here, from the dark dancing of “Circle of Trust” to the arcing acoustic grandeur of “Ride or Die.” But they finally dig into their bygone glory days for closer “Stuck in My Head,” where

Album","standard":"He may be the biggest star in country music at a time when country music’s bigger than it’s been this century, but Morgan Wallen remembers when he was the underdog. “Once you get to know me, I’m a coyote in a field of wolves,” he sings in his raspy twang on “I’m a Little Crazy,” a tale of moonshine runs and late-night paranoia that closes out his fourth album, <i>I’m the Problem</i>. Speaking to Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen, the 32-year-old Tennessee native singled out the line as his favorite. “At times in my life, I haven’t felt like I was invited,” he admits. “To me, that's what that line says: ‘Hey, I know I wasn’t invited, but I’m still eating, and I’m still fed.’”\n\nSince his sophomore album, 2021’s 30-track <i>Dangerous: The Double Album</i>, Wallen’s hyper-prolific bent has become a winning strategy. His 36-track follow-up, 2023’s <i>One Thing at a Time</i>, spawned eight singles (including the inescapable “Last Night”) and broke Garth Brooks’ Billboard record for most weeks at No. 1 by a country album. Not to be outdone, <i>I’m the Problem</i> clocks in at 37 tracks and nearly two hours long. But those hours fly by like a summer evening on the porch with a cooler of cold ones: No one crafts hooky, aerodynamic country anthems like Wallen and his longtime crew of co-writers and producers (HARDY, Ernest Keith Smith, Charlie Handsome, Ashley Gorley, Joey Moi).\n\nThere are the requisite odes to whiskey, women, bucks, and trucks, and Wallen’s in his sweet spot when he’s probing his own conscience, which he does with surprising nuance on songs like “Kick Myself,” a roots-rock exploration of vice and accountability: “Nothing’s changed/In a way it’s getting way, way worse,” he concludes after kicking his bad habits and realizing his problems remain. Themes of addiction and temptation continue through “Genesis,” which Wallen wrote from the top down; rather than starting with the hook like usual, he relished the challenge of flipping the first book of the Bible into something catchy and cool: “I’m like, ‘How would you write a Genesis song? What would it mean? How do you do that without sounding cheesy?’”\n\nYou’d expect the crossover country star of the 2020s to be running a victory lap, but the prevailing mood on <i>I’m the Problem</i> is heartbreak—served up with extra salt on the breakup banger “I Got Better,” but more often with whiskey-soaked regret on singles like “Lies Lies Lies” and “Just in Case.” (“I think there’s a lot of feelings on this album,” he says. “Happy is not the one I do best, normally.”) But the emotional centerpiece is “Superman,” the first song he’s written for his young son, on which Wallen admits his imperfections to the little guy: “I don’t always save the day,” he sings, “but you know for you, I’ll always try.” \n\n“There’s a lot of different things that I felt like I was trying to do,” he says of the deeply personal track. “Not only let him know where I fall short, but also give him advice, let him know I’m protecting him.” Generation-defining country juggernauts have feelings, too, y’know.\n","short":"The king of 2020s country\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d\u001d on his next opus: “There’s a lot of feelings.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/im-the-problem/1802103958","playParams":{"id":"1802103958","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IZ8sY5FjtL9hloXpv0XbD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802103958/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"829142092","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/829142092?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747438046260}}},"1802200212":{"id":"1802200212","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802200212?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Rock","Psychedelic"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-dandy-warhols/767263","name":"ROCK REMAKER - EP","artistName":"The Dandy Warhols","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/fe/fb/a2/fefba2f0-b005-cb57-4be7-cee144812ebc/113465.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c3b35","textColor2":"0e0c05","textColor4":"3c3b35","textColor1":"0e0c05","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rock-remaker-ep/1802200212","playParams":{"id":"1802200212","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802200212/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"767263","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/767263?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747303858513}}},"1802250617":{"id":"1802250617","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802250617?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Country"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/de/c8/26/dec826ab-458d-99ed-f23c-cb1d0fdf7ae6/d02a9219-2059-47b3-981f-af99a449c319.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b9934c","textColor2":"d39d49","textColor4":"a97e3a","textColor1":"e7b860","bgColor":"030100","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/2e/1b/ef/2e1bef5f-fc36-281c-3bf7-ee878802f1bf/74fdc8d9-c5ca-467b-8ffb-4111eb007781.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d0c9","textColor2":"fbb84e","textColor4":"dea54b","textColor1":"efeeeb","bgColor":"67573e","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2b/02/43/2b0243c4-0072-f8fe-3ccf-c8939a10f3ce/d0309953-e91e-401a-aa81-d7e2a241620c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a19154","textColor2":"d48d4f","textColor4":"aa713f","textColor1":"c9b569","bgColor":"030100","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/maren-morris/262260873","name":"D R E A M S I C L E","artistName":"Maren Morris","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9e/fe/a4/9efea436-6758-0c55-b271-b83f28c9aa68/196872746525.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e3a14a","textColor2":"feb039","textColor4":"e39a31","textColor1":"fdb858","bgColor":"794415","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Even on her major-label debut, 2016’s <i>Hero</i>, Maren Morris bent the rules of traditional country radio: She cursed, read men for filth, and, on breakthrough single “My Church,” bucked the title’s pious implication by declaring the radio, not the church, as her salvation. Since then, the Texas-born singer-songwriter (who moved to Nashville in her twenties at the behest of her pal Kacey Musgraves) has purposefully distanced herself from the Music City machine, mocking the industry’s conservatism on 2023’s “The Tree” and promoting 2024’s <i>Intermission</i> EP explicitly as pop. The five tracks from that EP appear alongside nine new ones on Morris’ fourth album, <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>—an even bolder departure from her country roots.\n\nFor both <i>Intermission</i> and <i>D R E A M S I C L E</i>, Morris veered away from Music Row and towards a crack team of pop songwriters (among them Julia Michaels, Tobias Jesso Jr., and MUNA). There’s no mistaking lead single “people still show up” for anything like country; instead, Morris sounds funkier than ever over a slow-simmering Jack Antonoff groove in celebration of the safety net friends provide after a breakup. “I wrote it back in early 2023, before a lot of my personal life stuff was imploding,” Morris tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, referring in part to her 2024 divorce. “So it was almost like this premonition of a song.”\n\nCatharsis comes up often: On the ’80s R&B throwback “cry in the car,” Morris extols the virtues of weeping at the wheel, and on the Julia Michaels duet “cut!” all the therapy and yoga in the world can’t match the release of a good scream session. And though “too good” might be the record’s twangiest moment, it’s also the pettiest: “Bitch, you still owe me rent!” Morris yowls to an ex, hoping that the couch they’re crashing on these days is comfy. “I don’t want perfection from my idols,” she tells Lowe. “I want them to be honest, as much as they’re willing to be. I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”\n","short":"A bold step further into pop: “I want it to be a little bit human and messy.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/d-r-e-a-m-s-i-c-l-e/1802250617","playParams":{"id":"1802250617","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5joLpod4NFAHs4p1ORo8g2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802250617/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"262260873","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/262260873?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747428840930}}},"1803733232":{"id":"1803733232","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803733232?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/19/41/fa/1941fa68-dfef-00f5-593c-fd46d93e4070/Job2a0b598d-5993-4549-93d1-e0bd10237a99-192525696-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377092617_2161348168-Time1747254020478.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","2d2422"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"494540"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f3c3e","textColor2":"2d2422","textColor4":"4e4646","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"494540","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a0/8e/8e/a08e8ecb-8f74-5630-59a6-588611fcc76f/0b916aa5-e811-4917-83d3-74f4406dfd85.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"363c29","textColor2":"161611","textColor4":"3f3a2a","textColor1":"0b180f","bgColor":"e2cc92","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/5b/b9/07/5bb90731-5257-363d-ff5b-7cf72eac8ee8/Job8eb44479-a8ec-4371-aeff-633c99931339-192525698-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377092616_2161348167-Time1747255975704.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3b3939","textColor2":"312922","textColor4":"514942","textColor1":"151516","bgColor":"d2cac5","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7b/a8/48/7ba848f4-0f64-e93a-41d2-131e0e085ddf/dbb46e5f-6fdc-4354-bd2f-574a01bc2ace.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"262525","textColor2":"080608","textColor4":"282627","textColor1":"060505","bgColor":"a8a7a6","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amin%C3%A9/1097595072","name":"13 Months of Sunshine","artistName":"Aminé","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2d/e4/53/2de453a8-3721-d972-378c-68b2b64154d0/810129980011.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3b3a3a","textColor2":"161617","textColor4":"3a3a39","textColor1":"161618","bgColor":"cdcac3","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"The Portland rapper broke through in 2016 with the carefree “Caroline” as an eager student of André 3000 and Tyler, The Creator, then spent the next almost-decade finding his own voice: witty but searching, with a penchant for bright, bubbly beats.

But it’s not all affogatos and plunge pools: On Leon Thomas duet “New Flower!” he recalls his days as an intern for Complex and Def Jam, remembering being sent to fetch sandwiches for Big Sean. And after a beat switch on Afrobeats bop “13MOS,” he dives deep into his Ethiopian and Eritrean family legacy: “I was named after my grandfather/So, I can’t put shame to the name I’m proud

Album","standard":"“I’ve been realizing that I really made the album that I needed to heal myself,” Kali Uchis tells Apple Music about <i>Sincerely,</i> perhaps her most liberating work yet. The Colombian American singer-songwriter’s catalog has never felt slight or frivolous, whether in English or in Spanish. Yet this full-length follow-up to her 2024 <i>ORQUÍDEAS</i> dyad presents as something truly unique, arriving roughly a decade after her promising EP debut <i>Por Vida</i>. \n\nThe majority of the songs here began simply as voice notes, fortuitously captured in inspired moments outside of the confines or pressures of a studio setting. “Messages would just feel like they were directly coming through me, and I just had to get them out,” she says. Given such natural creative origins, it should come as little surprise that the actual process behind the album eschewed industry norms altogether, favoring home recording and unconventional settings. And despite the demonstrated level of guest vocal talent at her fingertips, she opted out of features, too. “When you’re making emotional music, you have to actually dig into difficult subjects,” she says, marking a clear distinction between this piece and its star-powered predecessor.\n\nAs a result, <i>Sincerely,</i> feels disarmingly intimate for what is ostensibly a pop album, even one from as consistently adventurous an artist as Uchis. The evocative moments of opener “Heaven Is a Home…” and closer “ILYSMIH” speak on love in grand and sweeping gestures, the passing of her mother and the birth of her son making understandably profound impacts on the work. \n\nInfluences like Cocteau Twins and Fiona Apple can be felt in all that comes between those bookends. “There’s a lot of grief, but there’s a lot of joy,” she says, describing what seeps through the veil of “Silk Lingerie,” or the vamps of “Territorial.” Excess punctuation on titles like “Lose My Cool,” and “For: You” hint at the flowing prose of her lyrics as it contributes to an even greater whole. “I think it is a celebration of life in its own way,” she says, “in the sense of finding beauty in the pain and taking the good.”\n","short":"Kali Uchis gets intimate: “I made the album I needed to heal myself.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sincerely/1804747038","playParams":{"id":"1804747038","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2XhNukk6jDysbSRL7VsqYb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804747038/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"894731301","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/894731301?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747428983330}}},"1805251674":{"id":"1805251674","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1805251674?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/85/0a/c1/850ac10c-72f8-b488-c303-144b6230f7fd/Job1850f123-970c-4b92-a6bd-f43a7815a7a7-191899661-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375778912_2149140083-Time1746561675808.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","271f17"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"bcc3c1"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"343738","textColor2":"271f17","textColor4":"524b46","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"bcc3c1","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f2/a5/98/f2a59854-edad-4905-6d2b-a34075716bb2/1e2ea8f7-b229-4f4a-874d-a19fab72f539.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3a37","textColor2":"1e1a18","textColor4":"3d3b39","textColor1":"201a16","bgColor":"b8bcbd","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f8/16/6d/f8166dce-dfb9-e87e-25d8-d86dafb4389d/Job08cf97a0-9362-42ed-963d-694f729c8d49-191899662-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_375778911_2149140082-Time1746563142025.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","251c17"],"gradient":{"y2":0.29,"color":"bcc3c1"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"343739","textColor2":"251c17","textColor4":"514a45","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"bcc3c1","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cd/a3/34/cda33496-d90d-a6ae-c37e-6836cb89ff09/bc73039d-47b2-4864-8108-f6a4b9dd4bd2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"282929","textColor2":"1e1f20","textColor4":"363739","textColor1":"0c0d0d","bgColor":"989b9a","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/naomi-sharon/1459356994","name":"The Only Love We Know - EP","artistName":"Naomi Sharon","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ad/8f/62/ad8f6265-2b80-f91b-2bed-fcf39efa0436/51815.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333435","textColor2":"281e16","textColor4":"534b45","textColor1":"000102","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"As the first woman to sign to Drake’s OVO Sound label, Dutch singer-songwriter Naomi Sharon wasted no time in matching the high expectations set for her debut album, <i>Obsidian</i>, released in 2023. With her EP <i>The Only Love We Know</i>, Sharon aims to exceed them, diving into the emotional complexity of moving on from experiences that no longer serve your happiness. Jordan Ullman (of R&B duo Majid Jordan fame) helms production with assists from talent such as Alex Lustig (Drake, Lil Wayne) and hitmaker Justin Tranter—who applies their polished pop pen to “Can We Do This Over”—crafting a solid base of intricate but spacious instrumentals for Sharon’s spotless vocals to build on. \n\n“Bittersweet” calls for her to echo and boom with rich reverb; with “Soft Like Dawn” she allows it to float and drift over a haunting bassline sweetened by soothing guitar riffs. Sharon saves the best for last, powering the dynamic energy of the title track with stacked choral harmonies that soar above the steady, linear percussion of the otherwise unobtrusive beat. <i>The Only Love We Know</i> may deal in the language of letting go, but Sharon’s arresting performances compel the listener to stick around for more.\n","short":"Peerless vocals, dramatic neo-soul

On one hand, dreamy wisps of drum and bass and garage that clocked in at under two minutes; on the other, runaway megahits like “Boy’s a liar” and its subsequent Ice Spice remix. It’s a line PinkPantheress has trod deftly between her debut mixtape, 2021’s <i>to hell with it</i>, and her first studio album, 2023’s <i>Heaven knows</i>. “Half of me really wants to be a very recognized and one day iconic musician,” she tells Apple Music. “And then part of me is also like, being an unsung hero seems cool, too.”\n\nShe maintains the balance on her sophomore mixtape, <i>Fancy That</i>—at once slick and eccentric, nostalgic and new, crisp but not too clean. Here she channels the euphoria of ’90s big-beat heavy-hitters like Fatboy Slim or Basement Jaxx, the latter of whom she samples frequently throughout (most pointedly on “Romeo,” a nod to the UK duo’s 2001 hit of the same name). \n\nBasement Jaxx’s first album, <i>Remedy</i>, was a major source of inspiration. “It blew me away, and I felt things that I hadn’t felt before,” she says. She’s honed her knack for reinterpretation since. “Stars” features her second sample of Just Jack’s “Starz in Their Eyes” (she previously used it on 2021’s “Attracted to You”), and on “Tonight,” she flips a 2008 Panic! At the Disco cut into a swooning house number. Tying it together are her ethereal vocals, cooing sweet nothings across the pond over a bassline from The Dare on “Stateside”: “Never met a British girl, you say?”\n\nAs for where she stands on the superstar/unsung hero spectrum, she’s willing to tilt in favor of the latter at the moment. “I’m very happy to have an album that is way more pensive and less appealing to virality,” she says. “The first project was underdeveloped, but hype and hard and cool. Second project was well done, cohesive. I’ve proved I can do both. Now I can go and do exactly what I want.”\n","short":"The TikTok sensation wrestles with her own ambition on her second mixtape."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fancy-that/1806614239","playParams":{"id":"1806614239","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3o81FH5FTYVtoBQOZr3T7y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806614239/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1552521489","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1552521489?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747427552122}}},"1806720887":{"id":"1806720887","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806720887?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dylyn/1199142459","name":"Heavy - EP","artistName":"DYLYN","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d4/43/b3/d443b3ea-c300-fb17-49a5-11125d0641e2/067003982368.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9c2b9","textColor2":"f5e2cd","textColor4":"c9baa9","textColor1":"f5ece1","bgColor":"1a1c19","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heavy-ep/1806720887","playParams":{"id":"1806720887","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806720887/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1199142459","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1199142459?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747395067109}}},"1806742507":{"id":"1806742507","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806742507?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":17,"genreNames":["Pop Latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/98/2d/1d/982d1d22-b091-a694-8b42-e82b4e2b6247/Jobf02caf15-ed67-4829-b79d-dacc3d4b1cd7-192198966-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376409826_2154788360-Time1746901696447.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","efd3c8"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2b362b"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cdcec8","textColor2":"efd3c8","textColor4":"cfbcab","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2b362b","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/46/8c/31/468c31cc-3421-0127-9ec8-cadd6dcbda73/3d90bf3b-a595-4c49-a14a-71a241d4c138.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"383230","textColor2":"291f1a","textColor4":"433b39","textColor1":"1a130f","bgColor":"aeacb4","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4c/69/e4/4c69e480-6e36-bebf-695f-ae98692cab8a/Joba7b10897-3775-4a41-9357-7582e7659ccc-192198965-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_376409825_2154788367-Time1746900614063.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cbcdc9","textColor2":"eee2e8","textColor4":"cec6c6","textColor1":"ebeaec","bgColor":"4d593e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/38/2e/21/382e21f7-6e2e-68d8-ce1a-62eb2e40cfc2/9567a488-6be2-41bc-a3a7-c61cf641eba6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c7c4bd","textColor2":"d7d2b9","textColor4":"bab9a1","textColor1":"e7e0dc","bgColor":"475442","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6c/1b/7d/6c1b7dcd-064d-070c-9024-582c5e75b6ea/118f3a9e-f165-45e7-a8e2-1697950e4aeb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"2f2d2e","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"383536","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"9a99a0","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sebasti%C3%A1n-yatra/722264654","name":"Milagro","artistName":"Sebastián Yatra","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/80/2b/b5/802bb5bd-4ca3-e52b-b84a-81931603909a/25UMGIM44219.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c8c9c5","textColor2":"e69e84","textColor4":"c28c72","textColor1":"edebec","bgColor":"33422b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"A genuine sense of wonder often makes its way into Sebastián Yatra’s music, his lyrical thoughtfulness in matters of life and love proving pivotal to his process. Even as the Colombian singer saw his profile soar in the wake of his <i>Encanto</i> contribution “Dos Oruguitas,” that genuine nature behind his pop-music stylings proved inextricable on 2022’s ambitious and exploratory <i>Dharma</i>. \n\nHis proper follow-up to that album, <i>Milagro</i> concerns itself with the notion of everyday miracles, starting with the romantic probing of its title track and continuing through the broadly faith-based “Amen” and the “El final que soñábamos.” Obviously, matters of the heart remain a fixture of his songcraft, evident on the yearning pair “La Pelirroja” and “Disco Rayado.” On “Energía Bacana,” he describes a natural emotional high over a slowly paced thump, with handclaps and cheers cropping up intermittently. And while there’s no shortage of ballads here, Yatra concurrently pushes himself sonically further than before, the synth-rock surges of “París” and “Una Noche Sin Pensar” being the most obvious examples. Other shifts come more subtly, by way of the country-infused “La Pelirroja” and the subdued gospel choir of “La Primera Vez.” \n\nThough not wholly central to the album’s personal aims, some meaningful collaborations arise here and there. Sentiments swell with the florid poetry of “Templo de Piceas” opposite HUMBE and amid the tropical extravaganza of single “Vagabundo” with Manuel Turizo and Beéle. Yet it might be the simpler pleasures of a skillful interpolation like the reggaetón rework “2AM” with Bad Gyal that keeps his listeners returning for more.","short":"Miracles of love emerge across the Colombian singer’s latest."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/milagro/1806742507","playParams":{"id":"1806742507","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5yMYOAgxWplaESIY4hZdsR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806742507/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"722264654","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/722264654?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747424909165}}},"1806751140":{"id":"1806751140","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806751140?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/3d/78/c7/3d78c7ee-d554-59e0-04c7-449a28d27c9d/Job6b623c9f-ca1a-4dc9-a9a2-8b7dd6fc3ea2-189886610-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371790999_2115965946-Time1744156605567.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","f67808"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b0703"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"b16f05","textColor2":"f67808","textColor4":"c76007","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b0703","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/45/4b/ed/454bedb3-0181-1dae-c68b-f85d6254f5ba/0242cca8-036a-47ac-be2a-e1f965a51a24.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"523053","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"5f404a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ceb6cc","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/7f/d7/01/7fd701aa-9b8e-1cc7-c133-2cb42be822e3/Job7c7740bb-3f01-41ca-9460-f10ebde8cd9e-189886609-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371791000_2115965947-Time1744155462969.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"cf7615","textColor2":"e27408","textColor4":"bf6209","textColor1":"f78e17","bgColor":"31180e","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/08/a4/86/08a486b2-d884-a135-1173-a5b1940a30c9/4fd2ac4b-b16b-4cff-aa8f-bcd13c681b4a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"a9ab88","textColor2":"eb8c41","textColor4":"c2763a","textColor1":"cbcea2","bgColor":"1f1f1f","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/22/e1/fc/22e1fc2b-d495-a6b7-2722-4785309cda91/26563c64-67a9-4e70-9386-35ef43cba1e2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e0bfec","textColor2":"fbbef8","textColor4":"e4a4e8","textColor1":"f6dffd","bgColor":"863fa9","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tee-grizzley/1177271472","name":"Forever My Moment","artistName":"Tee Grizzley","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/91/92/0b/91920b16-b793-29d6-bfb2-38c6714619e7/075679613691.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1500,"textColor3":"d07318","textColor2":"e07900","textColor4":"bb6300","textColor1":"fa8d1d","bgColor":"290d02","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“First Day Out” may have thrust Tee Grizzley into breakout rap stardom, but his subsequent eight years of work and dedication have kept him in the conversation. A key and respected part of the contemporary Detroit hip-hop vanguard with some commercial hits under his belt, he brings both confidence and gravity to <i>Forever My Moment</i>. As the opening title track shifts from him spitting raw and a cappella to going in on a bone-chilling Helluva beat, he begins reflecting on how fresh money changed his situation and relationships. \n\nThis lay-of-the-land purview pervades much of the project’s runtime, with Grizzley shaking his head at both the state of the game and its players on “Jalen Hurtski” and “Rick Jameski.” On the provocatively titled (though in no way political) “They Shot at Trump,” he cautions bros and opps alike that anybody can get touched in these streets.

Bronx-born star Prince Royce kept that informal tradition going, opening his eponymous 2010 debut with a bachata-fied take on Ben E. King’s “Stand by Me.” Following 2024’s genre-affirming album <i>LLAMADA PERDIDA</i>, his <i>ETERNO</i> revisits the not-so-secret formula behind that early hit, offering tropical interpretations from a predominantly 20th-century songbook. \n\nAs expected, he takes certain bilingual liberties with the material almost immediately, the opening pair of “Dancing in the Moonlight” and “How Deep Is Your Love” made malleable through his approach. His preceding catalog of romantic works, and that silky smooth voice, makes every tweak and quirk a gratifying one, his versions never overstepping the original ubiquitous smashes from Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Stevie Wonder, among others. Though his takes on stone-cold classics certainly shine, Royce’s plays on relatively more modern cuts, like Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way,” stand out in the best way.","short":"The bachata

With its chipper synth melody and sweet Etta James sample, the song brought dance music to a new stratosphere of mainstream appeal and launched the career of the musician born Tim Bergling, better known as Avicii. He’d spend the next seven years as one of the world’s biggest DJs and a producer known to bridge the gap between electronic music and just about anything else—particularly country, as he pulled off on “Wake Me Up” and “Hey Brother”—before his tragic death in April 2018. \n\n<i>Avicii Forever</i> is the second compilation project dedicated to his legacy, fleshing out 2021’s six-track <i>Live a Life You Will Remember</i> EP into a 20-track selection from his vast discography, including the previously unreleased “Let’s Ride Away,” a song Bergling wrote with Kacey Musgraves before his death that now features vocals from country singer Elle King.","short":"A 20-track selection from the late Swedish DJ’s vast discography."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/avicii-forever/1807714113","playParams":{"id":"1807714113","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5VPw18vPykfaX5s3jiS0Ox"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807714113/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"298496035","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/298496035?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747450728885}}},"1808005214":{"id":"1808005214","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808005214?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/54/19/d2/5419d2cb-6699-aae8-cbf7-468358283b12/166e96be-057a-422c-8a45-aa759e8ce711.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"171d26","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"181d26","textColor1":"020203","bgColor":"6d89b2","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/39/33/c5/3933c548-cfdf-ea6b-5f1f-bc057ea836b3/9225be7f-2a19-485f-bdbc-06540fc9f2da.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"b5babe","textColor2":"d5d6d6","textColor4":"b4b5b5","textColor1":"d6dde2","bgColor":"303030","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jin/1191850724","name":"Echo","artistName":"Jin","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/90/35/34/90353434-7681-fbf0-e425-8f0252f401d7/198704436611_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"67adc0","textColor2":"62cfe3","textColor4":"54abbb","textColor1":"7ad1ea","bgColor":"1b1b1b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"Six months after his solo EP debut and roughly a year following his return from mandatory military service, BTS vocalist Jin returned with <i>Echo</i>, a seven-track reflection on life, love, and not worrying too much. Lead single “Don’t Say You Love Me” opens the album with a heart-wrenching tale of lingering love that Jin tells Apple Music “anyone who’s experienced heartbreak will find something deeply relatable [in].”\n\nLike 2024 EP <i>Happy</i>, <i>Echo</i> leans into both Jin’s pop-rock sensibilities (“Loser,” “With the Clouds”) and his penchant for soaring ballads (“Nothing Without Your Love,” “Background,” To Me, Today”). Jin’s goofy charm, previously exemplified by the fishing-focused single “Super Tuna,” is back with “Rope It,” a country-rock track that opens and ends with a horse’s whinny. Jin personally shared his comments on each track to give us an exclusive deeper look into the album.\n\n<b>“Don’t Say You Love Me”</b>\n“It’s a pop song with a simple arrangement and a contrasting blend of emotional, melancholic energy. It tells the story of a painful love—two people who can’t let go, even after their relationship has ended. Anyone who’s experienced heartbreak will find something deeply relatable here. It’s also the first time I took on a romantic role in a music video, so this song holds a special place in my heart and will stay with me for a long time.”\n\n<b>“Nothing Without Your Love”</b>\n“This is my personal favorite from the album. It carries a heartfelt message that ‘you’ are my everything—my reason for being—and without your love, I’m nothing. The song blends a hopeful yet overwhelming surge of emotion, and I hope many of you will feel that and love it as much as I do!”\n\n<b>“Loser”</b>\n“‘Loser’ features YENA, and I’m so grateful she joined me on this track—thank you again! It’s a pop-punk song with a lively yet raw edge, and I think the catchy guitar riff will really stay with you!”\n\n<b>“Rope It”</b>\n“‘Rope It’ is my first time trying out the country rock genre. The lyrics are bold and witty, with a message that regrets won’t help you reach your goals.”\n\n<b>“With the Clouds”</b>\n“Just like its title, ‘With the Clouds’ is a lyrical, fairy-tale-like song. The more you listen, the more its unique charm comes through—I hope you’ll enjoy soaking in that atmosphere.”\n\n<b>“Background”</b>\n“This one’s a ballad pop song that highlights emotional and lyrical depth. My vocals take on a deeper, more mature tone in this song, blending with the full emotional texture of the band’s sound.”\n\n<b>“To Me, Today”</b>\n“I worked on this song with the thought that instead of worrying too much about the future, maybe we should focus on who we are today—a version of ourselves that won’t come again. I hope you savor the happiness of today and spend each day meaningfully with the people you love.”\n","short":"Just six months after his solo debut, the BTS singer is back."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/echo/1808005214","playParams":{"id":"1808005214","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3DmDoHxAeEiDFNWrHSKAdQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808005214/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1191850724","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1191850724?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747435155347}}},"1808436132":{"id":"1808436132","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808436132?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Metal"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4a/be/b4/4abeb48a-9b1b-800c-6685-95d79e931efa/Jobc9eaeb10-91c0-440b-a040-307a123814a8-192585349-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377227531_2162644373-Time1747322099310.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","191919"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c3c1c1"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"262626","textColor2":"191919","textColor4":"3a3a3a","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c3c1c1","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/86/57/04/865704fc-0795-41c7-155d-f29ccfdb5c00/Job39459f22-f944-43cd-a4d4-de924a648f2c-192596352-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_377249683_2162843471-Time1747330275200.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","070707"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"c3c1c1"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"202020","textColor2":"070707","textColor4":"252525","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"c3c1c1","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/president/1808681551","name":"In the Name of the Father - Single","artistName":"PRESIDENT","artwork":{"width":2500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/85/b3/a1/85b3a1b5-7db1-c44d-7427-ab7c1905cc96/5034644616919.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2500,"textColor3":"272727","textColor2":"090909","textColor4":"282828","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"a4a4a4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-the-name-of-the-father-single/1808436132","playParams":{"id":"1808436132","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808436132/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1808681551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1808681551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747373691761}}},"1808879302":{"id":"1808879302","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808879302?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-16","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/xzibit/106492","name":"Kingmaker","artistName":"Xzibit","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/86/f3/80/86f380dc-705c-e8d9-0b03-b6f76a9272a3/5063655311698_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"392f2c","textColor2":"241814","textColor4":"453b37","textColor1":"150906","bgColor":"cacac4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kingmaker/1808879302","playParams":{"id":"1808879302","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vYB6Ufvl9weaOZ9aXtFBR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808879302/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"106492","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/106492?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747439238987}}},"1809026285":{"id":"1809026285","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809026285?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":19,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/35/fb/3e/35fb3e0a-5465-138d-4c02-2200ec44594e/f7c16214-ac1b-493b-98d6-dbdc66347dfe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cccdd2","textColor2":"dee9e9","textColor4":"c1cacb","textColor1":"ededf2","bgColor":"4a4c52","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dannylux/1523636464","name":"LEYENDA","artistName":"DannyLux","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/10/82/db/1082db80-1dc0-bb4c-af10-e107a9b25983/5021732777393.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfb0b8","textColor2":"f2dac2","textColor4":"c7b3a2","textColor1":"fbd6dd","bgColor":"1e1824","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"One of the artists at the forefront of the so-called sad sierreño scene, DannyLux cemented his star status with albums like <i>Limerencia</i> and <i>DLUX</i> as well as the occasional Eslabon Armado team-up.

Those eager for more of his lush, moody compositions have plenty to revel and/or wallow in, including “SIRENA” and “MELANCOLÍA:(.” \n\nHe makes heartbreak so deeply relatable on the crushing “YA NO ESTÁS” yet makes a hopeful cast for the promise of true love on the Jasiel Nuñez team-up “Cielo Eterno.” In line with the emotional messiness of crashing out, some of the titles suggest incomplete status or otherwise intentional rawness, with potent yet spare cuts like “no_pasa_nada_demo.wav” and “instinto_natural_demo.wav” conveying a certain intimacy.

On her full-length debut, she bridges these conflicting tendencies with ease, placing her diaristic songwriting and hilarious social commentary against a backdrop of smooth R&B and alt-pop. She moves from delicate croons that touch on her refusal to shave her legs for a bum partner to a Florida-inspired rap flow about soft-girl summers. Highs, lows, and seemingly every emotion in between: SAILORR owns them all on <i>FROM FLORIDA’S FINEST</i>.\n\nHer ability to convey these feelings so honestly and relatably comes from her unique perspective as a cultural commentator. “I think that, in general, memes play a large role in how we communicate with others,” she tells Apple Music. “It's a very universal thing. I really, really love just being able to be vulnerable with what I’m saying, but also kind of mask it with comedy.” Many of the lowest points of the album find SAILORR employing this “laugh to keep from crying” mentality. “That’s just how I deal with my own emotions. And so, if I can find a fun way to say something, I’ll do that,” she explains. \n\nSAILORR is never one to wallow in her despair, though, even on tracks like “DOWN BAD.” “I feel like genuinely that song just perfectly encapsulates what real love will do to a person,” she says. Despite the ecstasy of love, it was a real challenge for her to embody this mindset, which helps illustrate just how much SAILORR has grown since her emergence in 2023: “It’s actually so much easier to write a heartbreak song over a love song. I feel like it’s so much harder to be vulnerable in that way, to be like, ‘Oh, I’m in love, and I’m happy now.’”","short":"Her debut mixes vulnerability, humor: “That’s how I deal with my emotions.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/from-floridas-finest/1809267067","playParams":{"id":"1809267067","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4KUlLprpCrNpRDsXC4MOAV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809267067/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1741604584","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1741604584?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747398694254}}},"1809282679":{"id":"1809282679","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809282679?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-09","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ad/74/31/ad74319b-5d98-bd8c-20f6-a93cf78abfaf/Jobce4d46a3-4adf-4354-89e7-184122070942-191473860-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374918104_2141372395-Time1746029328602.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fa5127"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c8411f","textColor2":"fa5127","textColor4":"c8411f","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8d/d4/7b/8dd47b55-5fb7-b851-5217-f4f4c3af9087/Jobb9c0e480-f2d3-42bf-b5f7-34c03be5cfda-191473861-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374918103_2141372394-Time1746030679278.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ec4c23"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"000000"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"c9411e","textColor2":"ec4c23","textColor4":"bd3d1c","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pierce-the-veil/258668501","name":"The Jaws Of Life (Deluxe)","artistName":"Pierce the Veil","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/db/b0/70/dbb0700d-9916-48ef-d8a7-a29fec6e9f1f/24CRGIM43167.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c53c1d","textColor2":"ed4229","textColor4":"be3521","textColor1":"f64b24","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-jaws-of-life-deluxe/1809282679","playParams":{"id":"1809282679","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3pXReKEtUVjzaXLY6nissS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809282679/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"258668501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/258668501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747379648694}}},"1809453485":{"id":"1809453485","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809453485?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-10","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/95/b2/68/95b26897-f3c9-e307-ef80-2439ccf3abd3/253a91ff-5039-4808-a96b-3b33a8961a4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"292827","textColor2":"11161f","textColor4":"2c3037","textColor1":"0d0c0b","bgColor":"9a9998","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/grupo-firme/1086320682","name":"Evolución","artistName":"Grupo Firme","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e8/96/be/e896be96-cfd9-c7df-1cad-45af2d34b240/198704476211_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"caa87b","textColor2":"f2724d","textColor4":"c45e42","textColor1":"f9cf95","bgColor":"0e0f14","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"More than a decade into their storied career, Tijuana’s own Grupo Firme stand out for their innovative and, at times, unconventional takes on banda, norteño, and other música mexicana styles.

That said, <i>Evolución</i> finds Eduin Caz’s ensemble less concerned with features and cameos, instead focused on showcasing the oft boisterous sound of the band itself.\n\nThe lush arrangements of “Cero Sentimientos” almost mask the rage of its scorned protagonist, while “Quiere Llorar Y No Puede” sways to the oh-so-satisfied musings of its singer. There’s an arena-rock energy to “Luna,” its urgent lovelorn lyricism backed by big bluesy licks.

Album","standard":"Contemporary Christian star Forrest Frank follows his 2024 LP <i>CHILD OF GOD</i> with this 20-track collection, which continues the Texas-born artist and producer’s efforts to bring modern sounds to the genre. Versed in pop, indie, and hip-hop, Frank has an expansive take on what makes worship music, and lyrically leans into more positive, uplifting messaging instead of fire and brimstone. <i>CHILD OF GOD II</i> opens with “ENCORE,” a gauzy overture with a snippet of Frank speaking to his grandfather about his rise to fame, a move that sets up the personal nature of the rest of the project. \n\n“YOUR WAY’S BETTER” pairs a bubblegum beat with a sunny lyric, recalling Chance the Rapper’s pre-fame work with Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment. Other highlights are “NO L’s,” an edgier number that could sneak onto pop radio, and “LIVE YOUR LIFE,” a laidback track that splits the difference between Jack Johnson and Still Woozy. Guests on <i>CHILD OF GOD II</i> include actor and musician Nathan Davis Jr. on the slinky, trap-inspired “WOKE UP THIS MORNING” and Nigerian singer-rapper Limoblaze on the loose and groovy “LIKE WATER.” Country star Thomas Rhett joins Frank on “NOTHING ELSE,” a short but potent celebration of what makes life sweet.\n","short":"Faith and good-vibes pop unite on the Texas singer’s joyful follow-up."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/child-of-god-ii/1810093737","playParams":{"id":"1810093737","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/53E5Y0zhUmgDfX7LznfMKs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810093737/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1436657314","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1436657314?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747423263175}}},"1810293073":{"id":"1810293073","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810293073?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":35,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-14","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/finishing-move-inc/1152686264","name":"Doom: The Dark Ages (Original Game Soundtrack)","artistName":"Finishing Move Inc.","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d8/2c/99/d82c992a-0bc6-3f93-90dd-278d36388178/093155176287_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"d3ccc6","textColor2":"f4dfaa","textColor4":"cbb689","textColor1":"fdfaf5","bgColor":"291608","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/doom-the-dark-ages-original-game-soundtrack/1810293073","playParams":{"id":"1810293073","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1mL4QfAwy3gFEjtGPHMG3F"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810293073/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1152686264","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1152686264?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747344012172}}},"1810320315":{"id":"1810320315","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810320315?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-12","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a4/a9/08/a4a908f5-ec10-cb1c-2b76-b5f6bcf29e3a/Job9e7f2b07-ceb6-49cf-b248-b28abdf64694-190976272-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374013526_2133703450-Time1745520968446.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","422727"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"f2e1de"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"3f2e2e","textColor2":"422727","textColor4":"644848","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f2e1de","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/88/b9/2a/88b92a7a-e68a-1604-ebbf-390301c27386/9c575e57-6fe5-42e9-99b5-a2883bbc71ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"34393f","textColor2":"292829","textColor4":"424448","textColor1":"191a1d","bgColor":"a4b7c5","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/89/e6/75/89e67554-a5a2-3487-bbc5-ea8aacc36671/Job393c2ad7-c396-4af2-b031-0cb62a56e94e-191278310-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_374524424_2138113070-Time1745828734534.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"3f3030","textColor2":"392222","textColor4":"5d4545","textColor1":"130707","bgColor":"f0d4d4","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/meovv/1765256889","name":"MY EYES OPEN VVIDE - EP","artistName":"MEOVV","artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a9/7b/56/a97b56c3-984c-cea9-1c05-ed2d190cf495/8800303089526_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"403131","textColor2":"382122","textColor4":"5e4546","textColor1":"130708","bgColor":"f4d7d9","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"MEOVV (pronounced “meow”) made their mark on the K-pop scene in 2024 with a flurry of singles, including the “cattitude”-driven “MEOW,” diary-pop ballad “TOXIC,” and sultry empowerment anthem “BODY.” However, the five-member girl group from BLACKPINK producer Teddy wouldn’t release an EP until 2025 with <i>MY EYES OPEN VVIDE</i>. The six-track album features the aforementioned singles alongside Brazilian-funk-inspired “HANDS UP” and R&B track “LIT RIGHT NOW,” but it’s “DROP TOP” that was chosen as the EP’s featured single.

While their previous release, <i>19.99</i>, captured the uncertainty between boyhood and adulthood, this time the six-piece breaks free from convention altogether, on their own terms. That authenticity is only deepened by the fact that the members make their own music: Just as they’ve done since their debut, JAEHYUN, TAESAN, and WOONHAK took an active role in songwriting. Notably, WOONHAK—the youngest of the group—is credited on every track, working with label KOZ’s in-house producers Pop Time and Kako as well as executive producer ZICO.\n\nThe funky track “I Feel Good” embodies the spirit of the EP’s six songs: bold, free-spirited, and brimming with rock-star energy. Other standouts include the breakup song “123-78” with its ’60s soul-pop flair; the breezy city-pop tune “Step by Step”; the cheeky, funk-driven “Is That True?”; and hit single “IF I SAY, I LOVE YOU.” To celebrate the release, the members of BOYNEXTDOOR shared their thoughts on each song with Apple Music below.\n\n<b>“123-78”</b>\nRIWOO: “This track feels like winter fading into spring. It captures a sense of seasonal change that stirs up a wide range of emotions. There’s also a romantic atmosphere you can easily get lost in.”\n\n<b>“I Feel Good”</b>\nTAESAN: “When we were working on ‘I Feel Good,’ we wanted to make something fun. As soon as you hear it, you’ll start to feel the energy. Make sure to pay attention to the chorus—it’s got a crazy addictive rush.”\n\n<b>“Step by Step”</b>\nJAEHYUN: “We worked on this one while counting down the days until summer. You can really feel that summertime vibe in the song. Why not cool off and enjoy the season with ‘Step by Step’?”\n\n<b>“Is That True?”</b>\nWOONHAK: “This track is about that flash of jealousy when you run into your ex who seems totally fine, but we put a fun, playful twist on it. I think it’ll be so much fun to perform live and jump around with ONEDOOR!”\n\n<b>“Next Mistake”</b>\nSUNGHO: “This track stands out for its falsetto and sleek rhythm. The scratching that wraps up the song is the highlight for me.

Album","standard":"Though the title of Chuckyy’s 2025 album may suggest something haunted, supernatural, or in line with his obsession with all things scary, <i>I Live, I Die, I Live Again</i> also speaks to his resilience as a rapper. Chicago’s favorite horror rapper began dropping music in 2023, and very quickly managed to build a career indebted to, but not reliant on, horrorcore rap icons of yore. With <i>I Live, I Die, I Live Again</i>, he’s created a project that both leans into these aesthetics while introducing a wide swath of new genre exercises, including styles close to home (drill) and far out in left field (alt-pop). “My World” fits firmly into the latter, featuring a New Wave-inspired hook from EKKSTACY and a torrent of bars from Chuckyy that fit loosely over the propulsive punk-leaning groove. Even when the vibes shift, though, Chuckyy remains devoted to his signature themes of loss, alienation, and determination.","short":"Chicago’s reigning horrorcore MC is frighteningly versatile."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-live-i-die-i-live-again/1811873626","playParams":{"id":"1811873626","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0pSIFVPHDByTEX6LztYz9M"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811873626/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1703210537","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1703210537?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747439551410}}},"1811884088":{"id":"1811884088","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811884088?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nowe-rozdanie/1811882712","name":"Przesłuchania Cz.

Famously elusive since the split of his iconic Southern hip-hop duo, Outkast, André arrived at the Met Gala—a celebration of Black dandyism that raised a record-setting $31 million—with a massive model of a piano strapped across his back. Beneath a red cap and round glasses, he beamed for red-carpet cameras. The night represented not only the surprising relaunch of his erstwhile fashion line, Benji Bixby, but also the surprising release of <i>7 piano sketches</i>, his first full project since his surprise 2023 entry into serene spiritual jazz, <i>New Blue Sun</i>.\n\n<i>7 piano sketches</i> began to take shape a decade ago, when André and his son temporarily lived in a Houston house with spartan furnishings—some TVs, some beds, a piano. Around the time of the final shows of the most-recent Outkast reunion, he began recording little piano pieces and even pondered releasing several as <i>The Best Worst Rap Album in History</i>. The liner notes were set to read, “It’s the free-est emotionally and best I’ve felt personally.” But he shelved them, leading first to lingering questions about when he would return to music and, ultimately, to <i>New Blue Sun</i>, a stunning break with expectations for one of hip-hop’s best-ever minds. \n\nThese little pieces—seven tracks, 16 total minutes—perpetuate that break. After a voice offers the track number and title, André feels his way through a theme and variations. Where opener “bluffing in the snow” is a refracted and pensive blues, “hotel lobby pianos” drifts into a confident midtempo stride as voices drift in the background. The record ultimately points toward new directions. After he dances through a smiling melody for a while, “off rhythm laughter” blooms into an exquisite drone. And on closer “i spend all day waiting for the night,” he improvises around a drum machine’s languid march, his sunken-world piano rising to meet the rhythm in the middle. André 3000 continues to push hip-hop expectations off his back, this time with the actual piano strapped to it.","short":"Three Stacks’ break from rap continues with 16 minutes of piano

Album","standard":"While Latin stars now regularly dabble in Afrobeats as a pop music cheat code, Beéle was one of a rare few Spanish-language artists to commit to exploring that sound. With an ear for global polyrhythms and a penchant for romantic lyricism, the Colombian singer became reliably known for his singles in a distinct style that commingled with concurrent tropical music trends. On <i>BORONDO</i>, his long-awaited debut album, he shares an even broader sonic vision that both builds on that reputation and expands upon it. \n\nExpected expressions of his West African influences—“mad koknut” and “i miss you”—arrive alongside less anticipated artistic explorations like the warbling, ambient post-rock of “una vez al mes” and the surreally swirling “hotel east.” His knack for the laidback comes through on tracks like “si te pillara” and “top diesel,” but he’s experienced enough now to change it up for “una curita por favor” or the dance-floor-primed “no tiene sentido.” Topically, he’s as amorous as ever on the somewhat idiosyncratic “sobelove” and perhaps at his most sensitive on the descriptive “frente al mar.”\n\nThroughout <i>BORONDO</i>, Beéle reinforces his worldwide connections, linking with hitmaking Nigerian producer Thisizlondon for “si mañana me muero” and salsa superstar Marc Anthony for “Dios me oyó.” Esteemed Mexican singer Carla Morrison proves an ideal duet partner on “arena,” yet some of the most gratifying collaborations here are wholly homegrown ones, with Nanpa Básico sharing his heartache on “hasta aquí llegué” and no less than Ovy On the Drums co-headlining the balmy yet energetic “mi refe.”","short":"The Colombian singer’s debut exceeds Afrobeats

Album","standard":"On the eve of her first world tour, Korean R&B singer-songwriter BIBI released <i>EVE: ROMANCE</i>, a 14-track album about the duality of love. The theme is exemplified by singles “Apocalypse” and “Scott and Zelda,” breezy, assured tracks about the seductive and self-delusional potentials of love. “The way you read/Oh my god, those paper cuts,” BIBI playfully whisper-croons on the latter, which is titled something closer to “Bookshop Boy, Literary Girl” in its original Korean. “Shh, look at your apple/I wonder what it tastes like,” BIBI sings on the chorus of the former, tapping into a similar balance of bemused and sincere in her vocal delivery.\n\nBIBI entered the public eye in 2018, when she was scouted by rappers YOON MIRAE and Tiger JK to appear as a contestant on the Korean competition show <i>The Fan</i>. She made her debut in 2019 with the pop track “Binu,” which translates to “soap” in English, pushing K-pop norms by touching on subjects like alcohol, cigarettes, and hickeys in the sweetly performed single. BIBI would continue to build on her honest, provocative persona with tracks like 2020’s “She Got It” and 2022’s “Best Lover.”\n\nSome of BIBI’s biggest hits include 2021’s “The Weekend,” 2022’s “BIBI Vengeance,” and 2024’s “Bam Yang Gang.” The last, a whimsical, confectionary-themed pop track, represents a departure from BIBI’s signature sultry sound, and is one of eight songs on the musically eclectic <i>EVE: ROMANCE</i> that were previously released. The six tracks original to the album include “Apocalypse,” “Meat,” “Pygma girl,” “Scott and Zelda,” “Real Man,” and “Midnight Cruise.”\n","short":"The Korean R&B singer-songwriter builds on her provocative persona."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eve-romance/1813305786","playParams":{"id":"1813305786","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4OrisjS1FiGCNucXdwtd3Y"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813305786/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1444569221","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1444569221?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1747385843557}}},"1813421501":{"id":"1813421501","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813421501?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-15","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b7/ff/eb/b7ffebcc-aab9-0aa9-1bcd-3de0407edd5d/ea49bf99-3cfa-4dc4-a125-76185decca96.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3e3e3e","textColor2":"2c2c2c","textColor4":"545454","textColor1":"101010","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7a/2f/56/7a2f56e5-e110-7981-2496-e7e1bd9bb764/c180f8f8-63bf-4fc4-a2b7-25ced2cf1cd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c7c7c7","textColor2":"f0d2b2","textColor4":"c8b096","textColor1":"eeeeee","bgColor":"282828","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ad/d4/f8/add4f8ba-cffc-4914-6be0-7b7b2209a925/cde2a5de-a5c7-4e37-a4ab-48fd6f279a26.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"434343","textColor2":"313131","textColor4":"585858","textColor1":"161616","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/snoop-dogg/21769","name":"Iz It a Crime?","artistName":"Snoop Dogg","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1e/fe/32/1efe3246-7f09-2940-18ba-1658bc739de2/764656318406_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b19d82","textColor2":"d2a87e","textColor4":"ab8968","textColor1":"dbc1a0","bgColor":"0e0e0e","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I can write the words, but the music has to match the energy,” Snoop Dogg tells Apple Music. “And it just feels like when we own that shit on the West, we great at that shit.” Since his 2022 acquisition of Death Row Records, he has wasted little time in repositioning the infamous record label that propelled him to stardom. From bringing on new R&B signees JANE HANDCOCK and October London to facilitating the returns of Tha Eastsidaz and Tha Dogg Pound, as well as seemingly riskier moves like blockchain drops and a gospel compilation, Snoop’s updated model benefits from having him at the center. “I was on this label when it was started and I seen all the pluses and the things that worked,” he says. “I seen the things that hadn’t been tapped into. So as I hold it as the owner, it’s my job to give it life, to give it love.”\n\nFollowing last December’s long-awaited Dr. Dre reunion <i>Missionary</i>, the ever-entrepreneurial Long Beach native drops a sizable solo album that merges West Coast rap nostalgia with the modern touches expected from an industry impresario. <i>Iz It a Crime?</i> not only nods to the Sade classic liberally sampled on its probing title track, but more broadly addresses a worldview that comes from lived experience, as a man and as an artist. “I’ve never been afraid to try different things when it comes to music, because that’s what music is,” he says. “It’s a universal language of all people. And once you’ve mastered a craft of your voice and who you are, you should be able to do any style of music when you want.”\n\nFurthermore, his latest comes at a time of existential triumph for Los Angeles hip-hop, a scene for which he serves as a long-standing load-bearing pillar. “The original West Coast sound was drug-related gang-bang music that made you act ignorant,” he says. “It was that sound of representation, like wherever you was from, what part of the city, what gang you was from.”\n\nOne can hear Snoop’s proud ownership of that history on “Joy,” a bombastic series of slickly executed references, and on “Sophisticated Crippin’,” a laidback throwback teeming with success-story energy. As he emphasizes that elder-statesman swag, he also brings in fresher faces like LaRussell (“Can’t Wait”) and Sexyy Red (“Me N OG Snoop”), both to share the spotlight and to double down on his legacy-building enterprise. Yet <i>Iz It a Crime?</i> feels truly special when he’s reconnecting with older hitmaking pals, vibing luxuriously with Wiz Khalifa on “Just the Way It Iz” and retooling the funk on “Spot” with Pharrell Williams, a longtime collaborator. “I love music,” Snoop says. “I don’t feel like I am just a slouch or a pushover. I feel like I’m a great musician and a great voice.”\n","short":"The Doggfather mixes modernity and nostalgia on his solo
