Album and Interview","standard":"A recurring piece of fan feedback shaped Sons Of The East’s second album: “I love your recorded music, but seeing you live is a completely different experience,” keyboardist/vocalist Nic Johnston recounts to Apple Music. “So we wanted to get the record a little closer to what it might sound like to come and see us live.” Accordingly, the Sydney indie-folk trio recorded much of the album together in the same room rather than tracking their parts separately. There is, Johnston says, “a little more chaos, a little more liveliness. In a very broad sense, that’s one of the big things we wanted to bring to this record.”\n\nSimilarly impactful was the fact many of the ideas were formulated while touring. Some came while walking around empty venues before doors opened, guitar in hand (“Hard to Tell”); others while noodling on their instruments en route to the next show. “That’s probably why so many of the songs feel so good when you’re driving in a car, because a lot of them came about in those circumstances,” says guitarist/banjo player Dan Wallage.\n\nThe resulting album moves from anthemic indie-folk (“Rescue Me”) and indie-rock (“Recognise”) to pastoral folk (“10 Days”) and ’70s West Coast grooves (“Pour the Wine”), tied together by the trio’s lush, CSNY-inspired vocal harmonies. Here, Johnston and Wallage take Apple Music through <i>SONS</i> track by track.\n\n<b>“It’s Alright”</b>\nDan Wallage: “The basis for that song came from a jam in the studio. It was one of those songs that just made all of us smile.”\nNic Johnston: “Lyrically, it follows that sense of everything’s relaxed and vibey and we’re having fun. We just wanted to keep it light and enjoyable, open the album on not too heavy a note.”\n\n<b>“Sweet Thing”</b>\nNJ: “Definitely a heartbreak song. I remember sitting in the studio and playing these chords and Jack [Rollins, guitar/vocals] came up with this melody over the top really quickly, and it was quite seamless. Then we worked on instrumentation, trying to pair Dan’s arpeggiated acoustic guitar with the organ.”\n\n<b>“Rescue Me”</b>\nNJ: “The lyrics are quite emotional and sad and hinting at impending heartbreak, but it’s also quite hopeful as well. It came from this jam we had ages ago and I kept coming back to it, like, ‘There’s something here.’ The original recording is complete chaos—us going hell for leather on all our instruments and singing different lyrics. It took us quite a while to home in on what the song’s about and what it all meant.”\n\n<b>“Pour the Wine”</b>\nDW: “It was keys, banjo, guitar, just us sitting in comfy chairs, very relaxed, with a bunch of mics on us, and we just jammed through the whole song. Let’s not worry about being completely perfect or playing to a click, let’s just create a vibe within those three instruments. I’ve always wanted a song where we go from Jack to Nic or Nic to Jack singing lead. It starts with Nic on the lead vocal then switches to Jack and then, the chorus, you don’t know who’s doing what. I love the chaos in that.”\n\n<b>“Recognise”</b>\nNJ: “It’s a bit of a standout for us in terms of the band going in a slightly new direction. This one makes me think of being on tour in America, or just generally being on tour. It’s got this traveling feel to it.”\nDW: “We’ve never gone, ‘We have to be a folk band, we have to be blues country.’ We all like different types of music so we thought, ‘Let’s try and create something that feels like Sons Of The East, but has elements from all different genres.’ It’s got the driving drums and banjo and synth together, which is a unique flavor.”\n\n<b>“10 Days”</b>\nNJ: “It’s definitely the rawest song on the record. For a while there it was quite hard to listen to. Lyrically, it’s a massive question mark over where a relationship is going; that feeling of something slipping away but you’re not quite sure how it happened and where it’s going. It’s very vulnerable and close to my heart.”\n\n<b>“Time Will Tell”</b>\nDW: “It kind of falls into a similar boat to ‘Rescue Me’—it delves into similar tales of hope and resilience and rolling with the punches and getting to the other side. We wanted to take it back to how we started Sons Of The East, which was one of us playing acoustic guitar and then maybe some piano and some vocal, and then have this ending where it’s very upbeat. You want people to sing the chorus even though it’s somber.”\n\n<b>“Wish I Knew”</b>\nNJ: “This was another one where we wanted to replicate that live experience a little more. We just wanted this to be a big sing-along. Lyrically, it’s a pretty universal feeling of sometimes you just have no idea where you’re headed. That idea we’re all in some way, shape or form making it up as we go along. And that’s OK.”\n\n<b>“Get Even”</b>\nNJ: “I remember being on tour last year and we were going through this tiny town in Nevada. And we stopped at this little servo [rest stop] that was selling these cheap cowboy hats. There was something about the combination of it feeling so foreign—we were so far from home, surrounded by massive American road trains and truckies [truck drivers] and these big truck stops—paired with then pulling up FaceTime and calling loved ones back home. That set the scene for where this song began.”\n\n<b>“Oh My My”</b>\nDW: “Once again, these overall themes of persistence and strength and freedom come into ‘Oh My My.’ One of my favorite lyrics is ‘Taking on water but I’m bailing it out and it’s my life.’ Just that idea bad stuff’s going to happen and we’re all going to have our ups and downs, but sometimes you just have to see it through to the other side.”\n\n<b>“Head Above the Water”</b>\nNJ: “It was written as a song to a friend who was going through a hard time. It’s basically, I’ve got your back. Quite often those songs are written in a relationship context, and it was really nice to write something that was just for a friend. Love between friends is not showcased quite as much and it’s such an important part of all our lives, that support network we have around us.”\n\n<b>“Hard to Tell”</b>\nNJ: “That first riff came about in Atlanta in a venue. Quite often we’ll just grab a guitar and walk around an empty venue and strum ideas, and there’s something about being in that context that is quite conducive to letting your mind wander and coming up with new ideas. To me that song is nostalgic of that very first tour we did in the States. And I think it’s reflected through the vibe of the song.”","short":"The Sydney trio embrace their live energy on their second

Album and Interview","standard":"A mid-career self-titled album is often an intentional statement, if not an outright reset. For Parker McCollum, attaching his name to his fifth studio album is something of a reintroduction, an hour-long tour of the Texas-born singer-songwriter’s expansive talents and a glimpse into his still immense potential. Co-produced by Music Row veteran Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack), the collection finds McCollum pushing his artistry to new places, a feat aided by stepping back from longtime collaborator Jon Randall and jetting up to New York City to record the album’s 14 tracks.\n\n“This record that we made in New York is the record I always wondered if I was good enough to make,” McCollum tells Apple Music. “I always thought about a record like this, and I finally just feel like maybe I might’ve gotten close to something that could be that.”\n\nThe LP opens with “My Blue,” a rootsy, near-folk song following a character named Jackie whose life is marked by loss and hardship. That song, with its emphasis on narrative songwriting and traditional instrumentation, immediately announces <i>Parker McCollum</i> as an outlier among recent releases from McCollum’s peers, and shows him to have more in common with genre outsiders like Jason Isbell or Tyler Childers than the current crop of country stars. “Solid Country Gold,” with its chiming piano and crunchy guitar, recalls the hardscrabble twang of fellow Texan Hayes Carll, name-checking John Prine at the chorus for good measure. Below, McCollum shares insight into several key tracks.\n\n<b>“My Blue”</b>\n“I knew I wanted ‘My Blue’ to be the first song on the record, because I knew if you heard that song and you didn’t get it and it didn’t do it for you, then this record’s not for you. My agent the other day joked, ‘Well, if you like cocaine and suicide, this record’s for you.’ But I wasn’t trying to put them in any chronological order or get from one place to another. Anytime I sequence an album, I’m just like, ‘I just want you to go somewhere else each song.’ And I think that works. I think that’s not an easy way, but a commonly effective way to lay out the tracks for a record.’”\n\n<b>“Killin’ Me”</b>\n“It’s pretty different from how I wrote it, especially the scene change in the solo. You’re going to a whole other place for that solo, and then you come right back to where you were. I don’t think the band heard any of the songs on the record before we were recording them. I would just start playing them and everybody would just fall in. And everybody was really encouraged and told very sternly like, ‘Hey, play whatever the hell you want to play. Mess up, play wrong notes. If you think it’s dumb, wrong—just play and play.’”\n\n<b>“Good Time Charlie’s Got the Blues” (feat. Cody Johnson)</b>\n“Cody’s a lot better than I am. We ain’t even playing the same game. But I’ve just always been such a fan, and it was selfish of me to have him on that song, because I’ve always listened to that song and wanted to hear him sing it. I think he’s one of the best singers that I’ve ever heard. And his voice is so unique and it’s so true, and I believe every bit of it. I just always wanted to hear him sing that song, and so I mustered up the courage one day to text him. And then, about four months later, I was like, ‘Man, I should not have done that. I’m probably a pain in his ass. And he probably complained to his management that he’s got to sing on this dumb Parker song.’ And thank you—shout-out Cody for doing it again. But I listened to it after he’d sang it, and I was just like, ‘Damn, I was so right.’”\n\n<b>“New York Is on Fire”</b>\n“I had wanted to go to New York in the late fall. I wanted to catch it when that first cool, crisp air was rolling in. I just wanted to set it up and pretend like I was in my own movie for a week. And when we were flying in, the trees were electric. And I said out loud to Charlie, my keys player who was with me, I said, ‘Dude, it looks like New York is on fire.’ Then we were in the studio the first day, and we were just messing around between takes around lunchtime. I started singing, ‘New York is on fire’ over and over and over again. And Frank was just buzzed in. He was the only one in the control room listening. And he was like, ‘Hey, whatever that is, keep doing that.’”","short":"The Texas star reintroduces himself on his fifth album."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/parker-mccollum/1802060343","playParams":{"id":"1802060343","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0yqDWZNB69J3FYyQPgF4xA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802060343/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"733165597","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/733165597?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751809941503,"RTCI":0}}},"1802646078":{"id":"1802646078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802646078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ready-for-death/1591492294","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Pay With Your Face","artistName":"READY FOR DEATH","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ea/63/79/ea6379f7-984a-63db-400d-100430db8e60/199350066887.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6a165","textColor2":"faa029","textColor4":"cc8327","textColor1":"dfc576","bgColor":"12101e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pay-with-your-face/1802646078","playParams":{"id":"1802646078","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0gKFsXyOcSbmDrUKrsU64E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802646078/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1591492294","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1591492294?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1750932930692,"RTCI":0}}},"1803492393":{"id":"1803492393","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803492393?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cole-swindell/354625084","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/47/b8/b7/47b8b714-167d-3225-b4c6-b044ab8f53bc/Jobf7880501-4a90-45aa-b008-9d4149452d13-189536858-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371129793_2110637050-Time1743725129886.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","e0e1a0"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"1f1b13"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"c3b98a","textColor2":"e0e1a0","textColor4":"b8b883","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"1f1b13","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/7d/2c/fb/7d2cfbe8-137c-1f03-5e98-55b1a24c9df2/173c59ae-dff8-4a71-94db-033e8e587b9f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a0a09a","textColor2":"d2a188","textColor4":"ab8470","textColor1":"c4c4bd","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bf/30/2e/bf302e8d-c62a-07b6-0ccc-db8c75d0192a/Jobdac91d4e-8231-427a-9239-e6723126657e-189536857-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371129792_2110637049-Time1743723833119.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"bfbf97","textColor2":"f4e6ae","textColor4":"c6bb8c","textColor1":"eaebbc","bgColor":"110f04","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9f/87/13/9f87135f-8ef5-487e-a9bc-f2587eda17cf/597154b5-8f7c-485e-a7ba-d80e009a553b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"30271c","textColor2":"2b1e0d","textColor4":"433625","textColor1":"130b02","bgColor":"a39a84","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/37/cc/29/37cc2995-3dc7-1254-b54c-4c7e4060a2fc/546c0525-8b59-45be-bfad-c289ea4342bb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ac9c75","textColor2":"cbaf78","textColor4":"a48e61","textColor1":"d5c091","bgColor":"0a0a04","hasP3":true}},"name":"Spanish Moss","artistName":"Cole Swindell","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/cf/df/28/cfdf28c7-3920-43f3-f814-fac3a3834f26/093624831303.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0b18d","textColor2":"dedbac","textColor4":"b7b38b","textColor1":"e8d9af","bgColor":"1f1307","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Over a decade into his career, Cole Swindell is not the same man he was when he released his hit debut single, “Chillin’ It,” in 2013. The Georgia-born singer-songwriter has lived a lot of life in the intervening years, ascending to country stardom and, more recently, getting married and becoming a father. The 21 songs composing his fifth studio album reflect this more mature stage of life, digging into vulnerable topics like marriage, parenthood, and grief. And with assists from 11 producers and a veritable who’s who of Nashville songwriters, Swindell turns in one of the more stylistically varied projects he’s done yet. \n\n<i>Spanish Moss</i> opens with “Kill a Prayer,” a laidback, midtempo track with deceptively loose production, as Swindell acknowledges his hard-partying ways could have landed him in dire straits if “a mama’s amen” hadn’t helped him see the light. “Dale Jr.” was inspired by a real-life meeting with the NASCAR star, during which Swindell and Earnhardt connected over having both lost their fathers. “Georgia (Ain’t on Her Mind)” gives Swindell a chance to celebrate his home-state roots, turning in a smooth and sturdy vocal as he traces a relationship from its Peach State roots to its highway-bound dissolution. “Forever to Me” is sure to soundtrack many a future wedding, with sweeping production and sweet, romantic imagery. Closing track “Heads Up Heaven,” a tender and sparsely adorned ballad, ends the collection on an especially emotional note, paying tribute to Swindell’s late mother, who died in 2021.","short":"Over

Set up in the auditorium of the converted movie house, the legendary lineup ran through the staples of Motörhead’s early sets—stripped-down versions of Lemmy-penned Hawkwind tunes “Motörhead” and “The Watcher” plus Eddie Holland’s “Leavin’ Here” alongside originals that would surface on the band’s 1977 debut: “Vibrator,” “Keep Us on the Road,” and “Iron Horse/Born to Lose.” Nearly 50 years on, the tapes have been dredged up from the vaults of history, complete with Lemmy’s inimitable between-song banter.","short":"A legendary band takes their first steps on these embryonic recordings."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-manticore-tapes/1804071799","playParams":{"id":"1804071799","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4lA6sBkX6kxj6aoHBqd6eY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804071799/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"539605","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/539605?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751035790276,"RTCI":0}}},"1804117398":{"id":"1804117398","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804117398?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kesha/334854763","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2a/93/87/2a9387e7-32a1-b019-2644-40508c7c6cc8/c18b0211-074f-4a40-b2c9-07aa5ab812e8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bfa592","textColor2":"cdb9b1","textColor4":"a99993","textColor1":"e8c8af","bgColor":"1b191d","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/70/0b/53/700b53ab-e37f-e89a-968c-82a568e1b764/3bd2f548-04f1-47f3-905e-a5f41cad18c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbc0af","textColor2":"fc9deb","textColor4":"de89c6","textColor1":"f9e2cd","bgColor":"673835","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/90/3f/d5/903fd5f0-6b8d-307a-3bdf-81c50c2b0579/0b0e31b8-93ed-4bc4-aa5b-1f00df2aa68a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"ddd4bb","textColor2":"f8dfcd","textColor4":"dec2af","textColor1":"f7f5db","bgColor":"784f3a","hasP3":true}},"name":".","artistName":"Kesha","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2e/11/3a/2e113a91-1990-f7f7-7b20-4d810e9ffebd/5034644564371.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"492f25","textColor2":"310f09","textColor4":"4d2d21","textColor1":"2c120e","bgColor":"bea682","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“Freedom I’ve been waiting for you/Everything’s changed now,” intones Kesha, in the ambient first half of “FREEDOM.” which opens up her sixth studio album <i>.</i>—pronounced “period.” But as the song evolves into a rapturous, disco-infused celebration, those familiar with the singer-songwriter’s catalog, as well as the challenges she faced on her journey to this release (her first as an independent artist), will note that despite Kesha’s assertions, her preternatural ability to craft a flawless pop tune has thankfully remained very much the same.\n\nStill present, for example, are the sing-rap lyrics and unapologetic hedonism so essential to her sonic DNA—as on helter-skelter lead single “JOYRIDE.” or the rapid-fire seductive purr of “BOY CRAZY.”—albeit refreshed with production led by Kesha herself, assisted by zeitgeist figures including NOVA WAV (Beyoncé, Ariana Grande) and Zhone (Charli xcx). Also present: the holy rolling themes and unmistakable vocal twang that speak to her childhood growing up in Nashville and imbue her lively narratives with a streak of gritty Americana, demonstrated to full effect on tracks like “CATHEDRAL.” and “YIPPEE-KI-YAY.” \n\nAnd while there are new colors in Kesha’s kaleidoscope—slick house grooves on “LOVE FOREVER.” the mellowed-out electropop sound of “TOO HARD.”—the consistent threads that weave together her past and present make it clear that Kesha has been the architect of her own success all along.

Doorstop box sets with troves of fan-coveted rarities are de rigueur for any legacy artist, very much including Bruce Springsteen, whose 1998 compilation <i>Tracks</i> dutifully assembled 66 of these—four and a half hours of alternate history to one of rock’s most vaunted narratives. Twenty-seven years later, its nominal sequel is composed of seven full and distinct stand-alone albums recorded between 1983 and 2018, largely unknown to even the most devout Springsteen cryptographers. That something so auspicious and audacious bears the modest title <i>Tracks II</i> is the slyest joke of his career. \n\nIndividually, these albums demonstrate logical extensions of his classic songwriting that manage to meet that impossible standard—much like outtakes from <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> and <i>The River</i>, which were both full LPs’ worth of parallel material every bit the equal of the latter works, as well as tantalizing, disciplined, and fully realized genre exercises that have no real precedent in his discography. As a whole, the collection begs nothing less than a wholesale reevaluation of an already deeply considered career. \n\nA collection of gussied-up home recordings that bridges the gap between 1982’s <i>Nebraska</i> and the 1984 supernova <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>. An entire album in the subdued synth-pop vein of “Streets of Philadelphia” and “Secret Garden.” (The long-held idea that the ’90s was a relatively fallow period for Springsteen goes very much out the window here.) An atmospheric soundtrack to a shelved western that answers the question, “What if Springsteen transformed himself into Tom Waits?” One pure honky-tonk album and one of jazz standards-style torch songs. An album influenced by traditional Mexican music, another of full-bore, more recent vintage rock songs. These are the worlds contained within <i>Tracks II</i> and below is a quick and deeply insufficient guide to Springsteen’s most recent epic.\n\n<b><i>LA Garage Sessions ’83</i></b>\nFew words in the rock lexicon are more malleable than “garage.” For Springsteen in 1983, this meant an apartment over the garage of his new home in the Hollywood Hills, where he decamped in the interregnum between 1982’s spare, downcast <i>Nebraska</i> and 1984’s <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, which catapulted him from mere rock star to global icon and—forgive us—brand. Probably not a surprise, then, that these semi-polished home demos split the difference between those two vibes: “Don’t Back Down on Our Love” and “Don’t Back Down” have the bones of what could have been a couple of vintage E Street rave-ups, while “The Klansman” is a pitch-black song about the son of a proud KKK member learning the ropes.\n\n<b><i>Streets of Philadelphia Sessions</i></b>\nWhile on paper, this may seem similar to <i>LA Garage Sessions</i>—Springsteen working largely alone, at home, with a drum machine—it feels less like rough demos than a collection of fully realized songs that happen to share a specific dynamic. Even adding the word “sessions” into the title feels like a hedge. Springsteen’s slump-busting hit “Streets of Philadelphia,” written for Jonathan Demme’s 1993 film <i>Philadelphia</i>, was pared down to his voice, synths, and drum loops—a combination he found appealing enough to continue for another 10 songs, fleshed out in places by members of his early-’90s post-E Street backing band. While “Secret Garden” found its way to a greatest-hits compilation, the others were lost to lore—a whispered-about but never heard “drum loops album.” It’s not the rap or trip-hop album that those whisperers may have been imagining; it is, rather, a logical extension of the two known songs to come out of these recordings, only maybe a little hornier. “Maybe I Don’t Know You” has “Brilliant Disguise” DNA in its blood, while “One Beautiful Morning” comes the closest to a more traditional full-band sound. \n\n<b><i>Faithless</i></b>\nIn 2005, Springsteen was commissioned to compose the soundtrack to what he has called a “spiritual western” called <i>Faithless</i> by an as-yet-unnamed director, but probably someone we’ve heard of. The movie never wound up being made, but Springsteen held up his end of the bargain, and the result is as revelatory as anything in his career—a mix of moody instrumentals and gospel-tinged Americana ballads that manage to be oddly timeless despite the purported 19th-century setting. At least one song (“All God’s Children”) sounds so much like early-’90s Waits that you may check to make sure you didn’t switch records, while “Where You Going, Where You From” is buttressed by a choir of voices including two of Springsteen’s children. (Note: “Goin’ to California” is <i>not</i> a Led Zeppelin cover, but given the experimental streak on display, you’re excused for letting your imagination run a little wild.)\n\n<b><i>Somewhere North of Nashville</i></b>\nIf this set were constructed chronologically, and it is not, this one would have been slotted right after <i>Streets of Philadelphia Sessions</i>. As Springsteen began reactivating the E Street Band in 1995, he shelved what would have been that solo release and began working on <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> and this—a companion album of sorts that took a lighter approach tonally and sonically. <i>Somewhere North of Nashville</i> is a honky-tonk lark with a cast of characters including slide guitarist Marty Rifkin. “Janey Don’t You Lose Heart,” a beloved <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>-era B-side, gets revisited here a decade later, and sounds more than a little like R.E.M.’s “(Don’t Go Back To) Rockville.” This isn’t exactly Springsteen out of his element, but it may have been greeted in 1995 as the exact kind of cutting loose that fans hadn’t seen from him in a long time.\n\n<b><i>Inyo</i></b>\nA largely solo acoustic affair along the lines of <i>Devils & Dust</i>, also recorded around this time, <i>Inyo</i> is tied together by Springsteen’s focus on detailed, character-driven stories about the American Southwest and the Mexican border, combining the stark narrative style forged and perfected on <i>Nebraska</i> with música mexicana flourishes like mariachi bands and strings. Thirty years later, stories about the Southern border and the people on either side of it wind up being more resonant and urgent than he could have imagined at the time.\n\n<b><i>Twilight Hours</i></b>\nIn a sprawling collection that highlights Springsteen’s career-long comfort with formal genre exercises, the grand Burt Bacharach-style ballads of <i>Twilight Hours</i> may be the most jarring. Not that The Boss doesn’t deserve some downtime to undo his bow tie and nurse his heartache over a stiff martini, but it’s an era that doesn’t have much of an analogue in Springsteen’s canon. Written more or less alongside the long gestation period that eventually birthed <i>Western Stars</i>, songs like the title track, “Late in the Evening,” and “Sunday Love” evoke a smoke-filled lounge that couldn’t have fit anywhere else.\n\n<b><i>Perfect World</i></b>\nWhile the other six albums here were conceived and finally now realized as stand-alone works, the finale is an odds-and-sods collection of songs from the mid-’90s through the early 2010s with a loose theme: They’re nice rock songs, crowd-pleasers that just never reached any crowds, and are most likely the kind of thing that comes to mind when you close your eyes and think of the words “Bruce” and “Springsteen.” “I’m Not Sleeping” channels Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers’ “Don’t Do Me Like That,” while coulda-been hits like “Rain in the River” and “You Lifted Me Up” exemplify what makes this entire sprawling set such a unique window into a revered artist’s process: Someone could have forged a legendary career just off the material that one man couldn’t find a place for and barely remembered he made.\n","short":"Seven(!) previously unreleased albums disguised in a rarities-set trench

EP","standard":"Nilüfer Yanya’s third album, 2024’s <i>My Method Actor</i>, found the London singer-songwriter in an existential quandary. “It’s a weird one making a third album, because it’s like: ‘What is pushing me to do this?’” she told Apple Music at the time of its release. “Where is that desire coming from? Where am I going with this? Where am I going to be on the other side of this?” In writing the LP, she found some of those answers: “It’s a journey, but you don’t really know where it’s going,” she said. “But it’s about not worrying too much about the outcome; it’s learning to trust myself, to really listen to myself.” \n\nA few songs were abandoned in the process, which she undertook with her songwriting partner Wilma Archer. But upon returning from touring <i>My Method Actor</i>, Yanya found that some of those ideas deserved revisiting, and they form the <i>Dancing Shoes</i> EP. The title might be a little tongue-in-cheek—these four tracks don’t quite suit the club floor—but it does perhaps suggest a desire to dance the blues away. And like all of Yanya’s prior albums, she finds a springy tension between laidback rockers that mask pain with compelling grooves (“Kneel,” “Cold Heart”) and equally affecting, soul-baring pop ballads (“Where to Look,” “Treason”).\n","short":"The London artist reexamines a handful of song sketches."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dancing-shoes-ep/1807973507","playParams":{"id":"1807973507","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807973507/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1102497241","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1102497241?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751880270996,"RTCI":0}}},"1808384933":{"id":"1808384933","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808384933?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gaupa/1339127897","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"FYR - EP","artistName":"GAUPA","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/77/93/9e779342-0913-e1bb-7da1-ab37469b6279/cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"414141","textColor2":"2b2b2b","textColor4":"555555","textColor1":"121212","bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fyr-ep/1808384933","playParams":{"id":"1808384933","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808384933/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1339127897","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1339127897?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751602313460,"RTCI":0}}},"1808472078":{"id":"1808472078","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808472078?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kae-tempest/327874333","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/99/6a/a8/996aa8f0-c9b7-674a-647b-b86a05e6f4f0/64aa59c4-5f16-4ff4-b6fe-4972f7fd2628.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d1d1d1","textColor2":"e8e8e8","textColor4":"c6c6c6","textColor1":"f5f5f5","bgColor":"414141","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/fd/36/6c/fd366c65-c213-4075-818b-866bc4cfb12a/875ce417-0d40-4ad9-aca8-c2df0c882221.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c3c3c3","textColor2":"d8a9b5","textColor4":"b8929b","textColor1":"e6e6e6","bgColor":"363636","hasP3":true}},"name":"Self Titled","artistName":"Kae Tempest","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b4/c1/34/b4c1346a-7aa2-b60c-436c-1ab0df7b6875/25UMGIM48333.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c6c6c6","textColor2":"d7d7d7","textColor4":"b4b4b4","textColor1":"ededed","bgColor":"2b2b2b","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Kae Tempest says that <i>Self Titled</i> is a record borne out of synchronicity. The South Londoner is a master of many arts—he’s a rapper, poet, spoken word act, novelist, and more—but something didn’t feel right as he approached making what he thought would be his fifth solo album. Seeking an outside take on it, Tempest played some of the songs to Fraser T. Smith, with whom he’d collaborated on the Dave and Adele producer’s Future Utopia project, and Smith’s feedback opened up a whole new way forward. “He just said, ‘This isn’t right for right now, this just isn’t quite it, there’s something else I think that needs to come out of you right now,’” Tempest tells Apple Music. “He said, ‘Why don’t you just park this and come into the studio and let’s see what happens?’”\n\nWhat happened is <i>Self Titled</i>, a career peak that takes in menacing hip-hop grooves, jubilant, expansive pop, jagged beats, and bombastic soundscapes. By some margin, it is Tempest’s most ambitious musical work to date. Working with Smith unlocked something. “It brought out the bigness of my sound, my intentionality around songwriting, wanting to be more concise, more driven, wanting bigger sound,” Tempest says. “Fraser is a big songwriter.”\n\nThe process of making the record, he explains, felt like being swept up in a strong current. “We were just going with it, and the minute we tried to lead and not flow, it wouldn’t quite work. If I tried to get something to happen, it just wouldn’t happen.” <i>Self Titled</i> is very much the album that Kae Tempest was meant to make right now. Let Tempest guide you through it, track by track.\n\n<b>“I Stand on the Line”</b>\n“This is a statement piece. It’s huge. The orchestral instrumentation, the expansiveness of the sound and the production. This was that moment when I said to Fraser, ‘I want big sound. I want to make big songs,’ and this was his response. Lyrically, Fraser was encouraging me to tell my story. My natural place when I’m writing lyrics is to write from character perspectives or zoom in on one very specific thing but retain some kind of abstract relationship with the object of the poem or the lyric. But with this, Fraser was encouraging me to tell my story. I realized this is what appeals to me in songs, when you get this insight into somebody’s truth.”\n\n<b>“Statue in the Square”</b>\n“I was wondering whether to follow ‘I Stand on the Line’ with this because, in some ways, they tread some of the same ground lyrically, but in other ways, it’s a one-two punch that is so satisfying. I played Fraser Megan Thee Stallion’s ‘HISS’ and Run The Jewels. I was like, ‘I just want something so simple, but I want it to be so big, but so clear in each of its parts.’ I liked the idea of creating something on the piano that felt like an old loop but we’re just playing it now in the room. Lyrically, the first draft went on for ages and ages. The verses were really long, but the chorus jumped out and I thought, ‘OK, I know what this song wants me to do now, I just have to minimize and reduce and distill what I’m saying.’”\n\n<b>“Know Yourself”</b>\n“In my late teenage years, I was going through some heavy stuff, I felt at a bit of a crossroads. What I understood to be my older self came into my head and basically instructed my younger self to keep writing, to focus on creativity rather than destruction, and to know myself. That older self was what I understood my lyrics were coming from. Each time I wrote lyrics, it was advice I was getting from my older self. As I got older, I was like, ‘Well, it wasn’t me, I haven’t gone back, so who the fuck was that?’ Writing ‘Know Yourself,’ I was like, ‘This is the moment, this is when I went back,’ and it’s because that kid did what they did, that I can do what I’m doing. Fraser said, ‘Oh, that’s crazy,’ because he wrote this beat with Tom Rowlands from The Chemical Brothers. They went to school together but they didn’t see each other for 30 years. Tom went to Fraser’s house, they talked about their lives for about 10 minutes, then Fraser picks up a guitar, Tom’s on a drum machine. He said it was like, ‘Suddenly we’re 15 again.’ So lyrically, I’m talking to my younger self, musically, Fraser’s talking to his younger self.”\n\n<b>“Sunshine on Catford”</b>\n“I feel very strongly about dynamic and pace and gradient, I love to position albums and live shows, the journey of it all is very important. The idea is that once you know yourself, then you can know love and then in comes this beautiful love song, it’s like a thank you. It’s just a little gratitude prayer to a beautiful moment. We were blessed with the vocal of the fairy godfather of the album who came and sprinkled a bit of magic Pet Shop Boys dust on the record [Neil Tennant is a guest vocalist on the track]. This is a hymn of thanks to the small moments when you are trying to make a life with someone, when things just feel great.”\n\n<b>“Bless the Bold Future”</b>\n“The lyric began years ago. I always set myself this rule that I mustn’t write backwards because I thought if I ever went back, I wouldn’t be able to go forwards. I always went into the studio with a blank notebook and started from wherever I was at. After writing ‘Know Yourself’ and going back and sampling [an] old lyric, I was like, ‘Actually, maybe this is the moment where I can go back into older material with this new perspective.’ This lyric had been floating around and I couldn’t let go of it. There was something about it that I thought was interesting. It never quite found its home before, then we found this fucking absolutely rolling monster beat. It was beautiful.”\n\n<b>“Everything All Together”</b>\n“In my live show, I like to take a line from each of the songs at some point in the set and weave them all together and start repeating things that people have heard before. It gives this cumulative trance-like power to the whole experience. As the album was finished, I was saying to Fraser, ‘I want to make this kind of master poem,’ so I took a line from each of the songs and wove them together. We got all the session files up and took the horn line from that song, the snare from that song, one little piano part from that song, so there’s something from every single song and we put it on a grid almost like it was artwork rather than music work. We did it by eye rather than listening to it and then pressed play on that loop. It’s like the soul of the album speaking. It tells you everything that you’ve just heard and everything you’re about to hear.”\n\n<b>“Prayers to Whisper”</b>\n“This came out of me experimenting with form, four lines and the repeated fifth line three times. Obviously, it’s about something that’s close to my heart, the death of a friend. The chords Fraser found for it were quite somber. I was like, ‘No, no, no, no.’ Lyrically and musically, if the two things are going the same way, it’s death. We need uplift in the music. We need celebration. Fraser found these beautiful chords and it felt massive. It felt anthemic, which is how you want it to feel. It’s tough to feel optimistic in the face of somebody leaving, but there is this push and pull, if you lose somebody to something where they were suffering, to illness, to something painful, then there is some sense of release. I wanted the music to embody that and then it became this huge ballad, big pop song.”\n\n<b>“Diagnoses”</b>\n“I wanted to make something playful, celebratory, a summer banger about fucking antipsychotics and HRT. Why the fuck not? That’s your life. You still want to fucking dance. You’re still dancing. It’s another example of the lyric and the music pushing against each other. That’s what creates the good feeling. That’s what I like. It’s like, if this is your life, it’s no big deal. It’s a massive deal. You’re fucked. Life is just mental, of course. But at the same time, it’s just your life. And we are all just dealing with the fallout of what we’re in.”\n\n<b>“Hyperdistillation”</b>\n“I loved the beat but I was struggling to find the lyrical shape. It’s a love song to London, to my city, and there were these little hooky moments and I was like, ‘I need something in that hook.’ I went to Raven Bush, the string player from Speakers Corner Quartet, and said, ‘Can you write me a violin line that almost sounds like a soaring melody, like a vocal hook?’ He wrote this beautiful string part. It’s amazing, but it wasn’t enough. I wanted more of an uplift. Then I remembered [singer-songwriter] Connie Constance, who I’d bumped into a few times backstage and who I just love. She came down to the studio and wrote this amazing part. These fractured pieces suddenly came together in this perfect moment, which is what the song’s about.”\n\n<b>“Forever”</b>\n“This started as a love song about the uncertainty of a relationship and having this idea that let’s just fucking enjoy this for all that it is. And then Fraser was saying, ‘I know I was encouraging you to tell your story, but actually I feel like now the album needs more of your outward perspective.’ I totally agreed but I’d grown attached to that hook. If I tried to write a song about the world, I would never have written a hook so tender. The way that hook is addressed to a lover enables it to be more honest and truthful about the world, you escape the narrative trap of ‘I’m going to write a song about everything, which means you can write a song about nothing.’”\n\n<b>“Breathe”</b>\n“This is when I knew that the album wanted to be born. This was when Fraser had said to me, ‘Tell your story.’ I loved the beat, I wrote it, scribbled it out, went in the studio. This is the first time I did it. I could barely read the paper, my hands were shaking, and it is like a freestyle, wrote it, rapped it, that’s it. I haven’t quite got my head around what it is that I’m even trying to say, but the rush of that feeling, it is irreplaceable. Getting Young Fathers on there was amazing because within the world of that song I’m talking about, when <i>Everybody Down</i> [Tempest’s 2014 Mercury-nominated debut] came out, they were there, we were labelmates. They’ve been a part of this journey and it felt like a massive blessing to have them there on this song.”\n\n<b>“Till Morning”</b>\n“I wanted it to feel like the morning was coming, the sun was coming out, it was getting warmer, it’s getting brighter. When the chords come in at the end, it’s like the light. By the time we’d got our heads around that arrangement, it was two in the morning. I went in to put the vocal on it and I’d been metabolizing the lyric quite a lot and the take that I did was quite angry. Fraser said there was a tenderness in the original guide vocal because I was being very tentative with it. Sometimes, when something’s really new, you don’t even dare to say it, so I went back in and I did it like that. More gentle, more optimistic, more hopeful, more loving, less raging—and what you get is this very beautiful song about survival and about what comes after, about the possibility, a declaration of love. I thought, ‘How lucky I am to have met Fraser and to be in this relationship with somebody who can give a note like that, that can just shine a light on your performance?’”","short":"The rapper/poet on his fifth LP: “I want big sound.

all-original tracks from Ed Sheeran, Burna Boy, ROSÉ, and many more.","standard":"There’s no singular demographic within FORMULA 1 fandom. The sport has exploded in recent years, with TV coverage and social media making it accessible and obsessed over by folks of every background, every age. (And that’s before you even consider that the championship travels to more than 20 countries each season.) <i>F1® The Album</i>—the soundtrack to Apple Original Film <i>F1® The Movie</i>—follows suit, featuring original songs from artists spanning both geographic and musical spectrums.\n\nThe soundtrack’s diversity isn’t just there for the sake of it—it sets the tone for the film’s exhilarating, emotional ride. Leave the on-track action (and sounds) to the cars and their colossal engines. It’s the in-between moments where this music comes in: the drama, the tension, the romance, the overcoming.\n\nRoddy Ricch’s “Underdog” is all bravado and swagger, a shout-out to the underdogs from atop the rapper’s perch. It feels like the musical embodiment of young gun Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the talented rookie with a bright future—and plenty of hurdles—ahead. Meanwhile, the country rock of Chris Stapleton’s “Bad as I Used To Be” perhaps best depicts the rebellious cool of Brad Pitt’s Sonny Hayes, the rule-breaking racer who returns to F1® some 30 years after a near-fatal crash.\n\nElsewhere, Ed Sheeran goes full hard rock on “Drive,” belting it out over chunky guitars and big, brash drums (courtesy of John Mayer and Dave Grohl, no less). K-pop star ROSÉ delivers a passionate, lovelorn ballad with “Messy,” RAYE provides hearty soul via “Grandma Calls the Boy Bad,” and Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers goes old-school with “Baja California,” rapping in Spanish over a 1991 Black Sheep sample.\n\nDance music reigns throughout the rest of the soundtrack, making it every bit as fitting for a heaving dance floor or a speedy highway joyride. Darkoo’s “Give Me Love” has a sweetly tropical bounce, Burna Boy’s “Don’t Let Me Drown” is smooth and tender, and Obongjayar’s “Gasoline” is ultra-funky and flirtatious. EDM meets rap on “OMG!” by Dutch legend Tiësto (who makes a cameo in the film) and Sexyy Red, while the vibe goes dark and sweaty with the thumping house of PAWSA’s “DOUBLE C” and Peggy Gou’s “D.A.N.C.E.” As with FORMULA 1 itself, there’s something for everyone on <i>F1® The Album</i>.

Looking back, that album’s free-spirited imagery was a bit idealistic—a projection of how the New Zealand native turned New Yorker wished she could be. Her fourth album, as she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, is a portrait of the 28-year-old singer as she is, without edits or apologies: “Kind of like a photo of yourself that you don’t love, but captures something true about you.”\n\nThe resulting songs, written between 2023 and 2025, are forthcoming and visceral, trading <i>Solar Power</i>’s New Age-chill for beats you can feel in your gut. (It’s her first album since her 2013 debut not co-written and -produced by Jack Antonoff; instead, she shared production duties with the LA-based electronic musician Jim-E Stack.) Surrealist introspection gives way to throbbing bass on opening track “Hammer,” where a walk down Canal Street ripples with psychedelic visions. “I had just come off my birth control, and I could not believe how I was feeling,” Lorde told Lowe about the song’s inception. “Everything was pure possibility. That first sound feels like it’s coming from a very guttural place in the body. My sister said, ‘It sounds like it’s coming from your womb.’”\n\nCue the aura readings, 3 am cigarettes, broken mirrors, pregnancy tests, ego death. On “Man of the Year” and “Favourite Daughter,” questions beget more questions on the subject of what it means to be a woman, and moreover, a woman who’s now been famous for nearly half her life. The latter is at once a love letter to her mother and a meditation on being a teenager thrust into global pop stardom. “There’s been this dynamic for the last 10 to 12 years—and then further back—of wanting so badly to be loved, and to get this approval, and to be the favorite,” she told Lowe. “And it was really moving to me how, even as I was singing this song about my foremost idol and the person who I think is the most amazing in the world, I was also singing about what a crazy thing it is to have happened to you, what happened to me at 16.”\n\nNow the superstar finds freedom in the freefall: “I’ve been up on the pedestal/But tonight I just want to fall,” she sings on the shuffling “Shapeshifter.” “I still don’t know what happens when you put out a record that is like this,” she admitted about the unfiltered portrait <i>Virgin</i> presents. But in its full transparency, she arrives at something like peace.\n","short":"A self-portrait with no edits or apologies, but plenty of

Album","standard":"On his second mini-LP of 2025, the intensely introspective JP Saxe continues to blur the line between self-analysis and self-flagellation that he toed on the preceding <i>Articulate Excuses</i>. “If I turn off my head, will it still turn back on?” he asks on the crestfallen piano ballad “I HAVEN’T SAID ENOUGH,” underscoring his inner anguish with liberal quotes of “Losing My Religion” that remind us the R.E.M. classic was named after the Southern-slang term for freaking out. But <i>Make Yourself at Home</i> shows that Saxe is learning to exhale a bit—or at least figuring out (as the closing acoustic lullaby puts it) “HOW TO STAY HUMAN.”\n\nIn other words, he’s giving himself a little more grace for not always having his shit together, as reflected in the album’s more relaxed feel and endearingly homespun blend of his go-to synth-pop, R&B, and classic singer-songwriter influences. And with Argentine pop star TINI turning up to drop some Spanish verses on the moody slow jam “STRANGERS,” Saxe’s musical vocabulary continues to expand even as his writing remains achingly intimate.","short":"The intensely introspective songwriter is learning to relax."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/make-yourself-at-home/1811435470","playParams":{"id":"1811435470","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/46jHQdOJZaEaunUrtYEqD1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811435470/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"663417013","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/663417013?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751680356433,"RTCI":0}}},"1811444785":{"id":"1811444785","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811444785?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative","Folk"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laura-stevenson/298214700","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/fb/1a/2b/fb1a2b3b-7266-f544-138c-1c4ace3dbb35/2d49ffe9-3ef5-4584-b9d3-c4c181d3f8f9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1b1c1a","textColor2":"141312","textColor4":"282927","textColor1":"040402","bgColor":"78807a","hasP3":true}},"name":"Late Great","artistName":"Laura Stevenson","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/51/61/27/51612755-aae7-5a78-916e-ee041ccdad96/1164.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"47443e","textColor2":"24211a","textColor4":"4f4a42","textColor1":"191915","bgColor":"ffefe5","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Emotional directness has always been part and parcel of the Laura Stevenson experience—but on <i>Late Great</i>, the Long Island-hailing singer-songwriter digs even deeper within as she chronicles the dissolution of a long-term relationship. “There were a lot of changes in my life,” she tells Apple Music. “I had to rebuild, and it was really difficult. The aftermath was having to navigate the world as a person on my own—which was difficult, because I was partnered for my entire adult life.” These 12 songs, imbued with the rich lyricism and melodic punch she’s long been known for, came together as Stevenson dealt with the wreckage amidst navigating continuing education, parenthood, and the expectations of agelessness that come with being a full-time musician. “When you’re in a band, you never really feel like a grown-up,” she laughs. “Your future thinking is not that clear. All of a sudden, it was like, ‘Oh, I’m a grown up, and I don’t know what is going on.” \n\nThis period of change emboldened Stevenson to take charge in new ways with her studio collaborators, which included pop-punk compatriot Jeff Rosenstock, Real Estate drummer Sammi Niss, and producer John Agnello. “In the past, I wasn’t as vocal about things that I didn’t want—I’m a total people-pleaser, a peacekeeper,” she says. “This time around, I was pretty uncompromising about what I wanted. I sat with this one in a way that I never had before. I don’t think anything ever will be exactly the way you want it to be—but it was as close to what I really want as I’ve ever gotten.” Below, Stevenson tells the story behind each song on  <i>Late Great</i>.\n\n<b>“#1”</b>\n“I wrote this song a long time ago. I was playing it while opening for Murder By Death in 2016, and I was like, ‘Their fans are gonna hate me if I play my little quiet songs.’ So I made it more boisterous than it was intended, and then I hated it and I put it away for a long time. When I was coming back to it, I kept hearing Roy Orbison singing the chorus—and I love a real schmaltzy chorus, so I leaned harder into that. Then I felt like it needed to be over-the-top, so I asked Jeff Rosenstock to add some orchestration—and it was exactly what I wanted. I felt like if it wasn’t huge, then it would be stupider somehow—so it had to be really stupid to the point where it was good, and we got there.”\n\n<b>“I Want to Remember It All”</b>\n“When I was writing this song, I was like, ‘Is this already a song?’ I felt like it worked <i>too</i> well—it couldn’t possibly be my idea. It’s a song about when things happen in your life that are supposed to happen. My daughter’s here, and every moment of my life that led up to her birth has been the exact right thing that needed to happen to make sure that this very specific human being was made. There were a lot of painful things that happened in the past couple of years, but I want to remember everything. I’ll take the painful stuff if I can have all the beautiful things.”\n\n<b>“Honey”</b>\n“Sonically and lyrically, it’s a weaving together of similar ideas. Part of it is about the relationship that I was in, part of it is about love in general, and part of it is about singing to someone I hadn’t even met. It’s love in a bunch of different forms, and then I wove it all together. I’m barely singing to anyone—I might be singing to myself, who knows.”\n\n<b>“Not Us”</b>\n“This one’s really sad. I’d never heard a song about this topic, which is when you’re in a relationship and watching everybody else around you break up, and you’re like, ‘That’ll never happen to us—we’re perfect.’ It’s not schadenfreude, but with each relationship that dies around you, for some reason it draws you closer. But then it does happen, and you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I didn’t see that coming.’ How did we get there? Did we just let it fall apart because we didn’t think about it? We just thought it would always work.”\n\n<b>“I Couldn’t Sleep”</b>\n“This one is about me getting back out there—I’ve never been single in my entire life. That was scary. Then I was seeing someone, and I felt absolutely nothing—and I was, like, actually happy, because it just didn’t feel right. But then you feel like, ‘Am I broken?’ And that’s scary too, but it’s okay. I just thought it was such a good song, and it makes sense with this chapter in my life where I’m just trying to figure out what is going on—what love is, how to love. This is the truth, and that’s how I’ve always been with the things that I make. I don’t censor it.”\n\n<b>“Short and Sweet”</b>\n“It’s about being back in the world again and making yourself vulnerable, and being afraid of that. I’m working as a music therapist, and I work with older populations at an assisted living facility sometimes. I sing that song ‘L-O-V-E,’ and the end of the song goes, ‘Take my heart, but please don’t break it.’ I had a long talk with the folks at the assisted living facility about that lyric, and how that’s such a scary thing—and that’s what love is. So the song is about that, and not being ready for that, because it’s a scary prospect.”\n\n<b>“Can I Fly for Free?”</b>\n“I was in Queens seeing Paul Simon, and I had an existential crisis about my life—and also about my physical safety at that moment, because it was a poorly organized operation, there were no clear exits, and I was really scared that the crowd was gonna go crazy and everybody was gonna die. But also, I was feeling a little suffocated in my life. I wasn’t making choices based on what I wanted, and I was going along with things and pretty freaked out. It was like this weird, pivotal, scary moment, and I remember looking up and the moon was coming up so low in the sky, and this Spirit Airlines plane flew past the moon in this way that I’m always gonna have in my mind. The title is kind of a joke, because I mention Spirit Airlines, so it’d be nice to have like some sort of sponsorship.”\n\n<b>“Domino”</b>\n“This is about another attempt at love. It’s about knowing something is going to end—and end badly—but also knowing that it was never really real in the first place. It’s another attempt at love, but then you want to go back in a time machine and just be in that place where you felt good for a second, even though you know that everything was bad. When something’s ending, you wish for that ‘ignorance is bliss’ situation, but you can’t get it.”\n\n<b>“Instant Comfort”</b>\n“This one’s about being out in the world again—getting burned, and getting burned bad. It’s about knowing what I represented to someone instead of what I actually was, and feeling a little used in that regard, which is scary, and hard. Musically, I was really excited about this one because I borrowed a mandolin from my work. I used a lot of really chime-y instruments, like a 12-string guitar and a couple of other acoustic guitars, to get a really bright-sounding guitar sound that I was looking for. I sat with it a lot in the aftermath to get a layered sound that I couldn’t really describe when we were in the studio, so I did it myself, and sometimes that’s the way to do it.”\n\n<b>“Middle Love”</b>\n“I wrote this one on piano very quickly. It’s about a moment in time where you’re dropped into a scene and looking around. It’s very special when those songs happen, because it’s like a short story but you’re not given all the characters or context and you have to figure it out. In this one, it’s two people sitting in a notary’s office, separating. Their driver’s licenses are sitting there, and they’re seeing pictures of themselves in the past from a couple of years prior. They’re looking back at them like, ‘Would you have believed that you’d be sitting there right now in the future?’”\n\n<b>“Late Great”</b>\n“I had a friend tell me that this one is their favorite one, and I was like, ‘Really?’ I mean, when I was writing it, I was like, ‘This is a good song.’ But when I was going through the instrumentation, something got lost there for me and I fell out of love with it. But now I’m starting to fall back in love with it, because I’ve been playing it by myself the way that I wrote it. Thematically, it sums the whole album up: I’m doing it on my own, but I’m figuring it out. It’s the only song that has a real positive message.”\n\n<b>“#1 (2)”</b>\n“This song is my favorite. I felt like the record needed something, and then it just found its way to the end of the record. A lot had changed during recording, and I had a lot of time to reflect on how crazy and sad everything was.

EP","standard":"“Gnarly,” the lead single from KATSEYE’s <i>BEAUTIFUL CHAOS</i> EP, is both a comeback and a cannonball into the girl group’s new era. It’s a revved-up, hyperpop fever dream that’s braggadocious and tongue-in-cheek in equal measure (“Hottie, hottie/Like a bag of Takis/I’m the shit,” they chant), with generous cursing that cuts as sharply as its knife-slashing sound effects. It’s almost hard to believe this is the same group that debuted just a year earlier with 2024’s <i>SIS (Soft Is Strong)</i>, whose breakthrough single “Touch” was a sweet kiss-off wrapped in candy hearts. But that’s the point: KATSEYE are no longer the rookies pieced together by label giants HYBE and Geffen. “Gnarly” marks their charge into bolder, more daring territory that reflects who they really are: chronically online, fierce yet funny, mature yet refreshingly unfiltered.\n\n<i>BEAUTIFUL CHAOS</i> continues down that path, exploring the complexities of modern womanhood—dating, digital personas, and, in KATSEYE’s case, six distinct personalities living under one roof—across an eclectic range of tracks. On “Gabriela,” they warn off a romantic rival atop a breeze of Spanish guitars, with member Daniela delivering the group’s first Spanish-language verse. <i>SIS</i> fans will find an older sister to “Touch” in “Gameboy,” a pastel rebuff layered in 8-bit bleeps and hopscotch percussion, while the balladic “Mean Girls” lets the group’s vocal runs and harmonies shine as they rise above online haters. But closer “M.I.A” steers KATSEYE back to the club, reasserting their self-worth (“Don’t be like this/No, you won't put a leash on a bitch”) over a gritty, throbbing beat and ready to dash into the night.","short":"A fierce, funny cannonball into the girl group’s next

Album and Interview","standard":"The two years that followed BNXN’s forthright 2023 release <i>Sincerely, Benson</i> only seem to have cemented the singer-songwriter’s OG status. That time is what sets the stage for <i>CAPTAIN</i>, a sophomore album that finds BNXN coming to terms with his place as an Afropop juggernaut. “‘Captain’ is the name one of my friends used to call me,” BNXN tells Apple Music. “He would often say that as a sign of respect, leadership, and to signify who was in charge. I keyed into it deeply in the sense that I started to see myself as a crucial player in the industry, especially the Nigerian music industry. I don’t have to be at the forefront of it all. I just believe the sound or the kind of music I make is up there. It’s important.”\n\nThat sense of self-assurance is palpable across <i>CAPTAIN</i>, where BNXN asserts his place as an Afropop lodestar without sacrificing the thematic rigor and tonal deftness that stood him out from the start. “There’s a significant amount of growth on this project,” he explains. “I feel like anybody who’s a core listener of BNXN knows that this guy is way more confident about what he’s doing. There is a tendency to get very unsure or unstable in this game, but this project just showed me how solidified I am.” With contributions from a talented cast of collaborators that includes Seyi Vibez, Victony, and Rema, <i>CAPTAIN</i> oscillates between sun-drenched summer jams (“Phenomena”), affirming anthems for girl bosses (“Cutesy”), and withering rebukes to trolls (“Ashimolowo”), while peeling back a few layers on the drive that has powered BNXN’s rise to the pinnacle of Afropop.\n\nRead on as BNXN talks us through key tracks from <i>CAPTAIN</i>.\n\n<b>“I Alone”</b>\n“‘I Alone’ was produced by Rymez, a UK producer. For that beat, what stood out to me was [that] it just sounds very uptempo and very pop-like. It made me feel like I’m in high school enjoying some Black Eyed Peas type of music. [The song] is just me reflecting on my journey, and how lonesome it gets sometimes, but then I always have to remind myself that I’m him. It’s an introduction to me.”\n\n<b>“Cutesy”</b>\n“What’s crazy is, I like to see this project as a combination of four EPs. I never consciously recorded the EPs, but let’s just say they were sounds. So, the first four songs are all hip-hop-inspired. ‘Cutesy’ is sexy drill, but it’s still with the hip-hop influence, because it stems from New York. It’s the core feel of Afrofusion, just being able to fuse that African heritage with the hip-hop influence. I needed to try that sexy drill because the whole of summer 2024, when I was outside, that was all I was hearing. The women love that sound. Especially when the tequila is flowing.”\n\n<b>“Jies”</b>\n“It is an abbreviation for ‘ju idi e seyin,’ [which is] an interpolation from something Burna Boy did. There was a song he had back in the day with LeriQ and Phyno called ‘Turn Up.’ It’s a party scenario, but I had to make this feel like my own version of it. It’s produced by Young Soul, UK fucking genius-ass producer. It’s me just vibing and talking about being in the club, trying to woo a girl and telling her, ‘Your boyfriend could not level up to me, because I’m chilling. I’m chilling in the highest manner and I want you to join me. So, let’s dance.’”\n\n<b>“Very Soon” (with FOLA)</b>\n“This song just stemmed from FOLA really loving my music, and then thinking I could make his music better. I remember the day that I stumbled on the ‘Very Soon’ snippet on his Twitter. The song was done, right, but everybody only got to hear a 10- or 15-second snippet, and that was the best part of the record. He was like, ‘He’s going to send me the beat and I should just do whatever I want with it.’ FOLA did the hook, then I decided to do a little bridge there, do a verse, and then bring the hook back again. I am just happy when artists listen to each other because those kinds of things could have caused a rift. He could have felt some type of way, but he’s very understanding.” \n\n<b>“Eleyi”</b>\n“I think this is nostalgic music. This is galala. This is Ajegunle lost sounds. ‘Eleyi’ is street-dancehall. It was made in Ghana with Kel-P. ‘Eleyi’ is just me buttressing the fact that I’m doing something supercrucial in the industry. So ‘Eleyi’ is Yoruba for ‘this one’ and it is just me saying, ‘This very sound, this one, they can’t do it like me. This very sound is me, and if you go and hear it from another person, they couldn’t match it, like BNXN.’ It’s a lot of clones out there, but it’s like there’s the original person and that’s me.”\n\n<b>“Captain”</b>\n“I think this is my favorite song off the project—and it’s my life. I grossed like 1.2 billion streams, and it’s something that I was happy about, but it didn’t move me per se. I’m currently almost at 700 million streams on Apple Music. Maybe when I gross a billion on Apple Music, I’ll probably be cool. There are not a lot of people who have that in Nigeria. So, ‘Captain’ is me reflecting. I’m saying stuff like my life is the kind of one where I don’t have time for gratification. And the little gratification I do is to smoke weed when I feel like I’ve achieved some good thing. That’s how it just feels sometimes in the game. ‘Captain’ is me telling everybody that I didn’t choose this life, this life chose me.”\n\n<b>“Fi Kan We Kan” (feat. Rema)</b>\n“A lot of people were not expecting this one. Rema and I had been talking since 2023 and 2024, thereabouts. One of the songs I got or I sent him was ‘Fi Kan We Kan,’ and he loved it a lot. ‘Fi Kan We Kan’ is one of my favorite records. It’s the best song to demand your money from anybody.”\n\n<b>“Ashimolowo”</b>\n“So, this stems from a tweet. The tweet ‘Is Ashimolowo a bad bitch?’ That’s a stupid question, but it’s just me saying, ‘I don’t have time for a lot of things, or a lot of mentions. We’re still going to get money. We’re going to get extremely rich.’ So, there was something I used to do back then where, if somebody said something outrageous to me, I would crash out or I would respond to them. I don’t do that anymore, and that’s basically because of ‘Ashimolowo.’ It’s like I’m telling you, everything I do right now is magic, and it’s orchestrated by divine powers. I cannot be shaken by an agenda. We’re going to be successful, we’re going to make so much money, but we don’t have to respond to anybody.”\n\n<b>“Cough Syrup” (feat. Victony)</b>\n“So, this one is a Victony song originally. It was supposed to be on his project, but I was delaying on the verse, mainly because I hadn’t caught anything yet. Music is very sacred and special to me, especially if we’re not taking the gbedu [‘beat-driven’] route. The day I recorded the song, I was saying things that pertained deeply to me. On this song, I’m just saying, ‘People don’t want this smoke. If they did, they would choke a lot.’ I did the verse on it, and Victony hears it and he’s like, ‘This is deeper than what I wanted you to do before.’ I asked him to give it to me and he was OK with it.”\n\n<b>“In Jesus Name” (feat. Soweto Gospel Choir)</b>\n“I made this one in Cape Town with Gemini Major. ‘In Jesus Name’ is the conclusion to every prayer, when you say amen. It’s me describing my life with a little bit of detail, and how I feel so confident in what I’m doing. That’s pretty much the theme of the project, just confidence in what I’m doing, the solidity. It’s me feeling like I’m in the middle of the pitch and I have the captain’s armband on. I don’t have to score the goal. I don’t have to do too much, but I know at the end of the day, if we win that cup, I’ll be the one to lift it.”","short":"BNXN reaches Zen: “I don’t need all the shine, but respect what I bring.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/captain/1817243687","playParams":{"id":"1817243687","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5jqvO2VFTZ4n5MlE393wwT"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817243687/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1347142581","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1347142581?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751881932458,"RTCI":0}}},"1817396310":{"id":"1817396310","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817396310?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative","Punk"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dropkick-murphys/2928220","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7a/4f/a7/7a4fa795-147d-1c98-81f1-2471e91a046f/ed7b2598-5fed-40d4-b01f-a8eb22820ee6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b69771","textColor2":"d6aa8a","textColor4":"ae8c72","textColor1":"dfb989","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true}},"name":"For The People","artistName":"Dropkick Murphys","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2e/25/d4/2e25d4eb-1707-38e2-8c3a-a63eba6f04ee/5400863189563_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0dade","textColor2":"fccfd1","textColor4":"d0b9bd","textColor1":"e8f8fa","bgColor":"21616d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“For a band like us, who’s always talking about working-class people and that sort of thing, it would be difficult for our music to not be affected by the current political climate.” That’s Dropkick Murphys guitarist and accordion player Tim Brennan telling Apple Music about the story behind the title of the Celtic punk band’s 13th studio album, <i>For the People</i>. “I’m not hugely political myself,” he adds. “I come from a more human aspect—I just think everyone should be good to everyone else. The fact that that has become a wild idea is crazy, but I think it’s clear what the right and wrong sides of this are.”\n\nOn <i>For the People</i>, Dropkick Murphys deliver a call to populism that’s very different from the counterfeit version offered by right-wing politicians. Leadoff track “Who’ll Stand With Us?” addresses unjust deportations, widespread layoffs, and the revocation of benefits while special guests The Scratch, The Mary Wallopers, and English songwriter/activist Billy Bragg join Dropkick’s chorus of righteous voices. Elsewhere, personal lyrics about vocalist Ken Casey’s childhood (“Streetlights,” “Chesterfields and Aftershave”) mingle with tributes to Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge (“The Big Man”) and departed Pogues leader Shane MacGowan (“One Last Goodbye”). Last but not least, longtime Dropkicks singer Al Barr returns on “The Vultures Circle High.” Below, Brennan comments on each track. \n\n<b>“Who'll Stand With Us?”</b>\n“It’s not often that we play songs live before we’ve recorded them or released them, but this was one where we started playing it live pretty much as soon as it was written. It’s a good lead-off too, because Ken did a great job with the lyrics, describing the current state of things from the perspective of a bunch of guys like us—blue-collar, family, working-class guys. This album has a lot of different sounding stuff for us, but this is a tried-and-true Dropkick Murphys song, and it addresses the current state of things in a very Ken Casey/Dropkick Murphys way.” \n\n<b>“Longshot” (feat. The Scratch)</b>\n“Somewhere around 2007, when we put out our album <i>The Meanest of Times</i>, we came across this state-of-Massachusetts-style, sinister Irish type of song, and ‘Longshot’ falls into that category. Our banjo player, Jeff DaRosa, came up with that opening banjo riff, and we just kind of expounded from there. Lyrically, it’s a song about people who underestimate you, and you working your way through those people and those inner thoughts that tell you that you can’t achieve whatever it is you're looking to achieve. Our buddies The Scratch, from Dublin, laid down some vocal tracks for the song in Copenhagen when we were on tour together.” \n\n<b>“The Big Man”</b>\n“We did a bit of touring with Pennywise over the last few years, and we had known the guys casually for a while. You hear so many stories about [Pennywise guitarist] Fletcher [Dragge] and the destruction that happens in the wake of that man, but when we started hanging with him, we realized he’s such a fucking gentleman, so sweet and nice. And yeah, he likes to cause a ruckus now and again. I’ve seen him pick up [Warped Tour founder] Kevin Lyman in the middle of an interview on Warped Tour and throw him in a pond. I’ve seen him shoot BBs at people. We had a blast writing this song about him.” \n\n<b>“Chesterfields and Aftershave”</b>\n“Some of my favorite Dropkick songs are the ones where Ken talks about his childhood, because he's got so many interesting stories from that time. This one is about him spending time with his grandfather as a kid. He held his grandfather in such high regard. I never had the pleasure of meeting him, unfortunately, but there's a couple of Dropkick songs written about him. ‘Boys on the Docks’ is one of them. But this is a song where Ken is writing about being raised by his grandfather, essentially. Ken will be the first person to tell you that he was a bit of a foul ball as a kid. To have a role model like his grandfather set him on the right path was clearly so important for him, and that is not lost on him.” \n\n<b>“Bury the Bones” (feat. The Mary Wallopers)</b>\n“I wrote the music for ‘Bury the Bones’ during the first bit of the pandemic. I was sitting in my apartment, so I started recording shit, just stockpiling stuff. Often, I’ll do a demo like that and send it to Ken, and he’ll start writing lyrics to it. Sometimes he’ll have me swap stuff around, like put the chorus in a different place, but with this one, he called me and said, ‘Meet me at the practice space, and we’ll put vocals down.’ That was the summer of 2020, so we just hung on to it. We knew we wanted the Hendy brothers from The Mary Wallopers to do some stuff on this record, and they nailed the shit out of this. Their voices sound so great on it. I started working on it so long ago that to see it finally come out is a personal triumph.” \n\n<b>“Kids Games”</b>\n“We don’t often write on the road because it’s difficult, but this was one where Ken had an idea for a melody line and some words, so he and I got together and started working on it. I love The Replacements, so I snuck a little bit of a Westerberg-y type of thing into the intro riff. I love doing little Easter egg tip-of-the-caps and things like that throughout the songs—you can find them everywhere. It’s obviously not a standard Dropkicks song, but it’s very Dropkick Murphys in the way that it goes, and I think it came out great.” \n\n<b>“Sooner Kill ’Em First”</b>\n“Our producer, Ted Hutt, was in Boston with us when we were kind of working on new stuff. We were just fucking around, and the music for this song appeared. We thought it sounded very much like <i>Red Roses for Me</i>/<i>Rum Sodomy & The Lash</i>-era Pogues. Interestingly, the lyrics used to be on a different song. But the vibe of the music for that song made the lyrics seem way too serious. So, we took those lyrics, tweaked them into a more jovial Irish song, and it became a completely different thing that we felt fit better.” \n\n<b>“Fiending for the Lies”</b>\n“This song and the next one are my favorite songs on the album. I had been listening to a ton of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds when I wrote this one, and I put this demo together that pretty much sounds like what you hear on the album, with a couple of small differences. When I sent it to Ken, I said, ‘I know this is not anything close to what we’re looking for.’ But he liked it, so we started working on it. It’s very hard-hitting and aggressive, and it sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. I can’t wait to do it live. I’m pushing for us to open with it, but I think Ken’s going to be like, ‘Chill out, man.’”\n\n<b>“Streetlights”</b>\n“This is my favorite song on the record, hands down. Musically, we’d done two years of touring with The Scratch from Dublin, and between seeing them every night and listening to their albums, I started gaining a lot of inspiration. So, I made a demo of ‘Streetlights’ that was based on a Scratch song called ‘Old Dog,’ but I ended up getting blasted off in another direction. Lyrically, it’s from a part of Ken’s life that he’s not really touched on before, a very personal story from his childhood. I was so over the moon when I heard the finished version. It’s probably my favorite thing we’ve done in a decade.” \n\n<b>“School Days Over” (feat. Billy Bragg)</b>\n“About a week before we went into the studio to record this album, I texted Ken and Ted, our producer, and I sent them the Luke Kelly version of the song. It’s a song by Ewan MacColl, who also wrote ‘Dirty Old Town.’ He’s the father of Kirsty McColl, who sang ‘Fairytale of New York’ with The Pogues. Not only is it a great song with a great melody, but it seems apropos for the times. So, we started working on it. The idea of asking Billy to sing on it came up when he came to Boston two St. Patrick’s Days ago and played a few songs with us. They say don’t meet your heroes, but in Billy’s case, meet him. He’s the sweetest guy you’ve ever met in your life. He told us it was his favorite Ewan McColl song, and he agreed to do it. When we heard his vocal on this for the first time, we were in awe. His ‘There is Power in a Union’ has been our intro music for 23 years now, so to meet him and get to work with him is unbelievable.” \n\n<b>“The Vultures Circle High” (feat. Al Barr)</b>\n“When I did the demo of ‘Streetlights’ originally, it had an Irish-y outro. The idea was, I would ditch my guitar and grab the accordion, and we would do this instrumental outro. I played it for my wife, and she said, ‘That’s a separate song.’ And I said, ‘What do you know?’ Then I brought it to practice and everyone went, ‘It’s a different song.’ So, now my wife is taking credit for this because we took that part and expanded it into another song. It turned out to have that sinister Irish thing, kind of like ‘Longshot.’ And the opportunity to get Al on there was wonderful because we did so many years of touring together, and now he’s home doing his family thing. But first and foremost, people need to know that he’s very much a part of the family, no matter what is going on at home.” \n\n<b>“One Last Goodbye ‘Tribute to Shane’” (feat. The Scratch)\n“The Pogues are so important to Dropkick Murphys, obviously. When I was 14, there was a young English teacher at my high school who was like 22 or 23, fresh out of college. I wasn’t the best student, but this guy realized I was big into music. I was already playing in bands and was way into traditional Irish music in addition to punk and hardcore. He showed up with a dubbed cassette of The Pogues’ <i>If I Should Fall from Grace with God</i>, and my fucking life changed forever. I was obsessed. These days, I could have a doctorate in Pogues’ history. More people texted me about Shane passing away than they did on my birthday. The outro is an Irish traditional song called ‘Mo Ghile Mear,’ which is what they played at Shane’s funeral when they wheeled his casket out of the church to go to the cemetery. The Scratch guys are singing in Irish, and it just worked out perfectly.”</b>","short":"Celtic-punk populism: “I think everyone should just be good to everyone else.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-the-people/1817396310","playParams":{"id":"1817396310","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2M3u2dW8uCvgzAIAqjPop5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817396310/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2928220","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2928220?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751879654435,"RTCI":0}}},"1817468418":{"id":"1817468418","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817468418?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2014-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/avicii/298496035","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/88/13/8f/88138fa5-dd30-c82b-76aa-cd20ca2d0ce7/899d4259-4d3e-4613-a234-6df7edfb8817.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e1bdc5","textColor2":"fccc7c","textColor4":"e2b473","textColor1":"fad7e2","bgColor":"7c5752","hasP3":true}},"name":"Avicii at Tomorrowland Belgium 2014, MainStage (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Avicii","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e9/e4/21/e9e42168-b9a3-1a5a-004e-ae608101f919/705a7fb0-87a4-4447-88fc-27979d2c6370.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b7b7b7","textColor2":"cfcfcf","textColor4":"a5a5a5","textColor1":"e5e5e5","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"In 2014, Avicii was perhaps the superstar DJ that best personified the 2010s EDM boom—a master at using the melodic power and emotional complexities of pop to push at the boundaries of dance music. In this set from Tomorrowland’s 10th anniversary in 2014, you’ll find many of his signature tracks that defined that decade on the dance floor, plus others that shared a similar DNA and ambition to take music from the club to the world—the likes of Swedish House Mafia’s “Don’t You Worry Child” and Calvin Harris’ “I Need Your Love.” Listen now in Spatial Audio and sense the indelible presence Avicii left on dance—and pop—today.","short":"At TML’s 10th anniversary, Avicii was shaping dance music’s

Album","standard":"When hip-hop supergroup BROCKHAMPTON broke up in 2022, they announced what was billed as the group’s final album; in reality, <i>The Family</i> functioned more like a solo album from founder and de facto leader Kevin Abstract, who helmed the project as its only vocalist. <i>Blanket</i>, the first solo Abstract album since BROCKHAMPTON’s breakup, arrived the following year, departing almost entirely from rap to wallow in moody indie rock and grunge. Two years later, its follow-up, <i>Blush</i>, feels like a full-circle moment: Here Abstract assumes more of a curatorial role, regularly ceding focus to a deep roster of collaborators, including former BROCKHAMPTON bandmates Ameer Vann, Romil Hemnani, and Kiko Merley, plus alt-rap heroes Danny Brown and JPEGMAFIA and frequent collaborator Dominic Fike. \n\nThe title doubles as the name of the loose collective of Houston-based musicians who appear across the album’s 18 tracks: Love Spells, roro, E Bleu, Makana XO, Truly Young, Diego, Drigo, DERBY, and Devan. Between grimy Texas boom-bap, alt-rock breakup ballads, and a Sublime-channeling ska jam (“Geezer”), it’s got the scope to take in all the lives Abstract has lived over the years.\n","short":"The

Blessed by veterans like Tito Nieves and aligned with contemporaries like Luis Figueroa, the Puerto Rican singer represents this new tropical wave with vibrant energy and obvious star power. Following up his 2023 debut, the simply-titled <i>Yo</i>, his second proper full-length <i>Swingkete Vol. 1 - Maratón</i> reflects his growing profile with nearly an hour’s worth of songs that speak to the genre’s past while positioning it for this modern era. \n\nAlbum opener “Hello, What’s Up” provides a playful entry point for newcomers, overcoming perceived language barriers with winking humor and no small amount of charm. Songs like “El Dominó” and “E.M.U.” offer knowing stylistic touches familiar to longtime lovers of this music without ever feeling stodgy or stale. He sings with passion and pride in his country on “En PR con Plena,” adding to a contemporary canon of Puerto Rican homeland homage.\n\nAll too happy to invite reggaetoneros into his space, Alicea brings Jowell & Randy along for the uptempo “Carrusel” and lets singer J Alvarez in for a proper duet on “Homenaje a J Alvarez.” With Eliot El Mago D Oz by his side, he even manages to slip some bachata vibes into the mix on “Tus Celos.” Yet even without guests, he hints and gestures towards a potential for a more expansive vision of Latin stardom. After gliding over the drill-adjacent title track, he toys with reggae cadences on “Bomba Para Afincar” and tries out Afrobeats for size on “Ella Es Así.”","short":"One of salsa’s brightest young stars is in it to win it."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/swingkete-vol-1-marat%C3%B3n/1821045129","playParams":{"id":"1821045129","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3swn9BL0MqR8K0wcKUJwGi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821045129/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"831088637","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/831088637?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751643650107,"RTCI":0}}},"1821064917":{"id":"1821064917","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821064917?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Pop Latino","Music","Latin","Urbano latino"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kapo/1573761238","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/55/4a/d4/554ad4b7-cc25-a273-0885-0199e55f7245/676d960e-758d-4943-815c-3f46e76d3f04.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2d3535","textColor2":"2a231f","textColor4":"4b473f","textColor1":"040c12","bgColor":"d2dbc1","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/64/82/ba/6482bacd-feb5-0802-954a-e654dec574a1/03c97d85-f3ad-4039-91fd-f4b53a5d7d58.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d5c7b9","textColor2":"f7b178","textColor4":"d69566","textColor1":"f5f0de","bgColor":"542422","hasP3":true}},"name":"POR SI ALGUIEN NOS ESCUCHA","artistName":"Kapo","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/58/ad/40/58ad40ef-6190-e466-47c7-cb8ba1b413b6/196873288499.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cd640b","textColor2":"f25a02","textColor4":"c64c05","textColor1":"fc7809","bgColor":"131614","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"No shortage of Latin artists of late have drawn inspiration from the vibrant sound of Afrobeats. Yet while it’s become common to hear today’s Spanish-language stars contribute to the globalization of this particular style with singles or album one-offs, Kapo marks one of the few to fully embrace and embed himself within the genre. Starting with his breakout hit “OHNANA,” the rising Colombian star’s come-up in the 12 months preceding <i>POR SI ALGUIEN NOS ESCUCHA</i> featured a string of tracks like “ALOH ALOH” and “UWAIE” that reinforced that first impression. All three of those feature here alongside other like-minded tracks like “RUFF” and “NO CRY.” Previously released collabs “CARITA ANGELIKAL” with Rels B and “ILY” with Myke Towers join new ones like the bilingual “X TI” with Feid. No stranger to genre-hopping, Manuel Turizo fits right in alongside Kapo on the breezy yet pulsating “ANTES,” as does Colombian dancehall act Lion Fiah on the more reggae-informed “MEDICINA.”","short":"Colombia’s rising Afrobeats star embraces his genre."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/por-si-alguien-nos-escucha/1821064917","playParams":{"id":"1821064917","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0t4IoD2ctBdtx0zRYc8lFe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821064917/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1573761238","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1573761238?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751768428781,"RTCI":0}}},"1821066384":{"id":"1821066384","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821066384?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/electric-bloom/1317901346","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Electric Bloom - EP","artistName":"Electric Bloom","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fe/db/8a/fedb8a97-c22a-a410-f7de-66542dfe3823/25UMGIM82821.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b670bf","textColor2":"bc59f5","textColor4":"984ad5","textColor1":"e288da","bgColor":"081155","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/electric-bloom-ep/1821066384","playParams":{"id":"1821066384","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821066384/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1317901346","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1317901346?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751411445322,"RTCI":0}}},"1821072008":{"id":"1821072008","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821072008?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2012-07-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/avicii/298496035","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/57/f3/7a/57f37a90-234b-2ab7-2a89-a5ea26d1645e/dd669b16-d48e-478f-8732-e638794e772f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c0bec0","textColor2":"f3753c","textColor4":"c35d30","textColor1":"f0eef0","bgColor":"010101","hasP3":true}},"name":"Avicii at Tomorrowland Belgium 2012, MainStage (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Avicii","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ba/3d/c9/ba3dc92a-753b-dffc-2619-ee1c2ff3373e/38940da3-89eb-409a-b347-f6db9b19bf98.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2680d0","textColor2":"1795ff","textColor4":"1277d0","textColor1":"30a0ff","bgColor":"000015","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"Avicii made his Tomorrowland debut in 2011 with a set that included a then-unreleased track called “Levels.” By the time he returned to the Belgian festival the following year, plenty had changed. “Levels” had been a hit across the world and the Swede born Tim Bergling was given Friday night’s headline slot on the MainStage.

Album","standard":"After sharpening their attack across three EPs, Sydney quartet FANGZ come out snarling on their debut album. Belted out with dependable vitriol by lead singer Josh Cottreau, these anthems add alt-rock muscle to rapid-fire melodic punk. Opener “Wide Awake” lurches into a huge chorus as if every second counts, while “Wasting Time” echoes the dark, brooding interplay of <i>The Colour and the Shape</i>-era Foo Fighters. Cottreau’s hot-blooded singing (and occasional scream) leads the charge, hammering home shout-along tales of disappointment and regret. \n\nYet more sensitive nuances peek through as he pays tribute to his supportive sister on “Annie Marie” and describes young life in a rundown coastal town on the especially cathartic “Gone.” FANGZ are at their most engaging when Cottreau details the exact source of frustration that’s brimming over in the music and lyrics alike. He vents about his not-so-distant past as “a mess of a man” on “Same Old Story” and describes veering out of control on “Nothing to Lose,” all while hooks crash enthusiastically around him.\n","short":"Rapid-fire melodic punk packed with frustration and catharsis."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shui/1822178931","playParams":{"id":"1822178931","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0kqQEYittPYBP1gWEjlEPI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822178931/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1496178388","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1496178388?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751684911684,"RTCI":0}}},"1822553933":{"id":"1822553933","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822553933?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/painkillers/1495670436","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"IN SOSPESO","artistName":"PainKillers","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a6/b9/13/a6b913ac-6999-d768-1bef-7027ecf5632c/25UMGIM86842.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"31242a","textColor2":"000b0d","textColor4":"31262c","textColor1":"00090b","bgColor":"f591a9","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-sospeso/1822553933","playParams":{"id":"1822553933","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1YEbXr39akgyxxA7DekvrZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822553933/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1495670436","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1495670436?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751643114879,"RTCI":0}}},"1822615159":{"id":"1822615159","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822615159?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/natanael-cano/1406984792","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f6/ba/09/f6ba09a1-0be3-c8ab-31cc-874fab3c2ebb/128f2d49-dd68-4fa0-ac53-2925eef84bb6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"95a5b7","textColor2":"779fdd","textColor4":"6384b5","textColor1":"b6c9df","bgColor":"131517","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/19/cf/0f/19cf0f55-3b4a-38a4-c194-977a2e26b5c2/494f85b5-180a-4785-b05a-a09f199ab3f0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cccccc","textColor2":"00e800","textColor4":"0bc40b","textColor1":"f2f2f2","bgColor":"373737","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/db/21/63/db216301-6b85-a70b-5d90-b57c8ae6af05/55702f67-547b-4104-bd86-2aa9034f05ac.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"ededed","textColor4":"bdbdbd","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true}},"name":"Porque La Demora","artistName":"Natanael Cano","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3200,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/76/67/9f7667e0-4211-fc4e-3803-143acec11283/5021732853547.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3200,"textColor3":"bebebe","textColor2":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"eeeeee","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Natanael Cano deserves credit not only for pioneering and popularizing corridos tumbados, but also for using his platform to uplift numerous other young stars well into the 2020s. Yet his diehard fans know the trap aesthetic that often defines or otherwise informs the themes behind his hit songs also carries over to his work outside of música mexicana. On genre-crossed projects like <i>NataKong</i> and <i>Trap Tumbado</i>, he proved himself a formidable rapper able to contend credibly with the Spanish-language spitters he shares space with on the Latin charts. It is within that same rubric of creative freedom that <i>Porque La Demora</i> arises. \n\nCano’s most diverse offering to date, the 16-track effort evolves over the course of its runtime, pivoting into spaces both familiar and uncharted for the superstar artist. “Working in urban styles—rap, trap, or reggaetón—feels like a blast,” Cano tells Apple Music. “Mostly because a producer sends you a beat, and if you dig it, the song’s already halfway done. First, you have to like the beat, the rest just flows. Pure freestyle, bar after bar.” The opening pair finds him comfortable in two hip-hop modes, the title track more boom-bap than the modernity of “Como Es.” Not content to stay in any specific space here for too long, he briefly transitions toward the tropical with frequent collaborator Gabito Ballesteros on “Perlas Negras.”\n\nThe album has no shortage of high-wattage guest stars, but despite his reputation for bringing along other artists, Cano claims he does not exactly keep up to speed on what his peers are putting out. \"Not listening to other artists helps me a lot,\" he says. \"I’m obsessed with music, but I don’t consume it. I only play my own albums. That keeps me focused on creating something that’s 100 percent me: something pure.\"\n\nHe reaches for reggaetón on cuts like “Blancanieves” and “Polos Opuestos,” supplying both verses and hooks in true hit-making fashion. That continues through “Bellakita,” a standout team-up with the rising Victor Mendivil that calls back to that genre’s rugged roots. The album’s second half adds even more features to the mix, with traperos-turned-popular stars Myke Towers and Eladio Carrión coming through for “El Juez” and the comparatively more clubby “Como Tony,” respectively. Chilean sensation FloyyMenor lends his reggaetonero skills to “Mary Poppins” while longtime cohort Badguychapo gets his bars off for “Cholo.”\n\nBy the time the strobe lights hit on closer “VLV,” one might be forgiven for briefly forgetting Cano’s primary infamy in the corridos space. The closest <i>Porque La Demora</i> even gets to that side of his work comes on “Primero Muerto,” a piano-driven ballad that marks the most accessible moment on the entire album. Its narrative of pill-popping numbness and achingly romantic longing places him squarely in the pop zeitgeist, where he assuredly belongs.\n\nMore importantly, Cano has found a way of working that can keep him in the game for the long haul. “Over these past five or six years, I’ve definitely ridden that emotional rollercoaster, the highs and lows of making music, but you never stay in one place; it always shifts,” he says. “Today, I can say this is the first album I’ve genuinely enjoyed making, even though a year ago, I would’ve said I’d lost my hunger. All I needed was a break, and it reminded me that I still have plenty to give, starting with this album and many more to come.”\n","short":"A genre-hopping trip from the corridos kingpin: “I’m obsessed with music.”"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/porque-la-demora/1822615159","playParams":{"id":"1822615159","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7EIuLIjhFQAGPvq6L5gBvZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822615159/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1406984792","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1406984792?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751678051219,"RTCI":0}}},"1822663652":{"id":"1822663652","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822663652?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","R&B/Soul","Disco"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/touch-of-funk/1817817429","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/e7/a4/abe7a490-acf8-05bb-af79-c296c7ce4318/d6a9859f-c69c-4630-a66d-2bdacd446b4c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"4f4d4e","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"58524c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/f7/2a/95f72afd-8726-06f2-40c6-0a97a3ec5f9b/cf59838c-ffcf-4fff-a2c0-62528d87bf01.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"4f4f4f","textColor2":"2e2a29","textColor4":"575352","textColor1":"252525","bgColor":"f8f8f8","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/b0/d0/83b0d0af-45b6-9d7b-bd80-3f7966476fef/52e4b2b3-596b-42aa-8fbf-9677d87e26e4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"433f41","textColor2":"333333","textColor4":"5a5a5a","textColor1":"161214","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/59/b5/0659b5e9-ee74-1605-3847-c68eeaa33788/efc67f90-b9d0-4cc9-bd0f-624182d41ab3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3d393b","textColor2":"1f1c1d","textColor4":"4a4748","textColor1":"0e0a0d","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/21/fb/fe/21fbfe84-bb8d-d905-9af6-802b322a36e3/8a6ad81f-be0d-4991-b8a2-aa8669ab8796.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"0b0a09","textColor4":"2f2e2e","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"bfbfbf","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/23/9f/3d239fda-9edc-1839-9b03-d6a8abd9b9e3/74e4c9fb-f336-4cc6-b177-dfae3d28989c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"423e3f","textColor2":"303030","textColor4":"535353","textColor1":"1a1617","bgColor":"e0e0e0","hasP3":true}},"name":"Today's Hits: July 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Touch Of Funk","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5d/ae/e9/5daee98f-03fa-c584-4777-082204ac7cdc/5d780618-26c7-48c5-a590-d397acda4bfe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"312927","textColor2":"231612","textColor4":"3d3330","textColor1":"130907","bgColor":"a8a8a9","hasP3":true},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"You already know Today’s Hits—the playlist that keeps up with the most popular songs in pop, hip-hop, R&B, and more—but you’ve never heard it like this. This month, mashup master Touch Of Funk brings his disco twist to the hits you know and love. \n\n“My mix transforms today’s guilty pop and rap pleasures into shimmering disco gold, fusing the swagger of the modern charts with the lush, feel-good funk of a bygone era,” Touch Of Funk tells Apple Music. “It’s a slick, genre-bending concoction of smooth, groovy earworms you haven’t heard before, yet somehow feel like they’ve always belonged in your life.”\n\nThe result is a mashup of unexpected joy, but with so much disco goodness it’s impossible for Funk to pick a favorite. “I love all the tracks featured, not only because I made them all exclusively for this mix, but because every one has a different groovy element to vibe to,” he says. “Starting off with slower-paced and sensual dance-floor moments like Colombian singer KAROL G blended with the 1980s disco sound of Hi-Gloss, before moving into R&B from Ravyn Lenae mixed with a familiar boogie banger from Cheryl Lynn. We then end with more high-energy tracks like Lady Gaga’s fantastically manic ‘Abracadabra’ reimagined into a disco bop.” Hear it all now, and check back each month for more Today’s Hits mixes.","short":"“Smooth, groovy earworms” featuring Doechii, KAROL G, Tyla, and more."},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/todays-hits-july-2025-dj-mix/1822663652","playParams":{"id":"1822663652","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822663652/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1817817429","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1817817429?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751895741067,"RTCI":0}}},"1822827244":{"id":"1822827244","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822827244?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-06-27","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lizzo/472949623","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a1/b4/a5/a1b4a546-9f53-f6b7-feb0-26a3ec7c8793/878a43aa-70b4-44e6-8cd6-f3cbed254711.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bab2a6","textColor2":"cfb09b","textColor4":"a99080","textColor1":"e5dacb","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d0/78/3e/d0783e37-acd3-4056-de29-244da28f9240/8264035e-3d44-444d-b9d9-6623525de4fa.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"272e2b","textColor2":"1b2112","textColor4":"313932","textColor1":"0e1309","bgColor":"8897b3","hasP3":true}},"name":"MY FACE HURTS FROM SMILING","artistName":"Lizzo","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1c/79/24/1c79249b-701b-8cc0-2582-2a1d282df1b9/075679604262.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"1f1c0d","textColor2":"030302","textColor4":"211d0e","textColor1":"020301","bgColor":"96823d","hasP3":false},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Mixtape","standard":"The singing, rapping, flute-playing polymath spent the three years since 2022’s <i>Special</i> courting unexpected controversy and flirting in social media posts with quitting music entirely. After mostly laying low throughout the turbulence, Lizzo emerged in February 2025 with a rock-inspired new single and an announcement of her fifth album, both titled <i>Love in Real Life</i>. But first, a bit of raucous, freewheeling fun: With three days’ notice in late June, she revealed a surprise 13-track mixtape whose artwork shows the singer grinning from ear to ear and flipping the double bird. The project came together just as spontaneously. “I did this shit in three motherfucking days, bitch!” she crows on “DITTO,” before adding: “You’re welcome!”\n\nFrom the jump, <i>MY FACE HURTS FROM SMILING</i> stands in stark contrast to the posi-vibes-only pop-rap that skyrocketed the 37-year-old singer into the mainstream circa 2019. “Bitch, I’m mad! Bitch, I’m pissed off!” she bellows on intro “CRASHOUT” before letting loose a 35-minute barrage of blistering, boisterous trap music. But her formidable Southern rap skills come as no surprise to those who heard her unofficial TikTok remix of PLUTO and YKNIECE’s 2025 viral hit “WHIM WHAMIEE,” which appears here as the rowdy “YITTY ON YO TITTYS (FREESTYLE).”\n\nOver grimy, bouncy beats from the likes of Zaytoven and Tay Keith, Lizzo sounds like she’s having more fun than she’s had in years: firing shots at the haters, turning up with her girls, and interpolating trap throwbacks. (“NEW MISTAKES” is likely the only song of 2025 to interpolate both Boosie Badazz and “Für Elise.”) She’s joined by Doja Cat on “STILL CAN’T FUH” and SZA on “IRL” for a pair of bratty bad-bitch symposiums. “I can’t let no comment section ever fuck with my vibe,” she spits on the latter duet. It’s a lesson to take heed of for 2025: Why be mad when you can throw ass and touch grass instead?","short":"A freewheeling surprise mixtape that leans into boisterous trap
