could think of, besting Garth Brooks’ previous stats for single-week sales and ultimately becoming the year’s best-selling album. Back then, you couldn’t leave the house without hearing the silky harmonies of the Orlando, Florida, five-piece. Narratively, “I Want It That Way” may have been a bit of a head-scratcher, but its earworm chorus embedded itself into the fabric of pop history, while the Latin-tinged lushness of “Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely” soundtracked the collective ache of millions of teenage yearners. A quarter of a century later, <i>Millennium</i> still stands as one of the best-selling albums of all time. Here the boys (er, men?) don their vintage white getups to recreate the cover photo for the anniversary edition, which features remastered versions of the original tracklist, a handful of demos and live recordings, and one new single, “Hey.”","short":"A 25th-anniversary reissue with demos and live

Can't Swim","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“I found myself in a new world of touring and chaos so quickly that I built a separation between myself as Josh and Barry on stage to deal with it,” Josh Mainnie tells Apple Music. “But when it came to writing this album, I knew it had to be for me as Josh. I wanted to bring those two parts back together.”\n\nAs DJ and producer Barry Can’t Swim, Mainnie has had a meteoric rise since the release of his 2021 debut EP <i>Amor Fati</i> and 2023 album <i>When Will We Land?</i>. Blending emotive melody with thumping electronic percussion and expertly chopped vocal samples, Mainnie’s signature has become a feel-good dance-floor communion.\n\nFor his second album, <i>Loner</i>, Mainnie turns inwards to explore his rise to fame, moving from the spoken-word soul-searching of “The Person You’d Like to Be” to the trance synths of “About to Begin” and soulful horn fanfares of “Childhood,” all while keeping his introspection anchored in the joy that has become his calling card.\n\n“Once I started, it all came together quickly,” he says. “It’s an authentic side of me that needed to come out for everyone to hear.” Read on for Mainnie’s in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track.\n\n<b>“The Person You’d Like to Be”</b>\n“This is a collaboration with a good friend of mine, the poet Séamus. I’ve known him since university and always wanted to work together. We finally managed to make it happen and he came up with these lyrics that set the tone for the themes of the album really well. It’s about having two voices of conflict and duality—myself and Barry. I then put his vocal through an AI voice generator, so that it starts AI and becomes more and more Séamus as the track continues.”\n\n<b>“Different”</b>\n“I loved the lyric of ‘everybody different’ in this vocal sample I found and ended up building the entire track around it. I was also really inspired by the track ‘Church of Nonsense’ by Daniele Papini, which I’ve played in DJ sets for years, since it has this incredible rising bassline that I wanted to emulate here. It’s minimalistic and the synth that comes in two thirds of the way through wasn’t originally in there but when I brought it to rehearsals for the live show my keys player Jakes [UK producer/artist Hannah Jacobs] added it in and so it stayed!”\n\n<b>“Kimpton” (with O’Flynn)</b>\n“‘Kimpton’ is one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album. I wasn’t sure where to begin, so I went round to [London DJ/producer] O’Flynn’s house, since he lives around the corner from me, and we just began mucking about. He started this tune himself when he was on tour with Bonobo and I liked the vocal a lot but wanted to simplify it and build a different chord progression and texture around it. It developed as a jigsaw from there and I’m really happy with how it turned out.”\n\n<b>“All My Friends”</b>\n“This is another early one, probably written in November or December 2023. I found the vocal sample first and loved it so much I decided to keep it as it was and not overdo it with too much extra instrumentation. I’m generally quite quick in the studio, playing most of the instrumentation live myself and working on ideas until they’re finished rather than multiple things at once.”\n\n<b>“About to Begin”</b>\n“I wrote this while I was staying at my parents’ house on the day I delivered the finished album. I didn’t have anything to do, so I decided to quickly make something fresh to keep busy. I picked this vocal from a sample pack and it sounded pretty cheesy and American but I liked the energy of it. I put it through an AI voice generator, which added another persona to the themes of the record, and it’s since become a huge tune in the live show, so it had to go on the record.”\n\n<b>“Still Riding”</b>\n“This is one of my favorite tunes I’ve made and it was written a few years ago when I got back from touring in America for the first time. It’s been finished for a while but I couldn’t get the Kali Uchis vocal sample cleared until I think my own profile got bigger and they finally agreed. I’m so pleased because I love the track.”\n\n<b>“Cars Pass by Like Childhood Sweethearts”</b>\n“I was listening to a lot of [French DJ/producer] Pepe Bradock and his tune ‘Deep Burnt’ when I made this because I love the warmth and texture of the strings loop he uses. I started writing strings inspired by that and built all the other parts around it. It was originally just an instrumental but I spent a couple of weeks digging through samples and eventually found this vocal that works really well with the vibe of the tune.”\n\n<b>“Machine Noise for a Quiet Daydream” (feat. Séamus)</b>\n“This is a good place to have a bit of breathing space in the record. Séamus just sent me a poem he was working on one day, and I thought I’d see how it sounded on an instrumental I’d already finished and I loved the energy of it. I didn’t do much else, and none of it is really in time but I fell in love with his delivery on the phone voice note he sent through, so that’s what we kept.”\n\n<b>“Like It’s Part of the Dance”</b>\n“I don’t often write tracks for my live show but this is one that found its way into the show very quickly. I’ve been playing it for six or seven months and it always goes off—even when I sent the album to friends and the people I trust, a lot of people picked it out as their favorite. It’s all about the build and drop and energy.”\n\n<b>“Childhood”</b>\n“I was in Lisbon on holiday with my partner and I smuggled a keyboard along with me, which is what I ended up writing this one on. I started with the horns and vocal sample and then it was a case of finding a chord progression that led nicely into a sense of release. I felt like the track had a feeling of innocence to it, which comes with childhood, hence the title.”\n\n<b>“Marriage”</b>\n“‘Marriage’ ended up having a strange Russian doll process to it, since I wrote the vocal and had someone sing it live over an existing instrumental. Then I realized I didn’t like that instrumental, so I changed it before realizing I didn’t like the vocal anymore either so had to change that too! We got there in the end, and I love that it’s built around the lyric ‘My heart is closed for the season.’”\n\n<b>“Wandering Mt. Moon”</b>\n“I was in the toilet of an Indian restaurant in Brick Lane and suddenly heard the strings part of an amazing Bollywood track play through the speakers. I immediately Shazamed it and once I got home, wrote my own part inspired by it. It’s definitely become one of my favorites on the album since it’s such a lush and textured ending to have. The title also comes from a Game Boy <i>Pokémon</i> level, where you’re exploring a dark cave with only a ray of light, which is what this felt like to me.”","short":"The DJ/producer reveals “an

follows her debut at the Grand Ole Opry, touring North America in a humble RV with her family, and winning a life-threatening battle with sepsis. <i>Neon Cowgirl</i> doubles down on the Canadian-born New Zealand songwriter’s soulful brand of country music, opening with dramatic strings and reverb on “Foolish Heart” as her smoMldering and then booming voice rings out with loving shades of Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison. Recorded live with producer Steven Schram (Crowded House, Paul Kelly), the album also features guest turns from NZ icon Neil Finn, Americana duo The Secret Sisters, and Oklahoma songwriter JD McPherson. “Borrow My Boots” enlists country singers Ashley McBryde and Shelly Fairchild and guitar prodigy Grace Bowers, tapping into the swagger of both roadhouse blues and girl-group soul. “Salvation Mountain” casually name-checks Willie Nelson, with whom Neilson has duetted and toured, and “Heartbreak City, USA” nods to the rollicking Bakersfield sound. Sprinkling welcome vocal and lyric grit into these romantic tunes, Neilson showcases a wider stylistic range while confirming the depth and power of her pipes.","short":"The powerhouse country-soul singer confirms her range."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7d/b2/af/7db2af7e-803c-7b65-61e4-0072409dc7dc/113473.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bdc2c8","textColor2":"edc4a7","textColor4":"c5ab99","textColor1":"e3e0e1","bgColor":"264962","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/neon-cowgirl/1802233614","playParams":{"id":"1802233614","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0UYIyJARIGSYHTXhEmzA39"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802233614/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"264938841","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/264938841?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752207263328,"RTCI":0}}},"1802918329":{"id":"1802918329","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1802918329?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wet-leg/1569685293","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f6/c3/02/f6c302d5-2749-424a-9e7b-a214d36e1d2b/Job7e416199-d051-4124-84f6-95a57daab096-189395628-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370845359_2108391931-Time1743587291747.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","2a1e12"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"b0a58a"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"2b2a22","textColor2":"2a1e12","textColor4":"413a2e","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b0a58a","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6d/4a/8e/6d4a8e39-c4b5-d6d6-a070-1de30e9a4483/b0cdeeca-7bb2-407f-a042-7db298bfc52c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b2a8a5","textColor2":"c9cbcb","textColor4":"a4a6a6","textColor1":"dacdca","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/81/fe/56/81fe56e9-1276-df74-7652-ce6aee57bbb2/Job1ea5ce44-7754-4612-af9e-6cdbb57e4155-189395629-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_370845361_2108391932-Time1743588836102.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","382d20"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"b0a58a"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"37332b","textColor2":"382d20","textColor4":"575142","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"b0a58a","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/84/82/87/8482874a-a449-b72d-791c-4a5adb71f0ce/18b4c3ee-c5c6-4144-9669-d4749ef383ea.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d0d3c8","textColor2":"e0e1d3","textColor4":"c5c5b7","textColor1":"edf3e8","bgColor":"5a5347","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/4f/79/10/4f79100c-0da1-f0aa-dd6a-a8cfbb732d22/857407ef-62f6-4c72-9c01-a6a232031ed1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"4d403a","textColor2":"3a2b23","textColor4":"574a44","textColor1":"2e1e16","bgColor":"c8c6cb","hasP3":true}},"name":"moisturizer","artistName":"Wet Leg","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Love, Davina McCall, and making more tunes to play live: Wet Leg’s inspiration for their second album sounds like it came easily, but they had to shift into new territory on <i>moisturizer</i>. Their debut—2022’s <i>Wet Leg</i>—provided 36 minutes of lo-fi hooks, wit, and twentysomething confessions to catapult them into a BRIT- and Grammy-winning swirl of well-deserved hype. After a relentless but enjoyable touring schedule, they decided to escape to a seaside town for two weeks at a time to turn their attention to album number two.\n\n“I think we’re really fortunate we can write in that traditional band setup,” Rhian Teasdale tells Apple Music’s Matt Wilkinson. “When we stopped touring, we were like, ‘OK, what are we going to play when we go on tour again? Let’s make some tunes.’”\n\nSo the band decamped to a house in Southwold, Suffolk and got to work. “There was a kid’s playroom with some LEGO around, so we took the majority of the stuff out and put all of our gear in it,” says guitarist Joshua Mobaraki. “Some days we were like, ‘OK, let’s start at this time and put a shift in.’ And then other times, it was 1 am and all of a sudden we were writing again. It was really cool.”\n\n<i>moisturizer</i> finds the band once again teaming up with producer Dan Carey and repeatedly nailing the perfect three-minute song on 12 tight tracks. They admit they give away more of themselves than they did on <i>Wet Leg</i>. While “catch these fists” has a strong message about reclaiming personal space, they stray into more romantic territory elsewhere. Hester Chambers wrote “don’t speak” for Mobaraki, who’s also her partner, but she subverted the idea. “She wrote me a song from me to her, which is really cheeky,” he says.\n\n“CPR” captures the feeling of infatuation, while “davina mccall” and “11: 21” sum up more secure, longer-term love, which are themes Teasdale had avoided before this album. “I’d never even attempted writing any kind of lyrics that were to do with love,” she says. “I had this rule when I was younger to just not even use the word ‘love.’ I was really hesitant because I felt like there were so many love songs out there. Also, it didn’t feel very authentic. When I was younger, I don’t think I really did know love, so I was just pulling out cliche after cliche.”\n\nOn <i>moisturizer</i>, Wet Leg sound as vital and adventurous as they did on their debut—but there’s a new assurance creeping in too. “Our position as a band is to just constantly be surprised that people still want to listen to it,” says Mobaraki. “I don’t know if the imposter syndrome goes or it’s like you turn it into something else. It’s a way of not being like, ‘Everyone’s telling us that we’re amazing. That means that we are amazing.’ Instead, it’s just like, ‘Huh, let’s do another song. I like that one. Let’s do another one.’ I think we’ve developed and grown and we’re different now. We’re giving ourselves permission to take up space.”","short":"The balm of a second album gives the band “permission to take up

Epilogue (Deluxe)","artistName":"Dean Lewis","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"Eight years after his first single and five after his debut album, <i>The Epilogue</i> marks the end of Dean Lewis’ first era as an artist as well as a significant revelation: “My whole philosophy changed when I realized I spent the last eight years chasing success,” the Sydney-born singer-songwriter tells Apple Music. “I attached my self-worth to the numbers. How the songs are doing, if the shows are selling out, how my TikToks are doing. I fell into that trap. So this album is me saying goodbye to that whole period of my life.” \n\n“Waves” and “Be Alright” were multiplatinum, chart-topping singles that appeared in TV shows and advertisements, got remixed and covered, and earned Lewis a global fanbase, but that isn't the kind of success he's looking for with his third album. “I don’t need a song to go viral, and viral doesn't necessarily even mean it's good,” he says. “Social media gave me a second chance, so, as much as I appreciate it and I’m used to it, I just want to release great songs. Instead of focusing on constantly selling myself, I'm more interested in the stories, the world of the songs.”\n\nIt's those songs and stories that resonate most on <i>The Epilogue</i>. Some are about specific people, like old friends and past lovers. Elsewhere, he draws personal experiences together to tell something broader, but no less meaningful. “I'm writing songs that I want people to hear about my life in the most specific ways,” he says. “People won’t connect to music if it’s just for them, because you can’t only write for other people. It’s got to be about you.” Read on for more insight into select tracks on Lewis’ third album.\n\n<b>“Empire”</b>\n“I wanted it to feel like you're in a cabin on a hill and the wind is hitting it hard. I started with the percussion, the knee tapping. The song is actually about my best friend who I lost my relationship with. She supported me through everything, helping me with my vision, my photos, the TikToks, what song I should release, what style. She gave up so much of her life, and she eventually wanted to go and pursue her own dreams, and I think she felt a bit trapped. So the song is me saying, ‘Go and achieve your dreams on your own, and if the wind ever breaks down your windows, I'll be here to help if you need me.’” \n\n<b>“All Your Lies”</b>\n“It’s about fake friends, about realizing that not everyone has the best intentions, being a little bit too trusting. It's about wanting to just get away and drive into the hills. You don't always realize that not everyone has the best intentions. It’s about a few things—two-faced friends, people that you think are your friends and they're not really. Business things as well. You get taken advantage of, people want to make money from you. It's about a lot of different things in life and wanting to go, ‘I just want to make songs, man. I don't care.’ I'm not a flashy guy. I don't go to events, I don't care about anything like that. I just want to get away and write songs.”\n\n<b>“Memories”</b>\n“It’s also about losing my relationship with my best friend, but it was at a different sort of stage. When you just know it’s kind of done, but you can also look back and say, ‘Wow, we had a great time and these memories are going to stay with me forever. We've gone our separate ways, but I appreciate all that time that we had together.’ It’s a really special one for me.”\n\n<b>“Trust Me Mate”</b>\n“It’s another one of those songs where I combined a bunch of things, including some stuff that had happened to me and one of my brothers. You know that feeling of telling a friend to not give up? With my career, there’s been so many times where you go up and down, go up and down. You don't stay hot forever and you don't stay at the bottom forever. And it's really good to have friends who will say, ‘Hey, it's going to be okay.’ Sometimes that's all you need. For me, so many times in my life, you think negatively about something and then someone will go, ‘Here's the brighter side,’ and I’ll feel better. So that song is really about friendship, hope, and not giving up on yourself or your friends.” \n\n<b>“Clélia's Song\"</b>\n“Clélia was like a sister to my brothers and me. She passed away and I wanted to write a song for her. In the lyrics, I say, ‘You're driving the long way around, I'll see you again sometime.... Pick up, pick up, pick up.’ It’s like, how do you feel? You're lonely. It's just a beautiful song I wanted to write about her and let her know that we're all thinking about her.”\n\n<b>“The Last Bit of Us”</b>\n“I wrote my whole second album about one girl. I think it's hilarious and embarrassing, but it’s the truth. This is me saying, ‘This is the last song I'm going to write about you and about us.’ It was interesting, because I knew it was the last one, and it was a choice. It’s also about the very last time you hug someone and you say goodbye, so I tried to describe that feeling. I’m really proud of the songwriting in this one, especially the way that it builds in the end with this big instrumental crescendo.”\n","short":"“I just want to release great songs,” says Lewis on his

balance of a world so recently turned upside down. God was appointed chief scientist, the shaping force behind universal harmony and nature’s rational order. Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber sought to reflect the divinely ordained relationship between humankind and the rest of creation in music that combined dazzling virtuosity and striking tonal contrasts. \n\nRachel Podger and five companions from Brecon Baroque reveal the depths of Biber’s Violin Sonatas of 1681, not least by bringing a profound spiritual stillness to each work. Listen, for instance, to the “Variatio” from the Sonata No. 2 in D Minor (Track 12), where Podger’s violin exudes calm as it soars and swoops, or to the enchanting interplay of bowed and plucked instruments in the “Passacaglia” from Sonata No. 6 in C minor (Track 26). Even the <i>Sonata representativa</i> (Tracks 16-24), with its playful imitations of animals, gains a meditative quality in the hands of Brecon Baroque’s inspired musicians.","short":"Biber’s colorful music chimes in these joyful, enriching performances."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2e/2b/e6/2e2be65d-056d-20b5-802f-94b1f649de11/723385485254.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c49571","textColor2":"dea27c","textColor4":"b98868","textColor1":"edb387","bgColor":"231e1b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/just-biber/1807000884","playParams":{"id":"1807000884","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807000884/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"79484453","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/79484453?l=en-US"},{"id":"398668387","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/398668387?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752229301552,"RTCI":0}}},"1807345147":{"id":"1807345147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1807345147?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-lake/135067114","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/13/f0/53/13f053d2-a348-8266-c07a-6c278c66b33d/dda55edf-5789-43de-a1b2-74e4b4415650.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"dbd1c8","textColor2":"facab0","textColor4":"dbb49f","textColor1":"fbede3","bgColor":"5d5d5c","hasP3":true}},"name":"Chemistry","artistName":"Chris Lake","contentRating":"clean","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"For Chris Lake, releasing his debut album two decades into his career was worth the wait. “I didn’t really know how to put together an album’s worth of material in an interesting way,” he tells Apple Music. “But that changed in the last few years. I developed more as a musician, and I had the vision for it.” Though the idea of an album once felt distant, the UK-born, LA-based producer had already made his mark through a long run of club and chart successes, from his 2006 breakthrough “Changes” to later hits like “Turn off the Lights,” “Deceiver” (with Green Velvet), and “In the Yuma.” But after wrapping a tour in late 2022, he stepped back to reset. Digging through old demos, he uncovered a melodic side of his sound that had since taken a backseat in his recent work. “I’d kept refining my music to where it became more and more simple and effective,” he says. “I wanted to put more musicality into what I was doing.”\n\nTwo years later, <i>Chemistry</i> is the realization of Lake’s vision. Packed with bright melodies, driving percussion, and magnetic vocal hooks, its 15 tracks show off his expanded range and depth, moving through different textures and moods: house woozy with infatuation (“In My Head”), melancholic UK garage (“Broken Hearts”), warm disco-funk (“Ease My Mind”)—and yes, even a peak-time banger (“Psycho”). \n\nBut the album, at its core, is also about collaboration. Nearly every track features a vocalist or co-producer, reflecting Lake’s desire to learn from the people around him. “I just gravitated toward people that I like and whose music inspires me,” he says. That instinct led to sessions with Bonobo, Amber Mark, Riovaz, longtime collaborator (and wife) Aatig, and more. Most of the songs came together in his home studio, with Lake adapting his process to each artist. “There are so many different ways that songs can come together,” he adds. “I really enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to get the best out of the person I’m working with.” Read on as Lake takes us through <i>Chemistry</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“On & On” (feat. Yael Watchman)</b>\n“I’m obsessed with Yael’s voice. I played a completely different version of this song two years ago at the Hollywood Boulevard show with FISHER, and while I loved that version, it never quite worked the way I wanted. So many people want me to release it, but that’s not the version on the album. I’m going to piss a lot of people off, so I decided, ‘Fuck it, let’s get it out of the way and make it the first track.’”\n\n<b>“Memories” (feat. Nathan Nicholson)</b>\n“This was the last track I finished for the album, but one of the first I sketched out. It’s probably one of the most deceptively clubby records on the project. I’ve played it out a couple times, and it really hits. It was great working with Nathan again—he’s the voice on ‘Summertime Blues,’ the track I released with Sammy Virji.”\n\n<b>“Savana”</b>\n“This one came together pretty quickly. I had a distinct vision, and by the time we got to this later stage in the project, I’d refined the approach of making musical songs with the kind of beats I was into. People seem to really like it, so I’m happy.”\n\n<b>“Reach for You” (feat. MPH)</b>\n“This was a collaboration with MPH and Kelly Lee Owens. This was slightly Frankensteined because it was made in two parts. I wrote a version with Kelly over a completely different backing. I loved her voice, but I felt like I hadn’t done as good a job on the production. Then Myles [MPH] came over, and we started working on a new beat. I brought the vocal over and everything clicked. I showed Kelly and asked if I could continue with it. She said, ‘Go for it.’”\n\n<b>“In My Head” (feat. Amber Mark)</b>\n“This was originally an R&B song—hers. I didn’t write it. I was just captivated by her voice. I heard her demo and was like, ‘I have to have that vocal. Give it to me.’ I put the beat together, and it ended up being quite a big song in my sets. It’s so catchy, really simple.”\n\n<b>“Favourite One” (feat. Black Lotus)</b>\n“I just love how quirky this song is. It was a hell of a vibe working on this with Black Lotus, who’s a new artist. I had to recruit Alexis [Roberts] for the vocals. She recorded them in her spare bedroom in Atlanta on what she described as a very crappy mic and setup. But when you’ve got a voice like hers, she could honestly record using a cup and a piece of string, and it would sound great.”\n\n<b>“Watch the Sunrise” (feat. Aatig)</b>\n“That’s my wife, so it’s an in-house tune. We’ve been married for a long time, and I’ve worked with her for years, so it felt quite natural. I love the vibe. She always sounds fantastic. This is the only one she’s officially featured on, but she’s also singing on ‘Broken Hearts’ and ‘Psycho.’”\n\n<b>“Ease My Mind” (feat. Abel Balder)</b>\n“So much work went into this one. Abel’s a fantastic artist, and I think this was a great example of working really hard to meet in the middle in an interesting way. It’s not a heavy club track—it’s a vibe. We performed it live in this room for a couple of days, refining it until we committed to recording it. I think the middle-eight of that song, with the guitar solo and keys, might be my favorite micro-section of the whole album.”\n\n<b>“Broken Hearts”</b>\n\"Aatig and I initially wrote this as an interlude, but it ended up becoming a little bit more. I got this delay unit, and when I pipe my electric piano through it, it creates all these really weird, spaced-out textures. The sound at the very beginning of this song was created with that delay pedal. I called her to the studio, played the notes, and she was like, ‘Turn the mic on!’ She just laid it all down. MPH did additional production and helped me with the drums.”\n\n<b>“Round After Round” (feat. Riovaz)</b>\n“I was introduced to Riovaz through my label. I had him over, and the whole thing came together in two hours, start to finish. We were really cooking on this song. I don’t think he normally sounds the way he does on here, so it was great fun. I’d never worked with an artist like him before: a bit emo—he sings like he’s got tortured emotions, you know what I mean? I love it. I really felt the vocal and the vibe, and what you hear is pretty much what the demo was like.”\n\n<b>“Chemistry” (feat. Vera Blue)</b>\n“Similar story to ‘Broken Hearts.’ I sat down with Vera and her writing partner Nat, started playing some notes on the keyboard, and she just poured this whole idea out. Then I had the idea to make her vocal the lead. I chopped it up, and the song fell into place. It was a pleasure working with someone that’s got vocals as strong as hers. She’s unbelievable.”\n\n<b>“Psycho”</b>\n“The simplest one on the album. It’s like the automatic reflex of Chris Lake: If you told me to shut my eyes and make a beat, this is the kind of thing I’d make. An absolute ripper. There aren’t any chords—it’s actually kind of the betrayal of everything I described in my manifesto for the album, but I felt like it had a place. It’s that juxtaposition, that walloper that reminds you that this is a dance producer’s album.”\n\n<b>“Jungle” (feat. Black Lotus)</b>\n“It’s all about the vocals. Black Lotus wrote the original, and I immediately had a vision. I completely flipped the concept and put together that wild lead at the drop. I’m really proud of this one. I don’t know where those ideas and chords came from, but I love it. It’s just odd.”\n\n<b>“Satisfy Me”</b>\n“I worked on this one for fucking ages, but I’m so glad I persevered. It’s probably the most Frankenstein song on the album. The vocal is actually two people from two different songs, written in completely separate sessions. The first demo was this slow, trip-hop kind of song sent to me by Tim Randolph and Christian Alexander. I pitched and sped it up, and there was this one vocal bit—‘Do you satisfy me?’—that was so magical, but I couldn’t make it into a full concept. Later, I was in a session with Leven Kali, a great friend who I’ve worked with a lot, and he played me a demo he’d written called ‘Satisfied.’ I was like, ‘That’s really cool, and also quite close to what I’ve been doing.’ I asked if I could completely bastardize it and he was like, ‘Yeah, sure.’ So, I chopped up his vocal, pitched it up, and combined it with Christian’s. I swear, when I played them together, they sounded like the same singer—they fit perfectly, lyrically and timing-wise. I’ve never had a situation like that before. Complete coincidence.”\n\n<b>“Falling” (feat. Bonobo & Alexis Roberts)</b>\n“This is another one I did loads of work on. I wrote the verses with HAYLA, who’s become quite big over the last few years doing songs with deadmau5 and Kaskade and John Summit. I went through nearly 10 versions of this track but never nailed the production. Then I ended up in the studio with Bonobo. I hadn’t played it for anyone yet because it was really personal, but I believed he’d get the vision. I played it for him, and he said, ‘I’ve got an idea’ and went from there. We brought Alexis in to sing the vocal and everything fell into place. It was an absolute joy to work with one of my musical heroes.”","short":"A star producer’s full-length debut, two decades in the

Yips","artistName":"Petey USA","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Petey USA may have amassed millions of followers as a TikTok funnyman, but music has always been his most sincere passion, and with his third album, <i>The Yips</i>, he presents his most serious statement to date: an ambitious concept album about people who’ve lost all concept of their ambitions. “The yips” is sports-speak for freezing up in a clutch situation, but Petey isn’t so much singing about professional athletes in a slump as ordinary people struggling to make it through the day, envisioning each song as a discrete conversation between desperate people gathered around the tables in a fictitious dive bar called The Yips.\n\nWith his teenage hero Chris Walla behind the boards, Petey’s Midwestern emo roots blossom into heart-tugging heartland-rock anthems (“Breathing the Same Air,” “Model Train Town”) and soul-baring synth-pop manifestos (“As Two People

But on the title track, he invites fellow members of the low-self-esteem club to dance their blues away in a flurry of cowbell-clanking, sax-squawking Talking Heads funk, while the climactic “God Is the Gray” is a triumphant surge of pop-punk poetry that suggests Springsteen crashing the second stage at Warped Tour.","short":"The TikTok star bares his soul on a heartland-emo concept album.

For <i>THIS IS FOR</i>, TWICE’s fourth full-length album since their 2015 debut, the third-generation squad slides into a comparatively subdued cool-girl persona to explore overlapping themes of female empowerment and romantic frustration, artfully navigating the space between K-pop’s “girl crush” and “bubblegum pop” false binary. \n\nThe cool-girl persona is especially on display in <i>THIS IS FOR</i>’s title track, a high-energy song that starts with a chuckle and a shout-out: “This is for all my ladies who don’t get hyped enough/If you’ve been done wrong, then this your song, so turn it up.” TWICE makes room for feelings of otherness on “THIS IS FOR” before using the synth-pop bop “MARS” to expand on the theme: “Do you ever feel like/You don’t belong in the world?” The tale of tested confidence continues in the rolling rhythms of “G.O.A.T.,” a subunit song that has members Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung comparing themselves to a phoenix rising from the ashes in the aftermath of a breakup: “Got me on a roll, yeah, I breathe fire/Try to bring me low but I go higher.”\n\nReleased in TWICE’s 10th year as a K-pop group and in the immediate aftermath of the JYP Entertainment squad’s successful contributions to the <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> soundtrack, <i>THIS IS FOR</i> sees the group also preparing for their This Is For world tour. The 14-track, mostly English-language album includes five subunit songs that fit particularly well into a high-energy set list as an opportunity for non-participating members to rest. In addition to “G.O.A.T.,” they include “BATTITUDE” (Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, and Mina), “DAT AHH DAT OOH” (Sana, Jihyo, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu), “LET LOVE GO” (Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, and Tzuyu), and “TALK” (Nayeon and Jihyo).\n","short":"The veteran K-pop group celebrates female empowerment on their fourth LP."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b3/a8/e2/b3a8e208-ebd1-831e-4d00-2bdddd99f54a/8809928955766_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"3d3334","textColor2":"151115","textColor4":"43393b","textColor1":"0d090c","bgColor":"fbddd3","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/this-is-for/1813490993","playParams":{"id":"1813490993","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/02dUOPB3MtmV5fawzaZiq6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813490993/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1203816887","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1203816887?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752235241202,"RTCI":0}}},"1814841818":{"id":"1814841818","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814841818?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-02","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/reysha-rami/1623937519","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"T0M F00LERY","artistName":"REYSHA RAMI","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/95/10/ed/9510edbd-0f48-bd50-cb7c-eb784299a774/764656330019_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b6b3b6","textColor2":"ccb7a3","textColor4":"a59584","textColor1":"e1dce0","bgColor":"0a0d0c","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/t0m-f00lery/1814841818","playParams":{"id":"1814841818","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4WqZSEHtRLlhJAV6bVKr6p"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814841818/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1623937519","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1623937519?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752207476731,"RTCI":0}}},"1815356726":{"id":"1815356726","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815356726?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/giv%C4%93on/1070668868","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3b/01/4d/3b014d3b-aa9e-ab20-6ad5-1cf3784d7761/826b1caf-e619-4051-8dbe-f082ce6a4aac.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"252729","textColor2":"1a1716","textColor4":"313132","textColor1":"0b0b0a","bgColor":"8f99a2","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/5d/4d/dc5d4dd6-0b40-93cf-1afd-477700f7ae1f/e45e8440-a18e-4f98-80ff-6c3c7f490a78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cac8c2","textColor2":"d5c7be","textColor4":"b7aca5","textColor1":"edeae3","bgColor":"404140","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/03/67/ce03679a-3014-0a03-b9f5-155cbd7c8c60/720700c5-eb2a-41a4-8f7d-0b2ea945c2ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"27292a","textColor2":"201f1f","textColor4":"373839","textColor1":"0c0c0b","bgColor":"939da5","hasP3":true}},"name":"BELOVED","artistName":"GIVĒON","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"GIVĒON has been working on his craft these past few years, and the fruits of his labor are resplendent on <i>BELOVED</i>, a love letter to R&B that has the timeless feel of ’70s soul sides while possessing a distinctly 21st-century sensibility. “There’s that element where I’m doing this because it’s in my DNA,” GIVĒON tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I didn’t choose music. I tell people all the time, ‘I didn’t choose it. It chose me.’ But I care about rhythm and blues. It means a lot to me.”\n\n<i>BELOVED</i> starts off in a big way: Surging strings create a high-drama atmosphere that sets the mood for “MUD,” a poison-pen letter to an ex that’s given a cushion by GIVĒON's supple croon and the sonic splendor surrounding it. Not only does the song send a message to the person who did GIVĒON wrong, it lets listeners know that the singer-songwriter has leveled up in the years since his last album, 2022’s <i>Give or Take</i>. \n\n“I think I grew as an artist exponentially,” he says. “There’s a leap in my knowing how to articulate what I feel, or what I have a taste for.” On <i>BELOVED</i>, GIVĒON showcases his evolution in a way that’s dazzling without being showy—the longing “I CAN TELL” frames his vulnerable vocals in rhythmic snaps and dry horns, while on the slow-burning “KEEPER” he fully throws himself into his plea to a lover he’s missing. Much of <i>BELOVED</i> came out of GIVĒON and his collaborators jamming in the studio, and its grooves possess the sort of loose yet locked-in feel that characterizes the most sublime soul. \n\nDespite growing up in Southern California, GIVĒON was raised on East Coast R&B, and he studied records by the likes of Teddy Pendergrass, as well as the productions of Philadelphia soul architects Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, to get properly inspired for <i>BELOVED</i>. He also got better at fully tuning in to his artistic desires and curiosity. “I know what artist I am,” he says. “I understand my process. I understand how to evolve as well.”\n","short":"“I understand how to evolve”: The R&B star crafts a love letter to the genre."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/03/4c/47034c71-831b-61a2-8cc2-502f927834bd/196873057620.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c7ccc5","textColor2":"d9c7a3","textColor4":"b7ad8f","textColor1":"edeee6","bgColor":"2d4243","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/beloved/1815356726","playParams":{"id":"1815356726","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7pcBXbl1g198PNAxt44bHQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815356726/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1070668868","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1070668868?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752246355040,"RTCI":0}}},"1815520672":{"id":"1815520672","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815520672?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/paloma-mami/1401778806","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0a/04/f4/0a04f4f9-6230-473c-ec83-2b28fe340e5c/7a63e201-6d14-4c72-8e7b-0688444a4196.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"1e1f20","textColor2":"111011","textColor4":"282a2c","textColor1":"050302","bgColor":"869196","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5f/68/17/5f68173d-3db7-da99-2bf5-aa7faa39eee0/ebf379a0-f1ba-42c2-9133-2c91611431cb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"1b191a","textColor2":"030303","textColor4":"1b1a1b","textColor1":"030202","bgColor":"7c777c","hasP3":true}},"name":"CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA","artistName":"Paloma Mami","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"“I have a lot of artistry inside me that I hadn’t been able to explore,” Paloma Mami tells Apple Music about making her second full-length album, <i>CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA</i>. “Since I was creating this whole album, I finally got the opportunity to really experiment.” In following up 2021’s <i>Sueños de Dalí</i>, which paired her with producers like El Guincho and Hit-Boy, the Chilean American sought to take greater creative control of her musical process. That meant, in part, limiting those who had access to her while recording, including her own family members. “I was completely alone, by myself, just working, and only had my engineer,” she says. “It was a big moment for me to know myself and see who I am, really.”\n\nAs such, a clearer picture of Paloma Mami comes into focus across these 11 engaging tracks. Though she playfully indulges in a doll-like visual transformation on the cover, her <i>CÓDiGOS DE MUÑEKA</i> is anything but superficial. Here, she pushes female empowerment in numerous ways, be it in reevaluating relationships as on “SíNTOMAS DE SOLTERA” or exhibiting a command of sex positivity on “Mi KAMA.” “I spent some time searching, really, looking for my femininity,” she says. “This whole muñeca aesthetic and concept comes from being a powerful girl in general.”\n\nAs she decodes and redefines her personal definition of girl code throughout, she chooses collaborators who can live up to her expectations. This comes through in the sultry Rauw Alejandro duet “LA FREAK” as well as the more emotionally resonant “SiNKRONiZAMOS” with DannyLux. “I never had the chance to know myself,” she says, looking back on the process. “I was just in a whole other world before.

She was like, ‘You and Mick Jagger would be so legendary.’ And she pressed about it for so long.”\n\nThe song is called “Empty Chairs” and is a unique classic-rock/Afrobeats hybrid—just one of a wealth of disparate vibes Burna explores across <i>No Sign of Weakness</i>, an album whose title implies a plan for continued dominance while asserting a pronounced lack of fear in his musical practice. “I was trying to make something that I haven’t made before,” Burna says. “In a sense that I’m trying to do the opposite of everything I’ve ever done—in a good way. I just feel like right now, I’m big enough to do it. I’m big enough to enjoy it now and just do everything that I would want to listen to, if it wasn’t me.”\n\nBut it <i>is</i> him who fans the world over have been adding to playlists, requesting in DJ sets, and buying tickets to see season after season since at least 2018’s “Ye” took the Afrobeats world by storm. His practice has expanded with every release since, and on <i>No Sign of Weakness</i> we get dalliances with hip-hop (“No Sign of Weakness”), country (“Change Your Mind”), house (“Kabiyesi”), baile funk (“TaTaTa”), lovers rock (“Sweet Love”), and R&B (“Come Gimme”), complemented by linkups with Travis Scott, Stromae, and Shaboozey, an artist Burna actually feels a tribal connection to. \n\n“So, here’s the thing: I didn’t know he was actually Nigerian,” Burna says, “Before he came, they would tell me, ‘Hey, you know this guy’s Nigerian, right?’ But when [people] say someone is Nigerian, it’s like they probably have one drop of Nigerian blood somewhere. With Shaboozey, his name is Chibueze, and I’m speaking pidgin, and he understands that.”\n\nYou’d not need to be kin to the singer and MC to understand the Burna Boy lifestyle, specifically in regard to reaping the financial benefits of his genius (“Bundle by Bundle”), his undying love for the ganja leaf (“28 grams”), or even his amusement at making local tabloids (“Dem Dey”). He’s happy to tell you all about it—including how he deals with it all—as he does on album mission statement “No Panic.” “Basically, I’m saying, every day I’ve done all this, but I don’t panic—I won’t panic,” he says. “It’s some shit that they say in the streets in Nigeria as well. It’s like, ‘Dem go whine you, but no panic.’ It means they’ll play with you, but don’t panic.”\n","short":"Eight albums in, the African Giant seems only to be getting stronger."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/25/a5/b6/25a5b6bf-c1ef-81de-4ddf-e5a8bfd1383d/075679623539.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"baa68e","textColor2":"d3bd9b","textColor4":"b1987c","textColor1":"deceb1","bgColor":"2c0404","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-sign-of-weakness/1815620619","playParams":{"id":"1815620619","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/35EMM8QwKJ2qXmoUJnUSNf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815620619/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"591899010","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/591899010?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752246631769,"RTCI":0}}},"1815944154":{"id":"1815944154","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815944154?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":16,"genreNames":["Classical","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=2355964-196586923","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bb/22/af/bb22af67-a4a3-7ab1-54ec-eb42e0d7be4e/f27568c6-7a0c-4baf-8e9e-69f9470788f6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7cddb","textColor2":"a5ccf8","textColor4":"8fb3e0","textColor1":"ebedf2","bgColor":"384e81","hasP3":true}},"name":"Sommernachtskonzert 2025 / Summer Night Concert 2025","artistName":"Vienna Philharmonic & Tugan Sokhiev","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Set within the grounds of Vienna’s dazzling Schönbrunn Palace and hosted by the Vienna Philharmonic, the annual al fresco Summer Night Concert attracts a live audience of tens of thousands, and a broadcast audience of millions.\n\nEach June the orchestra is joined by a different conductor, who leads them and a guest star artist or two in a program of well-known classical works. For the 2025 Summer Night Concert, Tugan Sokhiev took to the podium, alongside tenor Piotr Beczała and the Vienna Boys Choir. “Sharing music with so many thousands of people creates a very joyful and vibrant atmosphere,” he tells Apple Music Classical, “and the setting, with the stage in the gardens of the beautiful and historic Schönbrunn Palace, is magical.” \n\nThis year, the concert began with a poignant memorial to the Graz tragedy, with the “Air” from J.S. Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 3, followed by warm-hearted performances of Puccini’s “Nessum Dorma,” extracts from Bizet’s <i>Carmen</i>, the “Hungarian March” from Berlioz’s <i>Damnation of Faust</i>, and many more favorites. The encore, Johann Strauss II’s waltz <i>Wiener Blut</i> (<i>Vienna Blood</i>), has, over the years, become something of a tradition. “It’s a fantastic to have the opportunity to be able to return to these pieces,” says Sokhiev. “Even though they are very well-known classics, they are not necessarily pieces we perform in concert very frequently. That’s why it’s wonderful to go back to them.\n\n“I can’t say exactly which music the crowd loved the most—I hope that they loved all of it!” he continues. “I must say that there were huge and well-deserved cheers for our wonderful soloist, Piotr Beczała, so I’m sure for many people his performances were some of the highlights. But, the whole evening was a series of highlights!”","short":"Tugan Sokhiev on the Summer Night Concert’s “joyful atmosphere.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/64/82/55/64825565-fdee-ea35-194f-82e7d67f056e/196873097534.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"7c8cb7","textColor2":"ec525b","textColor4":"c54650","textColor1":"91abdb","bgColor":"2b1325","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sommernachtskonzert-2025-summer-night-concert-2025/1815944154","playParams":{"id":"1815944154","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815944154/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2355964","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2355964?l=en-US"},{"id":"196586923","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/196586923?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752224732523,"RTCI":0}}},"1816191685":{"id":"1816191685","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816191685?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-moving-stills/1336058757","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Half Moon Bay - EP","artistName":"The Moving Stills","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a2/7b/eb/a27bebf1-fd90-8922-4dc0-4cb3510cd467/347577.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b0b2b0","textColor2":"d6b8b2","textColor4":"b29993","textColor1":"d4d8d7","bgColor":"221c18","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/half-moon-bay-ep/1816191685","playParams":{"id":"1816191685","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816191685/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1336058757","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1336058757?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752219023844,"RTCI":0}}},"1816313639":{"id":"1816313639","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816313639?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=627567-682277-1819765935","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/b1/c2/4d/b1c24d7d-2c8f-0088-a878-72cd90cdbb03/Jobee9d0735-c614-4692-9110-4b11dc8d2be8-194261636-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380557960_2195018158-Time1749229399419.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","171316"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"292229"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"45393f","textColor2":"171316","textColor4":"443a40","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"292229","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a0/70/8b/a0708be3-c4bc-8c69-afe6-9f5ae8a27f1c/59d6db6f-e5d3-4041-adc1-b00143010344.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor4":"a9a9a9","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/39/df/8e/39df8e65-3e87-252c-06c2-25000e6e8f52/Jobce3a525d-c5fc-4ea9-8d58-0a5bb13f2a4a-194261637-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_380557961_2195018159-Time1749230505067.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","45292b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"292229"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"443b41","textColor2":"45292b","textColor4":"694b50","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"292229","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6a/8c/8e/6a8c8e6a-d755-1a60-6e66-68641482849a/b5cdecb0-1ce9-4e56-a2e9-0232a5c2d4c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbc1cc","textColor2":"e4d0d0","textColor4":"c8b5b6","textColor1":"fbdfec","bgColor":"5b474d","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5f/32/d7/5f32d712-2145-e437-0435-3a7d8ba234f8/129c961e-ad8d-4f33-8bf8-03ed2cc676bc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor2":"cccccc","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"f0f0f0","bgColor":"060606","hasP3":true}},"name":"Let God Sort Em Out","artistName":"Clipse, Pusha T & Malice","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"“It is because of my faith that I’m sitting here with you right now,” Malice tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden about reforming Clipse with Pusha T. “That is the only reason that I get to sit here with my brother.” Brethren both in blood and in song, the Thorntons made up one of the most vital rap duos of the 2000s. Signed back in the day to The Neptunes’ Star Trak imprint, the Virginia Beach pair spat intricate yet gratifying narco bars over cutting-edge production.\n\nYet despite dropping three essential, consequential albums over the course of that decade, an apparent crisis of Christian values appeared to prompt a creative split. Not long after the late-2009 release of <i>Til the Casket Drops</i>, a hiatus commenced as both members explored solo careers with distinct differences. Pusha T continued his coke-rap ascent within the GOOD Music roster, while Malice purposefully rebranded himself a Christian artist under the subtly adjusted moniker No Malice. \n\nThankfully, their bond could never be broken. A momentous 2019 appearance by both brothers on Kanye West’s <i>Jesus Is King</i> suggested a greater musical reconciliation. Yet it took the return of longtime collaborator Pharrell Williams, a core architect of the classic Clipse sound, to produce <i>Let God Sort Em Out</i>, their first new album in some 15 years. “It just felt like a real good family setting,” Malice says of the studio sessions in Paris that yielded these tracks. “The creative aspect, the same as it’s always been from yay high.”\n\n“We get caught up in the feeling of certain records,” Pusha T adds. “You got to realize that before we even get to the process of hooks and writing, man, we’re so entranced by the beat.” Considering the triumphant sound of Pharrell’s production on the first single, “Ace Trumpets,” it’s hard not to believe the sincerity of that statement.\n\nReunited at last, their chemistry feels as potent as ever beginning with “The Birds Don’t Sing” where, with a little help from John Legend, they pay respect to their departed parents with their respective verses. “The framework of the song was my last conversation with my mom and his last conversation with my dad,” Pusha T says. “It was therapeutic, but it was the hardest record to make. That’s why it actually starts the album.”\n\nNotorious for taking out his foes with acutely pointed bars, Pusha T once again wields his surgical summer skill set with incisive precision on “So Be It Pt. II.” It’s little wonder they invited the like-minded Kendrick Lamar to join in on the fun with a euphorically acrimonious verse on “Chains & Whips.” And while the album boasts a handful of choice rap features by everyone from Neptunes superfan Tyler, The Creator to Griselda affiliate Stove God Cooks, one of the biggest moments comes from an artist who preceded and inspired Clipse. \n\n“I was like, ‘Man, this, this piece right here is made for Nas,’” Pusha T says of the title track’s guest appearance, adding that the Queensbridge legend was originally meant to rap on his 2022 solo album, <i>It’s Almost Dry</i>. “His excitement was through the roof.” For Malice, it was his younger sibling’s enthusiasm towards the new music that lit a proverbial fire underneath him. “It just reminds me of how it was when we started,” he says. “We ain’t felt like this in a while.” \n\nThat feeling comes through in a major way with every single verse from the rejuvenated elder brother, slipping a stunning blend of religious imagery and key memories into tracks like “P.O.V.” and “So Far Ahead.” Aglow with gospel vibes and synth swells, the latter of these succinctly sums up the spiritual dilemma that kept Malice away from Clipse for so long with one crucial insular line: “I done been both Mason Bethas.”\n\n“It is in the suffering when you start looking for answers,” he says. “Nothing is going to help you until you get into that word of God. That’s where I get all my peace from.”","short":"Malice and Pusha T return. “We ain’t felt like this in a while.”"},"artwork":{"width":2500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/70/a6/9a/70a69aeb-3bcf-968b-de75-f3cb44a89e1b/1605.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2500,"textColor3":"d5c7c3","textColor2":"f9dae6","textColor4":"ddc0cc","textColor1":"efe3dc","bgColor":"6f5762","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-god-sort-em-out/1816313639","playParams":{"id":"1816313639","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/17ScNnJ0lSWajodZaRpHdQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816313639/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"627567","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/627567?l=en-US"},{"id":"682277","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/682277?l=en-US"},{"id":"1819765935","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1819765935?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752243095532,"RTCI":0}}},"1816954407":{"id":"1816954407","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816954407?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tobi/1308518856","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/83/88/db/8388db1a-b45c-e467-ebbb-89c9a65225ac/72e99dd7-b27a-4c7b-a8e7-eba06e9a980f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c6b4a8","textColor2":"cdc4cd","textColor4":"b1a9b6","textColor1":"e8d3bb","bgColor":"3f3a5a","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/08/5d/92/085d92c9-a30b-e144-bf81-c30b94591c67/5d267e8a-0f2d-4d43-8fec-6edce7aea3f9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d6c4b8","textColor2":"d4e5f7","textColor4":"b9c8da","textColor1":"f8e0cd","bgColor":"4d5466","hasP3":true}},"name":"ELEMENTS Vol. 2","artistName":"TOBi","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Five years later, a follow-up of rap, soul, and Afrobeats from the Toronto artist."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/93/86/f8/9386f8b1-d19b-9bab-0437-dfe528a9172f/5034644721965.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cfd1cf","textColor2":"f8efe1","textColor4":"d3cfc9","textColor1":"f3f2e9","bgColor":"404d69","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/elements-vol-2/1816954407","playParams":{"id":"1816954407","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0Ign7x9QgYkG3sDMZhMAqY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816954407/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1308518856","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1308518856?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752239139944,"RTCI":0}}},"1817150963":{"id":"1817150963","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817150963?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Techno"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/khabiar/1764534096","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Ok, I'm Here -

The fact that that has become a wild idea is crazy, but I think it’s clear what the right and wrong sides of this are.”\n\nOn <i>For the People</i>, Dropkick Murphys deliver a call to populism that’s very different from the counterfeit version offered by right-wing politicians. Leadoff track “Who’ll Stand With Us?” addresses unjust deportations, widespread layoffs, and the revocation of benefits while special guests The Scratch, The Mary Wallopers, and English songwriter/activist Billy Bragg join Dropkick’s chorus of righteous voices. Elsewhere, personal lyrics about vocalist Ken Casey’s childhood (“Streetlights,” “Chesterfields and Aftershave”) mingle with tributes to Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge (“The Big Man”) and departed Pogues leader Shane MacGowan (“One Last Goodbye”). Last but not least, longtime Dropkicks singer Al Barr returns on “The Vultures Circle High.” Below, Brennan comments on each track. \n\n<b>“Who'll Stand With Us?”</b>\n“It’s not often that we play songs live before we’ve recorded them or released them, but this was one where we started playing it live pretty much as soon as it was written. It’s a good lead-off too, because Ken did a great job with the lyrics, describing the current state of things from the perspective of a bunch of guys like us—blue-collar, family, working-class guys. This album has a lot of different sounding stuff for us, but this is a tried-and-true Dropkick Murphys song, and it addresses the current state of things in a very Ken Casey/Dropkick Murphys way.” \n\n<b>“Longshot” (feat. The Scratch)</b>\n“Somewhere around 2007, when we put out our album <i>The Meanest of Times</i>, we came across this 'State of Massachusetts'-style, sinister Irish type of song, and ‘Longshot’ falls into that category. Our banjo player, Jeff DaRosa, came up with that opening banjo riff, and we just kind of expounded from there. Lyrically, it’s a song about people who underestimate you, and you working your way through those people and those inner thoughts that tell you that you can’t achieve whatever it is you're looking to achieve. Our buddies The Scratch, from Dublin, laid down some vocal tracks for the song in Copenhagen when we were on tour together.” \n\n<b>“The Big Man”</b>\n“We did a bit of touring with Pennywise over the last few years, and we had known the guys casually for a while. You hear so many stories about [Pennywise guitarist] Fletcher [Dragge] and the destruction that happens in the wake of that man, but when we started hanging with him, we realized he’s such a fucking gentleman, so sweet and nice. And yeah, he likes to cause a ruckus now and again. I’ve seen him pick up [Warped Tour founder] Kevin Lyman in the middle of an interview on Warped Tour and throw him in a pond. I’ve seen him shoot BBs at people. We had a blast writing this song about him.” \n\n<b>“Chesterfields and Aftershave”</b>\n“Some of my favorite Dropkick songs are the ones where Ken talks about his childhood, because he's got so many interesting stories from that time. This one is about him spending time with his grandfather as a kid. He held his grandfather in such high regard. I never had the pleasure of meeting him, unfortunately, but there's a couple of Dropkick songs written about him. ‘Boys on the Docks’ is one of them. But this is a song where Ken is writing about being raised by his grandfather, essentially. Ken will be the first person to tell you that he was a bit of a foul ball as a kid. To have a role model like his grandfather set him on the right path was clearly so important for him, and that is not lost on him.” \n\n<b>“Bury the Bones” (feat. The Mary Wallopers)</b>\n“I wrote the music for ‘Bury the Bones’ during the first bit of the pandemic. I was sitting in my apartment, so I started recording shit, just stockpiling stuff. Often, I’ll do a demo like that and send it to Ken, and he’ll start writing lyrics to it. Sometimes he’ll have me swap stuff around, like put the chorus in a different place, but with this one, he called me and said, ‘Meet me at the practice space, and we’ll put vocals down.’ That was the summer of 2020, so we just hung on to it. We knew we wanted the Hendy brothers from The Mary Wallopers to do some stuff on this record, and they nailed the shit out of this. Their voices sound so great on it. I started working on it so long ago that to see it finally come out is a personal triumph.” \n\n<b>“Kids Games”</b>\n“We don’t often write on the road because it’s difficult, but this was one where Ken had an idea for a melody line and some words, so he and I got together and started working on it. I love The Replacements, so I snuck a little bit of a Westerberg-y type of thing into the intro riff. I love doing little Easter egg tip-of-the-caps and things like that throughout the songs—you can find them everywhere. It’s obviously not a standard Dropkicks song, but it’s very Dropkick Murphys in the way that it goes, and I think it came out great.” \n\n<b>“Sooner Kill ’Em First”</b>\n“Our producer, Ted Hutt, was in Boston with us when we were kind of working on new stuff. We were just fucking around, and the music for this song appeared. We thought it sounded very much like <i>Red Roses for Me</i>/<i>Rum Sodomy & The Lash</i>-era Pogues. Interestingly, the lyrics used to be on a different song. But the vibe of the music for that song made the lyrics seem way too serious. So, we took those lyrics, tweaked them into a more jovial Irish song, and it became a completely different thing that we felt fit better.” \n\n<b>“Fiending for the Lies”</b>\n“This song and the next one are my favorite songs on the album. I had been listening to a ton of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds when I wrote this one, and I put this demo together that pretty much sounds like what you hear on the album, with a couple of small differences. When I sent it to Ken, I said, ‘I know this is not anything close to what we’re looking for.’ But he liked it, so we started working on it. It’s very hard-hitting and aggressive, and it sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. I can’t wait to do it live. I’m pushing for us to open with it, but I think Ken’s going to be like, ‘Chill out, man.’”\n\n<b>“Streetlights”</b>\n“This is my favorite song on the record, hands down. Musically, we’d done two years of touring with The Scratch from Dublin, and between seeing them every night and listening to their albums, I started gaining a lot of inspiration. So, I made a demo of ‘Streetlights’ that was based on a Scratch song called ‘Old Dog,’ but I ended up getting blasted off in another direction. Lyrically, it’s from a part of Ken’s life that he’s not really touched on before, a very personal story from his childhood. I was so over the moon when I heard the finished version. It’s probably my favorite thing we’ve done in a decade.” \n\n<b>“School Days Over” (feat. Billy Bragg)</b>\n“About a week before we went into the studio to record this album, I texted Ken and Ted, our producer, and I sent them the Luke Kelly version of the song. It’s a song by Ewan MacColl, who also wrote ‘Dirty Old Town.’ He’s the father of Kirsty McColl, who sang ‘Fairytale of New York’ with The Pogues. Not only is it a great song with a great melody, but it seems apropos for the times. So, we started working on it. The idea of asking Billy to sing on it came up when he came to Boston two St. Patrick’s Days ago and played a few songs with us. They say don’t meet your heroes, but in Billy’s case, meet him. He’s the sweetest guy you’ve ever met in your life. He told us it was his favorite Ewan McColl song, and he agreed to do it. When we heard his vocal on this for the first time, we were in awe. His ‘There is Power in a Union’ has been our intro music for 23 years now, so to meet him and get to work with him is unbelievable.” \n\n<b>“The Vultures Circle High” (feat. Al Barr)</b>\n“When I did the demo of ‘Streetlights’ originally, it had an Irish-y outro. The idea was, I would ditch my guitar and grab the accordion, and we would do this instrumental outro. I played it for my wife, and she said, ‘That’s a separate song.’ And I said, ‘What do you know?’ Then I brought it to practice and everyone went, ‘It’s a different song.’ So, now my wife is taking credit for this because we took that part and expanded it into another song. It turned out to have that sinister Irish thing, kind of like ‘Longshot.’ And the opportunity to get Al on there was wonderful because we did so many years of touring together, and now he’s home doing his family thing. But first and foremost, people need to know that he’s very much a part of the family, no matter what is going on at home.” \n\n<b>“One Last Goodbye ‘Tribute to Shane’” (feat. The Scratch)\n“The Pogues are so important to Dropkick Murphys, obviously. When I was 14, there was a young English teacher at my high school who was like 22 or 23, fresh out of college. I wasn’t the best student, but this guy realized I was big into music. I was already playing in bands and was way into traditional Irish music in addition to punk and hardcore. He showed up with a dubbed cassette of The Pogues’ <i>If I Should Fall from Grace with God</i>, and my fucking life changed forever. I was obsessed. These days, I could have a doctorate in Pogues’ history. More people texted me about Shane passing away than they did on my birthday. The outro is an Irish traditional song called ‘Mo Ghile Mear,’ which is what they played at Shane’s funeral when they wheeled his casket out of the church to go to the cemetery. The Scratch guys are singing in Irish, and it just worked out perfectly.”</b>","short":"Celtic-punk populism: “I think everyone should just be good to everyone else.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2e/25/d4/2e25d4eb-1707-38e2-8c3a-a63eba6f04ee/5400863189563_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c0dade","textColor2":"fccfd1","textColor4":"d0b9bd","textColor1":"e8f8fa","bgColor":"21616d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-the-people/1817396310","playParams":{"id":"1817396310","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2M3u2dW8uCvgzAIAqjPop5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817396310/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"2928220","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/2928220?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752235162839,"RTCI":0}}},"1817468418":{"id":"1817468418","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817468418?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":27,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Electronic"],"releaseDate":"2014-07-25","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/avicii/298496035","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/88/13/8f/88138fa5-dd30-c82b-76aa-cd20ca2d0ce7/899d4259-4d3e-4613-a234-6df7edfb8817.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e1bdc5","textColor2":"fccc7c","textColor4":"e2b473","textColor1":"fad7e2","bgColor":"7c5752","hasP3":true}},"name":"Avicii at Tomorrowland Belgium 2014, MainStage (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Avicii","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"In 2014, Avicii was perhaps the superstar DJ that best personified the 2010s EDM boom—a master at using the melodic power and emotional complexities of pop to push at the boundaries of dance music.

Yet while it’s become common to hear today’s Spanish-language stars contribute to the globalization of this particular style with singles or album one-offs, Kapo marks one of the few to fully embrace and embed himself within the genre. Starting with his breakout hit “OHNANA,” the rising Colombian star’s come-up in the 12 months preceding <i>POR SI ALGUIEN NOS ESCUCHA</i> featured a string of tracks like “ALOH ALOH” and “UWAIE” that reinforced that first impression. All three of those feature here alongside other like-minded tracks like “RUFF” and “NO CRY.” Previously released collabs “CARITA ANGELIKAL” with Rels B and “ILY” with Myke Towers join new ones like the bilingual “X TI” with Feid. No stranger to genre-hopping, Manuel Turizo fits right in alongside Kapo on the breezy yet pulsating “ANTES,” as does Colombian dancehall act Lion Fiah on the more reggae-informed “MEDICINA.”","short":"Colombia’s rising Afrobeats star embraces his genre."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/58/ad/40/58ad40ef-6190-e466-47c7-cb8ba1b413b6/196873288499.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cd640b","textColor2":"f25a02","textColor4":"c64c05","textColor1":"fc7809","bgColor":"131614","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/por-si-alguien-nos-escucha/1821064917","playParams":{"id":"1821064917","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0t4IoD2ctBdtx0zRYc8lFe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821064917/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1573761238","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1573761238?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752244128041,"RTCI":0}}},"1821337734":{"id":"1821337734","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821337734?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Americana"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/madeline-edwards/1127961228","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"FRUIT","artistName":"Madeline Edwards","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/b5/83/1d/b5831dad-7fb4-85b3-a94d-6375ead61f22/199316137477_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d5dddc","textColor2":"f0fae3","textColor4":"d0dfcc","textColor1":"f6f7f7","bgColor":"517270","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fruit/1821337734","playParams":{"id":"1821337734","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7jYMtcyKX4IGZzAxeBWEkS"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821337734/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1127961228","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1127961228?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752219066142,"RTCI":0}}},"1821405081":{"id":"1821405081","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821405081?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":3,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-09","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1184859670-1184859883","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Grind Revisited -

La Demora","artistName":"Natanael Cano","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Natanael Cano deserves credit not only for pioneering and popularizing corridos tumbados, but also for using his platform to uplift numerous other young stars well into the 2020s. Yet his diehard fans know the trap aesthetic that often defines or otherwise informs the themes behind his hit songs also carries over to his work outside of música mexicana. On genre-crossed projects like <i>NataKong</i> and <i>Trap Tumbado</i>, he proved himself a formidable rapper able to contend credibly with the Spanish-language spitters he shares space with on the Latin charts. It is within that same rubric of creative freedom that <i>Porque La Demora</i> arises. \n\nCano’s most diverse offering to date, the 16-track effort evolves over the course of its runtime, pivoting into spaces both familiar and uncharted for the superstar artist. “Working in urban styles—rap, trap, or reggaetón—feels like a blast,” Cano tells Apple Music. “Mostly because a producer sends you a beat, and if you dig it, the song’s already halfway done. First, you have to like the beat, the rest just flows. Pure freestyle, bar after bar.” The opening pair finds him comfortable in two hip-hop modes, the title track more boom-bap than the modernity of “Como Es.” Not content to stay in any specific space here for too long, he briefly transitions toward the tropical with frequent collaborator Gabito Ballesteros on “Perlas Negras.”\n\nThe album has no shortage of high-wattage guest stars, but despite his reputation for bringing along other artists, Cano claims he does not exactly keep up to speed on what his peers are putting out. \"Not listening to other artists helps me a lot,\" he says. \"I’m obsessed with music, but I don’t consume it. I only play my own albums. That keeps me focused on creating something that’s 100 percent me: something pure.\"\n\nHe reaches for reggaetón on cuts like “Blancanieves” and “Polos Opuestos,” supplying both verses and hooks in true hit-making fashion. That continues through “Bellakita,” a standout team-up with the rising Victor Mendivil that calls back to that genre’s rugged roots. The album’s second half adds even more features to the mix, with traperos-turned-popular stars Myke Towers and Eladio Carrión coming through for “El Juez” and the comparatively more clubby “Como Tony,” respectively. Chilean sensation FloyyMenor lends his reggaetonero skills to “Mary Poppins” while longtime cohort Badguychapo gets his bars off for “Cholo.”\n\nBy the time the strobe lights hit on closer “VLV,” one might be forgiven for briefly forgetting Cano’s primary infamy in the corridos space. The closest <i>Porque La Demora</i> even gets to that side of his work comes on “Primero Muerto,” a piano-driven ballad that marks the most accessible moment on the entire album. Its narrative of pill-popping numbness and achingly romantic longing places him squarely in the pop zeitgeist, where he assuredly belongs.\n\nMore importantly, Cano has found a way of working that can keep him in the game for the long haul. “Over these past five or six years, I’ve definitely ridden that emotional rollercoaster, the highs and lows of making music, but you never stay in one place; it always shifts,” he says. “Today, I can say this is the first album I’ve genuinely enjoyed making, even though a year ago, I would’ve said I’d lost my hunger. All I needed was a break, and it reminded me that I still have plenty to give, starting with this album and many more to come.”\n","short":"A genre-hopping trip from the corridos kingpin: “I’m obsessed with music.”"},"artwork":{"width":3200,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/76/67/9f7667e0-4211-fc4e-3803-143acec11283/5021732853547.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3200,"textColor3":"bebebe","textColor2":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"a4a4a4","textColor1":"eeeeee","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/porque-la-demora/1822615159","playParams":{"id":"1822615159","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7EIuLIjhFQAGPvq6L5gBvZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822615159/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1406984792","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1406984792?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752235414048,"RTCI":0}}},"1822663652":{"id":"1822663652","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822663652?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":25,"genreNames":["Pop","Music","R&B/Soul","Disco"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/touch-of-funk/1817817429","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/e7/a4/abe7a490-acf8-05bb-af79-c296c7ce4318/d6a9859f-c69c-4630-a66d-2bdacd446b4c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"4f4d4e","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"58524c","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/95/f7/2a/95f72afd-8726-06f2-40c6-0a97a3ec5f9b/cf59838c-ffcf-4fff-a2c0-62528d87bf01.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"4f4f4f","textColor2":"2e2a29","textColor4":"575352","textColor1":"252525","bgColor":"f8f8f8","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/b0/d0/83b0d0af-45b6-9d7b-bd80-3f7966476fef/52e4b2b3-596b-42aa-8fbf-9677d87e26e4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"433f41","textColor2":"333333","textColor4":"5a5a5a","textColor1":"161214","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/59/b5/0659b5e9-ee74-1605-3847-c68eeaa33788/efc67f90-b9d0-4cc9-bd0f-624182d41ab3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3d393b","textColor2":"1f1c1d","textColor4":"4a4748","textColor1":"0e0a0d","bgColor":"f6f6f6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/21/fb/fe/21fbfe84-bb8d-d905-9af6-802b322a36e3/8a6ad81f-be0d-4991-b8a2-aa8669ab8796.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":3840,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"0b0a09","textColor4":"2f2e2e","textColor1":"080808","bgColor":"bfbfbf","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/3d/23/9f/3d239fda-9edc-1839-9b03-d6a8abd9b9e3/74e4c9fb-f336-4cc6-b177-dfae3d28989c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"423e3f","textColor2":"303030","textColor4":"535353","textColor1":"1a1617","bgColor":"e0e0e0","hasP3":true}},"name":"Today's Hits: July 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Touch Of Funk","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"You already know Today’s Hits—the playlist that keeps up with the most popular songs in pop, hip-hop, R&B, and more—but you’ve never heard it like this. This month, mashup master Touch Of Funk brings his disco twist to the hits you know and love. \n\n“My mix transforms today’s guilty pop and rap pleasures into shimmering disco gold, fusing the swagger of the modern charts with the lush, feel-good funk of a bygone era,” Touch Of Funk tells Apple Music. “It’s a slick, genre-bending concoction of smooth, groovy earworms you haven’t heard before, yet somehow feel like they’ve always belonged in your life.”\n\nThe result is a mashup of unexpected joy, but with so much disco goodness it’s impossible for Funk to pick a favorite. “I love all the tracks featured, not only because I made them all exclusively for this mix, but because every one has a different groovy element to vibe to,” he says. “Starting off with slower-paced and sensual dance-floor moments like Colombian singer KAROL G blended with the 1980s disco sound of Hi-Gloss, before moving into R&B from Ravyn Lenae mixed with a familiar boogie banger from Cheryl Lynn. We then end with more high-energy tracks like Lady Gaga’s fantastically manic ‘Abracadabra’ reimagined into a disco bop.” Hear it all now, and check back each month for more Today’s Hits mixes.","short":"“Smooth, groovy earworms” featuring Doechii, KAROL G, Tyla, and more."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5d/ae/e9/5daee98f-03fa-c584-4777-082204ac7cdc/5d780618-26c7-48c5-a590-d397acda4bfe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"312927","textColor2":"231612","textColor4":"3d3330","textColor1":"130907","bgColor":"a8a8a9","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/todays-hits-july-2025-dj-mix/1822663652","playParams":{"id":"1822663652","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822663652/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1817817429","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1817817429?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751988929743,"RTCI":0}}},"1822665060":{"id":"1822665060","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822665060?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Latin","Music","Música Mexicana"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-03","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1434810911-1546012648","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/44/64/d7/4464d736-4a1f-7ebf-095e-84ac8fba4cb8/611dcff6-13a2-42bc-bcf2-d540868731fc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbc2b2","textColor2":"e5d3a9","textColor4":"bdb290","textColor1":"e2e8d4","bgColor":"1e2d2a","hasP3":true}},"name":"PISTEANDO DESDE LOS ANGELES (En Vivo)","artistName":"Codiciado & Edgardo Nuñez","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","short":"Two corridos faves join forces in a live setting."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d7/03/0f/d7030ff0-7029-d1ff-3d13-ae2a0d9ee5e6/5021732854704.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"bfbdb7","textColor2":"d1c048","textColor4":"ae9f3e","textColor1":"e6e5df","bgColor":"261d17","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pisteando-desde-los-angeles-en-vivo/1822665060","playParams":{"id":"1822665060","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3QbPa15debwncYYRMvb1hL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822665060/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1434810911","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1434810911?l=en-US"},{"id":"1546012648","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1546012648?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1751827217279,"RTCI":0}}},"1822666383":{"id":"1822666383","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822666383?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":7,"genreNames":["Afrobeats","Music","African"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-11","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/odeal/1221904128","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bb/37/6f/bb376f58-9a74-f29f-bec7-e42f07023a59/7d39416d-c293-4e49-86ef-88f7dd5ed075.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b5d089","textColor2":"c8dbf4","textColor4":"abbeca","textColor1":"d6f3a3","bgColor":"354724","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ac/b1/55/acb155eb-b32f-4b59-4d0e-fd13253e9180/efc2973c-e633-42af-bede-e03ac5b26bf2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4c981","textColor2":"f6e07c","textColor4":"d4c570","textColor1":"f6e692","bgColor":"4d573e","hasP3":true}},"name":"The Summer That Saved Me","artistName":"Odeal","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New EP","standard":"After a childhood spent living across Europe, British Nigerian singer Odeal moved back to London in 2017, putting a stop to a phase of his life that had been largely defined by moving between countries and experiencing life’s joys and fluctuations from several locales. “I think what makes my music special is where the inspiration comes from,” Odeal tells Apple Music. “That shift—from being constantly exposed to the world to being limited—shaped the way I saw things and the way I made music.” Yet putting roots back down in London didn’t dull his sense of wonder and craft. \n\nSince 2017’s <i>New Time<i>, the singer has been making music that pays homage to the sweeping confessions and lilting melodic underpinning of neo-R&B influences within Afropop. In characteristic Odeal fashion, <i>The Summer That Saved Me<i> contends with the dynamics of modern romance, adding an unavoidable sense of cosmopolitanism to the mix. The aptly titled “London Summers” affectionately references the communal nature of his home’s warmer months. It all works in service of an intention to celebrate a recently renewed zest for life: “This summer was the first time I really had the freedom to move how I wanted—to go wherever, connect with different versions of myself, and just live,” he says. “This is a project about what it feels like to finally have that access to explore, to feel, and to be free, and every song on it is an extension of that energy.” Below, Odeal walks us through <i>The Summer That Saved Me<i>, track by track. \n\n<b>“Miami” (feat. Leon Thomas)</b>\n“‘Miami’ captures the beginning and the end of a certain moment in summer. It’s about someone I met out there [on my travels]. The first half of the song describes the moment we met: that infatuation and that spark. But the other half reflects what they gave to me: their presence and their honesty. It’s like they became my therapist without even knowing it.”\n\n<b>“London Summers”</b>\n“Summer in London brings out the best in people. There’s this collective mood shift. You see smiles, music in the air, parks packed, and a kind of joy that feels rare and real. This project has the feel of a summer spent around the world, but this track brings it home. It highlights London and how the city lights up when the sun comes out.”\n\n<b>“My Heart”</b>\n“While ‘London Summers’ and ‘Miami’ take a broader, more cinematic approach, capturing locations, energy, and movement, this song narrows the focus down to a single scene. It’s intimate, emotional, and raw. It’s that intense attraction, that heart-pulling moment where logic goes out the window. You’re just letting your heart take control because it still remembers.”\n\n<b>“Obi’s Interlude”</b>\n“This is the most vulnerable point in the project. Obi is what my mum calls me, and in Igbo, it means ‘heart.’ This track is me speaking from that place. No mask, no performance. Just me. It’s a moment where I’m trying to love with my full chest, trying to reach someone who’s been hurt, who’s scared, who keeps pulling away. There’s something painful about offering something real and still not being let in. Like there’s something deeper trying to stop two people from connecting.”\n\n<b>“Monster Boys”</b>\n“‘Monster Boys’ taps into that playful, confident energy. The delivery is light but intentional, and it brings that nostalgic energy of those older Odeal records into the present. It comes right after ‘Obi’s Interlude,’ which is heavy and vulnerable, so this track lifts the mood entirely, but it’s still part of the same journey. The chase isn’t just emotional; there’s also that sweet, exciting side when things start to feel like they could work.”\n\n<b>“Patience”</b>\n“It’s about learning to appreciate someone who’s taking their time—a woman who’s slow and intentional with how she moves. At first, it frustrated me. I wanted things to happen quickly, just to dive in. But over time, I started to understand and admire her patience. She’s careful, she’s grounded, and she’s not rushing into something just because it feels good at the moment. In the chorus, I refer to her as Delilah, drawing from the biblical story. Delilah made Samson change his ways and made him do things he wouldn’t normally do. In the same way, this woman’s patience made me slow down and rethink how I move.“\n\n<b>“In the Chair”</b>\n“It captures the tension between love and absence, the heartbreak of being far from someone who once felt like home. I’ve been moving, traveling the world, chasing purpose, but in doing so, I lost touch with someone I deeply cared for. This song is me finally owning up to that. I wasn’t present when it mattered most, and maybe that absence made her feel like I didn’t deserve her love. The painful part is that I still need it. I still believe in it.”</i></i></i></i></i></i>","short":"Odeal breaks new ground: “This is about how it feels to finally

likely one you wouldn’t be able to get into. Just look at who showed up to pay homage: The album has features from Lil Wayne, Cardi B, Fridayy, Meek Mill, Sexyy Red, Quavo, G Herbo, YTB Fatt, and Polo G, and an increasingly rare appearance from Cash Money Records impresario Bryan “Birdman” Williams, who pops up just to talk shit between a few Rob49 verses (“Get the Picture,” “JetWifi”). Artists—as well as fans—love Rob49, and not just for his impossible-to-see-coming runaway smash “WTHELLY.” \n\nThe MC has plenty to offer, and he offers plenty of it across <i>Let Me Fly</i>’s 22 tracks. There are songs for war (“Get the Picture,” “Supposedly,” “On Sight”), for celebrating (“BLOUSIN,” “High or What”), for repenting (“Hear Me Momma”), for those in need of motivation (“Pick Your Poison,” “Widebody”), for women who think he’s sexy (“So Sexyy,” “I Swear to God,” “Tell Nobody”), for the dawgs locked away (“Where I’m From”), and a few for day-one Rob49 fans (“Wassam Baby,” “Off Dat Drank”). He’s got an authentic New Orleans accent and a voice with the kind of bass young men used to emulate when they wanted to sound cool over the phone. And to be fair, Rob49 does sound cool. And unbothered. And like someone you wouldn’t want to piss off. Basically, he is the rap superstar archetype. \n","short":"Twenty-two tracks to let us know exactly “WTHELLY” talking about."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/9c/71/40/9c7140d4-3b94-57a3-6b6b-61be6a58342c/25UMGIM82678.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cb4e48","textColor2":"e36562","textColor4":"be5351","textColor1":"f35e58","bgColor":"2c0b0b","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-me-fly-deluxe/1822864598","playParams":{"id":"1822864598","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/16fOEIiwZ9ic2JIL7PI6u7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822864598/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1503242655","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1503242655?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752247041045,"RTCI":0}}},"1822876919":{"id":"1822876919","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822876919?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dustin-lynch/493220807","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ce/af/e8/ceafe83b-370f-a74c-0d08-728f77d91df9/Jobfb29af06-e820-4920-9f82-da2436a18335-196410831-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384663082_2235033771-Time1751494325987.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2732,"textColor3":"2f323f","textColor2":"151616","textColor4":"353741","textColor1":"0e0f13","bgColor":"b5bdef","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/5b/aa/7c/5baa7c08-e374-1ad7-9d61-2ccf40a8a47f/Job6babcbb9-8c0f-4497-9904-207a257b6597-196410832-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384663081_2235033770-Time1751495391344.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"30323f","textColor2":"0c0e12","textColor4":"30323f","textColor1":"0c0e12","bgColor":"bec3f1","hasP3":false}},"name":"Club Set Remixes - EP","artistName":"Dustin Lynch","artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/1f/7d/e11f7dce-fbbe-3a6e-2115-97e3ab61d881/4099964190229.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"2e2f3a","textColor2":"131318","textColor4":"363744","textColor1":"09090c","bgColor":"c1c7f4","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/club-set-remixes-ep/1822876919","playParams":{"id":"1822876919","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822876919/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"493220807","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/493220807?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752218995518,"RTCI":0}}},"1822933221":{"id":"1822933221","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822933221?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/super-junior/284066214","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Super Junior25 - The 12th Album","artistName":"SUPER JUNIOR","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When SUPER JUNIOR’s “Sorry, Sorry” hit the pop-sphere in 2009, the dance track unlocked a new level of international recognition for the group and the broader K-pop industry, especially across Asia.

production duo LNDN DRGS, Bay Area-hailing MC Larry June is motivation in motion—a lifestyle salesman committed to telling tales rife with bike rides and unabashed organic living. June’s chemistry with celebrated beatsmith Cardo Got Wings (Travis Scott, Baby Keem, and Playboi Carti), however, has proven over the course of four projects to be something else altogether. Cardo, to be clear, has served as go-to producer for a bevy of popular MCs, but there’s an undeniable synergy that surfaces in his work with June. Or as Uncle Herm says on project opener, it adds “a guaranteed slight edge.”\n\nIn tow on the duo’s fifth outing together are Bay Area legends E-40 (“Ya Feel Me”) and Richie Rich (“Until Night Comes”), Cactus Jack label melody specialist Don Toliver (“100 Bags”), and one-time Cashout Boyz standouts Payroll Giovanni and HBK. They, like June, appreciate what a Cardo Got Wings production can do for your life outlook. Or as June himself raps on “100 Bags,” “I really be livin’ life/I really be thankin’ God/I’m never gon’ switch sides.”","short":"The Bay’s healthiest MC and his right-hand producer are back in the act."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/b8/7f/4e/b87f4ec1-80e2-caa7-9aad-f96f28441ba5/199316159905_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0cdd3","textColor2":"d0d3f1","textColor4":"b6bad1","textColor1":"f1ebf4","bgColor":"4c5253","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/until-night-comes/1823800912","playParams":{"id":"1823800912","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5WJO3pjfQVLaxRl7cqhMmX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823800912/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"675391681","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/675391681?l=en-US"},{"id":"1452652457","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1452652457?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752240999387,"RTCI":0}}},"1823849288":{"id":"1823849288","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823849288?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":34,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2020-07-10","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/juice-wrld/1368733420","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Legends Never Die (5 Year Anniversary Edition)","artistName":"Juice WRLD","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"The rapper’s posthumous album—now with previously unreleased music.","standard":"Surfacing seven months after his tragic passing, Juice WRLD’s 2020 LP, <i>Legends Never Die</i>, is the rare posthumous release to feel like one of an artist’s major statements. The project is indicative of the exciting and fresh direction in which Juice’s music might have headed if he were alive. In both music and lyrics, it stands as the most varied Juice WRLD release, finding him breaking out of his more broad-strokes treatises on romantic angst, drug abuse, and other dark themes and turning toward clearer, detail-oriented autobiography. The video version of the LP includes videos featuring animation, archival footage, and more, providing an epilogue to the music that celebrates Juice’s life and examines his legacy.\n\nHauntingly, the lyrics on <i>Legends Never Die</i> feel more prescient than anything released before his death. On the mournful “Wishing Well,” Juice sings: “Let’s be for real/If it wasn’t for the pills, I wouldn’t be here/But if I keep taking these pills, I won’t be here, yeah/I just told y’all my secret, yeah.” In the computer-animated video for the song—included in this release—the rapper battles his way through a hallucinatory minefield of a world where gravity is suspended and threatening emojis chase and crowd him. The uncanny clarity of lyrics in songs like these points up the major difference between <i>Legends Never Die</i> and Juice’s formative releases: Having developed his character based on himself, he is often reacting to fame directly on these songs, sketching out an explicit road map for his anxiety and existential despair. (See also his snapshot of a self-destructive night in London on the explicit emo homage “Man of The Year”).\n\nAs on the previous Juice WRLD release, 2019’s <i>Death Race For Love</i>, the young star also carves out a fair amount of new musical ground for himself in these songs, seemingly pushing away from being pigeonholed merely as a rapper. Amid the expected emo-trap anthems, the record’s singles find him venturing into more explicitly Top 40–oriented territory than ever before—specifically, the inspirational, Marshmello-featuring EDM-rock track “Come & Go.” There is also a bittersweet trap-pop ballad with Halsey, “Life’s a Mess,” dramatizing two flawed people attempting to find common ground to support each other.\n"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f9/18/13/f91813af-ff0b-1c02-06a9-9903e2a46366/25UMGIM87588.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"e3c587","textColor2":"f0cda0","textColor4":"d8b78a","textColor1":"fedf9b","bgColor":"7b5e34","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/legends-never-die-5-year-anniversary-edition/1823849288","playParams":{"id":"1823849288","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823849288/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1368733420","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1368733420?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752243847531,"RTCI":0}}},"1823971227":{"id":"1823971227","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823971227?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-08","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/public-enemy/36954","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Black

ninth album is a good reminder to anyone, especially those engaged in rigorous activity: <i>Breathe</i>. “Exercise is a great form of stress relief and helps achieve balance, both physically and mentally,” the Dutch trance pioneer tells Apple Music. <i>Breathe</i> is a guest-packed, 51-track shot of caffeine, and he includes a number of its tracks in his Apple Music Fitness Mix. “I designed this mix to not only inspire others to get into regular exercise, but also to double as a proper soundtrack for those workout sessions,” he says. “It immediately gives a kick of energy, setting the mood, and only rises in tempo and intensity—a great way for those exercising to push themselves to the limit.”\n\nBy the end of the set, “‘Late at Night,’ by Lilly Palmer and Maddix, has that drive that helps achieve that last set or round when fatigue has kicked in,” van Buuren says. “I also love ‘Taking Back Control’ by Adam Beyer. It comes in at that moment in a session where the first bit of tiredness bubbles up and, consequently, when the mind starts thinking about perhaps cutting a session short. This track—in sound and title—does an amazing job of replenishing the energy and motivation, and pulling focus back to the goal.”\n","short":"The trance icon mixes a set for athletes “to push themselves to the limit.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2f/e9/23/2fe9231e-4c10-a0bf-b04b-d763c401b8a5/ab4525a6-0e4b-4c0b-a229-296342d41fbd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"262727","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"2c2d2d","textColor1":"0e0d0d","bgColor":"898d8c","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-july-2025-dj-mix/1824311105","playParams":{"id":"1824311105","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824311105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"17976294","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/17976294?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752228866315,"RTCI":0}}},"1824319062":{"id":"1824319062","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824319062?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-04","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jid/282841404","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bc/8c/c9/bc8cc96f-dbaa-1b7c-3882-2152aaa0b238/Job2432bd4d-a593-4ad3-be23-39b62a4b4ee3-196979811-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385740102_2243698221-Time1752082358118.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","211b17"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"2b2625"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"23201e","textColor2":"211b17","textColor4":"3a332e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"2b2625","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/6c/b4/36/6cb436b5-99d8-140e-8ee6-bd84194a4282/9677a3a4-7b86-4e18-aef2-d1de77dd7733.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bdc0c5","textColor2":"f1d4bc","textColor4":"c4ad99","textColor1":"e8ecf2","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4c/de/7a/4cde7a1e-aaaa-4f70-4842-977802c87869/Jobcb07a849-93ef-48aa-9921-5a90c5160ded-196979812-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385740101_2243698220-Time1752084130233.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"33312f","textColor2":"2f2824","textColor4":"4f4945","textColor1":"0b0a09","bgColor":"d1ccca","hasP3":false},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/02/a4/75/02a4759e-a93a-7788-f9bd-e1effa0894c6/30c932bf-ca03-4e64-9d8c-1252a6e737d9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"24211f","textColor2":"060504","textColor4":"24211f","textColor1":"060504","bgColor":"9e928b","hasP3":true}},"name":"GDLU (Preluxe) -

Also present: the holy rolling themes and unmistakable vocal twang that speak to her childhood growing up in Nashville and imbue her lively narratives with a streak of gritty Americana, demonstrated to full effect on tracks like “CATHEDRAL.” and “YIPPEE-KI-YAY.” \n\nAnd while there are new colors in Kesha’s kaleidoscope—slick house grooves on “LOVE FOREVER.” the mellowed-out electropop sound of “TOO HARD.”—the consistent threads that weave together her past and present make it clear that Kesha has been the architect of her own success all along. With <i>.</i>, she finally gets to claim the credit.","short":"The singer-songwriter luxuriates in liberation on her first indie release."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/26/63/86/2663864b-88eb-4c58-f7f3-b0bd329770b4/5034644820576.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3c2621","textColor2":"180a08","textColor4":"3b2823","textColor1":"1a0706","bgColor":"c7a08f","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/1825083551","playParams":{"id":"1825083551","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6xp0NBjMoWgRHKqYPG5Dl3"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825083551/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"334854763","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/334854763?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752235332549,"RTCI":0}}},"1825497312":{"id":"1825497312","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825497312?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":5,"genreNames":["Reggae","Music","Worldwide"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-01","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/prince-swanny/1211264038","editorialArtwork":{},"name":"Outside -
