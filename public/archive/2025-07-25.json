Wants to Talk About Love?","artistName":"Jade Bird","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When UK-born singer-songwriter Jade Bird was making her 2024 EP <i>Burn the Hard Drive</i>, she didn’t realize she was writing about a breakup that hadn’t happened yet—the one that would involve her fiancé-slash-touring guitarist. <i>Who Wants to Talk About Love?</i>, Bird's third album, is a more conscious processing of that loss. But rather than focus its songs tightly on just that relationship, Bird widens her lens of self-reflection, reckoning with the failed marriages around her (specifically her parents’ and both sets of grandparents’) to better understand where she might’ve gone wrong.\n\nThis personal introspection underscores Bird’s gifts for raw, nakedly honest storytelling. She poses the album’s title as a rhetorical question in “Who Wants,” a look at her family’s poor communication habits in the face of love breaking down. And on “Dreams,” which she wrote the morning after a particularly rough night with her now ex, Bird questions her will to leave a partnership that isn’t working. But in “Glad You Did,” she finds that, in hindsight, it was all for the best. “You let me slip right out your grip,” she sings. “You lost me, gone bit by bit, but I’m so glad you did.”\n","short":"Raw honesty drives the UK singer-songwriter’s post-breakup reckoning."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/79/c6/ca79c6e0-9968-e2fc-dfe4-677b6c9eacbc/198846843285.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"beced6","textColor2":"efc3be","textColor4":"c3adb3","textColor1":"e9ecea","bgColor":"115786","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-wants-to-talk-about-love/1803701071","playParams":{"id":"1803701071","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5jqRoaJWRJjiYTHWhBA6jE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1803701071/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1167712148","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1167712148?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753417906059,"RTCI":0}}},"1804207324":{"id":"1804207324","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1804207324?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/0b/8f/e2/0b8fe28e-d554-85be-2b58-8684c16da522/Job170c3e11-ab6c-4a2f-955a-e87745008174-189595644-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371252715_2111578233-Time1743787197261.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","141c2b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"232e34"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"1f2a3e","textColor2":"141c2b","textColor4":"263755","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"232e34","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ff/03/ec/ff03ec53-ac89-9fe1-09f3-b598381ca317/89afefe9-fc2a-4909-8369-129c93dca949.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c7c2c4","textColor2":"c4e1fc","textColor4":"a4c5e1","textColor1":"f0ddd7","bgColor":"245676","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/63/3e/76/633e7681-7842-7f65-e858-472017fb10b9/Jobd0d5eab5-1c51-42fd-a843-400757784b3e-189595645-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_371252714_2111578232-Time1743789184067.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"1e283b","textColor2":"161e24","textColor4":"27384f","textColor1":"0a0b0c","bgColor":"6a9ef9","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/3e/a9/d3/3ea9d3fa-f610-d7a5-65c2-a643542f1e7a/2dc276e7-4a80-4326-9517-12931c71d016.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"262b31","textColor2":"161614","textColor4":"282e35","textColor1":"14120f","bgColor":"6e8fba","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/indigo-de-souza/1047781911","name":"Precipice","artistName":"Indigo De Souza","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Indie rock songwriter Indigo De Souza finds the deep mysteries of the unknown equal parts intriguing and terrifying on her fourth album, <i>Precipice</i>.

When the group split up in 1974, it seemed unlikely that they’d reunite. Vocalist and ringleader Alice Cooper embarked upon a hugely successful solo career that only hit greater heights after he got sober in the mid-’80s. Then guitarist Glen Buxton, co-writer of Alice megahits “I’m Eighteen,” “School’s Out,” and “Elected,” passed away in 1997 at the age of 49. And yet: Here we are in 2025 with <i>The Revenge of Alice Cooper</i>, the first album written by original members Dennis Dunaway (bass), Neal Smith (drums), Michael Bruce (guitar), and Alice Cooper since 1973’s <i>Muscle of Love</i>. The icing on the cake is “What Happened to You,” a song based around an unreleased recording that features Buxton’s guitar playing.\n\n“These guys are my oldest friends,” Cooper tells Apple Music. “We went to high school together, ran cross-country track together—all before The Beatles came along. We’re part of the generation that went, ‘If The Beatles can be a band, so can we.’”\n\nOver the last several years, Cooper invited Dunaway, Bruce, and Smith to join him in the studio while recording his albums <i>Welcome 2 My Nightmare</i> (2011), <i>Paranormal</i> (2017), and <i>Detroit Stories</i> (2021). “I invited Dennis to play on certain songs, Neal to play on certain songs, and Michael to play on certain songs,” he says. “And we did a couple of songs together on some of the albums. And then, it finally just got to a point where it was like, ‘Why don’t we just do an album?’ The trick was getting Bob Ezrin.”\n\nProducer Bob Ezrin was crucial to the original band’s career, helming such classic Alice Cooper albums as <i>Love It to Death</i> (1971), <i>School’s Out</i> (1972), and <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i> (1973). When he agreed to produce <i>The Revenge of Alice Cooper</i>, the deal was sealed. “None of us knew what to expect at first,” Cooper says. “Then we all walked into the studio, and it was as if 50 years had not gone by. It was the most natural recording I’ve ever done.”\n\nThe first song they wrote together was leadoff track “Black Mamba,” an appropriately slithering cut that underscores Cooper’s longtime relationship with snakes (see the album covers of 1971’s <i>Killer</i>, 1986’s <i>Constrictor</i>, and the snakeskin wallet of <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i>, among others). Cooper then enlisted his friend Robby Krieger of The Doors to play guitar on it. “I couldn’t think of anybody else who could play a song with that kind of slinky, snaky feel to it,” Cooper says. “The background stuff he did on all those mysterious Doors songs like ‘The End’ and ‘When the Music’s Over’ was really, really effective, so I knew nobody could complement ‘Black Mamba’ better. And he absolutely nailed it.”\n\nBuxton’s presence isn’t confined to the guitar track on “What Happened to You.” Album closer “See You on the Other Side” and the swinging lounge tune “What a Syd” are tributes to the late guitarist. “We’re saying, ‘We’ll see you again, we’ll play again,’” Cooper says of the former. As for the latter: “Glen was not one of these guys who could jam with anybody,” Cooper explains. “In fact, the only person I ever heard him jam with was Syd Barrett. And anybody Glen thought was a jerk, he’d say, ‘What a Syd.’ That tells you a little bit about who he was.”\n\nMeanwhile, “Kill the Flies” is a continuation of the group’s 1971 song “Ballad of Dwight Fry,” which extrapolated upon the late actor Dwight Frye’s role as Renfield in the 1931 film <i>Dracula</i>. (Spoiler alert: Renfield ends up in a mental hospital.) “I thought, ‘What would he be doing now?’” Cooper says. “Well, he’s still in the mental institution, and everything is great. He loves it there, except for the flies. That’s his big nemesis in the world. I liked the idea of bringing Dwight back to see what he was doing 50 years later.”\n\nElsewhere, <i>The Revenge of Alice Cooper</i> features serial killers (“One Night Stand”), a tip of the cap to Marlon Brando’s 1953 biker flick <i>The Wild One</i> (“Wild Ones”), and an aspiring artist playing guitar in his mother’s basement for 60 years (“Crap That Gets in the Way of Your Dreams”). “Being in a band is not an easy road,” Cooper says by way of explanation. “Stuff gets in the way. Having to eat, having to work—everything gets in the way of sitting and writing songs. It’s saying artists have to deal with real life too.”\n\nAs for the album’s title? “When we first started, we were always the underdogs,” Cooper says. “People said, ‘This band won’t last more than six months,’ or ‘They got lucky with “I’m Eighteen,” but that’ll be it for them.’ We were so determined to prove everybody wrong that we had 10 Top 20 singles. Fifty years later, the idea is, ‘You mean, there’s more?’”","short":"The band finally gets back together: “None of us knew what to expect.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a2/36/73/a236735e-3033-c05c-e3fe-e3852942020f/4029759203735.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"c9b31d","textColor2":"f8db12","textColor4":"cbb00e","textColor1":"f6e024","bgColor":"160000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-revenge-of-alice-cooper/1806152434","playParams":{"id":"1806152434","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1UZ19qQUfDVRm9Odj7Yvjg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806152434/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"393703","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/393703?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753427871077,"RTCI":0}}},"1806221918":{"id":"1806221918","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806221918?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":24,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coffin-break/60288499","name":"Revival","artistName":"Coffin Break","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d8/21/00/d82100c4-de20-9b1a-1d3e-73666c442869/199199311773.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cac310","textColor2":"f81e25","textColor4":"c6181d","textColor1":"fcf415","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/revival/1806221918","playParams":{"id":"1806221918","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2dtZLDYJiydvCGJ6TykIxc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806221918/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"60288499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/60288499?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1746171547802,"RTCI":0}}},"1806760885":{"id":"1806760885","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1806760885?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/94/6f/6d/946f6d14-8c1a-ea32-9914-464ef04c2888/d0209bf1-32fa-4d46-b0cd-9c3c81efd715.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2e2e2e","textColor2":"401a1c","textColor4":"583a3b","textColor1":"0c0c0c","bgColor":"b8b8b8","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cody-jinks/363412711","name":"In My Blood","artistName":"Cody Jinks","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Cody Jinks is proving to be one of outsider country music’s more prolific artists, releasing this LP just a year after dropping a trio of projects in 2024: the studio album <i>Change the Game</i>, a remastered rerelease of 2012’s <i>30</i> called <i>Backside of 30</i>, and the tribute album <i>Cody Jinks Sings Lefty Frizzell</i>. This is no collection of cutting-room-floor material, though, and it shows the grizzled Texan at the top of his game as a vocalist and a bandleader. As he has for most of his albums, Jinks recorded <i>In My Blood</i> at the famed Texas studio complex Sonic Ranch, with Joshua Thompson and Charles Godfrey producing. Jinks and his band the Tonedeaf Hippies don’t reinvent the wheel here, instead leaning into the hard-rock-informed Texas country that put him on the map. Highlights include “Lost Highway,” a dark and brooding meditation on life’s mysteries, and “Something Wicked This Way Comes,” a harmony-rich midtempo rocker that plays off the Ray Bradbury horror novel of the same name. Jinks closes the project with “When Time Didn’t Fly,” a raw and nostalgic ballad that shows the emotional depths of his singular voice.","short":"Another helping of the country artist’s

2","artistName":"Jackson Wang","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The 11 tracks on Hong Kong-born artist Jackson Wang’s album <i>MAGICMAN 2</i> started as diary entries. “After 10 years of nonstop schedules, all packed every day of the year, I figured I needed some rest,” Wang tells Apple Music, referring to his first decade of work in the massively successful K-pop group GOT7. In stark contrast, Wang spent the lead-up to production on the 2025 album with family and getting introspective: “I took almost a year off just for myself to breathe and to think about what does everything mean.” \n\nThe album is a follow-up to Wang’s 2022 solo album <i>MAGIC MAN</i>, which was a raw and dramatic alt-rock effort inspired by the artist’s experiences with burnout. <i>MAGICMAN 2</i>, a different kind of confession, expands the thematic scope of the man behind the pop persona. “People see Jackson Wang, my audience sees me, but how do I really feel? I didn’t even know that,” says Wang. “This album is all about how I feel in everything—in reality, in society, in industry.” \n\n<i>MAGICMAN 2</i> is divided into four chapters, meant to take the listener on an emotional journey through “manic highs,” “losing control,” “realization,” and “acceptance,” explains Wang. The album gets personal in its subject matter, prioritizing vulnerable specificities over vague universalities. Early on, in the haunting, dramatic synth-pop track “High Alone,” Wang makes a desperate plea to an ex-lover. In “BUCK,” featuring Indian superstar Diljit Dosanjh, he celebrates the infinite groove of the dance floor.  \n\nWang finishes the album with the acoustic pop track “Made Me a Man,” which he calls his favorite on the album, a song he did not intend to be a commercial hit as much as an honest statement. “I felt like I needed one of those albums in my life that represents me,” he says. “Not thinking about, ‘Oh, is this going to be an ear candy song?’ I want something that represents me.”\n","short":"The veteran K-pop star gets personal: “I want something that represents me.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e8/c4/67/e8c46785-018b-721e-cdb5-1afa6db0a8f3/199350240560.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a7908b","textColor2":"d0a492","textColor4":"a78476","textColor1":"d1b4ad","bgColor":"030305","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/magicman-2/1809249753","playParams":{"id":"1809249753","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6grHFyWJvGNZjyLCAHPnrJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809249753/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1219157172","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1219157172?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446254476,"RTCI":0}}},"1810467818":{"id":"1810467818","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810467818?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/4f/3b/52/4f3b5210-8333-00f2-bef4-b9c77ff3030b/d1991626-c6c3-48bb-b2f7-a07fac19292f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"e08085","textColor2":"ef7884","textColor4":"d7646d","textColor1":"fa9ba2","bgColor":"771410","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daron-malakian-and-scars-on-broadway/1810454952","name":"Addicted To The Violence","artistName":"Daron Malakian And Scars On Broadway","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s been seven years since System Of A Down guitarist Daron Malakian released a Scars On Broadway album. As it turns out, he recorded and mixed <i>Addicted to the Violence</i> twice. After being dissatisfied with the first version, he scrapped everything except his vocals and started over. But Malakian’s perfectionist tendencies have paid off. <i>Addicted to the Violence</i> is a metallic whirlwind of musical precision and lyrical freeform that explores the theme of violence and its effects.\n\nWhether it’s terrorism, gang warfare, or domestic violence, Malakian hypothesizes, the fallout is the same. “Insanity, controlling me/Society, the kids are on a killing spree,” he sings on leadoff track “Killing Spree,” a track that seesaws in a whiplash fusion of djent, punk, and black metal. With a delivery that recalls Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra, Malakian name-checks the Ayatollah, serial killer Richard Ramirez, and the bloody Afghan poppy trade on “Destroy the Power” before asking, “Can’t you see the abuse creates strength for us? We take the power, and we can destroy you.”","short":"The System Of A Down guitarist’s first album in seven years is a whirlwind."},"artwork":{"width":1400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6b/66/01/6b66013b-b768-3f64-ea2e-9290408217dc/198704482625_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1400,"textColor3":"f0ca44","textColor2":"f4d97d","textColor4":"e8ad64","textColor1":"fffd56","bgColor":"b80000","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/addicted-to-the-violence/1810467818","playParams":{"id":"1810467818","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6CWO5GdXfUd6mjbDDD5Hln"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810467818/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1810454952","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1810454952?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753417097510,"RTCI":0}}},"1810807922":{"id":"1810807922","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810807922?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":8,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/f9/be/dcf9bec0-a5c1-ed57-ec28-b70fe0afbe87/c2bc9663-adf1-4294-9685-179a5aa1b63c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d4d4d6","textColor2":"ececec","textColor4":"cdcdcd","textColor1":"f5f5f6","bgColor":"525252","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/madonna/20044","name":"Veronica Electronica","artistName":"Madonna","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"During the extra-long recording process of her 1998 magnum opus, Madonna came up with an alter ego drawn from her confirmation name—a character she felt so strongly she nearly named the album after it, though ultimately she decided on <i>Ray of Light</i>. Her entrancing seventh album introduced electronica to the American mainstream and reignited the relevance of the 39-year-old new mother at a time when pop music was trending teenage and perky. It was a pivotal moment for the icon both spiritually and creatively, and she’s often cited the record as her proudest work. \n\nBack then, she planned to follow up the original album with a companion disc of harder-hitting remixes, though the project was ultimately sidelined due to <i>Ray of Light</i>’s runaway success. (The boundary-pushing original would become one of the best-selling albums by a woman of all time and earn Madonna three Grammys, including Best Pop Album.) More than two and a half decades later, the project has finally resurfaced with remastered versions of the original remixes and one previously unreleased demo (“Gone Gone Gone”) recorded during the <i>Ray of Light</i> sessions with the producer Rick Nowels. Here the classic album’s slinky singles are pushed even deeper, bringing songs like “Drowned World / Substitute for Love” and “Nothing Really Matters” from the chill-out lounge to the dance floor with pulsing edits from William Orbit, Sasha, BT, Victor Calderone, and the late Peter Rauhofer, aka Club 69. \n","short":"Remixes from 1998’s Ray of Light add depth to the pivotal album."},"artwork":{"width":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/53/48/d7/5348d71b-f4a4-ba61-2118-7c853d7f0e1f/603497812462.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":4000,"textColor3":"dfdfdf","textColor2":"f8f8f8","textColor4":"d9d9da","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"616163","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/veronica-electronica/1810807922","playParams":{"id":"1810807922","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2JgIGypHO489ni7EtpMmdz"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810807922/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"20044","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/20044?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753351749589,"RTCI":0}}},"1811139336":{"id":"1811139336","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811139336?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/69/d5/5f/69d55fe7-61f8-efff-1ce3-42b962d16460/f659c9dc-a033-4966-ba7b-0fb347793e7b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8b6d7","textColor2":"b0c0f6","textColor4":"91a3d2","textColor1":"cdd7fc","bgColor":"123046","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ef/d6/22/efd6222f-d80c-5985-7611-bbe835d6005e/895e728e-64fb-42b5-9fe9-7d3da7afc49d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"92b5cf","textColor2":"92c2f1","textColor4":"7da7cb","textColor1":"acd3f6","bgColor":"2a3c35","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/duke-dumont/257148267","name":"Union","artistName":"Duke Dumont","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"When British producer Duke Dumont released his debut album <i>Duality</i> in April 2020, clubs and festivals around the world were closed down, leaving dance floors empty. The cover of his follow-up, <i>Union</i>, feels like a response to that absence: a candid shot from one of his shows, capturing a packed crowd mid-dance, arms raised in anticipation. More than a photo memory, it’s a testament to the communal power of live music. \n\nIf <i>Duality</i> nodded to the glory days of ’90s house, <i>Union</i> embodies the energy of a UK rave: harder, faster, clubbier—made to be played loud, start to finish. The title track jump-starts the adrenaline with a cinematic crescendo, seamlessly moving into “The Chant,” slow-burning electronica with a euphoric payoff. Later, “Hit Em” offers a momentary breather with mellow breakbeats before resuming sweat mode. Collaborations like the resilient “Ain’t Giving Up” with Clementine Douglas and the haunting “All My Life” with Panama highlight Dumont’s pop sensibilities, pairing vocals aching for connection with soaring melodies. <i>Union</i>’s most poignant instincts arrive on “Feels Like This,” where poet Tony Walsh sums up the spirit of it all: “Call it an energy, call it a vibe/Call it a spirit, we share it inside/And here on the dance floor, this spirit has chance for/The loving of living a life fit to dance for.”\n","short":"Come together with the producer’s euphoric second full-length."},"artwork":{"width":3543,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f0/5a/91/f05a91ee-b7bb-e654-1c88-1ff0c847dc9e/25UMGIM60711.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3543,"textColor3":"172f2f","textColor2":"001608","textColor4":"173835","textColor1":"000a00","bgColor":"73c0ec","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/union/1811139336","playParams":{"id":"1811139336","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0cTaflAQAHx4Z0ZmtchnvY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811139336/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"257148267","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/257148267?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753430141326,"RTCI":0}}},"1811177379":{"id":"1811177379","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811177379?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ace-hood/278942211","name":"S.O.U.L.","artistName":"Ace Hood","contentRating":"explicit","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/bb/3a/9ebb3a59-9fb7-3eea-5343-93305e007147/199350406737.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"d0cec2","textColor2":"f4ebc6","textColor4":"cfc8a5","textColor1":"f5f4ea","bgColor":"3a3922","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/s-o-u-l/1811177379","playParams":{"id":"1811177379","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3GMXtJJ5b7hA3eDGAY7dPj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811177379/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"278942211","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/278942211?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753454355926,"RTCI":0}}},"1811382502":{"id":"1811382502","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811382502?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative","Indie Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/63/2a/93/632a933a-ea0c-9341-1e75-ee1bcc634353/Jobec8af6d9-40da-4709-b4f6-83bb3e46abd4-193634684-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379324403_2183376988-Time1748529739850.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fc3773"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"6e2921"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"cb422f","textColor2":"fc3773","textColor4":"cd3161","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"6e2921","hasP3":false},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f5/d1/66/f5d16648-a9a8-4e96-f946-6b060ee0dc66/Job3c85277e-eff9-4c5a-8a75-04a501b8049b-193634593-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379324404_2183376987-Time1748528766468.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","fd2f20"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"6e2921"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"cecdba","textColor2":"fd2f20","textColor4":"cd2a1e","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"6e2921","hasP3":false}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=17605567-1464756","name":"Going Down To The River...

With minimal accompaniment, the Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter wonders if he’s too far gone on the LP’s old-timey opening track, pairing gospel-tinged harmonies with rootsy guitar to dramatic effect as he asks, “Lord, will you carry me?” Only a minute and a half long, the song sets the tone for the searching and heartfelt collection, which Gossett wrote and produced himself. That tune leads into “Hangin’ On,” a bright and buoyant folk-rocker reminiscent of early Mumford & Sons with its quick-strummed rhythm guitar and anthemic feel. The road song “American Trail” dips into newgrass, complete with banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and multi-part vocal harmonies, a sound that differentiates Gossett from peers like Zach Bryan. And the album, of course, features one of Gossett’s biggest hits, the stripped-down and vulnerable “Coal,” on which he wonders if the pressures of life will ever bring forth growth.","short":"A searching and heartfelt album from the Austin, Texas, singer-songwriter."},"artwork":{"width":3600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0a/a1/fa/0aa1fa6d-98fa-08b9-44ea-e16850f948a9/25UMGIM59902.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3600,"textColor3":"403e39","textColor2":"34322f","textColor4":"58554f","textColor1":"161615","bgColor":"eae2cd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/westward/1811479220","playParams":{"id":"1811479220","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/22iWmNK24h2hurzUzXnY1V"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811479220/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1526025679","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1526025679?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753422569369,"RTCI":0}}},"1811688038":{"id":"1811688038","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811688038?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6b/6a/1c/6b6a1cdf-4c94-a065-5a53-04e1fec05a1f/d9dc794d-57d2-4830-8edc-309e02271fc4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"cfd7de","textColor2":"ebeef1","textColor4":"c7d1d8","textColor1":"f5f6f8","bgColor":"395c76","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/59/dd/93/59dd9356-d6bb-0ef7-a4e3-40cd3c81fb98/6b598bf6-462a-404c-9fec-7ff09fce0e03.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a8a3a3","textColor2":"92bbdf","textColor4":"7b9bb8","textColor1":"cbc5c5","bgColor":"1e1b1d","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/max-mcnown/1682299543","name":"Night Diving (The Cost of Growing Up)","artistName":"Max McNown","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"This sophomore album from Max McNown comes less than a year after his 2024 full-length debut, the viral success <i>Willfully Blind</i>. On that outing, the pop-folk singer-songwriter from Oregon crafted a collection of songs tailor-made for fans of fellow of-the-moment troubadours like Noah Kahan and Zach Bryan. <i>Night Diving</i> doesn’t mess with that formula, instead doubling down on the raw, heart-on-his-sleeve sound that made McNown a TikTok favorite. <i>Night Diving</i> opens with its title track, a brooding rendering of youthful regret that recalls the more somber sounds of The Lumineers. Another ballad, “It’s Not Your Fault,” offers absolution to an unknown subject, adding a sense of universality to the song’s titular message. And another highlight, “Roses and Wolves,” is the lone collaboration on the album, bringing McNown together with critically acclaimed country singer-songwriter Hailey Whitters for a duet about the last days of a doomed relationship.","short":"The Oregon newcomer’s second album doubles down on earnest songwriting."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a8/26/ca/a826ca87-8734-b96b-d905-7693d267534d/850064541656.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b1bcc6","textColor2":"7ec6e3","textColor4":"6aa2b9","textColor1":"d6e7f4","bgColor":"1a1210","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/night-diving-the-cost-of-growing-up/1811688038","playParams":{"id":"1811688038","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0iK9uLukiE9sSqJ7P58C4c"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811688038/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1682299543","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1682299543?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753422670326,"RTCI":0}}},"1811710874":{"id":"1811710874","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811710874?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/cc/2d/cf/cc2dcf69-e785-e706-1204-840c52a1d820/0a0102fb-0d60-4eb5-9ae2-a45ef04ec31a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"9bcee0","textColor2":"84c6eb","textColor4":"71b0d4","textColor1":"b8ebfa","bgColor":"25597a","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/48/4a/57/484a579f-5478-fa48-6fb2-7a8adfa70535/5bb966cb-6a1b-4c1a-886f-e04a4d4d4c4b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"ca8984","textColor2":"f27e6a","textColor4":"cb6e5e","textColor1":"f19f99","bgColor":"2f2e31","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lord-huron/393068687","name":"The Cosmic Selector Vol. 1","artistName":"Lord Huron","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Lord Huron’s reverb-soaked, sepia-toned Americana has worn several faces over the years: the wide-eyed pioneer (<i>Strange Trails</i>), the lovelorn drifter (<i>Vide Noir</i>), the wistful cowboy just looking for a cold beer and place to hang up his spurs (<i>Long Lost</i>). As its title suggests, <i>The Cosmic Selector</i> leans into the spacier side of their sound, channeling moody, Lynchian atmospheres (“Looking Back”), ’50s ballads (“It All Comes Back”), and front-porch hymns (“Looking Back”) with the kind of gauzy, interstellar remove of late-’90s bands like Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse.\n\nPart of the project’s charm is that it never tries to sound too

The LA group’s sixth album, <i>Man on the Moon</i>, refines their post-Motown alt-pop aesthetic down to a science, presenting a virtual jukebox loaded with 14 potential singles that never relent in their hip-shaking and spirit-lifting intent. “OK OK OK” compacts all of The Tantrums’ signature traits—spine-cracking rhythms, blasts of brass, soul-revue energy, and, yes, handclaps—into an instant floor-filler that clocks in under two minutes flat, while the space-themed, string-laden title track hovers somewhere between Stax and the stars. And even when Fitz and co. tweak the formula here and there—be it with the Phoenix-like cosmopolitan pop of “Perfume” or the tropical R&B vibe of “Waste My Time”—the net result is the same: clothes drenched in sweat, dancing shoes worn down to the sole, and a smile smeared across your face.

A quickly rising up-and-comer, Westbrook tells Apple Music that <i>Texas Forever</i> spans a formative period and reflects the growth he’s experienced since first coming onto the scene with his viral single “Take It Slow.”\n\n“There are some songs on here from a year and a half ago,” Westbrook says. “And you’re like, ‘This is the headspace I was in when I wrote that song.’ It’s so weird how life changes and how you look back on your album. It’s really cool, because I have the opportunity to show an era of who I am, and then there’s another era, and there’s another era.”\n\n<i>Texas Forever</i> opens with “Darlin’,” a soulful, deceptively sweet song about stealing someone’s girl. The title track likens Westbrook’s deeply rooted connection to his home state to a long-term relationship, and features some of his most image-rich songwriting. “Funny Seeing You Here” is a full-circle kiss-off to an ex-flame, with prominent fiddle and a fiery guitar solo upping the romantic drama. The album also features Westbrook’s hit single “House Again,” a clever and wrenching breakup song that plays with the distinction between a house and a home. Fellow up-and-comer Mackenzie Carpenter is the album’s sole feature, lending her agile lilt to the wistful midtempo ballad “Lie to Me.” Below, Westbrook shares insight into a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Texas Forever”</b>\n“Loyalty to Texas would mean, to me, I’ll never run tracks in my songs. It’s going to be real drums, real everything. And if I can’t stop my live band in the middle of the show without a track playing, then I’m done making music. I don’t like tracks. And, of course, that goes for my lane. Do whatever you want, whatever, but not hating. Melodies matter a lot, and topics of songs. And loyalty to Texas is like, I’ll starch my jeans, but I’m not going to wear a cowboy hat everywhere I go. And then [I’ll take] any chance that I have to give back. There’s a certain thing that if you’re from Texas, you don’t say that you’re country. Nothing on my album is like, ‘I’m country.’ It’s like, ‘I’m drinking beer on a…’ It’s like, ‘Woke up this mornin’ in boots and jeans.’ It’s just topics, you know? And I think that’s my favorite thing to write.”\n\n<b>“House Again”</b>\n“We went from a house out in the country—we had five acres, six acres—and then we went to a golf course with a [small] front yard. And so, it felt like a house. My parents put stained concrete, and we had white tile instead, and you had our chaps hung on the wall, but there’s no room for chaps to be hung on the wall anymore. You know what I mean? It’s little things like that that I think make a house a home. You go stay in the bachelorette houses in Nashville, that ain’t a home. Your handprints in the sidewalk whenever you did that with all your family, mud tracks where you drove a four-wheeler through, or anything that’s humanly interacted with by a human. The house can’t interact back—we just make it a home, and we fill it out. I think that’s the difference between an IKEA sofa and a leather one that your grandma passed you down. Little things like that. So, that’s what makes a house a home to me.”\n\n<b>“Hill I’ll Die On”</b>\n“The whole album starts off with me stealing this guy’s girl. I’m calling her up, right? I’m calling her darling. He’s calling her up. And then, it kind of just goes through the whole story of boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, heartbreak, love, having fun, and then it ends on ‘Hill I’ll Die On.’ And I just remember after that song, nothing was planned. I didn’t have that tracklisting. I had no idea until I produced it, obviously. And I went into the studio, and at the end of it, I was like, ‘Y’all keep playing.’ And then they kept playing, and I was like, ‘All right, keep playing.’ And then I was like, ‘All right, y’all just rip.’ I just told the studio players, ‘Do whatever you want.’ And so, they just started playing towards the whole end. There’s like a whole minute outro. And then, I don’t know, I think also it represents everything that I am as a person.”","short":"The country singer wields his state pride: “It’s an era of who I am.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e1/f9/56/e1f95687-e778-ee4b-f6b0-bbc6b293e1bb/093624831686.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b49972","textColor2":"f1a97c","textColor4":"c38c66","textColor1":"deba8b","bgColor":"0d190d","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/texas-forever/1814944527","playParams":{"id":"1814944527","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Ob2sg38jCEu6s25riXlPe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814944527/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1740125054","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1740125054?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753451422706,"RTCI":0}}},"1815171198":{"id":"1815171198","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815171198?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":11,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/09/fc/33/09fc3396-1603-c7c1-2aa0-160f9b453a6b/705277ff-06bd-4a12-b574-a8dba15a15f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"3c3d3a","textColor2":"231e1a","textColor4":"3f4341","textColor1":"1f1611","bgColor":"aed7dc","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/72/9e/13/729e1317-37a8-7cd1-7b8a-f8a4cd3cad6f/ddfd2e0d-77ff-430a-8bd0-e59cade864c9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"424847","textColor2":"292c2d","textColor4":"434e50","textColor1":"282422","bgColor":"aed7dc","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/winston-surfshirt/936835721","name":"WINSTON","artistName":"Winston Surfshirt","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When Winston Surfshirt, aka Sydney artist Brett Ramson, began writing his fourth album, he thought he was making a disco record like Michael Jackson’s <i>Off the Wall</i>. Four years later, he arrived at a collection of songs that owes more to the late-’90s/early-2000s R&B of artists such as USHER, Craig David, and Aaliyah. “I just felt like everyone was doing it, and I don’t like doing stuff everyone’s doing,” he tells Apple Music of his shift away from disco. Also key to the move was his alliance with producer OSWRLD, aka Oscar Sharah. “Through our love for that [R&B] era, everything got pushed into that one street,” he explains.\n\nFrom the seductive R&B of “One Sugar” and nostalgic soul of “Spend My Nights” to the R&B, hip-hop and funk mélange of “Ice Cream,” the album is, says the artist, “almost like a pop record,” with each song a potential single. That he opted to call it <i>WINSTON</i> stems from both a desire to break the pattern of dessert-themed album titles (2022’s <i>Panna Cotta</i>, 2019’s <i>Apple Crumble</i>, 2017’s <i>Sponge Cake</i>), but also because the musical era that inspired the record is so key to informing who he is as an artist. Here, he takes Apple Music through <i>WINSTON</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Turn Out the Light”</b>\n“Probably the first song written, from before my first daughter was born, 2020, beginning of COVID. We were locked down and in a house with a new baby, and I was trying to write an album that was going to be disco, so the first demo of it is very disco. Some songs can have two meanings for me. Sometimes, I’ll be writing about love, but it can also be about music, which is another huge love of mine. Four years later, I feel like it’s more about music than love, and it’s more about me.”\n\n<b>“Ice Cream”</b>\n“This is the first song I wrote with Oscar. I get mad George Michael vibes from the verse. The chorus melody came within 30 minutes, and the verse was the same thing—he’d made the chorus beat, and then he flipped what he’d made to make a completely different part for the verses. I was like, ‘Oh my Lord!’”\n\n<b>“One Sugar”</b>\n“It’s just about my wife and love. That verse is the most literal thing in the world. She only drinks soda water and she makes good pavlova. I’d had that chord pattern in my head for the last four years, and it took till I met Oscar and he helped me work the chords out.”\n\n<b>“Desire”</b>\n“My second daughter is on ‘JEEP,’ there’s a sample of her voice, and my oldest daughter was upset that she wasn’t on a song, so I had to put her in ‘Desire.’ This song was from a writing trip in Kangaroo Valley with Oscar and a guy called Beso Palma and a piano player called Brekky Boy, and then my band and another mate. Musically, it was a lot of just getting people to jump in and mess about.”\n\n<b>“Up & Down”</b>\n“It’s pretty funny. We were pissing ourselves when we wrote it. [The inspiration came from a] guy called Domino, super-2000s hip-hop. And again, another chord pattern that I had but needed help with structuring. I sat down with Oscar, he played bass, I played keys, and the song was done.”\n\n<b>“JEEP”</b>\n“Another one from the Kangaroo Valley. We had no Wi-Fi, so there was only a television with radio channels, and there was a song on by Blackstreet called ‘Girlfriend/ Boyfriend’ that does that stutter beat. I couldn’t look up the song, so I had to try and explain to Oscar I wanted a beat like this with the drums, and then we just put some chords over it. The chorus melody, the baby’s sleeping thing, that’s an old song from five years ago when my [firstborn] was a baby.”\n\n<b>“Chop N Bowl”</b>\n“That’s just something I’ve always said. When people are like, ‘We’ve got to rock ’n’ roll, we’ve got to go,’ I’ve always said, ‘We’ve got to chop ’n’ bowl.’ We’ve got to get out of here. It’s time to go.”\n\n<b>“Spend My Nights”</b>\n“They’re all sort of [about my partner], or tongue in cheek. But it’s trying to evoke that feeling of when we were kids and I was besotted by this lady. We had the chorus and I remember that was in the Kangaroo Valley, and then months later it was like, ‘Can you finish that?’ The guy who plays drums in my band came over and helped me write this Q-Tip sort of thing.”\n\n<b>“Fill My Cup”</b>\n“Oscar had a chord pattern idea and I helped him figure that out. The song was called ‘Get Down on You,’ and I think we were like, ‘What does that mean? Is that a bit weird?’ We’ve also got a song called ‘Up & Down’ so we just used another title in there. Again, just a song about my wife, really.”\n\n<b>“BOOTS”</b>\n“It came after we had most of the songs. It felt like we were missing some upbeat stuff. And we were like, how do we do that in a ’90s way? And we started listening to Miami bass and stuff like that and went, ‘OK, let’s go at 123 BPM,’ which is probably the fastest song I’ve got, and it just worked. The chorus vocal melody was another thing I’d been singing in my mind for two or three years that never fit with anything.”\n\n<b>“I Can’t Hide”</b>\n“There was a three-month period where my daughter was a baby where I was trying to write a song for Elton John. A song that he would like to sing with me. I think I wrote 20 or 30 beats over this three-month period, and this was my favorite one. Then I got cold feet. He’s a busy man, he’s not going to do that!”","short":"The artist revives the spirit of late-’90s R&B on his fourth album."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/00/c4/02/00c402ed-2b4a-a9b8-7507-38dc4a18c8fc/9342977279203.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"3a4346","textColor2":"16373a","textColor4":"425e61","textColor1":"0c1618","bgColor":"f3fbfd","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/winston/1815171198","playParams":{"id":"1815171198","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Eulo5ecVZ1pF2kXbDMhA5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815171198/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"936835721","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/936835721?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753417815208,"RTCI":0}}},"1815328278":{"id":"1815328278","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815328278?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":18,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/28/1d/44/281d44d1-2503-df63-6bc4-ffc66f0ae256/0a60507a-7dc9-4cfe-9fe2-dae4442c49c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"27292b","textColor2":"26231a","textColor4":"3d3e39","textColor1":"0a0908","bgColor":"9ba8b5","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/88/83/f8/8883f8e5-147e-d8cc-2e47-4d3a81b4e1f4/c0048aa9-2a2e-44f8-8ec1-e20e1db615fd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bbd1dc","textColor2":"bce6f9","textColor4":"9ecade","textColor1":"e1eff6","bgColor":"245a74","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joyner-lucas/888715002","name":"ADHD 2","artistName":"Joyner Lucas","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"In a fun bit of irony, Joyner Lucas spent the lead-up to the release of his 2025 LP, <i>ADHD 2</i>, with his attention elsewhere.

On “NOBODY CARES,” his lyricism, flows, and rhyme schemes are superlative, which he showcases throughout <i>ADHD 2</i> as well. Take “One of Them,” which features skittering synths and stomping drums.

He’s not a household name, but he touches a nerve.\n\nHis first major-label album (whatever that really means in 2025), <i>Headlights</i>, isn’t different from his run of Domino albums (2015’s <i>Beach Music</i> to 2022’s <i>God Save the Animals</i>) in kind so much as in degree. “Every couple weeks, I’d have a new song and just start working on it,” he tells Apple Music. “And then, at the end of a couple of years, I guess I had these 12 songs that were good.” The conventional tracks are more straightforward (the early Wilco stomp of “Logan Hotel”), the experiments are both bolder and catchier (the Auto-Tuned hyperpop of “Bounce Boy”). For an artist who can pull deep feeling out of vague stretches of sound, he’s gotten incredibly good at knowing how to use detail and when: Just listen to the accordion that seeps into “June Guitar” or the girls’ chorus that drifts in and out of the alien-abduction/high-school-football story (yes) “Beam Me Up”—touches that feel both unexpected and irreplaceable. \n\nThe result is an album that feels less like a collection of indie-rock songs than a dream about collections of indie-rock songs—vivid but patchy, intimate but abstract, emotionally deep but totally indirect. In some ways, he’s just another point on the continuum of artists like Pavement or The Velvet Underground, both of whom managed to balance directness with abstraction, shadow with light. In others, he feels perfectly made for his moment, an enigmatically normal-seeming guy whose gift for melody and cool fragments of sound work as well as background vibes for chill times as hermetic texts left to be parsed by comment-section scholars. There’s a reason his fans latch on so tight: Like a good dream, Alex G points toward mystery.","short":"A cult songwriter makes his most direct record yet, without sparing the mystery."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/df/33/7c/df337c6f-7853-b1f8-8bd0-b4c9737fccc4/196872969757.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"cdcddd","textColor2":"fcd4b4","textColor4":"d0bcaf","textColor1":"f9eaed","bgColor":"215a9e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/headlights/1815825254","playParams":{"id":"1815825254","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6txHM80BKWlp4UdqLpWXRZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815825254/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"871667491","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/871667491?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446380825,"RTCI":0}}},"1816141049":{"id":"1816141049","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816141049?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":13,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/30/02/0a/30020a90-5a98-ccce-c448-f5c92bb98e90/2307d48d-b45d-4985-b3b2-c87caddfa919.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"444444","textColor2":"2b2b2b","textColor4":"535353","textColor1":"171717","bgColor":"f5f5f5","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gelo/1454510295","name":"League of My Own","artistName":"GELO","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"LiAngelo Ball never quite made it to the NBA like his brothers LaMelo and Lonzo.

Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me?</i>, came to her while touring in support of her sophomore effort, <i>In Search of the Antidote</i>. The New Jersey-born singer began to wonder who, exactly, she was making music for. With this 2025 LP, she aimed to wrestle agency back from oblivion and make a project that would provide satisfaction on its own terms, in its own time. FLETCHER is satisfied in ruminating on these weighty philosophical questions, finding as much joy in reflecting on the puzzling nature of happiness as in the feeling itself.\n\nOpener “Party” is a piano-driven pop ballad buoyed by FLETCHER’s powerful voice. She sings of champagne bottles that have gone flat after having been left open too long. The festivities have ended and there’s no one left to clean up the mess. Elsewhere, on “Chaos,” she opts for a simple arrangement of contemplative acoustic guitar chords, allowing plenty of room for her to reflect on her phone calls with God, in which she admits that she doesn’t know what she’s doing. That, in and of itself, is reason enough for FLETCHER to keep singing.","short":"Existential pop that questions the nature of happiness—but in a fun way."},"artwork":{"width":3594,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3b/bf/f8/3bbff83d-3d49-cef0-60d1-b00bf913a437/25UMGIM70160.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3594,"textColor3":"242625","textColor2":"17110b","textColor4":"2f2e2b","textColor1":"0a0804","bgColor":"8da0ab","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/would-you-still-love-me-if-you-really-knew-me/1817294201","playParams":{"id":"1817294201","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7CrfDijJ4YRvLEjlOMkgZI"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817294201/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1131301545","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1131301545?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446138532,"RTCI":0}}},"1817707266":{"id":"1817707266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817707266?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":15,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/64/50/b4/6450b467-a941-82d9-2cc1-10af5259bb51/bb2eaeb3-5434-4b19-b57e-f2b6dc1cab4d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"d6d4cd","textColor2":"d2b3a1","textColor4":"b39786","textColor1":"fffffb","bgColor":"372917","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/25/ad/6e/25ad6e84-1a69-f397-7c27-237bce1f8383/22ef7d73-e854-4815-b738-9db11f2ca686.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"d3bcae","textColor2":"e3c9c2","textColor4":"c5aea6","textColor1":"f6dbcd","bgColor":"4b4034","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/74/76/ef/7476ef26-c77e-de68-8014-6e7dfa1c7a15/6e26c0e9-de8a-4562-a96c-398004e82477.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","ffffff"],"height":1080,"textColor3":"262321","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor4":"2e2927","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"9d8a82","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jessie-murph/1548067332","name":"Sex Hysteria","artistName":"Jessie Murph","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"The Athens, Alabama, native grew up on pop and country, fell in love with hip-hop, and then blew up on social media with covers that combined all of the above. Since her 2021 debut single “Upgrade,” the 20-year-old singer has collaborated with Jelly Roll, Teddy Swims, and BigXthaPlug; briefly relocated to Nashville, then LA; and landed a handful of hits about heartbreak and dangerous love. Despite her gritty voice and outlaw predilections, Murph refrained from delving too deep into her own personal story on her 2024 debut album <i>That Ain’t No Man That’s the Devil</i>. \n\nHer follow-up, <i>Sex Hysteria</i>, fearlessly unpacks her past. “I’m from Alabama, I’m ’bout 4’11”/I’ve got a shitty father, and I’d like to go to heaven,” she drawls candidly on intro “Gucci Mane,” which country-fries a subtle sample of its namesake’s “Lemonade.” In Murph’s musical melting pot, trap, pop, and country meld into a twangy, swaggering hybrid. She flexes her hip-hop chops alongside a few of her faves, holding her own with Lil Baby on the snarling “Best Behavior” and Gucci himself on “Donuts.” The doomed romance of “Heroin” falls somewhere between Lana and Loretta Lynn, while the Amy Winehouse-inspired “1965” offers up a winking satire of trad-wife femininity. But the rawest moment is “The Man That Came Back,” a stark piano ballad about her violent upbringing and her father’s attempts at redemption—transcending her trauma by writing her way through it.\n","short":"A brutally frank and wholly unique blend of trap, pop, and country."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/93/4a/2a/934a2a00-c2e1-6d61-483c-762f86394042/196873058115.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"312c29","textColor2":"1a1815","textColor4":"3b3431","textColor1":"0e0d0c","bgColor":"c0a6a0","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sex-hysteria/1817707266","playParams":{"id":"1817707266","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1slf6g1SethO2KrA4cxgjq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817707266/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1548067332","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1548067332?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446343684,"RTCI":0}}},"1817735146":{"id":"1817735146","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817735146?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":21,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/7e/8f/f8/7e8ff88c-8319-d171-35a3-c1ab0720223b/Job3cbd966f-c023-4321-915c-8ba348f9600c-196413987-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384668503_2235089757-Time1751498978528.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","9dd05b"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b1503"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"9aaf5a","textColor2":"9dd05b","textColor4":"7eab48","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b1503","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/11/65/20/11652087-c2bf-f5a5-955a-e734dcbe6709/396cd8aa-612d-4ca8-aed0-7ee855ae5ec6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"28282d","textColor2":"231815","textColor4":"3d3432","textColor1":"080a0e","bgColor":"a5a2a8","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/cf/31/01/cf3101d0-3665-28a8-e7b1-9f39a1542243/Job11492f11-2d25-4019-9c8f-2844c824b446-196413986-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384668502_2235089758-Time1751497969523.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["ffffff","edb1a6"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"0b1503"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"80b05a","textColor2":"edb1a6","textColor4":"be9285","textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"0b1503","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/57/bd/42/57bd42a5-5e85-175c-834b-0366608436f2/ac6c9a1f-14ee-4d6c-9c3a-37a4e0c65b85.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"bf9180","textColor2":"d6a99f","textColor4":"b39086","textColor1":"e5aa98","bgColor":"252b21","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3e/fc/77/3efc77d7-552a-d253-539c-2e5c17788703/ea4f6ff1-7ec6-4a62-87b6-fda74bd354cf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"bebec1","textColor2":"f5ccbc","textColor4":"cdaca0","textColor1":"e3e3e6","bgColor":"2a2b30","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alex-warren/1572671688","name":"You'll Be Alright, Kid","artistName":"Alex Warren","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"It’s easy to imagine Alex Warren making a very, very different kind of music than the emotionally complex, deeply personal and revealing songs he wrote for his 2025 album <i>You’ll Be Alright, Kid</i>. After all, the California-born social media superstar got his start thanks to his turn as a prank-obsessed member of the Hype House. But Warren does away with deception and silliness on his debut, instead opting to write songs about big dreamers and lost souls—mostly keying in on the arduous road we face after heartbreak. \n\nOpener “Eternity” finds Warren looking for his true identity in the wake of a breakup, using his Christian faith to infuse the song’s imagery. “To be with you in paradise/What I wouldn’t sacrifice,” he practically pleads.

On this seventh full-length studio album from the Lawrence County, KY, native, Childers goes even bigger and bolder, recruiting superproducer and noted spiritual seeker Rick Rubin to helm a kaleidoscopic collection of wild, weird songs. <i>Snipe Hunter</i> opens with “Eatin’ Big Time,” a freewheeling rocker that takes its title from a phrase Childers and his band The Food Stamps deploy to mark milestones and celebrate successes. With a lyric as wild as his wailing vocal—there’s a verse about shooting and then skinning a man in a “motherfucking mansion”—it’s a fitting entry into this new world Childers built. “Bitin’ List” gets right to the point, opening with the line “To put it plain, I just don’t like you” while The Food Stamps sink their teeth into an old-time-adjacent arrangement. “Tirtha Yatra” pairs spiritual musings with a swinging beat, as Childers waxes poetic on the Bhagavad Gita. And longtime fan favorite “Oneida,” a staple of Childers’ live sets since 2017, gets its long-awaited studio treatment, bridging the gap between the burgeoning days of his career and this obvious high point.","short":"A big and bold swing—with an assist from the legendary Rick Rubin."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/61/2c/57/612c57ff-2a2d-f821-32ab-d5d19e866db7/196873116631.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"dbcfbf","textColor2":"eee3cd","textColor4":"d5c2ab","textColor1":"f4f3e7","bgColor":"744122","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/snipe-hunter/1818393806","playParams":{"id":"1818393806","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/00rssxYxFqqdbuO1lz1Gxa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818393806/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"473667472","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/473667472?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446297140,"RTCI":0}}},"1818739563":{"id":"1818739563","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818739563?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":2,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","House"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rob-hilgen/1149450222","name":"You Are Everywhere - Single","artistName":"Rob Hilgen","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ff/da/f5/ffdaf517-e236-346e-8fdb-815a3b8dff58/8718723290883.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"2e2a27","textColor2":"111111","textColor4":"2e2a28","textColor1":"111110","bgColor":"a29186","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-are-everywhere-single/1818739563","playParams":{"id":"1818739563","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818739563/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1149450222","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1149450222?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753454336294,"RTCI":0}}},"1819523017":{"id":"1819523017","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819523017?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Alternative Folk","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tors/1049138636","name":"Songs From The Road, Vol. 1 - EP","artistName":"Tors","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6e/f4/7b/6ef47b92-f067-ce88-b6ca-2dcb79b08d38/199350839191.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"4e4d4c","textColor2":"28261d","textColor4":"524f48","textColor1":"242222","bgColor":"f8f7f5","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/songs-from-the-road-vol-1-ep/1819523017","playParams":{"id":"1819523017","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819523017/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1049138636","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1049138636?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753443068085,"RTCI":0}}},"1819581569":{"id":"1819581569","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819581569?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Country","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1e/c6/e4/1ec6e4e7-bd6e-598b-ff67-cc2f59e0ed26/8db0d29c-cdbf-4ff1-adea-70413ef54627.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"b19c83","textColor2":"cea984","textColor4":"a88a6d","textColor1":"d9bfa0","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/23/7a/66/237a6672-2693-7ccc-f6bb-325a7df36217/34233c80-3bed-4e15-948b-1d8516369e34.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"c6c1ba","textColor2":"e0d9cf","textColor4":"bdb7af","textColor1":"ece5dd","bgColor":"32302e","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cam/975711021","name":"All Things Light","artistName":"Cam","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"This fourth studio album from Cam opens with a powerful statement.

Such heady themes abound on <i>All Things Light</i>, the follow-up to 2020’s <i>The Otherside</i> and Cam’s first solo project since contributing vocals, production, and songwriting to Beyoncé’s groundbreaking album <i>COWBOY CARTER</i>. \n\nEarly single “Alchemy” gets trippy, with dizzying vocal harmonies and slightly discordant guitar playing off one another as Cam considers natural wonders like “patterns in the grass” and the cycle of “dust to flesh to bones to dust” that makes up human mortality. Other highlights include “Kill the Guru!,” a dark and dusky rebuke of new age grifters with easy answers, and “Hallelujah,” a deeply searching portrayal of seeking truth and light in a world gone

Emperor's New Clothes","artistName":"Raekwon","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"There’s aging like fine wine, and then there’s Raekwon. The Wu-Tang Clan legend’s solo debut, <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…</i>, is rightfully revered as one of the greatest rap albums of all time, a benchmark release for the mafioso rap that so many other MCs would attempt to emulate in the decades that followed. But aside from that, his albums from the late 2000s forward unlocked a sharper curatorial ear and are largely more consistent than his works that preceded them. Early Wu-Tang music had an indispensable feeling, and the rapper known as The Chef has found ways to recreate it without allowing it to feel stale.\n\n<i>The Emperor’s New Clothes</i> finds Raekwon delivering more of the lucid street raps that make him great: crystal clear portraiture of characters down to the details of their clothing or the amount of money in their pockets, fluid storytelling, and popping shit while depicting a life of luxury. He’s strongest here while flexing his skills alongside other elite MCs: He highlights multiple Wu-Tang Clan members, a change from his previous album <i>The Wild</i>. Along with strong verses by Inspectah Deck and Method Man, longtime comrade Ghostface Killah has three features, with their chemistry at its best on the luxurious album closer, “Mac & Lobster.”\n\nRaekwon and Nas (whose label, Mass Appeal, houses the release) both shine on “The Omerta,” and he welcomes coke-rap torchbearers Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine on “Wild Corsicans.” Rae also takes time for a couple moments of introspection.

Even still, on 2024’s <i>LA PANTERA NEGRA</i> and its successor <i>LYKE MIIKE</i>, the Puerto Rican star summarily illustrated the two most prevalent sides of his catalog. The global pop of the former and the rugged hip-hop of the latter spotlit just how far he’d come from his Latin trap roots. For others lucky enough to be in his enviable position, that might be enough of a musical foundation to spend the rest of a career honing and tweaking. \n\nAnd yet the frequent departures that make up <i>ISLAND BOYZ</i> show Towers valuing fulfillment over mere contentment, providing another series of lenses through which to view him. That first word of his latest album’s title offers the most glaring hint as to its contents, a tropical assortment of inherently summery songs that significantly diversify his established hitmaking sensibilities. The distinctive dancehall reggae iterations of “ME HACES FALTA” and “SUNBLOCK,” as well as the airy Afrobeats escapades of “EXPECTATIVAS” and “PIÑA COLADA / LAS PALMAS,” capture the romantic drama of days spent with sun and sand as well as the sensual promises of nighttime. Others, like “TENGO CELOS,” the duet “SEÑORA” with Manuel Turizo, and the Quevedo-assisted “SOLEAO” share a sonic kinship of sorts with some of his most mainstream charting singles, albeit without relying on the safety of reggaetón’s guardrails. \n\n“BUCHANANS 18” and “POR UN QLO ASÍ” situate Towers in more recognizable musical circumstances, as does “NO QUIERE FLORES” with música mexicana star Gabito Ballesteros. However, even when he does veer towards the familiar, he often does so in order to defy expectations. “DE GYM,” for instance, could easily have taken a more straightforward thumping path instead of the twistier one it turns towards. The same applies to “SE REVELÓ,” which accents its frenzied merengue with reggaetón bursts. \n\nPerhaps more impressive is the way he lures other Latin acts into these different formats, be it with DFZM on “LA DESPEDIDA” or iZaak on “SURFERITA.” Nigerian singer Omah Lay does his part in the cultural exchange of “NO HAY BREAK,” produced by no less than the like-minded Jamaican genre-hopper Rvssian.\n","short":"Global pop gets a tropical infusion from the Latin star."},"artwork":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/c9/f5/84c9f544-c586-8018-4fc9-b001f4c28cd7/5021732854643.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2400,"textColor3":"38332f","textColor2":"181b1b","textColor4":"383432","textColor1":"171916","bgColor":"bb9b91","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/island-boyz/1822664085","playParams":{"id":"1822664085","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3YC3UkufiKRSwdBA1BDfHj"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1822664085/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1210225867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1210225867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753446025421,"RTCI":0}}},"1823627665":{"id":"1823627665","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823627665?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":22,"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a8/e0/c8/a8e0c871-0c1d-38ff-2db1-2f4439a3cfe5/20706a05-52e6-4ee0-8d07-337307439f43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"a1a6a3","textColor2":"cdcdb9","textColor4":"a4a698","textColor1":"cacdc7","bgColor":"010d16","hasP3":true},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c6/a6/21/c6a62192-8698-fc79-ad48-5457a4c506a2/20a4bf05-69c2-48b0-baa6-16a891b2360e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"cf9e38","textColor2":"e6b03f","textColor4":"bc9136","textColor1":"ffc241","bgColor":"141312","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bts/883131348","name":"PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE (LIVE)","artistName":"BTS","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Live Album","standard":"When BTS held their Permission to Dance on Stage concerts in Los Angeles in late 2021, the K-pop group known for their meticulous, vibrant performances hadn’t been in front of a live audience in more than two years. The short tour would include 12 concerts across three cities (Los Angeles, Seoul, and Las Vegas) and a set list that combined some of BTS’s most enduring hits (e.g. “Burning Up (FIRE),” “Blood Sweat & Tears,” “Spring Day”) with tracks the group had never before performed in front of fans due to the ongoing pandemic (e.g. “ON,” “Black Swan,” “Life Goes On”).\n\nIn mid-2025, after their return from mandatory military service, the Korean septet released an album version of the historic performances titled <i>Permission to Dance on Stage</i>. It includes 22 tracks that featured on the Permission to Dance on Stage set list, including remixed versions of their 2019 Halsey funk-pop collaboration “Boy with Luv” and English-language hits “Dynamite” and “Butter” with a live band. Deeper cuts include B-sides off of their 2020 mid-pandemic album <i>BE</i> (e.g. melancholic pop ballad “Blue & Grey,” social-ills-themed hip-hop track “Dis-ease”) and “Silver Spoon,” an urgent rap tirade against Korea’s rigid class hierarchy from 2015’s <i>Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2</i>.\n\nAs BTS’s inaugural live album, <i>Permission to Dance on Stage</i> captures the group’s stage presence eight years into their careers, at a distinctive moment in global pop history.

The Northern Irish duo composed the official soundtrack to a larger audio-visual installation of the same name, which spotlights climate change and Indigenous life across the Arctic region. It connected them with a wide-ranging group of Indigenous artists, including throat-singing duo Silla, composer Niilas, and Sebastian Enequist of heavy metal band Sound of the Damned.\n\nThe word <i>takkuuk</i> (pronounced “tuck-kook”) means “look” in Inuktitut in a commanding sense. As part of the In Place of War charity’s EarthSonic program, Bicep’s Andy Ferguson traveled to Greenland in 2023, where he immersed himself in the landscapes and the community, learning the environmental and cultural challenges locals face. Along the way, he collected hours of field recordings—from the fizzing sounds of the Russell Glacier to husky chains—fragments of which the duo reshaped into chords, drums, and ambience. When the Indigenous artists sent back their vocal and instrumental parts, the duo changed course. Rather than lead the tracks, they shifted the focus to their collaborators, building each piece around their voices and stories.\n\nRapper Tarrak delivers a dark and hypnotic performance in Kalaallisut (an Inuit dialect of Greenland) on “Taarsitillugu,” while on “Dárbbuo,” Nordic singer Katarina Barruk pleads for peace in Ume Sámi (a critically endangered language) with melancholic grace. And on the title track, Silla’s throat-singing is a mesmerizing display of rhythmic breathwork. Beneath it all, frosty breakbeats emerge alongside windswept textures and synths that glitter like ice in the sun. <i>TAKKUUK</i> may not be a traditional Bicep release, but that’s the point. This isn’t music for casual raving.

A Woman (& A Good Ol' Boy)","artistName":"Thomas Rhett","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Deluxe Edition and Interview","standard":"Seven albums into his career, Thomas Rhett is in a comfortable place. The country superstar has more No. 1 hits than he can count on two hands, and also found happiness offstage with his wife and children, who serve as a primary inspiration for this follow-up to 2022’s <i>Where We Started</i>. Comfort doesn’t mean complacency, though, and on <i>About a Woman</i> Rhett digs more deeply into his personal experiences, sharing intimate stories about marriage, parenthood, and nostalgia for one’s youth.\n\n“What Could Go Right” is a tender portrait of friendship growing into love, inspired by Rhett’s own marriage. “Church” taps into Rhett’s longtime love of fellow singer-songwriter Eric Church, connecting the Chief’s music to youthful romance. “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman” is a slinky groove with twangy flourishes, reminiscent of earlier Rhett tracks like “It Goes Like This” and “Craving You.” The thematic and musical centerpiece of the record is “I Could Spend Forever Loving You,” a spare and sincere love song that’s sure to show up on wedding playlists. \n\nRhett first expanded upon <i>About a Woman</i> with the <i>From a Small Town</i> edition of the album, which shook up the original tracklist and added five new tunes. That iteration kicks off with the Tucker Wetmore collaboration “Small Town Girls,” a loose and groovy ode to women living the simple life. Lanie Gardner joins Rhett on an updated version of “What Could Go Right,” upping the romance with a duet-style performance. Rounding out the mix of new collaborations is Teddy Swims, who lends his powerful, soulful voice to an alternate take of fan favorite “Somethin’ ’Bout a Woman.” \n\nThis third <i>(& a Good Ol’ Boy)</i> edition adds three more tracks, taking Rhett’s original vision for the album even further. Front-loaded at the beginning of the album, the trio of new songs begins with the Jordan Davis collaboration “Ain’t a Bad Life,” a sweet and rootsy celebration of country living that reinforces the LP’s familial theme. Blake Shelton joins Rhett on “Old Tricks,” an old-school rocker that gives both singers space to show off their ranges. And “Bottle with Your Name on It” should appeal to fans of Rhett’s more soulful side as he gets funky with some tight harmonies and wah-wah guitar. Below, Rhett talks through a few of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Ain’t a Bad Life”</b>\n“Say what you will about collaborations in 2025—maybe it's oversaturated, maybe it's not. I just love to do collaborations with my friends, and Jordan has just become one of my really, really close buddies. The hook of the song is ‘Ain't a bad life for a good ol’ boy.’ Me and Jordan were in Arkansas last year duck hunting, and my brother-in-law was out there shooting video, and me and Jordan just got to goof off and do a bunch of the content for the song. I've been playing this song acoustic in soundcheck, and the song just gives me chills. It kind of gives me ‘What's Your Country Song’-like vibes, if you will.”\n\n<b>“Old Tricks”</b>\n“I wrote with my producer Julian Bunetta and a guy named John Ryan. It had always been a band and crew favorite, and we ended up getting Blake Shelton on this track. It’s kind of self-explanatory, but basically the hook of the song is ‘My old tricks don't work anymore.’ In college I could drink 10 beers a day and wake up ready to do it again. At 35, it takes two full days to recover from that. Blake hops on the second verse, and it, in such special Blake fashion, just made the song 150% better.”\n\n<b>“Bottle with Your Name on It”</b>\n“It is the sore thumb of the deluxe, if you will. I wrote it with Julian and John on the exact same trip [as ‘Old Tricks’], and we were literally trying to shoot for this Aerosmith ‘Dude (Looks Like a Lady)’ kind of vibe. We wrote this song. It's basically just about, ‘Hey, you haven't let loose in a while,’ talking about my wife. But the production is so sick, and it makes me want to punch through a brick wall.”\n\n<b>“Overdrive”</b>\n“A song like ‘Overdrive’ would be directly centered towards high school kids—and then people that even, maybe, were high school sweethearts or got back together later in life—to go to reminisce on how innocent that time was. And how just because you’re kind of young, dumb, and reckless at 16 doesn’t mean that you can’t also still be there when you’re 35 or 55.”\n\n<b>“Gone Country”</b>\n“I wish I could say that I had this crazy story of dating this girl that flew in from Chicago and all these things, but I don’t have that story. For me, that song came about, and I’ve shared this story a couple of times, but just being at [Nashville’s] BNA [airport] and realizing how massive our genre has become. For me, it’s always been massive, because it’s what I’ve done for a living and what I’ve been so inundated with. Even people that did not grow up country, they’re just like, ‘I really like this way of living.’ You know what I mean? And that’s sort of where the inspiration from that song came from.”\n\n<b>“Church”</b>\n“The first two Eric Church records—I remember getting my first truck at 16, and Eric Church then was [like] listening to Zach Bryan now. It was kind of underground. He was the outlaw. He would sing about words that you couldn’t say on mainstream radio, all this stuff. So, me and all my buddies, that was our favorite. So, the original way this song got pitched to me was, it ended in heartbreak, like the guy and the girl never saw each other again, but he always reminisced over that time that they bonded over Eric Church. And so I came in on the back half and just rewrote the bridge and the last chorus, because [my story with my wife] ended differently.”\n\n<b>“What Could Go Right”</b>\n“I’ve tried to write that song a million different times, and it has always come out extremely corny and extremely cheesy. And a couple of the guys in the group are dating. One’s married and has kids and all this kind of stuff. And I was telling them about this night that I had with [my wife] Lauren when I was like 21 years old. [We] both were in long relationships with other people, and both kind of ended our relationship with other people at the same time. But there was always, in the back of my mind, this wonder of, like, ‘I wonder if we could ever date again.’ You know what I mean? Because we dated a little bit in high school. That whole song, I was telling the guys on the bus this story, and my buddy John is just writing, taking notes, soaking it all in. And I went to go get some food, and I came back, and they had written the verse and the chorus, and they were like, ‘Does this do it for you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s amazing.’”\n\n<b>“I Could Spend Forever Loving You”</b>\n“I think when I dream of what me and Lauren are going to look like and be doing at 70 years old, all I see is a front porch and a river and a cup of coffee. You know what I’m saying? So, I think it’s always good to dream in your marriage. It’s always good to kind of dream about the future. It’s OK to regret the past. Don’t harp on it, but also, it’s fun to reminisce on the past. Your youth doesn’t have to die because you have kids. Your youth doesn’t have to die just because you’ve been married for 10 years. And it really is a testament to knowing how much love can grow if you’ll allow it.”\n","short":"The second expanded edition of his 2024 album adds three more tracks."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f9/e2/90/f9e290b1-bc22-ec3b-6738-1110907cecc6/25BMR0006802.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"81aeba","textColor2":"7dcce0","textColor4":"6ca6b6","textColor1":"97d6e5","bgColor":"27100e","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/about-a-woman-a-good-ol-boy/1823991614","playParams":{"id":"1823991614","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7vWt3Oe027TmVOxBBVKrIC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823991614/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"502541718","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/502541718?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753427935147,"RTCI":0}}},"1824019687":{"id":"1824019687","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824019687?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Hip-Hop","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a7/18/4f/a7184f84-6363-069d-b468-4fe1efc8973a/4080c3ca-2959-4a18-b813-adf762f9f9f2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"82a6b5","textColor2":"adce67","textColor4":"8ea856","textColor1":"9fccde","bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1e/59/92/1e59927a-b28a-c38b-6404-a5700d71dbf0/56c54f98-afbe-4920-b916-c7d86b24dba5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"dbb09f","textColor2":"f6b7f8","textColor4":"d7a0db","textColor1":"facaad","bgColor":"5e4866","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=302166615-28446224","name":"Alfredo 2","artistName":"Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"Few pairings in modern hip-hop history have had the impact of Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist. More than just another timely rapper-producer duo project, 2020’s <i>Alfredo</i> differed in tone from the former’s critically acclaimed collabs with Madlib and the latter’s work with Action Bronson, Boldy James, and Earl Sweatshirt. However, capturing the unique magic of a confirmed classic a second time around has challenged many in this genre, as so many middling sequels show. In this case, though, both artists rise to the proverbial occasion with cinematic flair, changing the thematic crime scenery from mafioso to yakuza along the way.\n\nSimply titled <i>Alfredo 2</i>, their recorded reunion draws from a corresponding short film released ahead of the album drop, the narrative playing up their perceived distance only to bring them back together in dramatic fashion. Even without that context, these 14 songs showcase what makes their partnership so dynamic. Gibbs is downright gripping from the get-go, riding the gleaming groove of “1995” with cocksure bars likening him and his cohort to <i>Lethal Weapon</i> heroes Riggs and Murtaugh. That attitude persists on the defiant “Skinny Suge II” and the profane “Lemon Pepper Steppers,” both backed by airy, jazz-inflected production. \n\nHis way with words remains poetically brash, vividly detailing his point of view on cuts like “Gas Station Sushi” and “Mar-a-Lago.” Yet as good as these verses would sound even over some pretty basic boom-bap, Alchemist’s instrumentals elevate the proceedings without fail. His ability to cultivate and maintain a vibe is all but unparalelled, putting listeners at ease with the hazy comforts of “I Still Love H.E.R.” and “Jean Claude.” Elsewhere, he exercises an extraordinary restraint with the soul of “Shangri La,” never letting the samples overpower the MC.","short":"The magic is back!

It comes in at that moment in a session where the first bit of tiredness bubbles up and, consequently, when the mind starts thinking about perhaps cutting a session short. This track—in sound and title—does an amazing job of replenishing the energy and motivation, and pulling focus back to the goal.”\n","short":"The trance icon mixes a set for athletes “to push themselves to the limit.”"},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2f/e9/23/2fe9231e-4c10-a0bf-b04b-d763c401b8a5/ab4525a6-0e4b-4c0b-a229-296342d41fbd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"262727","textColor2":"151515","textColor4":"2c2d2d","textColor1":"0e0d0d","bgColor":"898d8c","hasP3":true},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-run-july-2025-dj-mix/1824311105","playParams":{"id":"1824311105","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824311105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"17976294","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/17976294?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1752597090801,"RTCI":0}}},"1824338876":{"id":"1824338876","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824338876?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":10,"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-18","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e3/72/0e/e3720e8c-93b4-5c0e-0b7f-3c8e5a064962/Job494d308d-3c0c-43ea-b302-591c6bb6059a-196494725-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384830688_2236338665-Time1751567752662.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","18161d"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ededeb"},"height":2732,"textColor3":"404344","textColor2":"18161d","textColor4":"444248","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ededeb","hasP3":false},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4c/37/e6/4c37e616-d20d-7af8-4768-9cdede1371b1/4e4ef6bb-babd-4d99-ac7d-c01692e30dd1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"2c3940","textColor2":"242525","textColor4":"3a4145","textColor1":"131b1e","bgColor":"90b3c6","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/97/5a/20/975a2007-bab9-d758-8589-f08f8f8316c5/Job40edd38a-abab-4caf-9828-436c52178dd1-196494726-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_384830687_2236338664-Time1751569308154.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","32302f"],"gradient":{"y2":0.48,"color":"ededeb"},"height":3840,"textColor3":"343433","textColor2":"32302f","textColor4":"595857","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ededeb","hasP3":false},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/21/08/30/21083008-fd61-60b8-c0bb-fc913673ad25/df73e09f-eb41-41cf-a323-7854d07b72ca.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2240,"textColor3":"2c2c2c","textColor2":"0a0a0a","textColor4":"2c2c2c","textColor1":"0a0a0a","bgColor":"b5b5b4","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/j-balvin/444520760","name":"Mixteip","artistName":"J Balvin","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Release","standard":"Back in the summer of 2024, when J Balvin dropped the refocused and revitalized <i>Rayo</i>, he revealed to Apple Music that he had three more albums’ worth of material at the ready. Given how diverse that full-length was, the Colombian hitmaker hinted that what could follow might be similarly expansive from a genre perspective. Yet regardless of whether or not <i>Mixteip</i> contains any of those recordings, this relatively shorter follow-up seizes upon the flexibility of its titular format to show a range of styles over which he can shine and thrive.\n\nWell-timed with a certain cinematic superhero’s reboot, opener “Bruz Wein” harkens back to his rise during the Latin trap surge of the mid- to late 2010s as he proffers hazy, nocturnal bars. Naturally, his status as an elite reggaetonero ensures there are plenty of dembow-driven moments like “No Te Olvido,” the slinky single “Rio,” and the comparatively poppier “Zun Zun” with Lenny Tavárez and Justin Quiles. Subtly calling back to “La Canción,” the slo-mo “PQBL” shifts into a more balladic mode to match its heartbroken theme without sacrificing the rhythm.\n\nMore surprising are Balvin’s successful forays into genres less characteristic of his catalog, generally achieved through credible collaborations with known entities. Veteran salsero Gilberto Santa Rosa gradually guides him into a tropical space with the timely “Misterio” while Dominican merengue Omega raises the tempo considerably for their irresistible “KLK.” The unmistakably British hip-hop sound of “Uuu” benefits both from Stormzy’s prominent feature and the ease with which his host adjusts to the urgency of its beat.","short":"The Colombian hitmaker flexes

Butch 2","artistName":"Benny the Butcher","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"For Benny the Butcher, feeding the streets is more than just a business strategy. As the Buffalo rapper builds his Black Soprano Family brand, he concurrently makes clear his determined aspirations towards earning a spot in the top-five-dead-or-alive vanguard of elite MCs. With the release of <i>Summertime Butch 2</i>, a sequel to his well-received 2024 project, he adds another audio document to the growing dossier comprising his craft. \n\nAfter letting Griselda comrade Westside Gunn get a few Flygod bars off on “Jasmine’s,” he proceeds to lay into the current state of rap music, lambasting the lyrical laziness and pop aspirations of a mercifully unnamed cluster of subpar artists. On “Told You So,” he deflects criticism from those who overvalue mainstream chart placements while cruising down his personalized path to hip-hop greatness. Later, he reaffirms both his dope-boy bona fides and his underground classics on “77 Club,” demonstrating a linkage with the past criminality that now thematically fuels his creativity.\n\nGuests like Bruiser Wolf and OT The Real operate at a high level alongside a never-complacent Benny on the Daringer-produced “Hood on Fire” and Nickel Plated’s “Gold Plated Leica,” respectively. Other collabs like the booming “In the Wall” with Bun B and “Why Would I” with G Herbo take him out of his well-established trap-house comfort zone, yet he adapts his knowledgeably streetwise flows with sweat-free dexterity over those beats. Naturally, he shows love for his BSF insiders, making space for Elcamino and Duckman on the cinematic “Pandoras.” \n","short":"Another stunning document in the Griselda rapper’s dossier."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3c/2c/80/3c2c805e-ebee-70f3-13ab-15aa781d0664/199538144505.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"333333","textColor2":"232323","textColor4":"434344","textColor1":"0e0e0e","bgColor":"c6c6c7","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/summertime-butch-2/1825212638","playParams":{"id":"1825212638","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/15Coiav9QHvI7TRvfouPXn"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825212638/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1281676587","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1281676587?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753445813702,"RTCI":0}}},"1825306487":{"id":"1825306487","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825306487?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":4,"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shadowbourne/1639762321","name":"Palingenesis - EP","artistName":"SHADOWBOURNE","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/03/ce/9b/03ce9b17-0266-bae4-2d1f-11d847437b7b/25UMGIM92560.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a0accc","textColor2":"adb5f5","textColor4":"8c93c5","textColor1":"c7d5fd","bgColor":"060908","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/palingenesis-ep/1825306487","playParams":{"id":"1825306487","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825306487/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1639762321","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1639762321?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753442977309,"RTCI":0}}},"1825449804":{"id":"1825449804","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825449804?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":9,"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/boiler-room/1772319577","name":"Rectify","artistName":"Boiler Room","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6d/22/e7/6d22e7dd-ebb2-f0ca-9614-b19a807dbd69/605491114177.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"a3a9ad","textColor2":"fa8220","textColor4":"ce6e21","textColor1":"c3ccd0","bgColor":"222022","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rectify/1825449804","playParams":{"id":"1825449804","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0MfzlVQ8FDyTCdCo1pXqKg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825449804/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1772319577","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1772319577?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753443104407,"RTCI":0}}},"1825489334":{"id":"1825489334","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825489334?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":6,"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anabel-englund/463022867","name":"Born to Fly - EP","artistName":"Anabel Englund","artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bd/f7/e6/bdf7e681-2b97-9a36-05ba-096028a90347/196873398129.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"b8b9be","textColor2":"ced0db","textColor4":"abadb6","textColor1":"dedfe5","bgColor":"201f24","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/born-to-fly-ep/1825489334","playParams":{"id":"1825489334","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/79rPw6bPRYr0VsjY3YfX80"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825489334/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"463022867","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/463022867?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753418827989,"RTCI":0}}},"1825504009":{"id":"1825504009","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1825504009?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":12,"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/quinn-xcii/1048237637","name":"LOOK!

For <i>THIS IS FOR</i>, TWICE’s fourth full-length album since their 2015 debut, the third-generation squad slides into a comparatively subdued cool-girl persona to explore overlapping themes of female empowerment and romantic frustration, artfully navigating the space between K-pop’s “girl crush” and “bubblegum pop” false binary. \n\nThe cool-girl persona is especially on display in <i>THIS IS FOR</i>’s title track, a high-energy song that starts with a chuckle and a shout-out: “This is for all my ladies who don’t get hyped enough/If you’ve been done wrong, then this your song, so turn it up.” TWICE makes room for feelings of otherness on “THIS IS FOR” before using the synth-pop bop “MARS” to expand on the theme: “Do you ever feel like/You don’t belong in the world?” The tale of tested confidence continues in the rolling rhythms of “G.O.A.T.,” a subunit song that has members Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung comparing themselves to a phoenix rising from the ashes in the aftermath of a breakup: “Got me on a roll, yeah, I breathe fire/Try to bring me low but I go higher.”\n\nReleased in TWICE’s 10th year as a K-pop group and in the immediate aftermath of the JYP Entertainment squad’s successful contributions to the <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> soundtrack, <i>THIS IS FOR</i> sees the group also preparing for their This Is For world tour. The 14-track, mostly English-language album includes five subunit songs that fit particularly well into a high-energy set list as an opportunity for non-participating members to rest. In addition to “G.O.A.T.,” they include “BATTITUDE” (Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, and Mina), “DAT AHH DAT OOH” (Sana, Jihyo, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu), “LET LOVE GO” (Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, and Tzuyu), and “TALK” (Nayeon and Jihyo).\n","short":"The K-pop veterans celebrate female empowerment on their fourth

accomplished a DJ as Green Lantern—or even Green’s counterpart in the <i>Live from the Mothership</i> series, Snoopadelic (also known as hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg)—you share music with the world however and whenever you want to. The second iteration of their collaborative mix project finds the pair serving up their personal favorite funk, soul, and R&B classics—with a few eyebrow-raising updates—as a healing balm for the troubles of the modern world.\n\n“The world is in need of good vibrations,” Snoopadelic tells Apple Music. “The Mothership Connection is making an <i>Emergency Landing</i>. Me and Green Lantern [are] taking you from P-funk to G-funk and everything in between, Death Row style!” That means the infallible work of Parliament-Funkadelic, Kool & The Gang, and Rick James, of course, along with updates from voices like October London, JANE HANDCOCK, and Diamond Ortiz. As a listening experience, <i>Live from the Mothership II</i> feels like what would be playing at either Snoop or Green Lantern’s homes. “The Mothership project is all about raising the vibration, taking you higher musically,” Green Lantern says. “Imagine a cool-ass house party in outer space—that’s us!”","short":"“Imagine a cool-ass house party in outer space—that’s us!”"},"artwork":{"width":1600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/41/4f/3a/414f3ab8-40bf-81de-1b34-04db0d111dc6/e68ab54f-7943-423a-a28c-e277068da7aa.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1600,"textColor3":"91a1ac","textColor2":"87c0ca","textColor4":"759fa7","textColor1":"abc2d0","bgColor":"2b1a1a","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/live-from-the-mothership-ii-emergency-landing-dj-mix/1826183840","playParams":{"id":"1826183840","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826183840/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"21769","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/21769?l=en-US"},{"id":"157056085","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/157056085?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753443169555,"RTCI":0}}},"1826198165":{"id":"1826198165","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826198165?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":14,"genreNames":["Dance","Music","Trance"],"releaseDate":"2025-05-17","editorialArtwork":{},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=252189518-15956984","name":"ARTY b2b Mat Zo at Anjuna25 in NYC, May 17, 2025 (DJ Mix)","artistName":"Mat Zo & ARTY","artwork":{"width":2000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/90/28/ca/9028ca04-bf97-c80c-c017-60adeb06cf6e/61a48bce-8f1c-4847-ac0f-d99b258edcbf.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2000,"textColor3":"cacacb","textColor2":"dadada","textColor4":"b8b8b9","textColor1":"f1f1f1","bgColor":"313133","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/arty-b2b-mat-zo-at-anjuna25-in-nyc-may-17-2025-dj-mix/1826198165","playParams":{"id":"1826198165","kind":"album"}},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826198165/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"252189518","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/252189518?l=en-US"},{"id":"15956984","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/15956984?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753443147389,"RTCI":0}}},"1826557409":{"id":"1826557409","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826557409?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":1,"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Rock"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-24","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/7f/56/a2/7f56a23b-9e7d-e191-7d8f-22b27ec6c376/62a06982-6a16-48d8-9c56-6968cdb11353.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"202123","textColor2":"101315","textColor4":"292c2f","textColor1":"040506","bgColor":"8e8f98","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/slot-machine/281011495","name":"Far Side of the Moon (“Shine”  Original Soundtrack) -

After the pleas for privacy on some of that 2024 album’s most memorable tracks—not least acerbic single “Noid”—his pugilistic 1980s rapper cosplay on the cover of the subsequent semi-surprise release <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> appears a continuation of that sentiment.\n\nThe contents of this significantly shorter follow-up to the critically acclaimed, commercially successful full-length are quite intentionally a big step away from the array of revelations, rebukes, and storytelling that defined <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i>. Judging by the opening robotic commands of “Big Poe,” Tyler is dead set against baring his soul for his fans again, explicitly prioritizing danceability over “that deep shit” as the tenet behind <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i>. Then, as with fictionalized alter egos like Wolf Haley and IGOR, he assumes the song title’s identity as his latest character, embodying this hedonist with a stream of winking profanity over a bed of N.E.R.D-esque synth-rock. Later, the sub-bass-blasted “Stop Playing with Me” operates in a similar thematic and sonic space, inherently threatening yet undeniably catchy. \n\nIn a way, <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> spiritually calls back to The Notorious B.I.G.’s unapologetically reclaimed “Party and Bullshit” ethos, with music that resembles the funk and dance styles that the late Mr. Smalls would no doubt have vibed to during the 1980s and early 1990s. From the squelchy electro of “Sugar on My Tongue” through the retro R&B boogie of “Ring Ring Ring” and “Sucka Free,” the genre callbacks offer comforting grooves for Tyler to melt into. His oft-caustic voice transforms into an ephemeral texture on “Don’t You Worry Baby,” a seductive bit of bass and breaks nudged along by his quiet commands. \n\nYet, even at the times when he seems conspicuously absent from the festivities, as on “I’ll Take Care of You,” it’s really because he’s cultivated a jam he can admire from somewhere above the dance floor. Call <i>DON’T TAP THE GLASS</i> escapism if you must, but it sure feels hella good in this club.","short":"Tyler’s back, this time prioritizing danceability over deepness."},"artwork":{"width":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a0/ae/e6/a0aee657-b365-fed2-249c-0f22efa507d0/196873435435.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3000,"textColor3":"673f3d","textColor2":"372b1e","textColor4":"5d5347","textColor1":"431111","bgColor":"f8f5ec","hasP3":false},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-tap-the-glass/1827715784","playParams":{"id":"1827715784","kind":"album"},"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1jzv3jwZbt8lYfEtMjiD1R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1827715784/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"420368335","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/420368335?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1753454145231,"RTCI":0}}},"1828031721":{"id":"1828031721","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828031721?l=en-US","attributes":{"trackCount":20,"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Downtempo"],"releaseDate":"2025-07-25","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionCover":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/16/54/fc/1654fcca-aac7-00e2-37d7-73e16f03946e/ae2c7960-876e-4b6d-86cf-8a4e0da37b1f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","gradient":{},"height":1080,"textColor3":"391b10","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"3a1c12","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"f5794b","hasP3":true},"staticDetailTall":{"width":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8e/c9/87/8ec987e3-4c0c-58d9-7a3e-5791588be5fe/6b98a2f2-e9df-4c27-b28b-ad794fd1d7c7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2732,"textColor3":"241a30","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"251b32","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ad7ef5","hasP3":true},"superHeroWide":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/95/11/27/951127b2-0c49-659a-d871-6e806a89b99c/40dfc74d-1fb5-42ad-8b31-01d0779aa569.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1800,"textColor3":"381c13","textColor2":"0c0503","textColor4":"3a1d14","textColor1":"090402","bgColor":"f47d58","hasP3":true},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/20/22/47/20224740-d9e0-4afe-bfa3-d0cc864e88b4/e01679fd-f606-4cee-8a5f-7b5c45813350.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"391c11","textColor2":"0c0604","textColor4":"3a1d13","textColor1":"0a0402","bgColor":"f5794b","hasP3":true},"staticDetailSquare":{"width":3840,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/1f/4b/56/1f4b5640-bd91-2317-ed5f-06c0c4aa5133/a9161e44-4570-456c-9c45-9677807827af.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":3840,"textColor3":"2d233b","textColor2":"0b090f","textColor4":"2e243d","textColor1":"09080c","bgColor":"bb8ff7","hasP3":true},"superHeroTall":{"width":1680,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ba/1c/94/ba1c9444-d833-282c-73c2-65c731f1b057/b75121fb-66ee-477b-9069-be8bb06f95ec.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textGradient":["000000","000000"],"height":2240,"textColor3":"452623","textColor2":"000000","textColor4":"582824","textColor1":"000000","bgColor":"ee8f9f","hasP3":true}},"artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-python/600956219","name":"Early Hours (DJ Mix)","artistName":"DJ Python","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New DJ Mix","standard":"“Early hours” can mean a few different things: Are you winding down after being up all night, or are you just rising to meet the sun? New York-based producer DJ Python has put together a mix that greets you where you are. “I think it can work for both,” he tells Apple Music. “It was made in the middle of a breezy day after a good night of sleep. If I’m putting together a chill set, I try to be fresh.”\n\nWhen it comes to choosing his standout tracks from the dreamy mix, DJ Python has two favorites: “TRISTÁN!’s ‘Life Is a Movie’ because of its pure, unabashed songwriting and Robert Lippok’s ‘I Can Tell,’ because there are not many songs about dog ownership.”\n\nDJ Python’s aim is to help you reach the right headspace when you’re in need of a little calm. “It’s a mix to help you relax and inspire reflection and pensiveness,” he says. “Go into your thoughts, of all spectrums, and confront them honestly, and hopefully feel in tune with them.
