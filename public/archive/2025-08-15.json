Firstly, he wondered if it should mark a return to his roots and the soulful, indie-ish sound of <i>Lighting Matches</i>, the 2018 debut that set Grennan on the path to stardom and introduced an artist who could wrap his emotional, powerful vocal around poignant tales of everyday life. \n\nBut there was another, more appealing idea. “I was like, ‘I’m going to roll the dice and give pop star a go,’” Grennan tells Apple Music. It’s a decision that has resulted in <i>Everywhere I Went, Led Me to Where I Didn’t Want to Be</i>, the most exuberant and euphoric record of his career.\n\nHeading to America and working with an A-list cast of producers and writers including Britney Spears and Selena Gomez collaborator Justin Tranter, brother team Connor and Riley McDonough, Cleo Tighe, and more, Grennan has crafted an album with an irrepressible swagger. There are indelible bangers, from the George-Michael-gone-Balearic opening of “Full Attention” to the gospel-house grooves of “Cool with That” and the slick future funk of “Shadows on the Ceiling,” but there are moments of downtempo reflection too, a theme in keeping with where Grennan’s head was at writing these songs. \n\n“When I first started the album, I remember sitting down with the people involved and saying, ‘I want to give pop a go, but I want to do it in my own way,’” he explains. “I need to be honest with what’s going on, and I want it to tell the story of me being 21 to 29 and the journey of what the music industry has been for me.” <i>Everywhere I Went, Led Me to Where I Didn’t Want to Be</i> is Tom Grennan’s jubilant pop statement. He guides us through it, track by track…\n\n<b>“Full Attention”</b>\n“This came from me being in therapy and me being at the forefront of ‘Who did I want to be?’ I’d sat down with my thoughts and faced things head-on. It was me saying, ‘I need to give myself full attention for peace of mind.’ I had to sit down with myself and look through the telescope of life and who was at the end of it: a little boy who just wanted to be loved, and the person who needed to love him was myself. The song unfolded from trying to be in tune with who I wanted to be and where I was at.”\n\n<b>“Cool with That”</b>\n“This is about the night I met my wife. It’s about understanding the person I was and the issues and the demons I had, and her going, ‘We will face them head-on together and everything will be cool with that at the end of it all.’ It’s about that night and feeling like, ‘Wow, I’ve already fallen in love with this person, however, still got a lot of shit I need to fix up before I can give it my all.’”\n\n<b>“Shadowboxing”</b>\n“This was the first song I wrote for the album. Again, it’s me fighting with my inner beast and that inner thing that I have to fight with daily. Even now, it’s like the devil and the angel on my shoulder and the battles that I have to get through every day to find peace again. I think that’s what shaped the whole album. I’ve always got to battle and I’ve always had to do that. I knew it was going to be a Marmite [love-it-or-hate-it] song, but that’s fine. Even for me, it’s a little bit Marmite sometimes but I think lyrically, it’s probably the most honest I’ve ever been in verses.”\n\n<b>“Boys Don’t Cry”</b>\n“This is about a lot of things. It’s the first time me and my friends had an honest, open conversation about emotions and men’s emotions. I’m from a working-class background in a small town. I’ve lived in London and a lot of people are in a bubble and forget there are all these little English towns that still have this kind of narrative that men have to be strong and never show weakness. I come from an alpha male friendship group that is very ‘How do we break each other down?’ I think it’s the first time we showed vulnerability to each other and spoke as men and said the deepest things that we’ve had to share with each other. That gave me the idea of ‘Boys Don’t Cry.’”\n\n<b>“Somewhere Only We Go”</b>\n“‘Somewhere Only We Go’ is about life, friendship groups, loved ones, and people that are in your life who you think are going to be there forever. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. It’s about someone who was one of my best friends and, unfortunately, life happens and people can drift apart. Even with all the malice and the shit that happened between us, it’s also saying, ‘You’re still a massive part of my story.’ Hopefully, one day we can reconnect and talk about the old times and go back to the place that only we know and where we grew up together.”\n\n<b>“Shadows on the Ceiling”</b>\n“This is more of a sexy tune. It’s a bit more adult. I feel like being 29 at the time, I’m allowed to show that I do have a romantic side. I’m not just a boy, I’m a grown-up man now. Again, it’s the first time me and my wife realized that we were onto something bigger than just having a relationship. It was longevity, it was magic, so it’s all about that, but bringing sex into it.”\n\n<b>“Celebrate”</b>\n“This says it in the title. It’s celebrating good times. I’ve been at the bottom of the well and I thought I’d never get out. I had glimpses of hope and I have glimpses, again, I keep using the words ‘peace of mind,’ but that’s what it is. I’m always just searching for peace of mind and to repair my soul. ‘Celebrate’ is just me saying, ‘Let’s celebrate family, let’s celebrate life and being alive, man.’ It sounds so clichéd but it is the truth.”\n\n<b>“Higher”</b>\n“I wanted to make a feel-good song. It was a feeling more than anything. I think it was everything I’ve spoken about, from my demons to the angels to the battle. Me figuring a lot of things out of what makes me tick and what makes me feel good and what makes me a better person in general. When you realize that, it’s like a higher power.”\n\n<b>“Certified”</b>\n“‘Certified’ is, again, about my wife, saying, ‘This is a certified thing, this is a done deal, this is a life’s commitment, this is happening.’ Again, it’s all about the story of how we met and what we went through. It’s a positive song. It’s an uplifting song.”\n\n<b>“Diamond”</b>\n“‘Diamond’ is having that rock that glows and makes you glow and makes you feel like you’re a million dollars. When you know you have that person on your right hand or your left arm, whatever it may be, they allow you to glow and you both glow together, and that’s what it’s about.”\n\n<b>“Dirty Dishes”</b>\n“This is me losing all sense of ego and going, ‘Fuck this.’ Again, it’s a feeling, man. I don’t actually know what the fuck this song’s about. There’s loads of shit that it could be about, man. Fuck knows!”\n\n<b>“Cinnamon”</b>\n“‘Cinnamon’ is acknowledging my focus is all on one person, when you see a girl and you’re like, ‘Wow, all these people in here have eyes on you. However, you’ve got eyes on me.’ I don’t want this whole thing to just be like, ‘This record’s about his wife!’ But a lot of it is. ‘Cinnamon’ is seeing somebody in a place where everybody’s looking at them and you’re lucky enough to have their eyes locked onto you and your eyes locked into them and everybody else is insignificant.”\n\n<b>“Drama Queen”</b>\n“‘Drama Queen’…well, I am one. In the past and even in the present, I always overdramatize a situation. That’s a bad trait I have. I always think the worst of myself, and it tells a story of me being in a place where I didn’t think I could come back from. When I look back, I was like, ‘Well man, it wasn’t all too bad.’ But there was a lot of soul-searching in and around the time that this song was written. ‘Drama Queen’ is about being a dramatic cunt sometimes.”\n\n<b>“I Won’t Miss a Thing”</b>\n“This came when my granddad was in hospital and it was me looking at my him and thinking, ‘Wow, life is short and to try and capture every bit of life you possibly can.’ Also, when somebody does pass away, not to believe that they’re not going to be with you and they’re always going to be watching. That gave me peace again where I was like, ‘If he does die tonight, then I think and I hope and I know that he will be always in my heart and helping me along the way.’”\n\n<b>“Lonely Dancer”</b>\n“This the same essence of ‘Cinnamon.’ There’s no rhyme or reason apart from this person knowing that in the moment, everything’s fine and everything is amazing and she can dance on her own. She doesn’t need attention, she doesn’t need anybody to bother her. She’s cool with life. That inspired me. I was like, ‘I wish I was like that. I need to be more like that,’ because I’m just a worrier. I wanted to write a song that, as soon as it’s played, all of the worries go out the window.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Everywhere I Went, Led

R&B’s finest representative discovers his “true essence.”","standard":"There’s something satisfyingly circuitous about the title of Craig David’s ninth studio album, <i>Commitment</i>, neatly coinciding as it does with the 25th anniversary of his game-changing debut, <i>Born to Do It</i>. Sure, his life path may have been fated, but even destiny requires dedication. An unprecedented speed run of an entire career’s worth of achievements for just one album could easily be put down to luck; to be considered one of the most influential voices in R&B—revered and respected by audiences and industry peers alike—and still releasing records 25 years down the line, speaks more to his drive, work ethic, and passion than mere good fortune. The secret to his staying power, as David told fellow R&B star Estelle on a special episode of her Apple Music Radio show, is a little bit of both. “When it’s divine and you can feel it, you get out of the way and you let it be,” he said. “Just step in when you need to step in, lean in when you need to lean in, and the other times, get out of the way.”\n\nIt’s this “let go and let God” attitude that informs <i>Commitment</i>. David exercises the versatility of his buttery-soft vocals with soulful, self-reflective turns at everything from box-fresh garage cuts (album opener “Wake Up”) and heart-pumping, four-to-the-floor club beats (“Leave the Light On”) to stomping country-flavored dance pop (“In Your Hands”), and gentle, acoustic balladry (“Rain”). There’s also two standout collaborations which see David link with powerhouse R&B singer JoJo for the sultry groove “In It With You” and Afrobeats star Tiwa Savage on the mellow-toned title track. “As a big fan of JoJo, to hear her vocals on the record gave my inner child all the smiles,” said David, describing the track as “the type of song I just feel people wouldn’t necessarily expect…It’s hitting a slightly different pocket.” He flips expectations on “Commitment” too, crediting Savage for bringing a new perspective to the track. “I felt like the lyric of that song, she just landed it,” said David, comparing Savage’s contributions to singer-songwriter Muni Long’s work on “Obvious,” a deep cut from his 2022 release, <i>22</i>. “[Long] took it and she spun the song differently. I respected it, because her penmanship was like, ‘This is how we do things,’ and it was the same with Tiwa…I love it when people just do [their] thing.”\n\nThe sheer prolificity of David’s back catalog proves he is welcomed down any avenue he happens to wander and while <i>Commitment</i> puts the myriad influences he has collected over the years on full display, the album’s smooth cohesion rings with a note of unmistakable authenticity that centers around David’s confidence and self-knowledge as an artist. “When you’re young, parts of you are fragmented out. You’re trying to find yourself, and you give parts of yourself away, and you’re trying to fit in,” he said. “The hero’s journey is to go back out there in the wilderness and find all the pieces that you gave away and bring them all back in. That’s the true sentiment of what <i>Commitment</i> is about—being committed to find the true essence of who you really are. Once you get that, then your reference point is you.”","tagline":"New Album and

the difference between his introspective and poppier sides.","standard":"Jordan Davis is a country wild card, zigging where others often zag and sticking to his musical roots regardless of what sounds are dominating country radio. The Shreveport, Louisiana-born singer-songwriter continues that streak on this third full-length, which follows his 2023 album <i>Bluebird Days</i>, a project that spawned four No. 1 country hits. Produced by Paul DiGiovanni, <i>Learn the Hard Way</i> splits the difference between the quieter, more introspective bent of <i>Bluebird Days</i> and the poppier sound of Davis’ debut <i>Home State</i>, offering a fuller sense of his musical ambitions. \n\nHighlights on <i>Learn the Hard Way</i> include “Bar None,” a melodic, soulful account of moving on from heartbreak, and “Jesus Wouldn’t Do,” an introspective ballad about owning imperfection and loving one’s neighbor. Davis taps a couple of friends to join him on the outing, too, with acclaimed singer-songwriter Carly Pearce lending her voice to the heartfelt duet “Mess with Missing You” and blues-rock guitar slinger Marcus King contributing to the funky, swampy “Louisiana Stick,” which pays tribute to Davis’ home state.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Learn The Hard Way","playParams":{"id":"1808972188","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/learn-the-hard-way/1808972188","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/134A79bb9B0FH4ZYxyQ3Sp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1808972188/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1240921740","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1240921740?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242054373,"RTCI":0}}},"1811667096":{"id":"1811667096","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811667096?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Shaki Tavi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shaki-tavi/1490314622","artwork":{"bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fbfbfb","textColor2":"dadada","textColor3":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"b2b2b2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/41/21/d9/4121d944-9b2c-b746-e69c-61b1c8483b59/54149.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Indie Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Minor Slip","playParams":{"id":"1811667096","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/minor-slip/1811667096","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6fPMnGDEpbigaeWzoIJLQy"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811667096/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1490314622","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1490314622?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243098308,"RTCI":0}}},"1811885198":{"id":"1811885198","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811885198?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Marissa Nadler","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marissa-nadler/147817240","artwork":{"bgColor":"d4d4d4","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060606","textColor2":"1c1b1a","textColor3":"2f2f2f","textColor4":"41403f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5e/c5/e4/5ec5e454-6013-a02f-126f-bacdd665033f/54184.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The queen of occult Americana gets back to folk basics.","standard":"Over the course of two decades, Marissa Nadler has absorbed myriad aesthetics—folk, goth, dream pop, doom metal—into her singular brand of occult Americana. And on 2021’s <i>The Path of the Clouds</i>, she executed her most lavish, cinematic, and powerful rendering yet, with the help of special guests like ex-Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde and harpist Mary Lattimore. However, <i>New Radiations</i> sees Nadler going back to old ways, putting the focus squarely on her acoustic guitar-playing and singing. None of these 11 tracks even feature percussion, allowing her double-tracked, self-harmonizing voice to fill the entire canvas of hymns like “It Hits Harder.”\n\nNo song better encapsulates the album’s uncanny balance of haunted and heavenly than the aptly titled “Bad Dreams Summertime.” And while <i>New Radiations</i> features no lack of painterly embellishments from collaborator Milky Burgess—be it the ominous string textures and distorted drones on “Smoke Screen Selene” or the Floydian synth swells on “Weightless Above the Water”—they’re largely used to impressionistic, subliminal effect, representing the turbulent undercurrent of emotions bubbling beneath Nadler’s deceptively serene storytelling.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"name":"New Radiations","playParams":{"id":"1811885198","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/new-radiations/1811885198","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YHjzYtgYMDhlVd11mDRAY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811885198/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"147817240","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/147817240?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243307621,"RTCI":0}}},"1811897147":{"id":"1811897147","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811897147?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Black Keys","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-black-keys/5893059","artwork":{"bgColor":"deded6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"080807","textColor2":"2b2a2b","textColor3":"333230","textColor4":"4f4e4d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d0/a4/2d/d0a42db4-4a20-7eba-645f-3a1abe36630d/093624832881.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"070708","gradient":{"color":"070708","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"1b1d20","textColor3":"343332","textColor4":"444646","textGradient":["ffffff","1b1d20"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3f/2a/f7/3f2af7fa-d2c3-66df-0d3c-48c2d8081270/Job368da169-c6be-4c32-8640-3765d6264e48-193673704-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379398939_2184089525-Time1748560649698.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"070708","gradient":{"color":"070708","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"bfc6bf","textColor3":"c5c4c1","textColor4":"9da39d","textGradient":["ffffff","bfc6bf"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8c/7d/be/8c7dbefc-d604-cc63-cb31-068f21985870/Jobea301bed-09fb-4dde-a831-4c315809e36a-193673705-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_379398940_2184089524-Time1748562157000.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"cdcccb","hasP3":false,"height":1080,"textColor1":"23211f","textColor2":"31302e","textColor3":"454341","textColor4":"504f4d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c4/b2/cd/c4b2cdc9-6f20-1152-ae1c-478584ae5c33/fde95614-b3cf-48de-901f-7a9587fd587f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c9c8c8","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"191816","textColor2":"2d2c2a","textColor3":"3c3b39","textColor4":"4c4b4a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/44/0f/03/440f0363-a331-bbd1-66dc-2fb1539e1d1f/41f3e19e-42ff-49e4-86a8-ebe63a9330f0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"989490","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0c0c0d","textColor2":"171617","textColor3":"282727","textColor4":"312f2f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/78/60/ac/7860aca5-949b-d290-4c01-d0990ef5e74a/75608d10-36b7-4fd6-830e-753900a969c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The sun comes out for the rock duo, with a little help from new friends.","standard":"After a tumultuous 2024 that saw The Black Keys cancel their tour, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney turned struggle into art on the duo’s aptly named 13th studio album—<i>No Rain, No Flowers</i>. “It totally kind of fucked our plans,” Carney tells Apple Music of the scrapped shows. “We took the time that we were going to be on tour, and we went back into Dan’s studio, and we just recorded a bunch of music.”\n\nThe other kids from Akron ultimately decided to build on the creativity of their last full-length. “<i>Ohio Players</i> was a deeply collaborative album we made with other musicians—I guess rock stars. Beck and Noel Gallagher. Heroes of ours, you know? And guys who’ve helped us out throughout the years in different ways,” Carney says. “For this new album, we just went one step further and we wanted to do some more collaborations, and we looked at some people who had worked with artists that we liked.”\n\nThat includes bringing on Lana Del Rey co-writer Rick Nowels (“No Rain, No Flowers,” “On Repeat,” and “Kiss It”) and Kacey Musgraves-favorite Daniel Tashian (“The Night Before,” “Babygirl,” “Man on a Mission,” and “All My Life”) as well as hip-hop producer Scott Storch (“Babygirl” and “Make You Mine,” the latter also with legendary songwriter Desmond Child). These fresh voices infuse Auerbach and Carney’s blend of rock with a bright passion (and more piano than usual)—but blues, disco, and psychedelia still all find purchase here. There's even room for throwback cuts like “Down to Nothing” and “A Little Too High,” plus some Nashville licks on “Neon Moon.”\n\nPerhaps the title track sums up their current journey best: “Live long enough, and you will be burned/But all these little messes/Are only little lessons we've learned.” Or, when life gives you rain, you make flowers.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"No Rain, No Flowers","playParams":{"id":"1811897147","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-rain-no-flowers/1811897147","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3GP6fZgniD9cydeW0nwEe4"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1811897147/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5893059","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5893059?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242359718,"RTCI":0}}},"1812517697":{"id":"1812517697","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812517697?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"JID","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jid/282841404","artwork":{"bgColor":"e6d3b6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"311b12","textColor2":"411a0b","textColor3":"554033","textColor4":"623f2d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7b/e1/66/7be166a3-92e6-c505-0802-9599973629ea/25UMGIM55109.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"0a0a0a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"eeeeee","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"c0c0c0","textColor4":"a0a0a0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/3a/d3/2a/3ad32aba-2007-b7ec-39de-46e7f43da644/41d7f197-5214-441a-8469-3b707f3573f4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"263c61","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d8e5f2","textColor2":"f2d2eb","textColor3":"b4c3d5","textColor4":"c9b4d0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/89/14/f4/8914f445-a372-0b2c-5069-c03231948ef0/f8059322-b403-4310-befe-e0c74f467241.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"252525","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f0dfc1","textColor2":"f1c284","textColor3":"c7b9a1","textColor4":"c8a371","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/77/6f/d7/776fd715-0f38-42e7-43ef-58cecdb9b8a1/b1710fd2-0b6d-4016-99ae-15dcca0abadf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A bold new statement from the Dreamville storyteller.","standard":"There was a time when Dreamville’s talented artist roster seemed destined to remain perpetually in J. Cole’s formidable shadow. Yet those who followed the Atlanta-raised JID from his mixtape days and the Spillage Village <i>Bears Like This</i> era had to know he couldn’t be contained for long. Some three years after his ambitious and acclaimed <i>The Forever Story</i>—and just over a month since the guest-laden <i>GDLU (Preluxe)</i> EP—his fourth solo album obviously comes with heightened fan expectations. Borrowing its title from his late grandmother’s clever turn of phrase, <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> finds the technically proficient MC up for the existential challenge. \n\nThe unmistakable sound of Westside Gunn’s assertive bellows introduce the tremulous “YouUgly,” in which JID assails sales-obsessed fandoms while puffing out his chest and stacking his checks. Immediately afterwards, he’s officially back in his storytelling bag for “Glory,” an uproarious gospel variant with heavyweight production by Beatnick Dee and Lex Luger. Those narrative gifts of his persist on tracks like “Of Blue” and the dark yet peppy “Sk8,” building upon the solid foundation of tales told in his catalog thus far. \n\nElsewhere, he’s detailing a Machiavellian come-up plot on the motivational “WRK” and defeating self-doubt with gratitude on the uplifting closer “For Keeps.” Of course, JID’s guest list is stacked, with masterful rappers like Vince Staples and virtuosos like Thundercat in the mix. Yet even amid a Clipse posse cut like “Community” and momentous duets like “No Boo,” the consistently bold <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> stays undeniably his own.\n","tagline":"New

Even as Tuttle showcases her expert picking skills on tunes like the fiery opener “Everything Burns” and the kaleidoscopic “Oasis,” <i>So Long Little Miss Sunshine</i>’s straightforward loveliness recalls Kacey Musgraves’ own country-pop crossover <i>Golden Hour</i>, as Tuttle’s high register soars above the soft throb of “Golden State of Mind” and sways across the simple balladry of penultimate track “No Regrets.” The result is a confident record that splits the difference between traditionalism and modernity without losing an ounce of its creator’s winsome ingenuity.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"So Long Little Miss Sunshine","playParams":{"id":"1813516732","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/so-long-little-miss-sunshine/1813516732","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/66H97i02fAu4oFUYUGxIhr"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813516732/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"864763421","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/864763421?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232869085,"RTCI":0}}},"1813601929":{"id":"1813601929","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813601929?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Liv Sin","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/liv-sin/1191565666","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ced4db","textColor2":"b3bac7","textColor3":"a4a9af","textColor4":"8f949f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/70/2f/b5/702fb5cb-8d2c-6e29-2d36-fa6d1ca282bf/199350633751.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hard Rock","Music","Rock"],"name":"Close Your Eyes","playParams":{"id":"1813601929","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/close-your-eyes/1813601929","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/41U6wQOkkwKWtFHeOdsEVc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813601929/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1191565666","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1191565666?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755231477401,"RTCI":0}}},"1813894286":{"id":"1813894286","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813894286?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Pool Kids","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pool-kids/1398931438","artwork":{"bgColor":"baad79","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1a161d","textColor2":"171e28","textColor3":"3a342f","textColor4":"373a38","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/18/4a/17/184a177a-4620-174e-d8cd-d8ab8e7b3871/0045778813667.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Easier Said Than Done","playParams":{"id":"1813894286","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/easier-said-than-done/1813894286","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3H6HMbQXLkEQgn9r07Jwsq"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813894286/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1398931438","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1398931438?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243104124,"RTCI":0}}},"1813978939":{"id":"1813978939","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813978939?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chevelle","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chevelle/519486","artwork":{"bgColor":"aba6a2","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"0d0907","textColor2":"3f0100","textColor3":"2c2926","textColor4":"542220","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/2d/7b/7f/2d7b7f64-8918-f19e-1674-8984f164aeb0/4099964165173.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dddddd","textColor2":"c7c7c7","textColor3":"b4b4b4","textColor4":"a3a3a3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0f/0a/13/0f0a138d-bdc6-41cb-02ab-741d1a7106ab/17b0413b-4727-4607-819d-6645d6cadb0a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The long-running band delivers more big hooks and big ideas on album 10.","standard":"Ask Chevelle vocalist and guitarist Pete Loeffler why the band decided to call their 10th album <i>Bright as Blasphemy</i> and he’ll essentially punt. “A big part of a writer’s job is to come up with cool-sounding shit,” he tells Apple Music. “Which is really hard to do, especially because so much has been taken. I hadn’t heard this one before.” If that seems like an evasive response, that’s because it is: Loeffler and his brother Sam (drums) are hoping the record speaks for itself. “Digging in and figuring it out is part of the fun,” he says. “Maybe drawing your own conclusions is the best part. I once read that when you look at a new painting, you should try to find something in it that you like, even if your first thought is that it’s not your particular style. It’s practice for being open-minded.”\n \nIt’s unlikely that Chevelle fans will find <i>Bright as Blasphemy</i> to not be their style. The first two singles, “Rabbit Hole (Cowards, Pt. 1)” and “Jim Jones (Cowards, Pt. 2),” deliver the type of big riffs and soaring hooks the Chicagoland rock band has built its multiplatinum career on. Lyrically, both songs offer critiques of government, religion, and technology. “The way I see it, shouldn’t all three of those things be critiqued?” Pete says. “It’s important to be careful how much you trust and read on the internet. Searching for the truth is full of nasty craters to fall in.”\n \nThe Jim Jones reference is especially poignant. The infamous cult leader convinced nearly a thousand of his followers to kill themselves (and their children) by drinking cyanide-laced Kool-Aid in 1978. “It’s one of the biggest abuses of power by someone who brainwashed his people,” Pete says. “It’s a reminder for us to be careful about the people that we follow and idolize.”\n \nFor <i>Bright as Blasphemy</i>, the Loeffler brothers decided to produce themselves after a four-album run with Joe Barresi at the helm. “We wanted to switch it up, and ultimately we wanted to use the tools we’ve learned in writing and recording and see where we would end up,” Pete says. “The recording took place over two years’ time, [because] it’s not always easy to tell if something is fully cooked and done when there’s nobody to take it away from you.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Bright as Blasphemy","playParams":{"id":"1813978939","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/bright-as-blasphemy/1813978939","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4UfWCai5kezrUuom68hwHt"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813978939/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"519486","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/519486?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755251085958,"RTCI":0}}},"1814416111":{"id":"1814416111","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814416111?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Rise Against","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rise-against/16252655","artwork":{"bgColor":"1d1d1d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3ce85","textColor2":"fc5402","textColor3":"c8ab70","textColor4":"cf4907","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/76/7c/81/767c8135-cfe1-6353-490c-b364970bbca5/24CRGIM46457.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"eee7e4","textColor2":"efdfcd","textColor3":"beb9b6","textColor4":"bfb2a4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/30/6d/ea/306dead7-52fe-d04b-e790-e3b84898aba4/bc8d470f-86d1-4afe-bfe8-055415faf217.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Chicago punks switch things up on their 10th album in 25 years.","standard":"Ten albums is a landmark in the music business, a testament to perseverance. For Chicago punk rockers Rise Against, the milestone sparked a new kind of self-awareness. “This is the first time I think I’d ever paid attention to the number of records we have, and 10 seemed like a lot,” vocalist and guitarist Tim McIlrath tells Apple Music. “Not a lot of my favorite bands made 10 records, you know what I mean?”\n\nTo mark the occasion, Rise Against decided to switch things up. After making six of their last eight albums with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, they enlisted Grammy-winning producer Catherine Marks (St. Vincent, boygenius) to take the wheel for <i>Ricochet</i>. “After 25 years, we’re sort of congealed in our way of working and sounding,” McIlrath says. “No matter how hard we try to break out of that, there’s going to be some of that still in us, which I think gives you the Rise Against sound. So we picked a producer who is really outside the box for us, and largely unfamiliar with the Rise Against world. Therefore, she’s not beholden to any idea of what we should sound like.”\n\nLyrically, McIlrath zeroed in on the theme of interconnectedness. “What I’ve been thinking about since our last record is just how desperate we are to isolate ourselves from each other, but how unavoidable it is that we’re all connected,” he says. “We try to crawl into our own silos and listen to our own news channels and streaming algorithms, and we react to things as if we’re not connected—not realizing that everything we do is so connected. I kept picturing this room that we’re all firing guns in. You may have intended to hit this target, but you actually hit someone else—or yourself—because all the bullets are ricocheting everywhere.” Below, he details each song on the album. \n\n<b>“Nod”</b>\n“When our songs fall into the political bucket, they’re often call-to-action songs, but this one was less of a call to action and more of a question of ‘Are you in this with me? Are we together? Am I alone?’ And I think that our shows can feel like those rallies in a sense, where just for a moment you feel like you’re not alone. You realize that there are people that are like you next to you. ‘Nod’ is talking about the nods we give to each other, those unspoken signs we give each other to let people know, ‘Hey, I see you, you see me.’ When I grew up in the late ’80s and ’90s, if you walked on the street holding a skateboard, you were nodding to every single other person with a skateboard out there. Or maybe you’re wearing a Descendents T-shirt. I think we’re always nodding, signaling different things to each other.”\n\n<b>“I Want It All”</b>\n“We came up with a real simple riff that felt powerful, and we decided not to overthink it. I think that Rise Against has lots of strengths, but if I was to speak about our weaknesses, we can get lost down the rabbit hole of a song and overthink it until we’ve just sucked the life out of it. So we decided to just put this one out there—big riff, big lyrics, a statement song. Lyrically, it’s about not settling. The punk rock world is steeped in punk rock guilt, the idea that you should be ashamed of any success you have. That’s the world we all grew up in. So we turned that on its head: Whether it’s musically or politically or with your career, don’t be afraid to want it all.” \n\n<b>“Ricochet”</b>\n“There’s a line in the song that goes, ‘Don’t turn away as the bullets ricochet.’ I kept picturing the world turning as so many horrible things are happening in it, and the things that we find ourselves doing on a Friday night, whether it’s at a Rise Against show or at a club or whatever, and meanwhile people are starving in Sudan. The reality of life is that we certainly can’t be emotionally engaged 100 percent of the time, but sometimes I feel like we can be turning away from it too much. So it’s saying: Don’t forget what’s happening in the world. Don’t forget that the life you live is sometimes built on the backs of people who aren’t living it.” \n\n<b>“Damage Is Done”</b>\n“This was a fun song to put together because it’s based around a Rise Against riff that’s about 15 years old or maybe even older. It’s something we’ve been playing around with for a long time but we’d always just hit a dead end with. Usually when you hit enough dead ends, I think as a musician it’s your sign to move on. There’s lots of songs I would give up on that I never thought about again. But this one nagged at me, and we always talked about it as the one that got away. This time, we finally turned it into a song. So, for us, it’s like a throwback, even though no one’s ever heard it before.” \n\n<b>“Us Against the World”</b>\n“This is about how easy it is to feel overwhelmed with what’s going on in the world. And it’s a reminder that anybody who ever changed anything meaningful in society always at first felt alone. So it’s normal to feel like it’s you against the world. That’s where lots of good things get started. The song is saying, ‘Can’t you see it’s always been us against the world?’ And maybe it’ll always feel like that, but it’s okay.” \n\n<b>“Black Crown”</b>\n“I co-wrote this with Andy Hull from Manchester Orchestra. I flew down to their place outside Atlanta, and we just jammed and hung out and wrote this one all in an afternoon, just him and I in a room with acoustic guitars and sort of singing at each other. That was fun, because I’d never really done that with anyone outside of the band before, so the song is probably a little bit of a curveball in the Rise Against world. Lyrically, Andy had read an article about a guy who was a doomsday prepper. Instead of trying to actively fix and repair the world, these guys are trying to survive and endure. But if you survive a nuclear apocalypse in your bunker or whatever, the world won’t be a place you want to live in.” \n\n<b>“Sink Like a Stone”</b>\n“When I was in high school, I had a summer job as a lifeguard. Every year I had to get trained in CPR and first aid, and one of the things they would tell you is that if someone was drowning and you had to save this person, you’ve got to make sure you take care of yourself first. You can’t create a second victim. If you go out and try to save some guy who’s twice your size, he could very well take you down. And now there’s two people drowning. So you’ve got to make sure you’re looking out for yourself. If you can’t help yourself, you can’t help anybody else.” \n\n<b>“Forty Days”</b>\n“This one’s just about persistence and patience and dedication and commitment to something or someone. I will wait here no matter what’s coming for you. No matter what happens as the waters rise, no one’s going to make me move. I’ll be right here. It’s a commitment and a dedication to an idea or a person. As for the number, it’s the old ‘40 days and 40 nights’ thing, like Moses in the desert. I went to Catholic school K through 8, so there’s too much Bible in me no matter what I do.” \n\n<b>“State of Emergency”</b>\n“I feel like the news and media around us is so driven for profit nowadays that the only way to keep us really engaged is to convince us that we’re always in some state of emergency. There’s always some breaking news, there’s always something happening that’s super urgent today, right now, that you need to drop everything and be fully panicked about. And I think there are things on this planet that we should be fully panicked about, but the biggest story of the day is often something we won’t be able to remember tomorrow. It creates a lot of anxiety for people, and this is the world our kids are growing up in.” \n\n<b>“Gold Long Gone”</b>\n“I think this taps into some of the ideas behind our last record, <i>Nowhere Generation</i>. There’s a line in the song that says, ‘Tell me what the hell is going on/We’re digging in the mines for gold long gone.’ I have this image of people who went out to the gold rush late, and they’re just chiseling away at the rock while somebody is standing behind them knowing that there’s nothing left. Meanwhile, this person has turned their life upside down just to dig away hoping to find that gold. It’s talking about the American dream and asking if it’s still there. The idea that you’ll be rewarded if you work hard is becoming less and less true. It’s asking if there’s anything left worth working for.” \n\n<b>“Soldier”</b>\n“‘Soldier’ is about blind faith in an idea or a concept and how dangerous that can be, and then what it’s like to walk away from it, especially if it’s been something like an article of faith. It’s the idea of somebody tearing off their uniform, pulling off the patches and being like, ‘I’m not going to fight this fight anymore.’ It’s about critical thinking and making sure you’re doing things for the right reasons. Always be analyzing the causes you’re fighting for. You’re allowed to evolve as a human and no longer identify with those causes. It’s like an anti-follow-the-leader song.” \n\n<b>“Prizefighter”</b>\n“This is talking about the world that you’re thrust into if you decide to start a band, write a song, and acquire an audience. It could be any kind of art—writing, acting, anything where you rely on an audience. It’s not something I ever thought about when I picked up a guitar with my friends in a basement and started playing songs and doing this. We didn’t have any delusions of grandeur that we’d still be doing this 10 records later. But it comes with all these extra dynamics between you and your audience that no one really prepares you for. We have an amazing audience. I’ve never met a Rise Against fan that I don’t like. But we’re still our own people, our own band. We’re going to decide what we do, what we sound like, who we play with, and where we play. We’re not beholden to anybody. A prizefighter fights for themselves.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Ricochet","playParams":{"id":"1814416111","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ricochet/1814416111","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0JWOSnfL0rLA50OEuF9Itc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814416111/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"16252655","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/16252655?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755250197055,"RTCI":0}}},"1814577195":{"id":"1814577195","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814577195?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hammer King","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hammer-king/925177434","artwork":{"bgColor":"121212","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"bfcad8","textColor3":"cfcfcf","textColor4":"9da5b0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/04/e5/5c/04e55c2c-ce90-04ac-ba9f-7fae76114467/5021732530912.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Make Metal Royal Again","playParams":{"id":"1814577195","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/make-metal-royal-again/1814577195","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5TfEy3kuyhpkC7gEJ73bAs"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814577195/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"925177434","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/925177434?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755167030743,"RTCI":0}}},"1815750959":{"id":"1815750959","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815750959?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dystopica","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dystopica/1488839599","artwork":{"bgColor":"050409","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fcfcfc","textColor2":"ceced1","textColor3":"cbcacb","textColor4":"a6a6a9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/38/c7/3a/38c73a1c-e565-5103-43ee-030b02cd606e/199350762536.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Semblance of Order","playParams":{"id":"1815750959","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/semblance-of-order/1815750959","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5GxtOkstNrun4gPxbo6z2X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1815750959/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1488839599","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1488839599?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243086754,"RTCI":0}}},"1816089441":{"id":"1816089441","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816089441?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Conan Gray","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/conan-gray/1168567308","artwork":{"bgColor":"0e303d","hasP3":false,"height":3635,"textColor1":"d3d4db","textColor2":"acbed0","textColor3":"acb3bb","textColor4":"8da2b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/1b/95/f6/1b95f6d8-dcbd-2ce0-2c35-f2336de9bbc2/25UMGIM71376.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3635},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"0b1f21","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f3f6f5","textColor2":"aec9d2","textColor3":"c5cbcb","textColor4":"8da7ae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/6d/22/32/6d22325a-b9cc-31a4-b116-2cd04297cae0/Job22891069-8c0a-42aa-8b8a-1f302dc98b1f-193124429-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_378324559_2173678023-Time1747961939205.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"0a2b38","gradient":{"color":"0a2b38","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d8e2f4","textColor3":"d7d8de","textColor4":"b8c5da","textGradient":["ffffff","d8e2f4"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/8c/2e/6d/8c2e6d78-fe1b-f8ac-7321-d32044c1dc8e/Jobde927daa-e602-4d97-871d-77f99d088990-193124428-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_378324553_2173678024-Time1747960978725.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"18233c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d8cdcd","textColor2":"d0cad0","textColor3":"b2abb0","textColor4":"aba9b2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9b/c7/ac/9bc7ac3f-6a1f-d7df-5f2b-fedd634271cf/b691ab3c-2837-421e-b0db-cfc3c3041255.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A cathartic exploration of the foray into adulthood.","standard":"When Conan Gray announced the arrival of his fourth studio album <i>Wishbone</i>, he shared in a statement that he wrote the album in secret.

The powerful “This Song” finds Gray admitting that it’s easier for him to sing about love for his unspecified partner than it is to utter the words face to face. “Romeo,” on the other hand, begins with a playful horn intro before slide guitar and a shuffling rhythmic groove betray the poison at the heart of his feelings: “You took away my will to live,” he admits. \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Wishbone","playParams":{"id":"1816089441","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wishbone/1816089441","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1Q0kTJx8DrQd8RJW9L7eIN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816089441/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168567308","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168567308?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242048609,"RTCI":0}}},"1816914839":{"id":"1816914839","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816914839?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"THE NONE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-none/1807505697","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1f1f1f","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"4b4b4b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a5/8a/0e/a58a0e10-a929-da9c-d9d4-8eb058f2fa01/3663729382566_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock","Alternative","Indie Rock"],"name":"MATTER - EP","playParams":{"id":"1816914839","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2024-08-29","trackCount":4,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/matter-ep/1816914839"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816914839/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1807505697","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1807505697?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754929366060,"RTCI":0}}},"1817443629":{"id":"1817443629","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817443629?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Evidence","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/evidence/388035837","artwork":{"bgColor":"1a1d20","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f27963","textColor2":"ef7885","textColor3":"c76755","textColor4":"c46671","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4d/10/81/4d108119-c319-78e7-3787-b55f04302e86/54965.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The veteran West Coast MC and producer is as sure-footed as ever.","standard":"For his fifth solo album, <i>Unlearning Vol. 2</i>, Evidence enlists a handful of underground-friendly West Coast MCs, including Larry June (“Future Memories”), Odd Future alum Domo Genesis (“Favorite Injury”), and late-aughts blog-rap darling Blu (“Stay Alive”).

Then a video Zimmerman casually uploaded—covering Black Stone Cherry’s “Stay” between truck builds—went viral, and by December 2020, he’d written his first song. Cue the record deal, the Morgan Wallen co-sign, the world tour, and the double-platinum debut full-length (2023’s <i>Religiously. The Album.</i>). But as he reminds you on the rowdy “New to Country,” he’s still the same whiskey-sipping, ATV-riding country boy, emphasizing in his raspy drawl: “Ain’t a thing changed ’round here but the money.”\n\nWritten fresh after a breakup, <i>Religiously</i> was rife with ballads about the pain of lost love. On its follow-up, Zimmerman sings a different tune. “When I first started writing songs, my life was like heartbreak,” he tells Apple Music’s Kelleigh Bannen. “With this album, my life has been awesome. I’ve been touring all over the world. I’ve been writing songs. I’m taking care of my family.” There are still plenty of big-hearted ballads on <i>Different Night Same Rodeo</i>, though now they’re scattered between heartland rock jams like the KID LAROI duet “Lost” or “Backup Plan” with Luke Combs, on which Zimmerman delivers his own motivational sermon: “If you got a fire, don’t lose it/If you got a do-or-die dream, do it/If you got something to prove, go on and prove it.”\n\nMaking regular appearances throughout the album’s 18 tracks is Zimmerman’s trusty old Chevy Silverado, which he took out a loan to buy from his grandpa at 16. “All day, when I was in school, I was thinking about getting in my truck and jamming music,” he says. “It felt like freedom.” That same truck is ridden with memories on “Chevy Silverado,” a track he says took him three years to perfect. And on “Holy Smokes,” it’s where he falls in love for the first time, chain-smoking cigarettes in the church parking lot: “At 17, that’s what hallelujah was.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Different Night Same Rodeo","playParams":{"id":"1818193663","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/different-night-same-rodeo/1818193663","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2cPJrMHIIBkKarl6nxi11P"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1818193663/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1551033783","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1551033783?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242404707,"RTCI":0}}},"1819112703":{"id":"1819112703","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819112703?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"mgk","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mgk/465954501","artwork":{"bgColor":"2b5574","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d9f3fc","textColor2":"c3dbe6","textColor3":"b7d3e1","textColor4":"a5c0cf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/05/2b/7c/052b7c26-11e8-f911-a344-a26486d83bc8/25UMGIM79102.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"497e9f","gradient":{"color":"497e9f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"3d0e1a","textColor3":"3f3c40","textColor4":"5c3a47","textGradient":["000000","3d0e1a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c5/25/ac/c525ac3c-160a-3299-689b-af63113d9555/Jobef4a8e8b-144b-458c-b145-e73bb2ff088b-195009363-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382096259_2208709398-Time1750121426254.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"497e9f","gradient":{"color":"497e9f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"c5e4f3","textColor3":"bcd7eb","textColor4":"a6cae3","textGradient":["000000","c5e4f3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/96/3a/09/963a090c-480e-c150-a8cc-3ec012440773/Job068b3db5-c6cc-4cc0-a825-58e06ff61cb9-195009362-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_382096258_2208709399-Time1750120311121.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"33669d","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f2f9d3","textColor2":"c9e5fd","textColor3":"ccdbc8","textColor4":"abcbea","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/43/64/94/43649416-3212-448d-5077-5f4ef7f1c659/62abf4c4-87f7-480d-926f-1006804febbc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4b85bc","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"111314","textColor2":"101315","textColor3":"1d2a35","textColor4":"1c2a36","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e2/7e/28/e27e2894-353e-14e1-64f1-2ca489df3143/d5f0c43c-65a3-47f5-99d6-211258cc54e9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"537f99","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"070303","textColor2":"111314","textColor3":"161c21","textColor4":"1e292f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ec/90/87/ec9087fa-0529-a46b-f766-b643e09b840c/c8e47a4d-376b-4eca-9cfb-c00a5b9a9316.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly reinvents himself yet again.","standard":"The artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly announced his seventh album with a trailer narrated by…wait, is that really Bob Dylan?! “<i>lost americana</i> is a personal excavation of the American dream, a journey to find what’s been lost,” drawled the 84-year-old legend over clips of mgk smoking, riding motorcycles, and strolling the Vegas strip. “This album is a love letter to those who seek to rediscover: the dreamers, the drifters, the defiant. It’s a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention, and a quest to reclaim the authentic essence of American freedom.” Some wondered whether it was AI, but no, Bob’s just a fan. (He inexplicably posted a no-context clip of a 2016 mgk performance to his Instagram stories earlier this year.)\n\nThe 35-year-old is no stranger to the spirit of reinvention, having deftly transitioned over the course of his career from a gritty Cleveland rapper hustling mixtapes at the mall to the poster boy for the pop-punk revival. Where 2020’s <i>Tickets to My Downfall</i> and 2022’s <i>Mainstream Sellout</i> funneled his long-simmering angst into blink-182-esque riffs, on <i>lost americana</i>, he gets all James Dean: driving 135 MPH down a two-lane desert highway, chain-smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, heading nowhere fast. “Take me somewhere cheap/Where the livin’ is easy/Out of all their reach/Set my spirit free,” he sings on the Springsteen-esque “outlaw overture,” and on “cliché,” he coaxes a lover to ditch this two-bit town and get married in Vegas. He channels The Strokes on “sweet coraline” and interpolates Third Eye Blind’s “Semi-Charmed Life” on “starman,” but returns to his hip-hop roots on songs like “indigo” and “treading water,” opening up on the latter about the long road to redemption after a troubled year.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"lost americana","playParams":{"id":"1819112703","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lost-americana/1819112703","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/30aIA1FrouOX9kHxP4dEr6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819112703/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"465954501","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/465954501?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242097340,"RTCI":0}}},"1819515284":{"id":"1819515284","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819515284?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Blessing Offor","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blessing-offor/274532732","artwork":{"bgColor":"edf2f4","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"22191d","textColor2":"37231f","textColor3":"4b4448","textColor4":"5b4c49","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ce/5e/a9/ce5ea92e-68c1-a671-d3c4-1cd4efaaa10e/25UMGIM74491.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"acb0b0","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"231b19","textColor2":"2c2729","textColor3":"3f3937","textColor4":"464244","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/90/11/a4/9011a4db-857f-ef5d-7d45-3b3d56a95fd1/9cb1fc46-ea31-4eef-8667-24516ba8f862.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Nigerian American singer follows his breakout LP with radiant pop-soul.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Real","playParams":{"id":"1819515284","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/real/1819515284","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Jaiy3v9v7pTkamkvTxO5l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819515284/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"274532732","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/274532732?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232506716,"RTCI":0}}},"1819608513":{"id":"1819608513","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819608513?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gavin Adcock","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gavin-adcock/1580645019","artwork":{"bgColor":"101e26","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"edb86f","textColor2":"d9a864","textColor3":"c09960","textColor4":"b08d57","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/7e/c3/27/7ec3273d-ca19-46b0-01e6-0ba13c4ddd81/093624829638.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"494137","gradient":{"color":"494137","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f7e7b5","textColor3":"dccfb4","textColor4":"dac99c","textGradient":["ffffff","f7e7b5"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/78/ad/5c/78ad5cd0-88cb-855b-6b99-06858a470dc4/Joba1c9aab4-188c-4f66-aa5a-2033f70bff3d-195561884-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_383099023_2219626642-Time1750707087465.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"494137","gradient":{"color":"494137","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"151413","textColor3":"231b13","textColor4":"2e271f","textGradient":["ffffff","151413"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/cc/80/f2/cc80f2a2-7629-cdc6-7671-f84f0887823d/Jobfc6de005-446e-41b1-a005-e1140a438985-195561885-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_383099022_2219626643-Time1750708263789.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"deb473","textColor2":"d2a76b","textColor3":"b59360","textColor4":"ab8959","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ce/67/d1/ce67d15d-43e2-9e43-4407-23eb2bd43f0a/bbede00e-7d06-4788-ba57-f1d688f6b4c8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"312b35","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1e1cb","textColor2":"e2c38d","textColor3":"cabdad","textColor4":"bfa57b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/1d/6f/30/1d6f30b1-8562-3a4d-a0db-3832b08860c4/9f0cb92e-76d1-4018-98e2-87de04bf9bcc.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The viral up-and-comer goes big with a personal and ambitious double album.","standard":"Just a year after his major-label debut <i>Actin’ Up Again</i>, viral country up-and-comer Gavin Adcock returns with a double album—the latest in a string of country stars to go big or go home with sprawling, ambitious projects.

The record opens with “Morning Bail,” a deceptively sweet song about waking up in the drunk tank after a rowdy night out. “Never Call Again” finds Adcock showing the gentler side of his often gruff voice, with drawn-out pedal steel flourishes adding a gauzy feel to the love song.

when you thought you were out, the Baton Rouge MC pulls you back in.","standard":"Named for the fearsome, loyal-to-the-end enforcer from Mario Puzo’s mafia epic <i>The Godfather</i>, the <i>Luca Brasi</i> saga has become nothing short of an institution for Kevin Gates. Though 2013’s <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i> certainly wasn’t his debut, it nonetheless brought the Baton Rouge rapper into the spotlight, where he’s remained ever since. Some seven years passed between the third and fourth installments, a time period in which the very same style of melodic, personal street rap he helped pioneer proliferated via a new generation of hip-hop artists. Of course, he kept busy that whole time with a rigorous and steady run of releases in the 2020s, making the arrival of <i>Luca Brasi 4</i> both momentous and of the moment in ways some other vet’s sequels are not.\n\nFrequently imitated by others, Gates’ signature style from the “2 Phones” and “I Don’t Get Tired” era remains undisputedly his own on tracks like “Bread Straight” and “Hard for Pt 2.” All about his business, he makes his position known to those who want in the game on “Stir the Pot,” his mid-song flow flip a more-than-modest flex. His defensively caustic wit comes through on “Stutter,” and he softens up for the thuggishly romantic pair “I Love This Bitch” and “Satellites 2.” Yet he still bears scars befitting a pain-rap progenitor on “Factory Reset” and “Disappoint Me,” the latter with rising rapper Hurricane Wisdom in tow. Other guests include fellow Louisiana native YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who brings his trademark charms to “I Am,” and Atlanta upstart YKNIECE, who eagerly matches Gates’ potent profanity on “BBO (Simon Says).”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Luca Brasi 4","playParams":{"id":"1820405800","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-13","trackCount":19,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/luca-brasi-4/1820405800","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2MrBg0bmBOii342VanrH6v"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820405800/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"298383551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/298383551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232711934,"RTCI":0}}},"1820967562":{"id":"1820967562","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820967562?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Good Charlotte","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/good-charlotte/468788","artwork":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3300,"textColor1":"0b0e13","textColor2":"0e1014","textColor3":"3c3e42","textColor4":"3e4043","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9f/ae/f2/9faef2f6-c3a2-6c77-8e55-4a18aaec49a7/075679605474.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3300},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ffffff","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"102354","textColor2":"193157","textColor3":"3f4f76","textColor4":"475a79","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/bc/fa/e5/bcfae588-01c3-aad7-b615-8a8c3a543b12/Job37cfae54-6cd5-4265-a358-56a0763ba8b5-199060935-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389696590_2276672772-Time1754090120017.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"ffffff","gradient":{"color":"ffffff","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"163059","textColor3":"40577a","textColor4":"45597a","textGradient":["000000","163059"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/3f/06/c4/3f06c496-4f53-706c-7abb-9c0c66bbdd66/Job7eaadf74-cb00-4e32-84b0-8eef6948a141-199061206-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_389696589_2276672773-Time1754091457815.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"c2c2c2","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"121315","textColor2":"161616","textColor3":"353637","textColor4":"393939","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/31/3d/55/313d5584-8816-00d9-4d72-ce0314630fbf/04080fe6-d120-491c-a0d5-5db23667f792.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"After a seven-year gap, a nostalgic return from the pop-punk vets.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Pop"],"name":"Motel Du Cap","playParams":{"id":"1820967562","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/motel-du-cap/1820967562","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5IbeeWff9kyS6ZU67NdyQD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820967562/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"468788","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/468788?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755241952814,"RTCI":0}}},"1821073090":{"id":"1821073090","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821073090?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Amaarae","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/amaarae/1292405220","artwork":{"bgColor":"00462e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"ead22d","textColor2":"dbb90f","textColor3":"bbb62d","textColor4":"afa215","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/48/b1/11/48b111cd-7e1b-e4b6-dc52-ed2bebbc2c82/25UMGIM83925.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"081414","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f4baa6","textColor2":"d6a592","textColor3":"c49989","textColor4":"ac8878","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/df/f1/35/dff13520-c97d-fdb8-3417-22606348d4ad/ef1886f7-a4a9-4970-9742-3fd2ac31c633.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"998e50","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"14090d","textColor2":"04120d","textColor3":"2e231a","textColor4":"212b1a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/73/6c/dc/736cdc83-93c7-e38b-d7e8-031ad6482600/93412103-47bd-4a9a-bb9d-8abd6f7a5bc3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Dance music that treats the last 40 years of pop like an endless palette.","standard":"The Ghanaian singer-songwriter’s third full-length is almost overwhelming at first approach, even when taking into account the big melodic strokes of her instant-classic 2023 record <i>Fountain Baby</i>.

The band’s typical laidback danceability is present and accounted for, with a few retro vibes thrown in, like on “Burn Burn Burn.”\n\nOf course, here, Levine and co. do attempt to define what love is actually like. From “It’s been a little crazy here/We been a little anxious, you know” (“Hideway”) to “I know this behavior is beneath us both/But I think the fucked-up thing is how it brought us closer now” (“Jealousy Problems”), it’s messy, all-consuming, and confusing—a departure from the black-and-white sensibilities dotting the rest of their catalog. “It’s funny because the music that we wound up making feels really fresh and cool,” Levine says. “For better or worse, we’re proud of the thing we wound up having released because it’s just different.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Love Is Like","playParams":{"id":"1821537686","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/love-is-like/1821537686","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0cMIntDigHjfYqnvgJjd3Q"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821537686/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1798556","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1798556?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755267495342,"RTCI":0}}},"1821937832":{"id":"1821937832","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821937832?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Aces","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-aces/1238525085","artwork":{"bgColor":"121b19","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"dec236","textColor2":"14d4d6","textColor3":"b5a030","textColor4":"14afb0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8c/50/31/8c5031f9-2b92-fc99-9b24-d6c127fc323d/751238066374.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d0c0a3","textColor2":"cca48d","textColor3":"aa9d86","textColor4":"a78774","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/cf/84/6a/cf846a57-ef15-7036-13cd-b8856b9d8df2/998aca33-f886-425d-9477-887e5a7486a3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The four-piece escapes into guitar pop sprinkled with some Studio 54 glitter.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie Pop","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Gold Star Baby","playParams":{"id":"1821937832","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gold-star-baby/1821937832","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5f6o1GrIrDjFnuxDd0c4GK"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821937832/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1238525085","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1238525085?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243544009,"RTCI":0}}},"1821938143":{"id":"1821938143","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821938143?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Rio Da Yung Og","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rio-da-yung-og/1463776488","artwork":{"bgColor":"98854f","hasP3":false,"height":1500,"textColor1":"050201","textColor2":"040404","textColor3":"221c10","textColor4":"211e13","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/87/a5/09/87a50988-649a-ffc2-7ca2-e208dd3c96bb/199316144505_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1500},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"bbd3d4","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0b0908","textColor2":"2f1c13","textColor3":"2e3130","textColor4":"4b403a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/eb/2e/c6/eb2ec6a1-0c64-8c11-c1fa-b81eadb5ff53/Jobb6d2f58e-3f26-4ddf-b9bb-87be24d55fc2-197671988-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387020581_2254495258-Time1752715414107.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1c1511","gradient":{"color":"1c1511","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"342622","textColor3":"373531","textColor4":"514a47","textGradient":["ffffff","342622"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/58/69/42/58694246-f895-bc0e-c1ab-674a4d80143e/Job6756c79f-fde9-4798-a8b1-e948f4b40760-197746565-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_387161303_2255681514-Time1752779265671.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"5b4e3f","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e7e3d6","textColor2":"c9dbd2","textColor3":"cbc5b8","textColor4":"b3beb4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/39/42/89/3942892b-d75e-67c0-f3fa-247f4244d12d/3c69578c-0598-4009-ab54-4319d6ba28d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"F.L.I.N.T.

hip-hop studio mastermind crafts a mix to “turn the gym into a club.”","standard":"Each month, the Apple Music Fitness Mix is helmed by one of modern music’s best DJs and producers to deliver the perfect set for your next workout. Calibrated to different modalities—whether you’re riding or running, at the gym or practicing yoga—it brings the right kind of energy to help you push through whatever challenge awaits. This set, mixed by Murda Beatz (born Shane Lee Lindstrom), will keep you locked in to your next gym session—or any sort of exercise you might choose.\n\n“My goal was to create a Fitness Mix that I would work out to, turning the gym into a club,” the Ontario-born, LA-based hip-hop producer tells Apple Music. “I structured the mix to let the energy build with the workout. Having that perfect track is important when you start to burn out.”\n\nLindstrom, who’s worked with Drake, Migos, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj, says he’d use the mix “during an intense weightlifting workout or cardio day.” Including tracks from Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, Waka Flocka Flame, 2 Chainz, and tons more, the set closes with something new from the Murda Beatz lab: “‘Same Shit’ was the perfect way to end a workout,” he says. “The guitar solo at the end is how I like to leave the gym.”\n","tagline":"New Fitness Mix"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"name":"Fitness: Gym, August 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1824536453","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":35,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-gym-august-2025-dj-mix/1824536453"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824536453/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1053740960","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1053740960?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264514022,"RTCI":0}}},"1824543248":{"id":"1824543248","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543248?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joey Valence & Brae","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joey-valence-brae/1643989506","artwork":{"bgColor":"464746","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e2e1e2","textColor2":"ec87bc","textColor3":"c3c2c3","textColor4":"ca7aa4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0e/f0/e7/0ef0e779-f0cb-b783-d381-1133eb4736dc/196873327051.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"101d3b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dedbe1","textColor2":"c2c4d2","textColor3":"b5b5c0","textColor4":"9fa2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/52/eb/9d/52eb9d02-0d1b-73b1-da01-01a8ebb8d264/e73cb4c7-10ee-43fa-bca2-6c686c39a8b8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"HYPERYOUTH","playParams":{"id":"1824543248","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hyperyouth/1824543248","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4QzLpl3oZx1P1BnhvkkAYW"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824543248/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1643989506","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1643989506?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232388745,"RTCI":0}}},"1824551934":{"id":"1824551934","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824551934?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"CHASE WRIGHT","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chase-wright/1524803936","artwork":{"bgColor":"bdd4db","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"2d201e","textColor2":"372823","textColor3":"4a4443","textColor4":"524a48","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/43/1f/00/431f00de-bec1-6649-d09a-f2701c40f0a4/659459922427.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"FIND MYSELF -

After reuniting with Pi’erre Bourne for 2024’s victory lap <i>Sli’merre 2</i>, he’s back with his longtime producer Coupe (known for “Peaches & Eggplants”) and beatmaking familiar Kid Hazel for the vibrant, ecstatic <i>PARADISE</i>. His mellifluous drawl and explicit lyrics coupled with surreally melodic instrumentals yield some of the most crowd-pleasing tracks of his career to date. From the irreverent strip club bounce of “BTA” to the smooth talk of “CHAINS ON” and “SUPER SLIME,” he’s in rare form as a trap libertine. Elsewhere, he shouts out Zone 6 on the more ominous “MOP STICK,” embraces baller status on “SNAKE,” and vibes with Latto on “WHAT’S HAPPENIN’.” Naturally, 21 Savage makes an appearance alongside Coupe on “ICED TEA,” but it’s the fresh Project Pat hook that takes the already elevated single to even higher heights.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"PARADISE","playParams":{"id":"1826145543","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/paradise/1826145543","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3GVcT0ZaiYTX3ZVETuP1aD"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826145543/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"898005271","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/898005271?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755242060137,"RTCI":0}}},"1826574954":{"id":"1826574954","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1826574954?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Audrey Hobert","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/audrey-hobert/1812750994","artwork":{"bgColor":"b19d7c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060708","textColor2":"1d1b1a","textColor3":"282520","textColor4":"3a352e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/4f/22/e9/4f22e913-135c-4381-71e6-943166042ac0/196873025001.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4e85b7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"070504","textColor2":"070504","textColor3":"151e28","textColor4":"151f27","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4a/1c/57/4a1c57d2-b9e1-b8db-2661-819412dd441d/9b19e0ac-ed10-4c76-963f-1e91641a7310.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"One of pop’s most unconventional and hilarious new voices? That’s so true.","standard":"The 26-year-old Los Angeles native never dreamed of being a pop star; after majoring in screenwriting at NYU, she got a job as a staff writer on a Nickelodeon comedy. On a whim in 2024, Hobert started writing songs with her roommate and best friend Gracie Abrams—several of which would end up on Abrams’ 2024 sophomore album <i>The Story of Us</i>, including “That’s So True,” the album’s biggest hit. Hobert’s own breakout single, May 2025’s “Sue me,” went viral for its borderline unhinged lyrics about hooking up with an ex (“I’m sorry that your dog died/Sorry that I’m, like, your dream bride”).\n\nThree months later, her debut album, <i>Who’s the Clown?</i>, establishes the once-reluctant singer-songwriter as one of pop’s most hilarious and unconventional new voices, gleefully blurring the lines between cool and cringe with songs that play out like voice memos from your funniest friend. She’s drunk in the Uber on “Sex and the city,” bored at the A-list party on “Chateau” (“Shit, how’d I even get in? And I’d love to get out”), and roasting her endless mirror selfies on “Thirst Trap.” And though Hobert seems allergic to taking herself too seriously, profundity slips through the cracks on songs like “Phoebe,” where she makes peace with insecurity while binge-watching <i>Friends</i>.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Who's the

along with a Detroit rap fixture on a narcotized trip.","standard":"Babyface Ray secured his standing in Detroit hip-hop over more than a decade’s worth of records, not the least of which being his 2022 pairing <i>FACE</i> and <i>MOB</i>. Firmly in his independent bag, he maintains the high quality of those standout projects on <i>Codeine Cowboy</i>, a narcotized trip that accentuates the themes found in his existing body of work while going deeper on other routes. Early on, fans will gravitate to streetwise cuts like “American Psycho” and “Kick the Cup Campaign.”\n\nOver time, however, a clear desire to explore R&B vibes crops up, particularly notable on “Nobody’s Perfect” and the JMSN collab “Don't Misuse Me.” Though his guests here represent an assortment of locales, those with close ties to Michigan (such as Lil Yachty on “Wavy Crete” and Veeze on “Half Sleep”) provide some of the most memorable features. Detroiters G.T. and Samuel Shabazz show up with their A-games for the faded “I Know” and the breezier “Sin Aire,” respectively, with the latter returning for thought-provoking closer “1 On 1 Talk With God.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Codeine

country star celebrates a career milestone with a six-pack.","standard":"Luke Bryan revisits his 2015 record <i>Kill the Lights</i> on this six-pack of tunes, which coincides with the 10th anniversary of the fifth studio album from the country superstar. Bryan pulls together the album’s original six singles for this collection, beginning with lead single “Kick the Dust Up.” A party anthem celebrating rural lifestyle, that tune is emblematic of the bro-country sound that dominated 2010s country music, incorporating elements of hip-hop and pop alongside more traditional country instrumentation. The sultry second single “Strip It Down” is still one of Bryan’s sexier tunes, while the Karen Fairchild collaboration “Home Alone Tonight” ups the romantic ante with a “will they, won’t they”-style duet about two heartbroken strangers connecting at a bar. “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” is textbook wholesome Bryan, and is the EP’s rootsiest, most purely country song. Bryan rounds out the project with the dance-floor-ready “Move” and the wistful ballad “Fast.”","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Kill The Lights - EP","playParams":{"id":"1830338015","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-07","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kill-the-lights-ep/1830338015"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830338015/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"20131064","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/20131064?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755243057948,"RTCI":0}}},"1830535998":{"id":"1830535998","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830535998?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sasha Keable","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sasha-keable/325850892","artwork":{"bgColor":"1d1d12","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"e0a074","textColor2":"ce9b61","textColor3":"b98660","textColor4":"ab8151","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c9/ef/c3/c9efc3c0-001d-c306-c99a-4d7ba2870082/196873160948.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"283120","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f6bb78","textColor2":"f8944c","textColor3":"cda066","textColor4":"ce8043","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/55/d4/87/55d4873e-41be-c4d4-1ad9-1e4773961837/15f72fe6-0a06-486a-9043-a5bd39985911.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"463428","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f6c79c","textColor2":"f9bd8e","textColor3":"d3a985","textColor4":"d5a279","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/40/77/25/40772539-5dbc-fc9d-3635-9e18a40bce9c/6e9491e0-fc4d-46f9-97fa-04c60f9976ab.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B star on her fifth EP: “It made me feel like, ‘All right, you are enough.’”","standard":"It’s not uncommon for artists to find catharsis, resolution, and therapy in making music. For Sasha Keable, though, it was therapy that led her to songwriting. “I put myself into therapy when I was six years old,” the Londoner tells Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis. “If my therapist didn’t hand me a book and go, ‘You need to start writing,’ there would be no Sasha [the artist]. She was like, ‘Start writing.’ I was so angry. I would just poke holes in the pages, trying to stab the book, whatever. So dark. Then after a while, the stabbing turned into kind of drawings. Then the drawings turned into words, then poems, then it started to turn into songs. And that was literally how my brain then started working through stuff.” \n\nGiven that songwriting foundation, it’s not surprising that Keable’s fifth EP, <i>act right</i>, is a work of bold honesty and expression. It’s also one where she can feel she’s making the music she wants to make, in the way she wants to make it—which hasn’t always been the case. The R&B singer-songwriter’s deep and nimble vocals first drew attention with her featured spot on Disclosure’s 2013 club cut “Voices,” but she’s dismissive of her debut EP <i>Black Book</i>, released the same year, and its 2014 follow-up <i>Lemongrass and Limeleaves</i>. “They’re not bad,” she says. “It feels like 20 million years ago. It just feels like it was so much of other people trying to dictate how I made music all the time. That was something that really didn’t resonate with me.” Two more EPs followed—<i>Man</i> in 2019 and 2021’s <i>Intermission</i> in 2021—but, again, Keable found herself yearning for more independence and she cut loose from her label and the teams around her. “Just after <i>Intermission</i>, I literally left everyone.” she says. “I was like, ‘No, I’m not doing this. I need to just set my own pace and work out what it means.’”\n\nWhat it means on <i>act right</i>, her first EP in four years, is turning a betrayal suffered into seven heart-grabbing songs. Lean, efficient production allows the impact of her words to simmer in the spaces as she portrays a journey from devastation to healing. On “FEEL SOMETHING,” she’s helpless and reckless in the aftershock (“Feels like I’m driving 95 with no lights on/No seatbelt on a terminated licence”) and struggling to let go of a bad thing during the angry and fragile “heartbeat”—but the tears clear on the title track, leaving the bitter clarity of seeing someone for who they really are. Optimism floods through “WHY” as Keable manifests what love should be, creating a standard to hold future relationships to. Like the whole EP, it’s a work of purpose and belief, the sound of an artist expressing her truest self—and feeling satisfied with who that person is. “My main thing is being able to create music for myself, music that fuels me, music that keeps me excited, music that gets me up in the morning,” she says. “I was not going through a good time writing [<i>act right</i>]. I guess [it’s] music that literally made me feel like, ‘All right, you are enough.’”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"act right","playParams":{"id":"1830535998","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/act-right/1830535998","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4YVaV9ViXndugkvyBOBGxX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830535998/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"325850892","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/325850892?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264142359,"RTCI":0}}},"1830597627":{"id":"1830597627","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830597627?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gunna","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gunna/1236267297","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1f21","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cdced1","textColor2":"bdcad2","textColor3":"aaabae","textColor4":"9da8af","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/39/1e/0c/391e0c06-1536-a90f-7c49-06b9289c37e1/075679606358.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"232323","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e0e3e5","textColor2":"c0cbd5","textColor3":"babcbe","textColor4":"a0aab1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/91/45/5f/91455fab-2c5f-2fe3-ef88-0e988bc8925e/Jobde1be0c1-f08c-4b95-a3cc-99cf17fe7bfc-199340778-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390258076_2280839326-Time1754428437360.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"121113","gradient":{"color":"121113","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"c1d2d9","textColor3":"b6b9bb","textColor4":"9dabb1","textGradient":["ffffff","c1d2d9"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/30/24/57/30245737-e47a-3ee8-fbbe-fb3affd812d8/Job49e523bd-67c6-4546-8d14-00598b500233-199340779-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_390258075_2280839327-Time1754430117690.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"020303","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cac5c4","textColor2":"d0c0b5","textColor3":"a29e9d","textColor4":"a79a91","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/5a/54/27/5a542752-b7b7-09ca-f347-4ff3eb66008f/9e42f6cc-5db2-4f05-8763-45ec98ebf883.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cdb9a9","textColor2":"dbac93","textColor3":"a7978a","textColor4":"b28d79","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/52/39/1a/52391ae8-9bf2-f8be-f512-b4eac4fe67c1/04c2ae36-f178-4332-8709-f4d858120808.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3b4646","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f3f3f6","textColor2":"e5eff5","textColor3":"ced1d3","textColor4":"c3cdd2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/6c/bb/6b/6cbb6b92-105e-893b-19d7-2d08762f1363/8c3eb5cf-3165-4fb0-808f-02b574a06d82.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The grand culmination of the rap star’s decade-long run.","standard":"With an album title like <i>The Last Wun</i>, speculation is bound to fly about Gunna’s future with—or without—his longtime label home YSL Records. Perpetuating his penchant for portraiture, the Cubist cover art conspicuously obscures his face even more so than on 2024’s <i>One of Wun</i> and further adds to the mysteriousness of these proceedings. Still, considering the repeated successes he’s enjoyed over the past decade, both solo and with hitmakers like Drake and Lil Baby, this sprawling set makes for an impressive send-off, one indicative of his commitment to quality. \n\nVictory laps don’t always yield the best results, but <i>The Last Wun</i> stands apart, staying consistently interesting throughout its more than two dozen songs. “pushin P” fans don’t have to wait long for new meme-ready moments like “let that sink in” and “just say dat,” though later cuts like the defiant “cfwm” and “him all along” are well worth sticking around for. His moneyed, jet-setting lifestyle matches a perpetual grindset mentality, evident on “showed em” and “on me.” Still, he remains a hedonist at heart, feeling faded yet tenacious on “again” and similarly invested in his pleasure on “gp.”\n\nRepeat Gunna collaborator Offset once again proves a worthy foil on “at my purest,” while Nechie adds some much-appreciated plug talk on “i can’t feel my face.” But as Gunna clearly looks towards the next stages of his career, his international tastes begin to intentionally solidify through some of his other feature choices. No fewer than three Nigerian stars make appearances here, with Burna Boy’s silky-smooth one on the explicitly salacious “wgft” contrasting with Wizkid’s romantic contribution to the subtler “forever be mine” and Asake’s more melodic placement on the luxe “satisfaction.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"The Last Wun","playParams":{"id":"1830597627","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-08","trackCount":25,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-last-wun/1830597627","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6l2aad6LJghHkbd0KX1f7w"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830597627/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1236267297","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1236267297?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264428455,"RTCI":0}}},"1831044542":{"id":"1831044542","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831044542?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bryson Tiller","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bryson-tiller/642591128","artwork":{"bgColor":"091215","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e4dccc","textColor2":"c2dbdc","textColor3":"b8b4a7","textColor4":"9db2b4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/f3/91/32f39154-b2ea-d39b-20fc-b039eb739760/196873461342.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cad2cb","textColor2":"cca882","textColor3":"a5aba6","textColor4":"a6896c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/8b/ac/7d/8bac7d7c-3d43-daee-fa0f-fa55b4a008b5/3a414f76-61bf-462a-83cc-40daf17d384c.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e8af7b","textColor2":"de9c65","textColor3":"bd8f66","textColor4":"b58054","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/6b/dd/43/6bdd43c0-dd3b-fbbc-3800-033fe2e5b594/062eafcc-cae2-41ff-89bd-db99ecfb5192.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3c3329","hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e5e0d1","textColor2":"d2caba","textColor3":"c3bdaf","textColor4":"b4ac9d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/ff/1a/1a/ff1a1a4b-56eb-9e6e-a7fd-e783bd85ec38/cc625148-edfd-4d1b-93e5-d790b893e622.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The multi-hyphenate sheds his vices on part one of his double album effort.","standard":"With Bryson Tiller’s 2024 self-titled LP, the Louisville crooner crafted a genre-bending departure from his comfort zone, experimenting with the soundscapes of dancehall, drill, and pop next to his signature mixture of hip-hop and R&B. Tiller fully embraced himself and where he was at within his artistry, so much so that he decided to take a hiatus from music after its release to pursue his passion for video game design. Released as the first installment of the double album, <i>The Vices</i>, Tiller lets go of shortcomings and starts a new chapter of his ever-evolving sound.\n\nAs he does across the majority of his discography, the singer-songwriter toes the line between singing and rapping; however, on <i>The Vices</i> he leans less into the moody trap-soul tracks that defined his career and launched him into superstardom. Instead, he dives deeper into the rap-heavy side of his musicality, delivering sharp flows and gritty, energetic bars over dynamic productions from Charlie Heat, Gravez, Teddy Walton, and Hitmaka.\n\nTiller is unapologetic as he revels in his impulsive nature, waxing poetic as he brags about his lifestyle (“First Place,” “200 Bands,” “Make Life Easy”) while navigating the ups and downs of his situationships (“No Sharing,” “More Than Money,” “Last Call”), and even contemplates letting go of his player ways (“Burnout”). Tiller isn’t alone as he ventures through partying and romance. He gets some help from Bossman Dlow, Rick Rock, Piles, T-Pain, BabyDrill, Luh Tyler, and Bun B, who are along for the ride.\n\nOn the closing track “Finished,” Tiller addresses his naysayers and critics who doubt his ability to surpass his 2015 debut album <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. His resilience in the face of criticism is evident as he confidently asserts: “I’ll be done with this shit when I’m done/I ain’t lookin’ for the number one /Just money and the shit keep comin’/Kept goin’, kept wrist V or nothin’/Ain’t fallin’ off, bitch, you funny.”","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Solace & The Vices","playParams":{"id":"1831044542","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-02","trackCount":24,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/solace-the-vices/1831044542"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831044542/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"642591128","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/642591128?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755270091896,"RTCI":0}}},"1831115458":{"id":"1831115458","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831115458?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jonas Brothers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jonas-brothers/114342891","artwork":{"bgColor":"e4f1f5","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0d0a11","textColor2":"111523","textColor3":"38383f","textColor4":"3b414d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ed/2d/c3/ed2dc3f1-5cef-dec8-c6af-aec93d0ab64e/25UM1IM07359.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d5cdbe","textColor2":"ccc4b2","textColor3":"aea79b","textColor4":"a6a092","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/46/2b/24/462b249c-1e1a-775d-9521-63aaa0116934/194218e8-9cc3-42a0-915c-337a5a35a729.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"030808","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d7cebb","textColor2":"cbc3ab","textColor3":"ada797","textColor4":"a39e8a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d9/e6/e1/d9e6e144-5c94-ee72-f378-51551dfba653/f701d66d-f886-4ba4-bd71-41820a18ddd9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The band of brothers take a trip back to where their musical journey began.","standard":"The seventh studio album from the Jonas Brothers arrives 20 years after they hunkered down to write the debut that served as a launchpad, rocketing them to teenage superstardom (<i>It’s About Time</i>, released in 2006), and it would seem the anniversary has them feeling nostalgic. Cue <i>Greetings from Your Hometown</i>, a mostly upbeat affair that strikes a delicate balance between past regret and future promise. Sandwiching the emotional core of the album between two surefire crowd-pleasers—galvanizing pop-rock anthem “I Can’t Lose” and the soft future-bass touch of Marshmello collaboration “Slow Motion”—the brothers Jonas nosedive into rumination before pulling up in a passionate glide through the boundlessness of romance. \n\n“Backwards” meanders around heartbreak, giving way to the minimalist production of self-aware lament “Loved You Better” and the title track’s sunny hopes for a brand-new start, forming a triptych of love and loss. Elsewhere, “Waste No Time” benefits from producer Ryan Tedder’s taste for suggestive rhythms and a quirky earworm melody, while “Heat of the Moment” and “Bully” borrow from alt-pop band MUNA’s dreamy pastel-colored palette (guitarist Josette Maskin is credited as a co-writer). Stripped to the bones, <i>Greetings from Your Hometown</i> holds the same heartfelt charm that first captivated Jonas Brothers fans and made them into household names, but the album’s glossy finish reflects the experienced artists they have become more than the wide-eyed young men they once were. Still, sometimes it takes a return to your roots to understand how much you’ve grown.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Greetings From Your Hometown (Deluxe Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1831115458","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-12","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/greetings-from-your-hometown-deluxe-edition/1831115458","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6RIoTRFwyMIV2a2zUb3mpR"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831115458/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"114342891","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/114342891?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755237681663,"RTCI":0}}},"1831121617":{"id":"1831121617","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831121617?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Tom Howe","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tom-howe/31556460","artwork":{"bgColor":"1b1b21","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"edc989","textColor2":"c2bdc1","textColor3":"c3a674","textColor4":"a19da1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/8b/2a/47/8b2a4746-a344-b91b-1c3a-c92f3fdd6305/780163676624.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"name":"Parenthood: Freshwater (Music From The Programme On BBC)","playParams":{"id":"1831121617","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/parenthood-freshwater-music-from-the-programme-on-bbc/1831121617","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1JWeZxwMjFJTp3py1JynW7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831121617/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"31556460","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/31556460?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232097445,"RTCI":0}}},"1831122567":{"id":"1831122567","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831122567?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Clinton Shorter","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/clinton-shorter/327484322","artwork":{"bgColor":"111315","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dcd4d7","textColor2":"d6a580","textColor3":"b3aeb0","textColor4":"af886a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/2b/7f/d0/2b7fd0b7-83aa-458a-e56f-bdda083455ab/780163676327.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Original Score","Music","Soundtrack"],"name":"The Rainmaker: Season 1 (Music from the USA Original Series)","playParams":{"id":"1831122567","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rainmaker-season-1-music-from-the-usa-original-series/1831122567","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ylbsqtyvreiqVBx9hfvLw"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831122567/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"327484322","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/327484322?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755232433480,"RTCI":0}}},"1831154451":{"id":"1831154451","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831154451?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"YOUNG POSSE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/young-posse/1711363069","artwork":{"bgColor":"7fb35f","hasP3":false,"height":5000,"textColor1":"040707","textColor2":"231a1b","textColor3":"1d2919","textColor4":"353929","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/27/eb/d1/27ebd1e2-e85a-1c41-8950-b456e572b2f4/cover_KM0023279_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":5000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","Hip-Hop/Rap","Korean Hip-Hop"],"name":"Growing Pain pt.1 : FREE","playParams":{"id":"1831154451","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-14","trackCount":7,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/growing-pain-pt-1-free/1831154451","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Nfxo1U4jKI13JB4nPimOJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831154451/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1711363069","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1711363069?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755218846295,"RTCI":0}}},"1831225972":{"id":"1831225972","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831225972?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"ZOONIZINI","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/zoonizini/1831222267","artwork":{"bgColor":"999793","hasP3":false,"height":3004,"textColor1":"0b0a09","textColor2":"151412","textColor3":"272625","textColor4":"2f2e2c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/e2/d5/cd/e2d5cded-0212-595b-ef26-2e3ecea478e8/cover_KM0023288_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3004},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop","Hip-Hop/Rap","Korean Hip-Hop"],"name":"DICE -

This month, the mix was helmed by DJ Skillspinz, a Columbus, Georgia, native who currently serves as tour DJ for West Coast legend The Lady of Rage. With a deep love for boom-bap and decades of experience already under his belt, the challenge here was connecting the dots between hit songs of today and the classics that have never failed him in a party. \n\n“My first rule is, just because two songs have the same tempo that doesn’t mean they would sound great together,” Skillspinz says. “It has to make sense and feel good. With me loving all types of music, though, it became easy for me to mix the new with the old, bridging the gap. An example of that would be Lil Tecca’s ‘Dark Thoughts’ and Kelis’ ‘Caught Out There’: I’m taking a 1999 release and putting it with a 2025 release. Talk about an age gap. [But] the melodies and basslines from the two hug each other so well.” The Rap Life DJ mix is the culture in action, so enjoy this set and check back each month for more one-of-a-kind mixes.\n","tagline":"New DJ Mix"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap"],"name":"Rap Life: Aug 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1831345785","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":23,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rap-life-aug-2025-dj-mix/1831345785"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831345785/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"78956051","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/78956051?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264314798,"RTCI":0}}},"1831592682":{"id":"1831592682","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831592682?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Gable Price and Friends","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gable-price-and-friends/1441378212","artwork":{"bgColor":"dfdeda","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"04060a","textColor2":"3e2512","textColor3":"303133","textColor4":"5e4a3a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/a8/5a/8d/a85a8db4-838d-eada-79e6-9c306096b164/25UMGIM53459.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Post Credits Scenes - EP","playParams":{"id":"1831592682","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/post-credits-scenes-ep/1831592682"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831592682/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1441378212","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1441378212?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755231406626,"RTCI":0}}},"1831856693":{"id":"1831856693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831856693?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Coco Jones","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coco-jones/401400095","artwork":{"bgColor":"e6edf7","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"312a28","textColor2":"322f2f","textColor3":"555151","textColor4":"565557","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/15/50/f5/1550f501-73b7-9b26-d73f-10463f4c35ac/25UM1IM06369.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"4f8bd4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0f","textColor2":"110d0f","textColor3":"182536","textColor4":"1d2736","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/75/d9/70/75d97049-74f7-4a97-d585-fd3506147195/9109315c-313a-4747-a004-d9ff74289371.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"To be specific: Why not eight more tracks on the rising R&B star’s debut?","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Why Not More?

With 2023’s <i>Lonestar Luchador</i> and the following year’s <i>Texas Technican</i>, the explicit yet charming Bay City representative became one of the state’s most visible modern rappers. Just months after his joint 2025 <i>Chicken & Sauce</i> project with Houston’s own Sauce Walka, he’s back with a characteristically engaging full-length called <i>Recess</i>. \n\nIntermittently interrupted by proudly sophomoric skits that play on the titular schoolhouse theme, the album plays to his strengths as a lyrical misfit while also testing his potential to break into different genre spaces. Whether suffering from success on “Hate Being Famous” or detailing his salacious appetites on “Foreign to Me,” his Southern bona fides naturally come through. He leans into a country-fried motif on the witty “Weed Eater” and applies a hilariously heavy-handed stepdad metaphor to the wack rapper smackdown “Rap Sons.”\n\n<i>Recess</i> continues his collaborative streak, with old friends and new showing up to get into his kind of mischief. Some of these veer into relatively poppier territory than his prior albums, including “U and Me” with Dallas’ BigXthaPlug and the Lil Wayne team-up “Baby Mad at Me.” Just in case that unsettles his Day Ones, tracks like “Accessories” with Peso Peso and “Business” with Money Man feel quintessentially within his established comfort zone. Still, it’s hard not to appreciate his evident growth on the boom-bap refresh “Blocka Blocka” with Denzel Curry or the heartland rock ballad “Runnin.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Recess","playParams":{"id":"1832089510","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":24,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/recess/1832089510","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Bo68f3J0Ufnb0d9iHf4FZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832089510/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1578103208","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1578103208?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755237612407,"RTCI":0}}},"1832392741":{"id":"1832392741","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832392741?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Yaego","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yaego/1350774686","artwork":{"bgColor":"151412","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d7a988","textColor2":"d4a970","textColor3":"b08b70","textColor4":"ae8b5d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/01/51/83/01518339-63ff-4712-3673-8054c74e7af7/artwork.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Trance","Music","Dance"],"name":"ÆRO: DELUXE - EP","playParams":{"id":"1832392741","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-12","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/%C3%A6ro-deluxe-ep/1832392741"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832392741/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1350774686","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1350774686?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1754885136004,"RTCI":0}}},"1832510565":{"id":"1832510565","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832510565?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"KAYTRANADA","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kaytranada/602382713","artwork":{"bgColor":"812c25","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f8f4f4","textColor2":"f2e9e9","textColor3":"e0ccca","textColor4":"dbc3c1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ab/55/49/ab5549a4-68aa-6367-68fa-a752bb364df8/196873346359.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"773128","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f8f4f4","textColor2":"f1eae9","textColor3":"decdcb","textColor4":"d8c5c3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/dc/7e/c2/dc7ec2b2-9807-c84f-f0e8-9a63c6f13583/34f45621-4806-4a0c-a070-fba0297d9450.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c2bcb9","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"25100d","textColor2":"2b1613","textColor3":"45322f","textColor4":"493734","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/80/45/ff/8045ff8e-1449-d7d2-fc2e-893c8f5f9bef/95489300-00ce-439d-9805-2dae08b83bd1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Hypnotic loops, slick rhythms, far-flung samples deliver dance euphoria.","standard":"Long before KAYTRANADA was headlining festivals and winning Grammys, he was a child obsessed with JAY-Z’s 2003 record <i>The Black Album</i> and its companion documentary <i>Fade to Black</i>. Watching prolific producers like Pharrell Williams, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Rick Rubin build beats from scratch, he went from fan to student, poring over album credits and eventually teaching himself to make beats by reverse-engineering J Dilla tracks. By the early 2010s, the Haitian Canadian producer had fused his love of hip-hop with a growing fascination for house music, emerging from the underground with viral edits of Janet Jackson and Teedra Moses songs, all driven by his signature drum swing. Following in the footsteps of his early heroes, KAYTRANADA became a master collaborator: His first three studio albums featured voices from PinkPantheress and Tinashe to Kali Uchis and even Williams himself. \n\nOn <i>AIN’T NO DAMN WAY!</i>, KAYTRANADA lets his production do all the talking. Stripped back to hypnotic loops, slick rhythms, and far-flung samples, the album is for total dance immersion—the kind that makes time slip away in the club. The chunky retro beat of “SPACE INVADER,” paired with a refrain from Latrelle’s Neptunes-produced “My Life” (“Gotta get away sometimes”), sets an escapist tone. Stutters and glitches ripple through tracks like “CHAMPIONSHIP,” “TARGET JOINT,” and “GOODBYE BITCH!” as if you’re catching him mid-DJ set. His blending of styles and eras transforms the ’80s Afro-boogie of Steve Monite’s “Things Fall Apart” into contemplative poolside house, while rapper Cappadonna’s 1998 song “Black Boy” becomes a resilient disco jaunt. Even the soulfully reassuring croons of “DON’T WORRY BABE / I GOT U BABE” serve as a Trojan horse for a slow-burning banger. The party carries on until the TLC-sampling closer “DO IT (AGAIN!),” both a playful last call and an invitation to run it back all over again. \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"name":"AIN'T NO DAMN WAY!","playParams":{"id":"1832510565","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-15","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/aint-no-damn-way/1832510565","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ThDVXsGeZahogahzHAIw6"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832510565/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"602382713","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/602382713?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264921854,"RTCI":0}}},"1832578341":{"id":"1832578341","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832578341?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kankan","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kankan/1001877055","artwork":{"bgColor":"93d500","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"070a00","textColor2":"0e1500","textColor3":"233300","textColor4":"293b00","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4a/45/31/4a4531dc-a94e-e1aa-1133-97c89a095791/199316227925_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"B4 F.E.B -

He followed that up in the beginning of 2025 with a compilation, <i>More Leaks</i>, a gift to fans while his legal problems resolved themselves. The tape was a bridge to <i>MASA</i>, his highly anticipated 2025 studio effort that arrived at the end of July. YoungBoy quickly got back to his old tricks of flooding the marketplace, though, as just two weeks later he returned with <i>DESHAWN</i>, hosted by none other than DJ Khaled.\n\nThe mixtape is a victory lap of sorts, a way for YoungBoy to get back in the rhythm of cooking up new music like everyone else cooks up meals. While <i>MASA</i> found YoungBoy reflecting on his legal battles and struggles to forgive himself for previous sins, he’s optimistic though rightfully guarded on its follow-up. Opener “AI Marley” features wise words from the project’s host, with Khaled declaring, “More money, more solutions,” while on “La Vida Loca” his excitement is nearly palpable when he raps, “Check the timing on my watch, I think my moment be right now.”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"DESHAWN","playParams":{"id":"1832629322","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-08-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/deshawn/1832629322","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1kBZ0CgBB3hqPCENxpKTNl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832629322/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168822104","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168822104?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1755264301629,"RTCI":0}}},"1832783290":{"id":"1832783290","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832783290?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Chance the Rapper","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chance-the-rapper/563355119","artwork":{"bgColor":"04172f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c9e0f1","textColor2":"35eb8e","textColor3":"a1b8ca","textColor4":"2bc07b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/43/85/df/4385df77-7e17-809f-9280-a0eb016418f5/5063778733858_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"625e35","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7f6f4","textColor2":"efeeea","textColor3":"d9d8ce","textColor4":"d3d1c6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/19/08/58/1908581e-a382-bcfb-c732-f879a3342136/9c2f796a-873c-440d-ba51-b0396e8bb443.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Chance faces reality with trademark wit, poignance, and wordplay.","standard":"Since his debut mixtape, 2012’s <i>10 Day</i>, launched 18-year-old Chancelor Bennett to indie stardom, fans have watched the Chicago native grow up in real time—from stoner on high school suspension to precocious hometown hero to God-fearing family man. “I lived an adulthood at a really young age,” Chance, now 32, tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I was touring and traveling and supporting multiple family members, businesses, friends, everything. I’m damn near a child star, you know what I’m saying?” Marking the journey were three studio mixtapes now deemed classics and an official debut album, 2019’s <i>The Big Day</i>, on which Lil Chano from 79th stepped with purpose into the roles of husband, father, and adult.\n\nThe Chance who opens his sophomore album by declaring, “Surprise! It’s the boy who lived,” is not the same man from six years prior; since then, there was the acrimonious split from his longtime manager in 2020, then the 2024 announcement that he and his wife were separating after five years of marriage. On <i>STAR LINE</i> (named after Marcus Garvey’s Black Star Line, an oceanic shipping line in the Back-to-Africa movement), he faces reality head-on, addressing not just his own struggles but those of the world with his trademark wit, poignance, and double-take-worthy wordplay. “Politically, internationally, the world is going through it,” he tells Lowe. “And we’re really getting to see the elasticity and the bandwidth of moral fiber. Everything is getting stretched to its limits.”\n\nThough Chance draws inspiration from recent travels to Ghana and Jamaica, <i>STAR LINE</i> is grounded in his hometown of Chicago, from whose culture he draws lines to Black culture across the diaspora. Here, the juke drums on “Speed of Light” co-mingle with the Rastafarian roots of “Tree,” the futurist dancehall of “Burn Ya Block,” and the Afrobeats rhythms of “Space & Time.” He shares the spotlight with Chicagoans past and present—from ’90s heroes Do or Die to up-and-comers like BabyChiefDoIt—and slips in slick interpolations of local anthems both beloved and esoteric. (Real heads will catch the reference to BBU’s “Chi Don’t Dance” on the Jamila Woods duet “No More Old Men.”) And on the soulful “Back to the Go,” Chance shakes off a series of stumbles, packs his bags, and heads back home: “Been around the board/Now I’m back to the Go.”\n","tagline":"New Release"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"STAR
