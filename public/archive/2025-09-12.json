Instead of fighting the chaos, the musician embraced it, resulting in what could ostensibly be called a breakup album. But on <i>Girl Violence</i>, King Princess swaggers rather than sulks, streamlining her formerly eclectic sound for a slinky, sexy deep dive into the havoc women wreak upon each other’s lives. “Why does nobody mention that girls can be violent?” she growls on the title track, concluding: “I hate it, but I kinda like it.”\n\nAfter moving back to NYC in 2023, Straus began working with a pair of Brooklyn-based producers: Jacob Portrait of the psych-rock band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Joe Pincus, who’d made beats for SZA and Doechii. Together, the trio crafted a sound steeped in late-’90s electronica and reverb-heavy rock, using heartbreak as a springboard for questions about human nature. Doo-wop meets dream pop on “Girls,” a slow-burner for the down-bad on which Straus yowls in her smokiest rasp: “To let you back in/That would be violence/That would be chaos/I wanna try it.” Luckily, all that drama builds character. On “Origin,” a sultry downtempo number, she begins to get her groove back: “I’ve had to face fire, fight fear/And spend a lot of time in the mirror/And I’m cool, I’m weirder/I’m hot, I’m deeper/I’m starting to feel myself again.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Girl Violence","playParams":{"id":"1809241664","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/girl-violence/1809241664","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4aAqSQJ69OruOHDlQ9B5ki"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1809241664/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1349968534","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1349968534?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757678733934,"RTCI":0}}},"1810267152":{"id":"1810267152","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810267152?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Parcels","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/parcels/1148094312","artwork":{"bgColor":"3a472d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f4f4a2","textColor2":"f4dcc4","textColor3":"ced18b","textColor4":"cfbea6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/17/dc/43/17dc433f-27cb-3cd7-1469-2184ae99b7b2/5056556160120_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b7b19f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"1d1510","textColor2":"31231c","textColor3":"3c342d","textColor4":"4c4036","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0c/37/5e/0c375e74-6874-78de-1bc3-a4985e717058/7732cbb3-6e96-4fc2-87b8-06a295fc69c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Byron Bay act’s third album: “This one feels a lot more pure and direct.”","standard":"The members of Parcels had barely graduated high school when they left Byron Bay, Australia for Berlin in 2014, five friends sharing a dream and a cramped one-bedroom apartment. Within a year, they had released their debut EP and signed a label deal; by 2017, they were collaborating with Daft Punk on the band’s single “Overnight,” a track that would become the dance icons’ final production. \n\nAfter two albums—2018’s self-titled debut and 2021’s double LP <i>Day/Night</i>—and nearly a decade in motion, Parcels finally took a break in 2023. For six months, they lived their ordinary lives while working on songs individually before reconvening to finish them together. Whereas <i>Day/Night</i> was recorded in a single studio and meticulously planned out, their third album <i>LOVED</i> was made more loosely, with sessions in Berlin, Byron Bay, Sydney, and Mexico City, and a go-with-the-flow approach that let the album emerge on its own. “It's kind of like Parcels back to our most authentic self, in a way,” bassist Noah Hill told Apple Music’s Travis Mills in April 2025. “This one feels a lot more pure and direct, and more to what we naturally have inside of us.”\n\nFrom opener “Tobeloved,” <i>LOVED</i> is dotted with moments of laughter and colorful ad-libs that drop listeners right in the booth with them. That joy permeates the production, a vintage blend of peppy keys, hand-claps, chest-swelling crescendos, and funky guitar riffs that beg for a little shimmy. They also bring tenderness: “Ifyoucall” offers unconditional love with the warmth of a long hug, and “Leaveyourlove” is a starry-eyed declaration of devotion. The latter, written in Mexico while watching the sun set over the ocean, became the album’s anchor point. “We were all writing our own individual verses about our own love stories at the time, and wanting to lean into that directness and not being afraid to talk about love so directly,” said Hill. “This track just clicked with all of us instantly.”\n\nBut <i>LOVED</i> also refers to the emotion in the past tense. The disco fizz of “Yougotmefeeling” sugarcoats the realization that a relationship is past saving, and the more delicate “Summerinlove” aches with post-breakup yearning. Other songs like “Safeandsound” and “Finallyover” embrace the unknowable future with optimism, while closer “Iwanttobeyourlightagain” circles back to where it all began: “I remember when we were green/Five people and two sets of keys/Trying so hard to be seen.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"LOVED","playParams":{"id":"1810267152","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/loved/1810267152","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1rSbjr5U9J9rQ9sE7RxHFl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1810267152/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1148094312","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1148094312?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757685371456,"RTCI":0}}},"1812746301":{"id":"1812746301","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1812746301?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ruston Kelly","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ruston-kelly/591951463","artwork":{"bgColor":"181715","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e6dbce","textColor2":"d4ccc0","textColor3":"bcb4a9","textColor4":"aea89e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/82/28/02/8228027d-8888-275b-9f59-5a837620770d/25CRGIM49500.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1a1918","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e9dbcc","textColor2":"6ac5ce","textColor3":"bfb4a8","textColor4":"5aa3a9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/8e/af/74/8eaf7411-6a2a-1b81-fb89-e307db7cd15d/Jobc8480cc1-e3f6-43c3-947a-629c64e30b4b-196828343-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385425998_2241278005-Time1751942148552.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2a2826","gradient":{"color":"2a2826","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"b4d7d4","textColor3":"bfb4a4","textColor4":"96b1af","textGradient":["ffffff","b4d7d4"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/43/68/4e/43684e4e-27f4-d41f-37e7-f212e3e70b4e/Joba08c315f-2817-4bde-b239-861000127e64-196828342-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385425997_2241278006-Time1751940447808.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e5f0e8","textColor2":"f3ccab","textColor3":"bbc3bd","textColor4":"c6a78c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0e/47/4f/0e474fb3-cb76-3ece-fcde-395db2dc318e/efba3503-4e8e-4b73-9f9e-b093ecac61b1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"161713","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"cfba46","textColor2":"dab442","textColor3":"aa993c","textColor4":"b39539","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/63/73/b5637366-21c4-1b35-67aa-9767cd673a00/8418758c-f169-4d84-b9e3-3b8b0230825f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Nashville singer-songwriter gets metaphysical on his fourth album.","standard":"Ruston Kelly has never shied from the spiritual in his music, but this fourth album finds the Nashville-based singer-songwriter in an especially metaphysical mindset. Following his 2023 album <i>The Weakness</i>, <i>Pale, Through the Window</i> comes after a pivotal time for Kelly, who chronicles a period of reflection, healing, and blossoming love in these 13 new tracks. Kelly recorded the album live in Nashville alongside his touring band and longtime collaborator/producer Jarrad K (Morgan Wade, Tommy Prine), and there’s a subtle looseness in the music that comes from this intimate setup. \n\nThe opening title track is built atop reverbed vocal harmonies, stacked for a gently mesmerizing effect that mimics being in the same room as Kelly and his crew. Lyrically, that song finds Kelly yearning hopelessly for a lost love, finding only himself instead. “Wayside” laments society “shouting from their phone” and highlights Kelly’s prowess as a melody writer, with a driving, sticky verse hook that breaks open at the chorus, while on “Waiting to Love You” he dips back into the rootsy pop rock of earlier fan favorites like “Mockingbird.” Kelly closes the LP with “All In,” a deeply confessional love song about fully committing oneself to another person, no matter how scary the prospect.","tagline":"New

Little Mix star takes the highs with the lows on her flamboyant solo debut.","standard":"When JADE made her bombastic solo debut with “Angel of My Dreams” in July 2024, her yet to be named album had already been completed. The song, a Mike Sabath production that splices power-ballad theatrics, stomping electro basslines, and sugary, sardonic melodies into a Frankenstein’s monster of a tune, was hailed by fans and critics alike for its bold experimentalism, setting up sky-high expectations for the Little Mix star’s future output. As JADE told Apple Music’s Rebecca Judd, shortly after its release: “There’s a lot of songs on the record that have that same experimental vibe. I have a few of the more straight-down-the-line, poppy songs on there, but peppered in with the chaos that is my brain.”\n\nThe statement holds water now <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> has landed. Front-loaded with singles, which see JADE navigate shimmering disco sensuality (“Fantasy”), ballroom club (RAYE co-write “Midnight Cowboy”), and no-punches-pulled electropop (“FUFN (Fuck You for Now)”) with consummate ease, the back half of the record pulls her broad spectrum of influence together cohesively without sacrificing any of the originality or left-field choices that have come to shape her sonic identity. “I think [the reaction to ‘Angel of My Dreams’] has given me reassurance that I can really be myself,” JADE said. “I can take these risks. I can do something a bit braver…”\n\nThat confidence extends to the album’s lyrical themes, which examine JADE’s complex feelings about life in the spotlight, love and its maddening effects—see the delightfully unhinged romance of “Plastic Box”—and the relatable feeling of being at war with your own mind, from all angles. She shoulders her own blame for throwing up emotional walls on “Self Saboteur” only to pull back the curtain with skittish midtempo “Glitch,” revealing the distorted inner voice “telling me lies, telling me how it is” and “hijacking all my decisions.” “Unconditional” makes floaty, ethereal promises of love without reservations to someone struggling to love themselves over a chugging, synth-pop beat, while “Natural at Disaster” takes the concept of a torch song and interprets it literally, putting a vocally dramatic match to the gentle, piano-backed memory of a toxic dynamic. “If there are any darker topics that are personal to me that I write about, then I always give it a bit of a humor to it,” JADE said, speaking to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in the week of release. “It’s been fun as a songwriter being able to finally write more personal concepts and explore that and show people exactly who I am.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, given JADE’s widespread songwriting contributions during the decade she spent as a member of one of the UK’s most successful girl groups, <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> shares some of its DNA (and its producers, including Sabath, MNEK, and Lostboy) with the sounds of late-career Little Mix. While it’s common for band members striking out on their own for the first time to reinvent themselves entirely—a kickback against the artistic compromise that collective creativity demands—JADE boldly bucks the trend, converging her own unique impetus with echoes of the familiar. <i>THAT’S SHOWBIZ BABY!</i> feels more grounded in authenticity as a result, allowing her to take ownership of her past as she builds for the future.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY!","playParams":{"id":"1813142774","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/thats-showbiz-baby/1813142774","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Q1Rf1xZ5OiQcCFnSAHdeE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813142774/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1753030541","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1753030541?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757679486387,"RTCI":0}}},"1813688790":{"id":"1813688790","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813688790?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Josh Ritter","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/josh-ritter/5117840","artwork":{"bgColor":"695a50","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6e4d3","textColor2":"e9d5c1","textColor3":"d9c8b9","textColor4":"cfbcab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/5d/7b/8c/5d7b8c7d-701c-d459-885e-88c3cdcf9492/199350553356.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Americana","Music","Country"],"name":"I Believe in You, My Honeydew","playParams":{"id":"1813688790","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-believe-in-you-my-honeydew/1813688790","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/69rts7FNFTznxiz1FU6uD5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813688790/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"5117840","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/5117840?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757653142061,"RTCI":0}}},"1813848690":{"id":"1813848690","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1813848690?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Big Thief","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/big-thief/1083255351","artwork":{"bgColor":"030305","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"7ad543","textColor2":"50d111","textColor3":"62ab36","textColor4":"41a70f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/40/40/53/404053dc-586e-f51c-8de9-446eef5af471/191400085077.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"b7eb77","textColor3":"b0c297","textColor4":"93bc5f","textGradient":["ffffff","b7eb77"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/da/d6/2e/dad62e31-5eb1-2463-d545-af305d67f600/Joba0e0eab9-a71f-447f-8017-22bcfe12cb82-194672044-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381396730_2202275900-Time1749747858320.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"43d500","textColor3":"99ba6e","textColor4":"35aa00","textGradient":["ffffff","43d500"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/96/b4/58/96b4580e-93c1-a232-8b15-5703b3e035d9/Job44a1cc58-60a5-47ec-8ae2-a5578d99d6a8-194672043-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_381396729_2202275901-Time1749746877394.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"615c4f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fbf4d8","textColor2":"fae4a8","textColor3":"dcd5bc","textColor4":"dcc996","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/47/7e/5a/477e5a10-d325-235f-7f6e-ea3a24fd12b9/8788badd-3624-4b32-8ba9-fdff0cf3a266.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Nine songs that find the band—now a trio—in a state of ragged intimacy.","standard":"After the stylistic sprawl of 2022’s <i>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You</i>, Big Thief’s sixth album finds the group bringing their increasingly distinctive sound closer to the vest in a literal sense: <i>Double Infinity</i> is their first album as a proper trio, following the departure of bassist Max Oleartchik. As a result, these nine songs—woolly, warm, and with frissons of electricity coursing through their veins—capture Big Thief in a state of ragged intimacy, every melodic turn and shift in instrumentation expanding and contracting like a pair of lungs. \n\nThe rumbling drum fills and strummy framework of “Words” seemingly stretch for miles on end, while the nearly seven-minute “No Fear” carries a faint gothiness in its inky guitar lines that drip around Adrianne Lenker’s bruising vocals. More so than on any other Big Thief album to date, rock music is the name of the game here; even “Grandmother,” which features ambient legend Laraaji lending vocal incantations, bursts and blooms in a manner not unlike what was coming out of the 1970s Laurel Canyon scene.

The former BRITs Critics’ Choice winner has hit a prolific patch since becoming an independent artist, with his fourth album in five years. He’s gaining new fans on TikTok, opened for Billie Eilish (a fan of his 2024 album <i>Black Friday</i>) on tour in 2025, and delivered a self-assured tribute to Brian Wilson at Glastonbury a few weeks before this release. But dig deeper into his lyrics and there’s a mass of vulnerability, self-doubt, and sadness at the world.\n\nThe willingness to bare his soul has led to a deep connection with fans—underlined by the continuing viral success of his 2012 debut single “Another Love” and 2023’s “Black Friday”—and <i>A Wonderful Life</i> finds Odell at his most authentic, even if he still doesn’t love the mid-thirties version of himself. “I’m standing in the mirror/I want to change my skin/Wish that I was taller/Wish that I was thin,” he sings on the early Radiohead-esque “Ugly.”\n\nWritten on tour in 2024, <i>A Wonderful Life</i> is a snapshot of a hectic period in which Odell balances the messy business of life on the road with love and friendship. There’s a nod to a pre-gig burnout on “Can We Just Go Home Now,” where he’s determined to carry on despite his ills: “Call the doctor up to my hotel room/You see I’ve lost my voice, I’m in a very bad mood/Give me drugs, give me a drip, give me a 20 minute’s rest.”\n\nBut the show does go on and by the time Odell reaches the album’s closing track, the Leonard Cohen-inspired “The End of Suffering,” there’s a glimpse of light coming through the curtains. “It’s good to see the sun,” sings Odell, suggesting that life might still be a little bit wonderful after all.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"A Wonderful Life","playParams":{"id":"1814427089","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-wonderful-life/1814427089","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5sjDYH0h22YYNEWiRw9IH5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814427089/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"524929515","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/524929515?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757666851509,"RTCI":0}}},"1814913813":{"id":"1814913813","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814913813?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Edie Bens","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/edie-bens/1317599505","artwork":{"bgColor":"050b1e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"c6eaed","textColor2":"c6c1cb","textColor3":"9fbdc4","textColor4":"a09ca8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/7c/e2/9e7ce29f-12bc-f2cb-a02f-bfb98cbef719/199350467004.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Cushiony vocals and elegant production from the Welsh singer-songwriter.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Songs for Myfanwy","playParams":{"id":"1814913813","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":8,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/songs-for-myfanwy/1814913813","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/31H5DZZXYZ6PvN4ZOWlBW7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814913813/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1317599505","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1317599505?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757652921637,"RTCI":0}}},"1814923974":{"id":"1814923974","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1814923974?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Frost Children","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/frost-children/1505504789","artwork":{"bgColor":"7a4d51","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f2faf8","textColor2":"fadfe3","textColor3":"dad8d7","textColor4":"e0c2c6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ef/14/8f/ef148f63-6d89-7703-30a8-239e480e1411/198704498367_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"a2a69f","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"1d090b","textColor2":"280a0f","textColor3":"372828","textColor4":"40292c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ee/9d/4d/ee9d4d2a-ed9d-f09b-1b4d-1036419f62d2/Job27f93654-b544-40ef-90f2-63b6496aad6f-196835503-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385440303_2241387809-Time1751947365284.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"2e231f","gradient":{"color":"2e231f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"110607","textColor3":"241a17","textColor4":"2d1e1c","textGradient":["ffffff","110607"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/f0/68/ee/f068ee1f-052c-3f65-1055-b4384ad5e483/Job0c4c8b23-de5f-49d5-aeeb-35c55b49ee7d-196835502-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_385440304_2241387808-Time1751946362867.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Angel and Lulu Prost hone their chaotic maximalism.","standard":"Since their first project as Frost Children (2020’s <i>Aviation Creates Adventurous Beginnings</i>), the duo of Angel and Lulu Prost have honed their chaotic maximalism while helping to define what exactly the “indie sleaze revival” means—is the trend a sound or a feeling? If the free-wheeling, red-blooded party-rock anthems of the St. Louis-raised, New York-based duo are any indication, it’s the latter—drawing from hyperpop, indie rock, electroclash, and meme mischief, Frost Children’s music is hard to pin down, but easy to dance to. \n\nOn <i>SISTER</i>, the duo wrings every last drop of pathos from a serotonin-heavy blend of scuzzy bloghouse, mid-aughts dance-punk, and festival-core EDM. The spirit of indie sleaze is alive on “ELECTRIC,” with its buzzsaw synths and Rapture-esque vocals, while Kim Petras collab “RADIO” channels sleazy late-2000s electropop. Setting aside their previous work’s occasional tongue-in-cheek humor, the prevailing mood is earnest: On the title track, stripped-down ’90s rock shimmers with a hyperpop sheen as the siblings recall the dandelions and hand-me-downs of their Midwestern upbringing: “The two of us, driving down a roundabout life again/It’s the two of us/Sister.”\n","tagline":"New

life-affirming joy from a creative polymath and American treasure.","standard":"David Byrne’s last album, 2018’s <i>American Utopia</i>, wasn’t merely an album: It was a sprawling multimedia work that encompassed music, a stage show, and a film that captured the magic of its performance. In fact, it was so sprawling that its chronology even includes a lengthy period of dormancy, between opening on Broadway at the end of 2019 and restarting in 2021 after COVID restrictions were eased. “During the pandemic, of course, I wanted to write new songs, but I felt like what was happening was bigger than anything I could write about,” Byrne tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of that unexpected gap. “And I didn’t quite know how to address it.”\n\nWhile the songs that make up his eighth album under his given name, <i>Who Is the Sky?</i>, recorded with the musically elastic Ghost Train Orchestra, aren’t directly a product of that time, there are threads and themes that trace back to it. “I realized that some of these new songs are coming out of that,” he adds. The most obvious is probably the ode to his living quarters “My Apartment Is My Friend,” where Byrne ruminates on how intimate that physical space has become. \"So forgive me if I hesitate, if a tear comes now and then,” he sings. “You stood by me when darkness fell/My apartment is my friend.”\n\nByrne has always had a gift for making the specific, and even the fantastical, seem universal. “Moisturizing Thing” plays like a Hollywood sci-fi, starring Byrne himself, in which he tries an anti-aging skin treatment only to turn into a toddler, forcing him to see the world through another’s eyes. He’s constantly asking more of himself in these songs: He questions a smiling religious teacher who’s gorging himself on hors d’oeuvres (“I Met the Buddha at a Downtown Party”); he ponders the place he’s been put in history (“The Avant Garde”); he wonders how his wife just understands things so naturally (“She Explains Things to Me”); he sees life in cycles of happiness and pain, searching and resolution (“Everybody Laughs”). And he does it all with the playfulness, grace, and naked, life-affirming joy of a musical elder statesman who has never lost his curious, creative spark.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Who Is The Sky?","playParams":{"id":"1816027264","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-is-the-sky/1816027264","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5xDqZQlSx2gRrAyAgHQ8AB"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816027264/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"47192943","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/47192943?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757666904459,"RTCI":0}}},"1816303048":{"id":"1816303048","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816303048?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"El Michels Affair","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/el-michels-affair/79343988","artwork":{"bgColor":"0f0e0c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d3d0d6","textColor2":"c3babd","textColor3":"aca9ad","textColor4":"9f9799","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/84/86/20/8486206b-3d8e-d1c0-3419-efcbec22e4bb/54896.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"2c2c2c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f5f5f5","textColor2":"e4e4e4","textColor3":"cccccc","textColor4":"bfbfbf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a9/9a/d4/a99ad485-32fe-8198-6551-142c8046db9b/fd5e4b9e-de4c-4b19-a179-aaa22cf76c09.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Clairo and Norah Jones assist on Leon Michels’ cinematic funk odyssey.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","R&B/Soul"],"name":"24 Hr Sports","playParams":{"id":"1816303048","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/24-hr-sports/1816303048","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5oRPwgejhwzH2hbQJO5wrC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816303048/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"79343988","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/79343988?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757678351888,"RTCI":0}}},"1816935990":{"id":"1816935990","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816935990?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Between the Buried and Me","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/between-the-buried-and-me/107404782","artwork":{"bgColor":"ede7dd","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"181a1f","textColor2":"222427","textColor3":"424345","textColor4":"4a4b4b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/c5/ae/bc/c5aebc7f-6350-c9d6-9456-f3a43d416ee6/196873101217.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"040d0b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f39371","textColor2":"f55935","textColor3":"c3785c","textColor4":"c54a2c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2d/f3/22/2df32259-bdea-48e8-b843-e5bfbf4547f6/fbc1e1ed-dd89-402d-acbb-11202699f5c4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The prog-metal visionaries dive deeper into labyrinthine soundscapes.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"The Blue Nowhere","playParams":{"id":"1816935990","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-blue-nowhere/1816935990","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7qy9gnX5SXAeW9fO6pzwTh"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816935990/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"107404782","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/107404782?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757652924665,"RTCI":0}}},"1817067073":{"id":"1817067073","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817067073?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"LEISURE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/leisure/999524551","artwork":{"bgColor":"a92700","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"fcdfc9","textColor2":"fad0b2","textColor3":"ebbaa1","textColor4":"eaae8f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e6/af/de/e6afde0f-f270-83cd-8acf-fb467deffe6e/067003177252.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"9a4a1c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"fce098","textColor2":"fdce57","textColor3":"e8c280","textColor4":"e9b34b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/9d/ab/389dab22-e8c1-91f9-68e4-d519fa4fe3e7/8136109e-e9cf-467b-9dfa-65bdaced4a56.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"These love songs are sincere and soulful in the best sense.","standard":"Romantic longing and devotion suffuses the fifth album from Auckland collective LEISURE. A full decade after the six members first convened, their unique brand of modern soul sounds more sincere than ever as multiple members take turns at the mic to serenade the song’s subjects. “I find my diamonds in you” goes the falsetto refrain of “Diamonds,” while similar sentiments guide “Dominoes” and “One in a Million.” The airy “Beach House” imagines buying the titular retreat for one’s lover and falling asleep together against the soothing sound of waves. LEISURE wanted fewer programmed elements and more live arrangements this time around, so they tapped outside guests for selective strings, brass, piano, and backing vocals. Yet, these songs are much more intimate than they are expansive, always sounding like sweet nothings being whispered from the next pillow. As for the music, it remains distinctly smooth and supple, with occasional reggae and funk tinges sneaking into the easygoing proceedings.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Welcome to the Mood","playParams":{"id":"1817067073","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-the-mood/1817067073","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3UtLsPn5V412E1SeqzFOP2"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817067073/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"999524551","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/999524551?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757669080847,"RTCI":0}}},"1817272996":{"id":"1817272996","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817272996?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Mimi Webb","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mimi-webb/1294518981","artwork":{"bgColor":"bdc0c0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0a0b0b","textColor2":"161a18","textColor3":"2e2f2f","textColor4":"373b39","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/15/7d/c6/157dc68f-ab70-cb56-54ea-696ac905fb26/196873182421.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"605851","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f9edeb","textColor2":"fbdbd6","textColor3":"dacfcc","textColor4":"dcc0bb","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/c8/05/47/c8054734-4db4-8299-3b72-56a6e3b5e4f6/b47bb4bf-5d1d-463f-bd37-bb71c1268e16.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“It’s about unexpected turns”: the viral phenom goes deep on her second LP.","standard":"Mimi Webb’s <i>Confessions</i> is packed with self-assured pop goodness, but the singer-songwriter had so many doubts about it she abandoned her initial ideas. “The first version of the album was completely scrapped,” Webb tells Apple Music Radio. “I wrote it about a year and a half ago and I just freaked out and felt so uninspired. I was like, ‘I can’t sing these bloody songs for the next two years on tour. There’s just no way.’ Even though I had so much love for them, it wasn’t touching the surface for me, it wasn’t deep enough for what I was going through in my day-to-day life.”\n\nWebb admits starting again on the follow-up to 2023’s <i>Amelia</i> was a challenge, but it’s one that left her “very happy.” And putting in that extra shift paid off, with 12 songs that show the emotional range of mid-twenties life. Webb shot to fame in the early 2020s with the Charli D’Amelio-endorsed “Before I Go,” and <i>Confessions</i> finds her diving deeper. Beneath the glossy Y2K R&B of “Kiss My Neck” lies hidden heartbreak, and she offers a tender acceptance of her parents’ split after 30 years of marriage on “You Don’t Look at Me the Same.”\n\nOne of Webb’s favorite tracks on the album is “Mind Reader,” with Meghan Trainor. “We went to her house and we were vibing the whole time writing that one,” she says. There’s also the standout “Love Language,” a tight three minutes of sophisticated pop that sees Webb examining what she wants from a partner. “It changes a lot with age,” she says. “When I was 21, it was gift giving and then as I got older, it’s all acts of service for me, just being a few steps ahead and helping me. If I’m rushing home from work, I’d love a bit of dinner on the table.”\n\nThere was just one more element of uncertainty once <i>Confessions</i> was finished: the title. “I had no idea what I was going to call this album and I was back and forth,” she says. “There’s a lot of positive and a lot of negative in it, and I think that is the story of life. For me, it was about being able to break the fourth wall on this album and dive a lot deeper than the surface levels. It’s about the whole experience of unexpected turns—you never really know what’s around the corner.”","tagline":"New Album and

1995 rootsy classic, enriched with alternate versions and demos.","standard":"Produced by Howie Epstein, <i>Lost Dogs + Mixed Blessings</i> was a new approach for John Prine. The band features master players from the L.A. studio scene, including guitarist Waddy Wachtel, multi-instrumentalist John Jorgenson, keyboardist Benmont Tench, and bassist Bob Glaub. Unsurprisingly, the result sounds more than a little like ’90s-era Tom Petty; that’s not a bad thing, especially on “Lake Marie,” “Same Thing Happened to Me,\" and “New Train.” The nondescript production of “We Are the Lonely” disguises what are easily some of Prine’s most hilariously self-deprecating lyrics: “White divorced swinging male/Seeks company to no avail/Worthless ruthless toothless man/Wants wealthy woman with a plan.” As much as fans and producers might want to try out new styles on Prine, there’s no denying the effect of “Day Is Done,” “This Love Is Real,\" and “He Forgot That It Was Sunday,” which essentially feature his voice and an acoustic guitar. Such songs provide a pleasure equal to watching fresh bread rise in a clay oven. But the real jewel is the closer, “I Love You So Much It Hurts,” a sweetly askew piano ballad worthy of Nilsson or Newman.","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music","Americana"],"name":"Lost Dogs + Mixed Blessings (Deluxe Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1819975338","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/lost-dogs-mixed-blessings-deluxe-edition/1819975338","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1OOmTHCxJ5pTg63TTcsVQm"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1819975338/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"157060","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/157060?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757674367145,"RTCI":0}}},"1820217693":{"id":"1820217693","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820217693?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"SG Lewis","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sg-lewis/966324292","artwork":{"bgColor":"23251d","hasP3":false,"height":4724,"textColor1":"e3b6d4","textColor2":"b7a7d8","textColor3":"bc99b0","textColor4":"998db3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/60/cd/44/60cd449b-2e0a-05a0-c5a7-366cf45fe9ba/25UMGIM50802.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4724},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"110e02","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1eee7","textColor2":"f5a13f","textColor3":"c4c1b9","textColor4":"c78333","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c1/bf/22/c1bf223c-1385-1c59-3612-bf10f3af1fbc/ded0ef9b-180b-4344-a401-ff92f8fc8297.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"“If there’s a deeper purpose to dance music, it’s escapism,” says the DJ.","standard":"“I think the difference between a ‘producer album’ and a ‘singer-songwriter album’ in the traditional artist sense is that you’re really trying to bring people into a feeling,” SG Lewis tells Apple Music. On his rapturous third studio album, the DJ/producer invites the audience to share in an emotion he has been experiencing for as long as he has been listening to and making music—albeit one he only recently learned there was a word for, after spending a summer immersed in the history of Ibiza. “In a lot of the music I make, I like to make references to different time periods or different eras of music, and I was kind of like, ‘What is the reason that I feel drawn to these different eras that I wasn’t a part of?’ It’s not nostalgia, because I wasn’t alive for it,” he says. “Is there a term for feeling nostalgia for something you haven’t experienced?”\n\nThe term Lewis was searching for would became the title of the record: <i>Anemoia</i>. Building on the idea of Ibiza as “a partying promised land, where all the shame and all the shackles of society didn’t exist,” he rendered the concept as a dream-within-a-dream-like reimagining of nightlife on the island during the ’90s. “I was pairing these nostalgic sounds that are very familiar to people, and are classic in a sense, with songwriters and voices and stories that are modern—but then also trying to find a through line in the production that tied those things together into what I interpreted as the sound of anemoia,” he says.\n\n<i>Anemoia</i> may keep a longing eye on the past, but the idealized fantasies conjured by tracks like the wistfully haunting “Feelings Gone” or bubbling rave anthem “Devotion” capture just as much of the current cultural moment—something Lewis was conscious of preserving as the record began to take shape. “If there’s any kind of deeper purpose to dance music, to me, it’s escapism,” he says. “Retrospectively, I want this album to create the feeling of anemoia for people who perhaps weren’t around or weren’t old enough to experience clubbing now, and the sound of the album and things I’m drawing on are all very escapist because there’s a lot of reasons to feel scared and worried about the future. I’m trying to create a sonic world people can escape into, or soundtrack their escapism and deliver them from whatever hardship they’re facing. That’s the mission.” Read on to find out more as he takes us through <i>Anemoia</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Memory”</b>\n“I knew that the word ‘anemoia’ is not a familiar word. I didn’t know what it meant before I Googled it, and also that no one knows how to pronounce it. So I wanted to build a track that was like a sonic introduction to the world which the album was going to inhabit, but then also be able to put on some audio that would introduce people to the concept of anemoia because it was not self-explanatory. The whole purpose of ‘Memory’ is just to introduce people to the feeling of the album—the euphoria, and this kind of bittersweetness, the chords, the sound—and also the literal concept.”\n\n<b>“Feelings Gone” (with London Grammar)</b>\n“For years I had this instrumental that I’d started in LA with my friend, J Moon. It was something that I was playing in DJ sets, and it had this feeling which was like bittersweet, but also the build of it and the drums having a slightly Balearic feeling to them. It was the first thing I made that I was like, ‘Oh, this is like the sound of the album…’ But the only voice I could hear on it in my head was Hannah’s [Hannah Reid of London Grammar]. There’s a depth to her voice and her songwriting that adds such emotional weight. Sometimes, dance music, especially pop dance music, can feel disposable but I just felt that Hannah and the band would really create a track that had depth. Rather than referencing what was happening in ’90s Ibiza, ‘Feelings Gone’ is my projection. If I was looking at those photos, what’s playing in my head?”\n\n<b>“Sugar” (with Shygirl)</b>\n“Shygirl and I started this song on the same day that we started ‘mr useless,’ which was a song that we did for her project [2024’s <i>Club Shy</i> EP]. So we had this other demo and I got Shygirl down and we finished off the song structure and stuff, and then TEED [Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs] added the synth line. We really wanted ‘Sugar’ to feel like one of those 2000s Hedkandi, ’90s trance, super-pop dance records where they’re just like an overflow of serotonin and joy—for every decision to be very bright and very pop.”\n\n<b>“Transition” (with RAHH)</b>\n“The summer that ended up making this album exist, I spent a lot of time in Ibiza and I played Pacha I lot. It’s the oldest club on the island, it has so much history. There’s a sound of Pacha and it’s this 2000s, super-compressed drums, funky basslines, French Touch—I wanted to create a song that is a nod to that. I’d heard RAHH on a couple of records so we got together, and she’s an incredible songwriter. She is able to deliver these vocals that have the power and soul of a classic house vocal, but it’s not delivered in a way that feels like pastiche. A lot of the album leans more into that kind of bittersweetness. I love that feeling, but when I sat back and listened to everything, I wanted a record that did the opposite. ‘Transition’ is a call to arms, the kind of dance record that I play out at peak times.”\n\n<b>“Devotion” (with Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs)</b>\n“TEED is one of my best friends in the world, but he still remains a musical hero of mine. He is someone I get a lot of help and advice from, so it only felt right to have him collaborate on the album. This was an instrumental we started together. We tried a bunch of different ideas and vocals, and eventually, I was like, ‘Why don’t you just sing on it?’ It’s very euphoric in a classic ’90s piano house way. When I think of acid house and the UK rave movement scene, I think about those ’90s rave piano tracks. It doesn’t matter where you are or how long you’ve been playing, when you reach that piano breakdown, the sound of those beats coming in provides such a moment of lights-on euphoria.”\n\n<b>“Past Life”</b>\n“This is really a breather in what is otherwise a very dance-oriented album. In any album or extended format like this, I do think that a change in tempo is a relief. So I wrote this hook that induced a sort of dreamlike state. The whole thing is supposed to be from the perspective of someone dreaming about another time in the past and what that might’ve been like. Just creating a moment of reflection and a sonic change from the pace and euphoria of the rest of the album.”\n\n<b>“Back of My Mind”</b>\n“I use my vocal in a way that is a lot more direct and front-on than I have done in the past—there’s less reverb, less effects—and I think that there’s a story and a deep emotion to it. All my favorite club music has that element. Whether it’s Robyn, ‘Dancing on My Own’ or Kings of Tomorrow, ‘Finally,’ those songs are designed for the club and an environment that’s very hedonistic and kind of momentary, but they have a depth and a story, and I think that gives them the longevity and the purpose. The initial idea was less dance-y—it came from listening to Radiohead, the verse was very meandering, kind of like Thom Yorke, trying to be cool—and it was like the euphoria got added and it got beefed up. Now that I’m playing it live, I can see people connecting to the lyrics. I hadn’t heard that phrase used in a dance record but it’s a very universal feeling.”\n\n<b>“Another Place” (with Frances)</b>\n“Frances is a long-term collaborator of mine, we went to university together. She’s primarily a songwriter now, and we did some great songs for this record, but she’s so musically gifted and has the most incredible vocal so I asked her if she would feature on this. I really wanted to create the end-of-night, 4 am, sort of slight comedown, emotional breakbeat song. The ‘Think’ break [the much-sampled drum break topped with ‘Woo! Yeah!’ from Lyn Collins’ ‘Think (About It)’] is sampled in this. I wanted to trigger that feeling of anemoia for people who aren’t tuned in to the names of different breaks where they’re like, ‘Where do I know this from?’ and because it’s such an iconic break and so synonymous with rave and dance music, the ‘Think’ break does that for a lot of people. I think that’s a fun emotion to play with.”\n\n<b>“Fallen Apart”</b>\n“I wrote the original six years ago, very quickly, after someone that I worked with really hurt my feelings. It was like a note that I’d written down, just like, ‘I’m not going to forget that’ and it sat on my hard drive for ages but there was never really a home for it. I played it to TEED, and we spent a day working on it, beefing it up and turning it into what it became. It’s funny because it sounds like a romantic breakup song, and I think, eventually, I changed some of the lyrics to allow it to resonate in that way, but it really came from a platonic falling out.”\n\n<b>“Baby Blue” (with Oliver Sim)</b>\n“I met Oliver in LA when I was working on this record and we did two sessions—one for my album, one for his. We didn’t come away with songs we wanted to put out, but we immediately got on well. I had this instrumental I’d worked on with my friend Karma Kid, and we just spent a day trying to make these end-of-night, disco-edit kind of instrumentals. I found this sample, Wess Machine, ‘Hard Luck’ and the intro just had this two-bar loop. I resampled it and added elements to it, made it work in a modern club setting. I sent it to Oliver, and he was out but said, ‘Give me five minutes…’ Five minutes later, he sends a voice note and he’d written the hook. He was like, ‘I just went in the toilet and wrote this.’ I was gobsmacked. So then he came down to my garden and we recorded it. Wrote a little verse and it was done. His voice is so warm and rich and beautiful. He’s a very special human being.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"name":"Anemoia","playParams":{"id":"1820217693","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/anemoia/1820217693","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3kse3e9XxmIedJb9bfjErH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820217693/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"966324292","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/966324292?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757673239245,"RTCI":0}}},"1821034852":{"id":"1821034852","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821034852?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"DEATH META","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/death-meta/1821033910","artwork":{"bgColor":"2f2f2f","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f5f5f5","textColor2":"e2e2e2","textColor3":"cdcdcd","textColor4":"bebebe","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/6b/3a/80/6b3a80c5-b389-2eb6-6597-71522c253dab/199538035827.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"MALWARE","playParams":{"id":"1821034852","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/malware/1821034852","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/36iWWIBtHpBUZgncjFWaPZ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821034852/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1821033910","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1821033910?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757640907327,"RTCI":0}}},"1821237733":{"id":"1821237733","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821237733?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Joni Mitchell","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/joni-mitchell/203373","artwork":{"bgColor":"1b1720","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"e99894","textColor2":"d99988","textColor3":"c07e7d","textColor4":"b37f73","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cb/ee/08/cbee08cf-589f-e13e-68e1-3c6cc5a3554d/603497811090.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A massive self-portrait of Mitchell’s most fluid, exploratory side.","standard":"Joni Mitchell fell in love with jazz as a teenager—in particular, the sound of Miles Davis’ trumpet. “Miles Davis taught me how to sing,” she said onstage in 1974. “Pure straight tones holding straight lines. The feeling when you sing and you open up your heart.” As much as we call her a folk singer (her acoustic guitar, her historical context), her music always felt more like jazz whether it sounded like it or not: the subtlety, the complexity, the privileging of personal freedom over the unity of (and accessibility to) the crowd. You could sing Neil Young at a protest or a campfire; Joni Mitchell, not so much.\n\n<i>Joni’s Jazz</i>, which starts with 1971’s “Blue” and goes on to present a non-chronological edit of album, live, and demo tracks going all the way up to “Summertime” from the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, is both a celebration of her music and an argument of sorts about it—namely that the “jazz” that drove the narrative around definitive but divisive albums like 1975’s <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> and 1979’s <i>Mingus</i> was actually a central part of her sound for most of her career and a driver of her creative legacy. (Of <i>Hissing</i>, she once joked that she “cut the jazzers some slack…and that was the kiss of death.”)\n\nThe irony of this progressive, often wild music is that it came out of a rejection of what at the time was considered cool. “I couldn’t get anybody to explain how this got to be hip,” she once said of her frustrations with the recording process in the late ’60s. “It wasn’t as good as the sound that went before.” Basic stuff, she meant—how drums sounded, the way a bass player arranged their part around her vocal melodies. “They would get exasperated, like I was ignorant,” she said.

Matchbox Twenty leader yearns for the chaos of youth.","standard":"On Rob Thomas’ sixth solo album, <i>All Night Days</i>, the Matchbox Twenty bandleader yearns for the chaos of youth. The title puts the singer in that hazy early-morning light, in that half-sleep state after an all-nighter, before the body can figure out what time it is and why it’s been awake for so long. On the title track, Thomas cooks up a hard-charging drum groove and atmospheric synths that give way to a chugging guitar melody and pedal steel accents. He wishes to be wild for just one more minute, to approach life with the unabashed joyfulness of his youth. He admits it might be the booze speaking, but honesty always flows easier with inebriation. “Picture Perfect” is a throwback cut, featuring drum sounds from ’80s synth-pop records and glimmering synths. Here, old memories are like “sad, sad songs.” Thomas asks to be taken back to a time he can hold on to, to a world in which the highs of freedom are tangible—not merely memories he’s left singing about.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"All Night Days","playParams":{"id":"1823142720","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-night-days/1823142720","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/29X77czxu4Wi88sASWvKHi"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823142720/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"217178","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/217178?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757666995033,"RTCI":0}}},"1824262319":{"id":"1824262319","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1824262319?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Rapsody & Madlib","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=6283845-19657316","artwork":{"bgColor":"ff3f1d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0d0806","textColor2":"011d15","textColor3":"3e130a","textColor4":"342416","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/63/54/ab/6354ab58-ee31-face-372b-0e1747cadd77/25UMGIM89593.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ff401f","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"100806","textColor2":"2f0e08","textColor3":"40130b","textColor4":"58180d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/16/e5/54/16e554e4-891e-4164-3c3a-395aa9c7a98a/Job7dd62c02-34c0-4af5-b613-fb89c1a0ecd1-202844027-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396760380_2334922337-Time1757619435949.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"111610","textColor3":"39110a","textColor4":"411e12","textGradient":["ffffff","111610"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/62/bd/fb/62bdfb81-329f-6b74-5ea0-a2c23a223f22/Job0d264ec5-03c4-49f4-ab26-57eb3fbdb308-202844026-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396760379_2334922338-Time1757618140884.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"MadRaps -

All the while, they’ve built an ornate fictional universe in which the exploits of characters like Clancy and the Torchbearer function as allegories about living with depression, anxiety, and insecurity. <i>Breach</i>, the duo’s eighth album, concludes the decade-long narrative that began with <i>Blurryface</i> and continued with their next three full-lengths (2018’s <i>Trench</i>, 2021’s <i>Scaled and Icy</i>, and 2024’s <i>Clancy</i>), resolving the cliffhanger of its predecessor’s ending. Through a dense rap-rock dystopia populated by robots and necromancers, the duo fight through bouts of insecurity (“Garbage”) and paranoia (“The Contract,” which recruits YUNGBLUD to continue where last year’s “Paladin Strait” left off). “Did you learn a thing?” Joseph sings on the haunting closing track, looking back on the decade-long journey and concluding: “Intentions will set you free.”","tagline":"New

Durban MC is finally unbound: “This album was inspired by feeling free.”","standard":"As a fixture of South African hip-hop for the past decade, Nasty C would like it to be known that upon the release of his aptly titled fifth album, <i>Free</i>, he’s more at peace with his creative practice than ever. “This album was inspired by feeling free to be creative and do all sorts of different new stuff, and experience some new things,” the Durban-raised MC tells Apple Music. “That’s pretty much what it was, and exploring different sounds.”\n\nOn his previous album, 2023’s <i>I Love It Here</i>, Nasty celebrated the joys of fatherhood and the thrills of a stable relationship over the bouncy trap-influenced instrumentals he’s become known for. With <i>Free</i>, he embraces the mobility of self-determination, delighting in an ability to chart a course for himself, regardless of where it lands him. Across the project’s 16 songs, Nasty runs through a range of emotions and life experiences. He’s back outside on the trippy “Shmokin” and then regaling nieces and nephews with tales from the pinnacle of South African hip-hop on “That’s Whassup.” As always, the MC stays nimble, folding influences from house, rock, and R&B into his expansive interpretation of hip-hop. “No two songs are the same, and some songs lean more towards the pop side of things,” he explains. “Some even touch on maskandi a little bit, which is like a Zulu genre. It’s a South African genre, but it’s very, very heavy in the Zulu culture; that was pretty exciting to do.” Below, Nasty C walks us through <i>Free</i>, track by track. \n\n<b>“Intro”</b>\n“‘Intro’ is one of those [songs] where the beat just inspires everything I say on the song, and you just ride the energy of the beat. We were in the studio, making music with some cool, creative people; talented artists.”\n\n<b>“Leftie (Dlala Ngcobo)”</b>\n“‘Leftie,’ kind of the same thing as ‘Intro’ [where] I just wanted something very high-energy, something playful or something melodic, not too crazy on the lyrics and punchlines and all that kind of stuff. I just wanted a vibe. ‘Leftie’ was produced by a guy called Cxdy, who’s a producer I like to work with from the States. He’s sick.”\n\n<b>“Shmokin”</b>\n“I recorded ‘Shmokin’ at my house here in Joburg. It’s a similar vibe to the two songs before it. I started recording, and before I knew it, I had this concept of just feeling like I’m back outside, smoking, drinking, vibing, mosh pits—all that kind of stuff.”\n\n<b>“Switch”</b>\n“‘Switch’ is about staying loyal to your friends and not switching because of outside opinions. Friendship should not be about what people think about where you should go, who you should hang out with, what you should dress and look like, and all that kind of stuff. It’s just being true to yourself and staying with the people that have always been there for you, that are locked in with you.”\n\n<b>“Head Up”</b>\n“‘Head Up’ was produced by a guy called RJ Banks. I brought my band with me that I perform with into the studio to add some live elements to it. In this song, I’m talking about staying positive, keeping your eyes on the prize, and focusing on the mission no matter what happens in life or what people say. A lot of people like to add their two cents when it comes to where someone’s career should go, just because they’ve been fans of them or they’ve been on the same journey with them. So when you switch things up as an artist, when you decide you want to go left or right or whatever, a lot of people might think you’re starting to lose the plot, or you’re slowing down, or you’re not sticking to the mission. If you know what your heart wants and where you want to go, just stay on it. People will understand in the end.”\n\n<b>“Soft”</b>\n“This one is pretty straightforward. It’s me talking about working hard just to live soft: grinding, hustling, to be able to survive. I made the beat for this one.”\n\n<b>“That’s Whassup”</b>\n“This one is one of those laid-back songs [that] feels like an interlude, a breather from the album’s pace. I’m just reflecting on where I am and the kind of influence that I have on my younger siblings, younger cousins, nieces, and nephews. It’s me realizing where I’m at and how cool I am to them. That realization just kicks in automatically every time I go back home. I was in Durban for a week or so, and it came off the kind of questions that they asked me, how interested they are in the life I live, the people I get to hang out with, and all that kind of stuff. They find that to be fascinating and cool.”\n\n<b>“10 Shooters”</b>\n“MashBeatz made the beat for this song. That’s another one of those where we were just vibing in the studio, and you just get creative. It was one of those days.”\n\n<b>“Ice”</b>\n“I was in the studio with Kling from Saak Beats. We went through a couple of beats, laying down a bunch of ideas, and this happened to be one of the better ones that we ended up picking. The beat is fire, but that sample takes it to a whole new level. It was very inviting.”\n\n<b>“Psychic”</b>\n“This is another one of those where I made the beat, and I was freestyling as I was making the beat. By the time I was done with the beat, I already had a concept. This is one of those songs where I’m just vibing.”\n\n<b>“MSP” (feat. DJ Speedsta)</b>\n“This one was produced by a guy called Spaced Time. I was just experimenting and having fun when I was recording that one. I was just talking about the hate or the awkward vibes that you get from people. I used a local slang term/cuss word: ‘ma se poes’ is a big slang term in the colored community. In the first verse, I’m talking about the guys that give me an awkward vibe or weird vibe when they’re just hating, staring, and all that kind of stuff. In the second half of the song, I talk about getting that kind of energy from females.”\n\n<b>“Selfish”</b>\n“I’m talking to my girlfriend on ‘Selfish’ and just reaffirming my love for her. It’s about how I want our relationship to last forever and how my intentions are still the same from when we started. The album starts with vibes and then it gets deeper. It just settles down a little bit and we talk.”\n\n<b>“Big Timing” (feat. Tellaman)</b>\n“‘Big Timing’ is about making it big with your friends, working with your friends, becoming successful with them, and sticking together through the thick and the thin. One of the things that makes me appreciate the friends that I have left is losing some friends throughout the journey. That makes you appreciate the ones who stayed and stuck by you even more. It feels good to make it with your people.”\n\n<b>“Evidence”</b>\n“‘Evidence’ is about believing in God, having faith, and wanting to believe that there’s a heaven and a better place. We’re just passing through this life, and this song is about asking all those questions that everyone asks, like, ‘Is it real? Is it worth sacrificing so much in this life that I’m presently living right now for something that I can’t see?’ There’s never been anyone who went there and came back and told me, ‘Yo, it’s real. Fix your life!’ So it’s like having those questions and those doubts while still believing, but saying, ‘Yo, it wouldn’t hurt to get a little bit of evidence.’”\n\n<b>“Other Plans (Interlude)”</b>\n“‘Other Plans’ is a song about being at a weird place with a person that you’re dating. It’s this awkward place where you don’t know if you’re taking a break, if you’re fully broken up, if you’ll get back together, or if this is it. On the song, I’m just reflecting on the good times, and thinking about where I messed up along the way, and what could have caused this thing that we’re going through at the moment, and thinking about the realities of that.”\n\n<b>“Not Tonight” (feat.

The six-track mini album represented a long-awaited reunion for members SHOWNU, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, JOOHONEY, and I.M, following a multi-year hiatus due to mandatory military service. Because of this, <i>THE X</i> isn’t just an album—it’s a musical bridge between MONSTA X’s boundary-breaking past and their future. \n\n“Time has passed, and it’s already been over a decade,” <i>maknae</i> I.M raps, in an interplay of Korean and English, on the Brazilian funk club banger “Do What I Want.” “We never slack off, the six of us together are never afraid.” Rapper JOOHONEY led composition for the forward-looking album opener, which acts as a reintroduction to MONSTA X’s focused, devil-may-care persona. \n\nThe third-generation idol group has taken an active part in writing their own music since their 2015 debut out of the survival show <i>No.Mercy</i>. Other “self-produced” tracks on <i>THE X</i> include the I.M-led “Savior,” a sexy pop earworm about an obsessive love, and the Hyungwon-led “Fire & Ice,” an R&B-tinged pop track about two opposites coming together. \n\nLead single “N the Front” has prolific American producer Dem Jointz behind the scenes. The track blends swaggering, rap-driven zigs with rock-fueled vocal zags. While it’s the only track without a MONSTA X member on the writing team, it’s a song that simultaneously evokes the group’s hip-hip idol origins and the eclectic musical maturity they’ve developed in a decade of performance.\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"THE X -

viral Dallas R&B singer returns with an ethereal outing.","standard":"After “act ii: date @ 8” hit, nothing was the same for 4batz. That major viral moment sent the Dallas singer hurtling into the spotlight, collaborating with stars like Drake, Lil Baby, and USHER, to name just a few. Endeared to ’90s-meets-2000s R&B aesthetics yet skillfully refurbished with modern Southern hip-hop appeal, 2024’s <i>u made me a st4r</i> provided a more complete picture of the type of artist he aimed to be. “I just was dealing with a lot of pressure going in my last project,” he tells Apple Music. “I had to settle down and remind myself that I could still do this.”\n\nFor his follow-up <i>Still Shinin</i>, sporting solid features from Texas rappers Maxo Kream and Zillionaire Doe, his endeavors to self-define and self-assess continue to progress in his favor. “We from Texas, so it hit different,” he says. “We showing y’all the culture right now, man.”\n\nWith Swishahouse co-founder and Chopstars DJ OG Ron C frequently popping in as a mixtape-styled host, the project furthers 4batz’s episodic escapades via the grindset romantics of “act x: n da mornin” and the lusty versatility of “act xiii: my lil shootah.” Production-wise, a woozy gloss coats just about every track, applying an ethereal, otherworldly quality to “act xiv: twerksongggg” and the knowing throwback “act xii: big on u.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Still

“club country” EP that distills sounds of the past decade.","standard":"Country up-and-comer Graham Barham found viral success by taking key genre trends from the last decade and change and distilling them into one sound, which he dubs “club country.” The R&B influence of early Sam Hunt, the crossover pop of Florida Georgia Line, and the down-and-out dirtbaggery of Morgan Wallen all gel together here on this EP from Barham, which follows a string of one-offs from the Louisiana native, like the hit “OIL MONEY.” Highlights on <i>WHISKEY RAIN</i> include “WRITE IT IN RED,” an autobiographical celebration of the country life that recalls “Dirt Road Anthem”-era Jason Aldean, and “WTH JUST HAPPENED?,” a shapeshifting ballad—rootsy verses give way to 808-inflected choruses—with shades of Eric

He plays the activist and leader on his 2025 effort: On “Before Hip Hop,” he examines the ways in which rap music is blamed for many societal ills that existed long before the genre came to fruition. “Act My Age,” which features Scarface, is an homage to and encouragement toward all the MCs who are rapping into middle age and bringing valuable perspectives to a genre led by younger artists. It’s uplifting, and though it’s one of many tracks imbued with a positive social message, Cube still leaves plenty of time to mess around and talk shit over classic gangsta rap beats. “Forget Me If You Ain’t Wit Me” is crafted for top-down cruises on the 91, and “That Salt and Pepper” is an intergalactic-funk reminder that age is only a number—especially when you’re Ice Cube.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","West Coast Rap"],"name":"Man Up","playParams":{"id":"1835940376","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/man-up/1835940376","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1lrNGJv5aIKpx4bznJyHCF"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835940376/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"471370","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/471370?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757653394540,"RTCI":0}}},"1836057630":{"id":"1836057630","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836057630?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Laurel Aitken","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/laurel-aitken/3178772","artwork":{"bgColor":"efb30d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"261a0b","textColor2":"262218","textColor3":"4e390b","textColor4":"4e3f16","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/bd/5b/da/bd5bda77-b3bb-d648-a2cd-eac220a03355/885890732930.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Reggae","Music","Ska"],"name":"Reggae Serenade: The Singles Collection 1972-1979","playParams":{"id":"1836057630","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":25,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/reggae-serenade-the-singles-collection-1972-1979/1836057630","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4LzoLLxYTPs4ggm8Y2VYOU"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836057630/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"3178772","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/3178772?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757586714950,"RTCI":0}}},"1836320628":{"id":"1836320628","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836320628?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Cuco","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cuco/1457270880","artwork":{"bgColor":"190e0a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"dcbdae","textColor2":"e0a78d","textColor3":"b59a8d","textColor4":"b88872","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/59/a3/a4/59a3a404-c3ae-c1d1-19a1-84020eb04657/25UM1IM24603.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d1daed","textColor2":"bacde8","textColor3":"aab2c0","textColor4":"98a7bd","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/9c/12/5c/9c125cc5-0904-03d6-3470-99fbcd65bc97/74c9ad67-6962-41cd-b8e5-0126618b50b7.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The indie pop artist adds six new tracks to his soulful love letter to LA.","standard":"The musician born Omar Banos emerged in the mid-2010s as a teenage old soul: His first brush with virality was for his slide-guitar cover of Santo & Johnny’s dreamy 1959 hit “Sleepwalk,” recorded in his high-school bedroom. A decade later, the 26-year-old singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist has amassed a die-hard fanbase for his vibey, lo-fi pop in which he draws from doo-wop, psych rock, and norteño and often lapses into Spanglish (as on his breakout single, 2017’s “Lo Que Siento”). “When I was first putting out music, I was always just trying to release—I didn’t necessarily have a timeline or an idea of what I wanted to do,” Cuco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “But as everything became a little more established, I feel like taking the time to put together projects that felt cohesive would be worth taking the time.”\n\nHis third album, <i>Ridin’</i>, is a love letter to his hometown of Los Angeles—specifically, its Mexican American car culture. It’s also a callback to the old Chicano soul music he’s loved since he was little. “ICNBYH” feels beamed in from an AM radio broadcast circa the early ’70s, with its easygoing swirl of brass and woodwinds. Far from the Ableton experiments of his teenage bedroom, here he’s joined by a team of first-rate instrumentalists, from The Roots’ trumpeter Dave Guy (who appears on “My Old Friend”) to producer Thomas Brenneck, who’s worked with everyone from Amy Winehouse to Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. “It could be riding with the whips, riding for your people, riding through the motions of life,” Cuco says of the album’s title. Still, it’s built to be played in the car with the windows down.","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Ridin' (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1836320628","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ridin-deluxe/1836320628","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1sN04YNP3ZXH3zEKN2xX9p"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836320628/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1457270880","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1457270880?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757667981703,"RTCI":0}}},"1836372096":{"id":"1836372096","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836372096?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Rachel Chinouriri","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rachel-chinouriri/1033202344","artwork":{"bgColor":"c1dfe9","hasP3":false,"height":3286,"textColor1":"090e08","textColor2":"1f2407","textColor3":"2e3835","textColor4":"3f4934","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/cf/77/61/cf7761f0-3880-5cda-8bf4-bbdb9b5ab059/5021732966803.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3286},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Indie Pop"],"name":"Little House - EP","playParams":{"id":"1836372096","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":5,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/little-house-ep/1836372096"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836372096/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1033202344","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1033202344?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757673939997,"RTCI":0}}},"1836562145":{"id":"1836562145","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836562145?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"NGHTMRE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nghtmre/910641213","artwork":{"bgColor":"eed0f5","hasP3":true,"height":3000,"textColor1":"010201","textColor2":"262626","textColor3":"302b32","textColor4":"4e484f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/95/74/d7/9574d7c6-806e-7268-5d42-680c7453046d/3ccb8ab3-afbf-40a6-9df7-2681a9383e68.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"f8e3fb","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3b363c","textColor4":"403442","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/56/ec/5b/56ec5bc3-3469-b4ac-6679-bd6910bceea1/c2bca8ea-2082-4a3c-895d-cefffe6af22a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"f9e5fb","hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"403442","textColor4":"413642","textGradient":["000000","000000"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/56/b1/40/56b14023-c428-2cfd-b836-da88d9213f05/a325c9d9-390e-4a6c-bb61-adcd83eaaafe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionCover":{"bgColor":"f3e3f4","gradient":{},"hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"383538","textColor4":"494549","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c3/f9/f0/c3f9f051-df32-9797-11a7-746c31193f3b/237555c4-a1c6-42a2-a179-d28dee1491eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f3e1f4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"413d42","textColor4":"534f53","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/0d/80/66/0d806680-e771-64e4-ce26-c61899f92381/1c199cf1-b970-4b9c-af91-372c5d8d1b72.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"f7e7f8","hasP3":true,"height":2240,"imageTraits":["hasTitle"],"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"403d40","textColor4":"535054","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/38/05/40/38054037-de10-b1ea-2e71-59d1caf6bdac/d57c83c4-acfb-4c88-82d1-f545d6e7f2a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1680},"superHeroWide":{"bgColor":"f4e3f6","hasP3":true,"height":1800,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"3a373a","textColor4":"59565a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b5/e8/49/b5e8490c-da6f-aad7-31da-5ca5248d440e/0bbfc04e-cc76-494f-8031-dacbe94c88f0.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A high-energy, tempo-shifting mix from the LA basshound.","standard":"LA producer NGHTMRE (aka Tyler Marenyi) is a wizard when it comes to dynamics. His 2025 album <i>MINDFULL</i> not only shifts gears in speed and intensity—it also intersperses trap and bass bangers (featuring the likes of A$AP Ferg and Flowdan) with tunes that more closely resemble singer-songwriter ballads. He takes a similarly varied approach to his Apple Music Fitness mix: “My goal was to change the tempo of the mix every 10 to 15 minutes or so,” he tells Apple Music. “A BPM change always helps jump-start my energy when working out and keeps things moving.”\n\nAlongside caffeinated classics like Europe’s “The Final Countdown” and Zombie Nation’s “Kernkraft 400,” and a few of his own recent tracks, Marenyi strategically places a number of songs for maximum impact. Kanine’s remix of Sub Focus’ “On and On” lands in the middle of the mix “and comes at the perfect time to get your second wind,” he says. “I always find myself losing energy after 20 to 25 minutes, so the tempo increase helps me push through.” LYNY’s “Section” closes things out: “The elements of the song are minimal, but the bass is strong. I always get so hyped when I hear this record. I figured it would be great to include as the final song to push through the end of the workout.”\n","tagline":"New Fitness Mix"},"genreNames":["Bass","Music","Electronic","Dance"],"name":"Fitness: Ride, September 2025 (DJ Mix)","playParams":{"id":"1836562145","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":38,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fitness-ride-september-2025-dj-mix/1836562145"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836562145/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"910641213","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/910641213?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757686613770,"RTCI":0}}},"1836902500":{"id":"1836902500","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836902500?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Esoctrilihum","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/esoctrilihum/1313049497","artwork":{"bgColor":"ee684c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"111115","textColor2":"181616","textColor3":"3d2220","textColor4":"432721","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/42/63/e1/4263e19f-0cb4-45dd-c5d6-ae8d9e4350ba/199538641813.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Death Metal/Black Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"Ghostigmatah – Spiritual Rites of the Psychopomp Abxulöm","playParams":{"id":"1836902500","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ghostigmatah-spiritual-rites-of-the-psychopomp-abxulo-m/1836902500"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836902500/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1313049497","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1313049497?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757640918139,"RTCI":0}}},"1836951266":{"id":"1836951266","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836951266?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"bgColor":"d33dbd","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"0b0109","textColor2":"0b0209","textColor3":"330d2d","textColor4":"330e2d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/32/27/67/322767b0-c137-5670-608a-2d00ea9fdafd/196873561417.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"000101","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d581f5","textColor2":"be81e4","textColor3":"aa67c4","textColor4":"9868b6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ff/10/27/ff1027d8-4715-255e-929d-00533e210ebb/b8d52f7a-1247-4618-822c-600e743d44d1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"360b40","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f8bda6","textColor2":"ef7c64","textColor3":"d19a91","textColor4":"ca655d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/41/68/ef/4168ef96-b147-aba8-83e8-b8ebd345299c/8fca1b1d-d912-497f-9cc5-825090435b21.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Pop classics get a K-pop makeover in the East-meets-West reality show.","standard":"In 2025, as the line between global pop industries continued to blur, Apple TV+ released <i>KPOPPED</i>, an eight-part series bringing together iconic Western artists, including R&B queen Patti LaBelle and vocal harmony boy group Boyz II Men, with some of contemporary K-pop’s most popular idols, including girl groups ITZY and STAYC.

Now he’s ready for a full pop revival on his eighth full-length. “I think <i>-<i> [<i>Subtract</i>] and <i>Autumn Variations</i> were a really good circuit breaker for me to just be like, ‘I’m a singer-songwriter, I’m going to make singer-songwriter albums and I am going to dip in and out of things when I feel like it,’” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And I think that <i>Play</i> will be one of the last pop hurrahs that I’ll get away with.”\n\n<i>Play</i> inhabits a familiar but expanding sonic space in Sheeran’s oeuvre. For several songs, he relies heavily on diverse Eastern musical styles like the Bollywood-tinged “Sapphire,” the Persian-influenced “Azizam,” and the Punjabi-inspired “Symmetry.” “I’m just exploring completely new different world and cultures, and there are superstars in the same country with different languages, and that’s super exciting as well,” he says. On tracks like “Old Phone” (a remembrance of lost friends that recalls the storytelling of “Castle on the Hill”) and “The Vow” (which harkens to “Perfect” and “Thinking Out Loud”), he throws back to the traditional Sheeran sound of old. \n\nBoth deeply personal and <i>mostly</i> relatable, many cuts belie his devotion to his family and wife. Two sweetly romantic odes, “In Other Words” and “For Always,” also describe universal emotions. “They’re very human things that you go through with your partner or your kids,” he says. “There’s stuff that I can relate to with my friends going through the same things. I’m very vastly different in other areas of my life and things that I do, but I think when you are a partner and a father and a friend, you share many, many, many experiences.” \n\nBut it’s the album’s first song “Opening” that may be more specific to Sheeran’s particular circumstances, taking a critical eye to his own international fame. “Not the pop star they say they prefer/Kept quiet but I came to be heard/Been a long time up top, but I ain’t complacent/If I look down, I can see replacements.” He’s not worried, though, about those deemed “the next Ed Sheeran”: “I just take them on tour.”\n</i></i>","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Singer/Songwriter"],"name":"Play (Extended Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1837753866","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-12","trackCount":18,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/play-extended-edition/1837753866","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/64QhljQEwTfoEt9z6jsyxl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837753866/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"183313439","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/183313439?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757684048522,"RTCI":0}}},"1837820589":{"id":"1837820589","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837820589?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"WENDY","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wendy/840523045","artwork":{"bgColor":"071328","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e8d4d2","textColor2":"c6ccd6","textColor3":"bbadb0","textColor4":"a0a7b3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/a6/2b/5f/a62b5fca-b753-0fd2-b93f-8ab0cf13a74d/191953471327.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"405d4e","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ebedeb","textColor2":"e9e0db","textColor3":"c9d0cc","textColor4":"c7c6bf","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5d/a7/e7/5da7e7ab-0f56-9844-c0bb-6d5ba6908682/e076c494-7abe-46b4-8a81-44add25961c6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"Cerulean Verge - EP","playParams":{"id":"1837820589","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-10","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cerulean-verge-ep/1837820589"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837820589/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"840523045","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/840523045?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757638063673,"RTCI":0}}},"1837843433":{"id":"1837843433","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837843433?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"KPop Demon Hunters Cast, HUNTR/X & Saja Boys","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1820264140-1478164763-1820264141","artwork":{"bgColor":"bbc0ec","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"180012","textColor2":"220018","textColor3":"39263d","textColor4":"412642","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/1e/eb/50/1eeb50b9-d3e3-ef81-13d3-9be87ab446a8/25UM1IM35857.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c9b1c6","textColor2":"d2a3b9","textColor3":"a491a1","textColor4":"ab8697","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/f9/fb/e7/f9fbe73e-8053-f9d3-a8bd-4424eb174055/d4dd9015-0d1f-43f3-b56f-9097530dc2ff.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b8b5f5","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"060610","textColor2":"070810","textColor3":"29293d","textColor4":"2a2a3d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/55/4e/fe/554efec6-8e2a-c53f-6eae-f587928095a0/02174a75-88c8-4100-ac1d-88a47cc0808b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The animated feature gets an action-packed, high-key K-pop soundtrack.","standard":"To craft the soundtrack for <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i>, Netflix’s animated film about a fictional Korean girl group that moonlights as demon hunters, co-directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans brought in some of K-pop’s heaviest hitters. BLACKPINK producer and The Black Label co-founder Teddy Park produced the girl-crush track “How It’s Done” and “Golden,” two of the songs that introduce the sound and characterization of girl group HUNTR/X and its members (Rumi, Mira, and Zoey) within the world of the film. Jenna Andrews and Stephen Kirk, the songwriters behind BTS’s English-language hits “Butter” and “Permission to Dance,” composed the soulful duet “Free” and climactic track “What It Sounds Like,” while German songwriter Lindgren (BTS’s “Boy with Luv,” TXT’s “CROWN”) wrote the fight song “Takedown.” \n\nKang and Appelhans tapped Black Label co-founder KUSH, Black Label producers Vince and 24, and Grammy-nominated music supervisor Ian Eisendrath (<i>Only Murders in the Building</i>) to help craft the sound of demons-turned-idol-group Saja Boys. The composers worked on the bubblegum bop “Soda Pop” alongside fellow Black Label producers Dominsuk and Danny Chung. For the Saja Boys villain track “Your Idol,” Black Label producer IDO, <i>Theater Camp</i> songwriter Mark Sonnenblick, and EJAE were also on the team. \n\nThe soundtrack cements its K-pop credentials by including features from TWICE, one of the most popular K-pop girl groups of all time. A “solo” version of TWICE’s 2024 girl-crush hit “Strategy” (which originally featured Megan Thee Stallion) is included on here, and members JEONGYEON, JIHYO, and Chaeyoung sing an alternate version of “Takedown.”\n","tagline":"New Soundtrack"},"genreNames":["Soundtrack","Music","Pop","K-Pop"],"name":"KPop Demon Hunters (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film / Deluxe Version)","playParams":{"id":"1837843433","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-09-05","trackCount":35,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film/1837843433","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/50O9cXkFsQs8z0RV0UOvvl"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837843433/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1820264140","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1820264140?l=en-US"},{"id":"1478164763","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1478164763?l=en-US"},{"id":"1820264141","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1820264141?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1757682681669,"RTCI":0}}},"1837867200":{"id":"1837867200","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837867200?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Justin Bieber","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/justin-bieber/320569549","artwork":{"bgColor":"f8b6c3","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0c0a0a","textColor2":"0e0b0c","textColor3":"3b2c2f","textColor4":"3c2d30","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e0/cb/3e/e0cb3e1c-0dde-156d-d500-7943bc4ddebd/25UM1IM36272.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"eeb8c4","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0b0909","textColor2":"171213","textColor3":"392c2f","textColor4":"423336","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/48/8d/46/488d4638-cb73-f5df-722b-a4985a3f13ee/8c9571aa-7755-4417-8826-c90cbeb05e1e.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"030202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d9af8b","textColor2":"cca58d","textColor3":"ae8c70","textColor4":"a48571","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/a1/a1/94/a1a194ff-f49d-5f71-2d48-903f56c212d4/4dde8042-e875-47af-a3c9-d2450de3f625.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A surprise sequel full of earthy, subtle love songs that double as devotionals.","standard":"Arriving by surprise in mid-July, <i>SWAG</i>—the seventh album from the 31-year-old pop icon—was both a testament of love and a declaration of independence. Fresh off big changes in his professional life and intrusive speculation into his personal life (including a paparazzi clash that spawned the instant-classic one-liner, “It’s not clocking to you that I’m standing on business!”), Bieber’s 21 love songs to his wife, Hailey Bieber, doubled as a cathartic reintroduction to an artist who’s been famous nearly two-thirds of his life. Rising above the noise of the past year, <i>SWAG</i> showed the singer at his most soulful, sensual, messy, and free.\n\nNot even two months later, <i>SWAG II</i> appears with just as little promotion (announced, like its predecessor, the day before its release), an even longer tracklist, and a similarly unencumbered raison d’être. Its 23 tracks—earthy, floaty, understated—draw from a similar sonic palette, informed by the sounds of his recent collaborators (Dijon, Mk.gee, Carter Lang) and, more distantly, by a gamut of R&B greats (Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, D’Angelo). Bieber channels The-Dream on the sultry “OH MAN,” evokes MJ on “DON’T WANNA,” and tries his hand at indie folk on the reflective “MOVING FAST,” on which he nods to his controversy-courting past (“I was speeding toward a wall, I was 25, closed eyes/Looking for a light”). The skits of <i>SWAG</i> are absent, and the cameos less frequent—supporting vocals from Afrobeats star Tems and British singer Bakar, return appearances from Eddie Benjamin and Lil B, and an unexpected verse on “POPPIN MY S***” from ringtone rap luminary Hurricane Chris.\n\nSexy, subtle, and surprisingly mature, what initially register as love songs sometimes double as devotionals: the simple joys of domesticity, the sun, and the sea blurring into one sublime celebration on “EVERYTHING HALLELUJAH,” as Bieber sings: “Let’s take a walk, hallelujah/Sun is out, hallelujah/I’m kissing you, hallelujah.” (He makes the religious subtext explicit on “STORY OF GOD,” a nearly eight-minute retelling of the Bible’s creation myth, which Bieber narrates as Adam.) Here, redemption can be found in an embrace, or in a reflection of his wife’s face in his infant son’s gaze, as it does on “MOTHER IN YOU.” In the end, it all comes down to the same thing, as he sings on the sweet, slow-burning “I THINK YOU’RE SPECIAL”: “Love is over everything/This is what I believe.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"SWAG
