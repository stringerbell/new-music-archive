Several tracks see the Fremantle indie-folk artist lament the time apart from his wife and two daughters while being on the road: “I look and you won’t be there,” he sings on “You Won’t Be There,” an airy ode to disconnection. “Left Side View” approaches the same longing with a bit more optimism: “I’ll take everything that I can get from you,” Pearce promises his wife, including “the clean with the mess.” Co-produced with repeat collaborator Andy Lawson, <i>The Weight of Our Dreaming</i> pairs personal accounts of creative and professional burnout with gorgeous atmosphere and peripheral touches—such as a young child laughing on “Foundation,” the song that provides the album’s titular phrase. Pearce also dwells on mortality on both “Funeral” (a duet with Scottish singer-songwriter Rosie H Sullivan) and “Headstone,” and mines some playful imagery from the gap between fantasy and reality on the ghostly “Pretend Ferrari.” Describing the feeling of brokenness hiding behind tinted glass and a fake moustache, he reminds us how enticing such illusions can be when we’re feeling lost.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"The Weight Of Our Dreaming","playParams":{"id":"1817721316","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-weight-of-our-dreaming/1817721316","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/4Qqtvrsn5PRRJcw9PFHrxx"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817721316/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"657193401","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/657193401?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761890362668,"RTCI":0}}},"1821861614":{"id":"1821861614","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821861614?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Charlatans","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-charlatans/1006269","artwork":{"bgColor":"e0dcd9","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"1a1a19","textColor2":"271f21","textColor3":"41413f","textColor4":"4c4546","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ca/a1/18/caa11870-e866-26ea-c162-51415490b4fb/4099964183535.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ebeae8","gradient":{"color":"ebeae8","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"d7ced2","textColor3":"abaebd","textColor4":"b3abae","textGradient":["000000","d7ced2"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/88/0c/f4/880cf45a-5fd6-6533-e4e9-3b247eba76e1/Job96a2bd6a-47de-4226-baa0-86ba7ed6a511-197409529-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386520142_2250364811-Time1752489035868.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"ebeae8","gradient":{"color":"ebeae8","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"363230","textColor3":"3b3a3b","textColor4":"595654","textGradient":["000000","363230"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c0/6b/f6/c06bf641-133c-af7e-6ec2-87462705b6e1/Jobf10c33d7-a61f-405e-97e1-4699022c5534-197409530-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_386520141_2250364810-Time1752490024778.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"35454b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dbd5d3","textColor2":"bad7e9","textColor3":"bab8b7","textColor4":"9fbac9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/b9/5d/83b95da6-eca3-a27a-3f89-38e9abd88b3c/d2bb274c-bb78-4161-9ffe-5fbbca0d98be.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Romance, reflections, and euphoria flood the indie icons’ 14th outing.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"We Are Love","playParams":{"id":"1821861614","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-are-love/1821861614","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6NfDKhBNBIMR1HeStDZqs7"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1821861614/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1006269","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1006269?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761908965048,"RTCI":0}}},"1823019433":{"id":"1823019433","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823019433?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Daniel Avery","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-avery/348559886","artwork":{"bgColor":"231810","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f8d5a3","textColor2":"aad6f4","textColor3":"cdaf85","textColor4":"8fb0c6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0d/c4/aa/0dc4aa41-a13d-c46a-0224-0c6e1626946e/887828056491.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"adc3de","textColor2":"afbfd4","textColor3":"8e9fb5","textColor4":"8f9cad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/83/1e/78/831e787d-4ebf-a46f-7bdb-e31fd2814712/0df6f596-a232-46c3-92fb-aff4829b69b6.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"834a24","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e9e9a0","textColor2":"ebc178","textColor3":"d4c987","textColor4":"d6a967","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f1/ce/b1/f1ceb1f1-c2c9-ce5f-e832-24663eb9295f/74bf4117-1abd-45d6-b695-78560d715e43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The UK producer revisits the noisy textures of his youth. ","standard":"Before Daniel Avery earned one-to-watch status with the leftfield techno of his 2013 debut <i>Drone Logic</i>, he was a teenager playing bass in rock and shoegaze bands. But the London producer never really left them behind. Over the next decade, as he swapped his guitar for synths and DJ decks, he drew their distortions and droning soundscapes into his world. Though the club still thumps through <i>Tremor</i>, the noisy textures of his youth push to the surface, shrouding the record in a thick haze that feels both heavy and weightless. \n\n<i>Tremor</i>’s shape formed almost by accident. A chance run-in with Wolf Alice’s Ellie Rowsell led to a joint studio session; once she hit the mic, he knew he’d found its sound. That song, “Haze”—heaving rock with frayed edges—was one of its first finished tracks, along with “A Silent Shadow,” whose spectral acid creep dissolves into bright piano and sunrise synths. The juxtaposition of light and dark, control and chaos, continues: the whispered intensity of “Greasy off the Racing Line,” swirling serenity swallowed by a fuzzed-out drone on “Until the Moon Starts Shaking.” \n\n<i>Tremor</i>’s wealth is also in its collaborations. Rowsell joins a wide cast of guests—from friends and contemporary peers Cecile Believe, yunè pinku, and yeule to Avery’s musical heroes Alison Mosshart (The Kills), Walter Schreifels (Gorilla Biscuits, Quicksand), and Andy Bell (Ride, Oasis). Behind the console, he recruited mixers David Wrench (FKA twigs, Frank Ocean) and Alan Moulder (Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails). <i>Tremor</i> is less a producer’s solo vision than what he calls a “living and breathing collective.” \n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"Tremor","playParams":{"id":"1823019433","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tremor/1823019433","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2Mf3c9BbAcMOybdL2FTkkJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823019433/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"348559886","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/348559886?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761926403859,"RTCI":0}}},"1823799611":{"id":"1823799611","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1823799611?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Antoine Morinière & Thibaut Garcia","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1501554836-1139255395","artwork":{"bgColor":"ada9a8","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"0b0c15","textColor2":"011a1e","textColor3":"2b2b32","textColor4":"24363a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ff/99/4a/ff994a1f-647e-b857-23d9-26be09f8ad9a/5021732792600.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"030202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f2c098","textColor2":"cba687","textColor3":"c29a7a","textColor4":"a3856d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/85/86/63/8586637e-9c04-53a1-e228-6e64d49ce908/03b58a6e-1ff9-4f3d-bb23-d7517b809e09.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Marvel as two guitar wizards cast fresh light on Bach’s sublime masterwork.","standard":"Two guitars created from the wood of a single tree supplied the fine material for which Thibaut Garcia and Antoine Morinière fashioned their arrangement of the <i>Goldberg Variations</i>.

spirited indie rockers return, with Jack White’s backing.","standard":"<i>Again</i> may be the second album from Melbourne indie rockers The Belair Lip Bombs, but it also has the distinction of being the first release by an Australian band on Jack White’s Third Man Records label. Produced by Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever’s vocalist/guitarist Joe White and The Teskey Brothers’ sound engineer Nao Anzai, the album distills the group’s penchant for ragged, tightly wound indie guitar rock and deceptively catchy pop melodies, while introducing dreamy piano to the restrained “Burning Up,” a synth loop to the Kings of Leon-esque “Hey You,” energetic horns to frantic opener “Again and Again,” and a Replacements-like swagger to “If You’ve Got the Time.”\n\nLyrically, vocalist/guitarist Maisie Everett draws inspiration from myriad places. “Don’t Let Them Tell You (It’s Fair)” is a lesson in resilience and believing in yourself, inspired in part by a conversation with fellow songwriter Alex Lahey, who told Everett that you have to make your own luck. The singer puts her emotive voice to heightened use in “Back of My Hand” as she implores a romantic partner to trust in their connection, while “Hey You” is a solemn yet catchy account of complications in a relationship (“I don’t really know where I went wrong/Are you really done turning me on?”). The band take their greatest creative leap in the gentle “Burning Up,” trading white-hot six-strings for piano and waves of atmospheric guitar as Everett combs through the wreckage of a failed romance (“If you ask me, baby/For a second chance/I would hold onto you until my final breath/I never meant to hurt you, baby”).","tagline":"New

Welch on her sixth LP: “It came out of me in this furious burst.”","standard":"“There was basically an urgency to this record. It came out of me in this furious burst,” Florence Welch tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of Florence + the Machine’s sixth full-length. “And it’s one of those records where if I hadn’t have put it out now, it never would’ve come out because I think how I felt about things is so specific to this moment in time, and this roared out of me. It was made almost like a coping mechanism.”\n\nThat moment in time began for Welch during the <i>Dance Fever</i> tour. “I actually ended up having a ectopic miscarriage onstage that was dangerous, and that I had to be hospitalized for, and I had to have immediate surgery because I had a Coke can of blood in my abdomen,” she explains. Her health crisis and ensuing feelings fueled <i>Everybody Scream</i>, which offers a haunting yet cathartic experience for both the singer and those listening. “I felt so out of control of my body, it was interesting,” she says. “I looked into themes of witchcraft, and mysticism, and everywhere that you looked in terms of birth or stories of birth, you came across stories of witchcraft, and folk horror, and myths.”\n\nInfusing those elements throughout the album, Welch wails, warbles, belts—and, yes, screams—with emotional clarity and appropriately witchy charisma while getting quality assistance in the form of Mitski, Aaron Dessner, and IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen. The title track muses on fame and pushing through the pain to perform: “But look at me run myself ragged/Blood on the stage/But how can I leave you when you’re screaming my name?” Conjuring up a bacchanalian forest rave, “Witch Dance” casts a spell with its heated pace and Welch’s breathy chants. And for the singer, “Perfume and Milk” helps alleviate her own agony. “It was about healing and having watched seasons change and having watched other things growing and then returning to the earth and a sense that I was also part of that nature and part of that cycle,” she says.\n\n<i>Everybody Scream</i> ends with the stirring “And Love,” striking a hopeful note: “Peace is coming” she repeats on the ballad. “Let this one be the one that comes true,” she says. “Let this one be the one that is realized in the world. I think the songs are always three steps ahead of me. It’s been that way my whole life.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Everybody Scream","playParams":{"id":"1833586446","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/everybody-scream/1833586446","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0NMpVPbFS9xaxwaENfZs65"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833586446/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"281070699","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/281070699?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761902422579,"RTCI":0}}},"1833939975":{"id":"1833939975","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833939975?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"sundayclub","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sundayclub/1822627949","artwork":{"bgColor":"2e2f29","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e7e3c5","textColor2":"dad9d9","textColor3":"c2bfa6","textColor4":"b8b7b6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ad/1c/24/ad1c24e0-30b1-6017-0a30-b3204025411e/880893146722.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Bannatyne -

You have two massive life changes happen in one go, which makes you feel like the world is crashing down on top of you.”\n\nThe songs on the follow-up to 2024’s <i>early twenties</i> run chronologically from one April to the next and they’re immensely moving and comforting to anyone who’s experienced loss. “Sad Forever” sees Burns breaking down in the midst of grief and confiding in her mum, while the celebratory “GIRLS!” shows light at the end of the tunnel. “It was very cathartic. For me, this is my comfort album,” says Burns. “They’re song diaries of me navigating my way through grief and heartbreak. Eventually, everybody has to experience their first heartbreak and the loss of someone. So I knew it was going to be a defining moment, but I didn’t know <i>how</i> defining. At the time, I didn’t know if I was going to get through it.”\n\nBurns takes the listener on a journey in 16 tracks. “I love musical theater, and the way the album tells a story feels like a musical to me, from not wanting to accept things in the first half and then the beauty of letting go in the second,” she says.\n\nBy the end, Burns is in a good place and the album’s release coincides with a time when her star has risen thanks to a pivotal role in <i>The Celebrity Traitors</i> on UK TV. “I like to keep people guessing and do random things sometimes because that’s what life’s about,” she says. Read on as she takes you through 10 of the album’s key tracks.\n\n<b>“Come Home”</b>\n“Lots of my favorite artists have a song dedicated to a family member who’s no longer with them. Ed Sheeran’s got ‘Supermarket Flowers’ and Tori Kelly has a song called ‘Your Words.’ I knew once my grandad passed away, I wanted to make a song that reflected how he viewed life and death. He was a very religious man and viewed passing away as the universe and God calling you back home once you’ve done everything you need to do on this Earth. So I wanted to pay homage to him, with the first verse showing how his passing was for us, but in the second verse I’m telling the story of him coming over from Jamaica. I wanted the start of the album to throw everybody in at the deep end.”\n\n<b>“Can Time Move Faster?”</b>\n“I talk to myself a lot, so I made videos of me at different points in my grief journey to see where I was at. This has a voice memo of me crying. We always hear from people when they’re out of the storm, and they say, ‘Don’t worry, you can get through it and everything’s going to be fine.’ But I wanted to document the process. People need to know they’re not alone in feeling what they’re feeling. I always say the day after the funeral is the hardest because that’s when people think you don’t need them anymore. You’re supposed to go back to normal, but I wanted to show how hard it is. This is when I wanted to skip to the point where time would heal me because I felt so heavy all the time.”\n\n<b>“I Hope It’s Me”</b>\n“‘I Hope It’s Me’ favors my hopeless romantic side. I have a massive heart and I love people intensely. This was written fresh after a relationship ending. I wasn’t processing it yet, but seeing reminders of that person everywhere I went. I think a lot of people hope they can reconcile with their first love and this song feeds into that. Even when I hear this song now, it’s uncomfortable to listen to because I’m in such a different place. But it had to be on the album because that’s how I felt in the moment. So many people are at that stage of their breakup where they’re like, ‘That’s my person and I don’t care what happens, we’re going to find our way back to each other.’”\n\n<b>“Sad Forever”</b>\n“This was written a few weeks after my grandad passed away and everything was in turmoil. I was crying every day and in a hard place. I went into my mum’s room and she hugged me and was there for me and calmed me down. She told me about her first heartbreak. I wanted to explore that in a song: I was going through this hard time and the only person I could look to for comfort was my mum because she knew just what to say. The chorus is like affirmations you can say to yourself. You’re not going to be sad forever, but you have to feel it now and trust it will get better. These feelings will pass.” \n\n<b>“All This Love”</b>\n“I realized that crying all the time and having all these emotions are not negative things. This is what love is. I have love for these two people and I can’t give it to them anymore. How do I navigate this? As soon as I started to accept that grief was love with no place to go, I found it way easier to handle. I talk about starting to go out more and trying to enjoy my life. Sometimes, you can think you’re not allowed to feel happy when you’ve lost somebody. Over time, I tried to find new places to put this love—and that’s more into my friends, more into myself, and more into my dog. She’s a cavapoo and she’s the light of my life.”\n\n<b>“GIRLS!”</b>\n“With ‘GIRLS!’ it was towards the end of the summer and I was starting to feel a bit more confident in myself. I realized I’d written love songs in the past, but I’d never made a fun, flirty pop track about my love of women across the board. And I was feeling more confident in myself and noticing an attraction from women towards me, especially because this was my first time being single after a long-term relationship. So I was experiencing being single in my mid-twenties and thinking, ‘Wow, this is fun.’”\n\n<b>“There’s Just Something About Her”</b>\n“This is a lovely pop song about that first stage of really liking somebody. A lot of my queer friends feel it. They’ll message me and they go, ‘Oh, I’ve just met somebody and it’s a whirlwind. I can’t work out why I’m so obsessed with them.’ I wanted to make a song about that, when you meet someone and you love everything about them. It’s like this person’s laced with something! I’ve always wanted to make songs about specific scenarios that are relatable to everybody, and I’m a detail-oriented person, so I love writing songs about those moments we all experience.”\n\n<b>“Please Don’t Hate Me”</b>\n“‘Please Don’t Hate Me’ is about the guilt you can feel for moving on. When you come out of a relationship, especially if it was long-term, you feel a level of loyalty towards that person. Sometimes, you can feel like, if you move on, you’re cheating on them, because you’ve been with them for so long. Allowing yourself to be loved by somebody else and to love somebody else can make you feel guilty. With people’s first loves, you think you’re going to be with that person forever and that’s why your heart breaks. I’m saying, ‘I don’t regret our relationship’ because I’m writing from an ending where no one did anything wrong and it was just life.”\n\n<b>“I Wish You Well”</b>\n“This is one of my favorites. It’s a conscious decision for me to always make higher vibrational songs with an element of hope. I believe that songs are spells—and if you put negative energy out into the world, that’s what will come back to you. I’m lucky enough that I haven’t experienced hard things in relationships, so I choose not to have a victim mindset. I’m not going to act like we weren’t together and we didn’t have a lovely relationship and we didn’t try, because we did. Even though we’re not speaking, I’m always sending good vibrations your way because I always want the best for you.”\n\n<b>“How to Be Human”</b>\n“If you’ve got ADHD or autism, or both, like me, I’ve always felt like there’s hidden cameras everywhere and someone’s about to go, ‘Stop. You’ve said that wrong,’ or ‘You’re doing life wrong.’ And I wanted to explore that idea in a non-cringey way. I remember going into the session thinking I want to make a song about being neurodivergent and what that means to me. So that’s why the first verse is saying I learned how to speak, socialize and exist from the media and TV shows, and I’m a sponge. I wanted that song to wrap up the whole album and end it there because this is a very neurodivergent way of processing grief. It ends with the vocoder to play on the idea of people seeing neurodivergent people as a bit robotic, not showing that much emotion, when there’s so much going on under the surface.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"How To Be Human","playParams":{"id":"1833993753","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-to-be-human/1833993753","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5l7VNmhvyYndw2XNxH9GFe"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1833993753/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1154970833","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1154970833?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761933264476,"RTCI":0}}},"1834759375":{"id":"1834759375","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834759375?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"HighSchool","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/highschool/1516250442","artwork":{"bgColor":"e5e5e8","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"212223","textColor2":"322f2f","textColor3":"48494a","textColor4":"565354","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3f/63/63/3f6363ad-f3f7-a984-90ce-0da0ae2af5f5/9332727136955_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"0c0d11","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f3eae4","textColor2":"dfb69d","textColor3":"c5bdba","textColor4":"b59481","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/e8/14/75/e8147512-4001-579d-c0b7-6e5220172075/beb6b36a-45c7-404e-b225-181c38bc73d2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The London-based Melbourne duo’s debut album expands on moody post-punk.","standard":"“It was important for us to showcase diversity on this record, beyond the boundaries of post-punk and shoegaze,” HighSchool’s Rory Trobbiani tells Apple Music. True to his word, the band’s moody self-titled debut deepens their established sound while dovetailing into ’90s- and 2000s-inspired indie rock and perkier New Wave.\n\nFormed in Melbourne and now based in London, HighSchool is centered on the creative core of Trobbiani and Luke Scott. The duo recorded the album on an East Sussex farm with Ben Hillier (Blur, Depeche Mode) and in London with Finn Bellingham (RIP Magic, Sam Akpro), plus some extra touches in Australia. Below, the pair pull back the curtain on each song.\n\n<b>“Dipped”</b>\nLuke Scott: “This track explores themes of luck, chance, and gambling, using the Greek tragedy of Achilles as a metaphor for addiction, impulse, and human weakness. The cold, gothic, minor-key verses contrast with a warm, major-key chorus, creating a push-and-pull dynamic that feels both tense and euphoric.”\n\n<b>“Sony Ericsson”</b>\nRory Trobbiani: “‘Sony Ericsson’ is about the strange dynamics of modern connection—the games people play over text and how a single message can spiral into endless overanalysis. A few words on a screen can be pulled apart, read and reread, and imbued with layers of meaning that may never have been there to begin with. It speaks about the discrepancy between how someone appears on a phone screen versus who they are in real life, and how the digital version of a person can feel enticing or alluring but also unreal or unknowable.”\n\n<b>“149”</b>\nLS: “A fun, punchy, little indie banger named after the 149 bus we used to take from Dalston to our studio in Tottenham. It’s a tribute to those early days after arriving in London, when everything felt new and uncertain, but full of exciting possibility.”\n\n<b>“Chaplins”</b>\nRT: “Named after Chaplin Café—a humble, old-school spot just off Walworth Road [in London]—this track is rooted in the quiet rituals of our mornings there, doing admin over fry-ups and Americanos. The café gets its name from Charlie Chaplin, who was apparently born nearby. We wrote the song about one of the glamorous waitresses, who always seemed destined for more than the café and her mean boss. We imagined a story where she quits spontaneously one day to chase a career in acting—a moment of bold escape into a new life.”\n\n<b>“American Aunty”</b>\nLS: “Our first fully acoustic track. With everything unplugged, we weren’t reliant on amplification—or even a studio—so we recorded it outside on [producer Ben Hillier’s] farm as the sun set over the cornfields. Ben close-mic’d the guitars while we played in the open air. The song is about the hidden sadness and quiet beauty of stark middle-class suburbia. We shot the video on New Year’s Eve in Melbourne, during the city’s firework display.”\n\n<b>“Peter’s Room”</b>\nRT: “This song sees us exploring different sounds. It draws influence from artists like Beck, Pavement, and Sonic Youth. Deeply rooted in nostalgia, it was written about a pivotal moment in my life working at a pub on Smith Street, Collingwood: riding my bike home in the summer after long shifts, the haunted beer cellar, playing dice at lock-ins, and how old all the 24-year-old managers seemed to my futile 20-year-old brain. That time introduced me to a new scene of people. The song is called ‘Peter’s Room’ because I wrote it in a guy named Peter’s room in South London.”\n\n<b>“One Lucky Man”</b>\nLS: “This song taps into our 2000s NYC indie roots. With the tempo and tone shifting halfway through, we actually switched drummers; Rory stepped in and played the second half. The song was written about tumultuous friendships that can’t last—a silent but mutual understanding of wanting something more while knowing it can’t make sense in the real world. Over time, those connections quietly dissolve into silence and memories.”\n\n<b>“Making Out at the Skatepark”</b>\nLS: “With this one, we really indulge our love for Midwestern emo. It’s one of the oldest tracks on the album, written back in our South Bermondsey studio in 2023. The title gives it away: It’s about the intense feelings of yearning and awkwardness that come with being a teenager, and the insignificant moments that somehow hold enormous significance in the teenage mind.”\n\n<b>“Trope”</b>\nLS: “This one has a woozy, off-kilter feel thanks to a vari-speed tape recording technique that Ben suggested we try. We laid down the instrumental at a faster tempo and in a different key, then slowed the tape down to reach the pitch and tempo that we wrote the song in—creating a dreamlike, slightly warped sonic bed for Rory’s vocals.”\n\n<b>“Rhinoplasty”</b>\nRT: “A sprawling, meandering goth-rock track. We recorded our friends having a phone conversation and layered it over the verse instrumental.”\n\n<b>“Best and Fairest”</b>\nRT: “This song is about growing up playing junior Aussie rules football, a sport both me and Scotty played as kids in Melbourne. Freezing-cold hands, the smell of Deep Heat in the locker room, directing your old man with a Melways to the middle of nowhere, those grim bright-red hot dogs, and the ridiculous pressure and importance placed on something so novel.”\n\n<b>“Colt”</b>\nLS: “We chose to close the album with a crowd favorite. Unlike the rest of the record, ‘Colt’ wasn’t recorded by Ben Hillier or Finn Billingham, nor was it mixed by Claudius Mittendorfer. Instead, it came to life in 2023 at Dan Carey’s legendary South London studio and was mixed by Macks Faulkron. The song stands as a testament to our love of ’80s New Wave electronic rock, infused with hints of Italo disco.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music","Indie Rock"],"name":"HighSchool","playParams":{"id":"1834759375","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/highschool/1834759375","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3AkpBHPOvTPlxXPEhmNp1b"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834759375/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1516250442","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1516250442?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761912495721,"RTCI":0}}},"1834907065":{"id":"1834907065","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834907065?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"KeiyaA","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/keiyaa/1477227733","artwork":{"bgColor":"010101","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"82a6e4","textColor2":"fa2a99","textColor3":"6885b7","textColor4":"c8227b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3f/d0/96/3fd09621-e80e-8107-33ea-9fa0b65ece44/191404156179.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"080808","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"86a7e4","textColor2":"ec359e","textColor3":"6d87b8","textColor4":"be2c80","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/b9/7d/86/b97d86f2-d209-7249-ee6e-32320d6b8970/Jobb4d5b138-aca1-4369-a352-ab32faec755c-206097617-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402609361_2383445487-Time1760537793785.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"090909","gradient":{"color":"090909","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fd1757","textColor3":"6780b5","textColor4":"cc1447","textGradient":["ffffff","fd1757"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/d5/82/00/d58200d4-ca7c-c82e-3eda-a720cbd79ec7/Job0cee6c85-7bf1-4f23-81c4-15be1c2e5f55-206097616-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_402609360_2383445489-Time1760535399017.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"26343d","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c9d5f3","textColor2":"f3c3b4","textColor3":"a8b5ce","textColor4":"caa69c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f2/58/ef/f258ef96-57bf-5207-a223-1abbbc23706d/12e6f551-269a-4b0f-8411-865b9c79f210.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Compositions where jazz, hip-hop, and cutting-edge club music coexist.","standard":"After years of grinding in New York’s experimental jazz and hip-hop scenes, the Chicago-born musician self-released her debut album, 2020’s <i>Forever, Ya Girl</i>, whose heady blend of R&B, bedroom pop, and electronics made KeiyaA a critical darling and underground star.

But she is on a short list of artists who can boast that her own album is a direct result of having been Mitchell’s close collaborator. “I had finished playing the Hollywood Bowl [in 2024] with Joni, and it took up so much of my spiritual space and my mind space,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I felt really emotionally make-or-break, because I just wanted that to be a pivotal moment for Joni.” Carlile’s stewardship of her hero’s comeback performances, alongside <i>Who Believes in Angels?</i>, her 2025 team-up with Elton John, another one of her idols and mentors, left her little time to tend to her own music. “It became so overwhelming and so all-consuming that this little voice did start to say, ‘OK, you’re not going to live very long if you keep setting the bar for yourself in these really stressful places,’” she says. “‘And you’re also hiding a little bit.’”\n\nFollowing her time in LA with Mitchell, she headed to Aaron Dessner’s Long Pond Studio in upstate New York to begin work on <i>Returning to Myself</i>. “I didn’t know whether we were going to be writing songs for someone else, or writing songs for me, or what we were going to be doing,” she explains. Though she admits to struggling initially with the process, the end result runs from the sweet and sentimental (“Anniversary”) to the angry (“Church & State”) and, of course, an emotional ode to Mitchell herself (“Joni”). Read below for Carlile’s thoughts on a few key tracks.\n\n<b>“Returning to Myself”</b>\n“I didn’t even bring a guitar. I went upstairs to the bedroom, and I sat on this bed looking at a blank wall, and I was so stressed to be that alone. I wrote the poem for <i>Returning to Myself</i>. It was just a poem; it didn’t have music or anything yet. I was just almost rejecting it. I was almost feeling like, ‘OK, this is it. This is a noble pursuit, me staring at this wall. This is what it means to learn to be alone. I guess I’m evolving right now. I feel like I’m not doing anything at all but just indulging myself and sitting here on this bed.’”\n\n<b>“Human”</b>\n“I do feel that every generation since recorded history believes that their generation is the one living through the end of the world. I think that’s really comforting. And we do. We all see our conflicts and our wars and our political upheavals and tyranny and democracy in constant balance. We are in a loop, and the loop is the loop of humanity. And don’t be apathetic. Don’t ignore it. Don’t look away. Do fight. Do be an activist. Do get out of bed every morning and think about how you can serve humanity. But also touch grass. Also realize that you’re here for a split second and that you don’t want to look back and realize you missed the whole thing because you believed you were living through the end of the world.”\n\n<b>“Church & State”</b>\n“We were set up to jam and that song was really carnal. We were in a circle. It was like rock ’n’ roll time, and it was November 5th, the night of the [2024] election. I went into the studio, laptop open, spiraling, just not doing great emotionally. I mean, I knew what was coming. I had written ‘Human’ the night before, and it was like a primal cry for self-preservation in a way, and not just for me, for everybody.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Singer/Songwriter","Music"],"name":"Returning To Myself","playParams":{"id":"1835483605","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/returning-to-myself/1835483605","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3e2Q0TkwIIfmWUAssLAJ8U"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835483605/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"64387579","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/64387579?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761906871633,"RTCI":0}}},"1835769599":{"id":"1835769599","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835769599?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bruce Springsteen","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bruce-springsteen/178834","artwork":{"bgColor":"434343","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"f2f5f5","textColor2":"f2e2e5","textColor3":"cfd1d1","textColor4":"cfc2c4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d6/fe/3d/d6fe3d00-46b5-0a47-10a4-958bef533db4/196873495354.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f2e1e3","textColor3":"cfd1d1","textColor4":"cfc2c3","textGradient":["ffffff","f2e1e3"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/80/81/30/80813080-b3ae-808e-7250-7cc6591b6670/Job715cfa0c-990c-475c-abe9-617601425047-201920434-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395062448_2320599745-Time1756844943284.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d2d2d2","textColor3":"b9b9b9","textColor4":"a8a8a8","textGradient":["ffffff","d2d2d2"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/70/cd/5b/70cd5b52-2ec8-5951-d74a-160b42dbd67e/Job3aa443c2-77ce-4d0b-baee-04305f6c7dce-201920433-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395062449_2320599744-Time1756843474480.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"f8f9f9","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0a0a","textColor2":"120808","textColor3":"393a3a","textColor4":"403838","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/47/d3/90/47d3904c-4493-4f66-8da6-77891c2e7795/a1c3c50d-6797-44b4-aafe-0c0016b5825f.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"474949","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7f8f8","textColor2":"f7f8f8","textColor3":"d3d5d5","textColor4":"d3d5d5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/22/eb/d6/22ebd6ec-a2bc-9b0d-3dda-ac8a375b5181/eb4c02e9-1330-457b-941a-3151ae35b1fe.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The legend of his sixth album grows with revelatory electric versions.","standard":"Not much about Bruce Springsteen’s sixth album could have felt mythical upon its arrival in 1982. Coming after 1980’s double-album garage-rock opus <i>The River</i> and before the 1984 supernova <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, this was a set of 10 uncharacteristically stark, unaccompanied acoustic songs, each more haunted than the last, that shifted Springsteen’s reputation from ebullient bandleader to evocative author of stories about desperate characters getting crushed by an American dream that turned out to not be for them. “I would say the closest I ever came to doing that would have been unintentionally, maybe <i>Nebraska</i> during the Reagan years,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2020. “I think if you wanted to find a body of work that expressed what it was like to be an American, say from 1970 to now, in the post-industrial period of the United States, I’d be a place you could go and get some information on that.”\n\nAs Springsteen’s stature grew, so did that of his most modest-sounding album. Within a decade, the kind of rough-hewn four-track bedroom recordings that marked <i>Nebraska</i> would become a genre unto itself. Author Warren Zanes’ 2023 book <i>Deliver Me from Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska</i> recontextualized the album not just as a sonic and thematic departure, but as a pivotal moment in which Springsteen wrestled with depression and doubt about where he stood and where he was going. Scott Cooper’s 2025 movie based on the book, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, only raised the stakes and the profile, although for Springsteen diehards, this period needed no help being mythologized. \n\nThis four-LP reissue makes it clear that <i>Nebraska</i> did not always know it was going to be <i>Nebraska</i>, as the songs written during this time included ones that would eventually find their way to <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> in decidedly glossier fashion. The rough acoustic demo of that album’s title track, which opens this box set, is relentlessly dour, and a million miles away from the bombast that tricked millions into thinking it was a jingoistic anthem. “Downbound Train,” “Working on the Highway,” and beloved B-side “Pink Cadillac” also appear here as sparse sketches.\n\nBut the draw here for many fans will be the long-rumored “Electric Nebraska” tracks—six of the album’s ten songs performed with the E Street Band, before Springsteen ultimately reverted to the original acoustic solo versions. A collection like this does not intend to convince anyone that these decisions were mistakes, but it’s hard not to do a double take hearing well-worn songs like “Atlantic City” and “Mansion on the Hill” and the haunting title track so divorced from their trademark vibe. It is, however, a reminder that Springsteen comes by his blue-collar bard reputation honestly: Even his most understated album required heavy lifting. \n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition","playParams":{"id":"1835769599","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":37,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nebraska-82-expanded-edition/1835769599","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6Cd23zUXeW83jRFlUiwcPM"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835769599/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"178834","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/178834?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761913463999,"RTCI":0}}},"1835795708":{"id":"1835795708","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835795708?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Oklou","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/oklou/1156489245","artwork":{"bgColor":"fdfdfd","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"112228","textColor2":"1f3538","textColor3":"404d52","textColor4":"4b5d5f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/62/a4/b5/62a4b552-985b-4f79-222f-a4f295262e1b/198704695872_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e0dddf","textColor2":"d0c7bd","textColor3":"b7b4b6","textColor4":"aaa29a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/0d/dc/6e/0ddc6e66-b6f9-75e8-99f5-0e150eab9673/78457f56-a153-46fb-af82-bb8d4647b199.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A handful of new tracks augment the French artist’s thrillingly odd debut.","tagline":"New Deluxe Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"choke enough (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1835795708","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-30","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/choke-enough-deluxe/1835795708","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2G7CqmCYcpF1GtpXx5ttRO"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835795708/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1156489245","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1156489245?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761905520341,"RTCI":0}}},"1836281105":{"id":"1836281105","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836281105?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Miguel","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/miguel/29254083","artwork":{"bgColor":"0c0b0b","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"cf9fa1","textColor2":"fa2f36","textColor3":"a88283","textColor4":"ca282d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/fd/28/d5fd2830-093a-de97-68b7-b145992b9c69/196871232944.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"b8b7af","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0f0f","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"30302f","textColor4":"3a3a37","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/11/23/5d/11235de6-8516-9ce7-1fef-0478434450ce/29772671-df2a-4b2d-9dcd-1b4ef57597c2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"c9d6d7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0e0a0e","textColor2":"161317","textColor3":"343336","textColor4":"393a3d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/04/61/c9/0461c923-15bd-8bee-5e91-acb28098605d/240d6a3c-b418-406c-9bc4-02eb5168eb28.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The R&B auteur’s first LP in eight years embraces darker sounds and themes.","standard":"A lot has changed in the eight years since Miguel last released an album, from the state of the world to his personal life. (In 2023, his divorce from longtime partner Nazanin Mandi was finalized.) If 2017’s <i>War & Leisure</i> hinted at turmoil both personal and political, the fifth album from the R&B auteur lands directly in the thick of it. On <i>CAOS</i>, the fight for peace is messy, but cathartic. Previous hits like “Adorn” and “Coffee” reveled in the bliss of intimacy, but here Miguel ventures beyond soulful psychedelia to embrace darker sounds and themes, landing somewhere between P-Funk and Nine Inch Nails. \n\nIn the dark underbelly of the present, love feels a lot like rage, and vulnerability and anarchy coexist more easily than you’d think. He’s masked, strapped, and ready for whatever on “New Martyrs (Ride 4 U),” a Bonnie and Clyde anthem for uncertain times. He sings in Spanish on the apocalyptic title track, interpolates 2Pac on “The Killing” (“I ain’t a killer, but don’t push me”), and flips a poignant piano ballad into a scuzzy house thumper on “RIP.” A streak of primal lust flashes through the darkness, and on “Angel’s Song,” he swoons amidst the flames (“I forget the world’s unraveling when I look at you”). And on the grungy “Always Time,” he delivers an elegy for his marriage, singing: “Maybe this time, love means letting go.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"CAOS","playParams":{"id":"1836281105","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-23","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/caos/1836281105","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2KKtiR6wEIINGF0p82NPRa"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836281105/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"29254083","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/29254083?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761906944527,"RTCI":0}}},"1837544742":{"id":"1837544742","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837544742?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sevdaliza","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sevdaliza/571173217","artwork":{"bgColor":"6b655e","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"f0efee","textColor2":"e2eada","textColor3":"d5d4d1","textColor4":"cad0c1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/94/11/29/94112927-c92a-611d-337f-0d1951ec7738/270.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f0b889","textColor2":"dc9d6b","textColor3":"c0936d","textColor4":"b07d56","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/32/91/95/32919595-11a6-ce18-ac33-452c4a30d30f/e6a3228b-6a6f-432b-99a3-00d559637495.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Pop","Music","Dance"],"name":"HEROINA","playParams":{"id":"1837544742","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/heroina/1837544742","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/49MiJYe7d4CfKDeJFqAWal"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837544742/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"571173217","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/571173217?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761930854333,"RTCI":0}}},"1837776033":{"id":"1837776033","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837776033?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Who","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-who/61499","artwork":{"bgColor":"423e48","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f1eded","textColor2":"eaccbb","textColor3":"cecacc","textColor4":"c8b0a4","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/53/59/9e/53599e6f-7d65-b5a6-89f0-f5bff5e1969a/25UMGIM56685.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"010202","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ebebeb","textColor2":"cfd1d2","textColor3":"bcbcbc","textColor4":"a6a7a8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/57/e3/2f/57e32f26-3198-d4c7-4428-dcccd0dc7c1d/57e534ca-bce3-4bba-bb5e-83ea3ca5c9b9.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Who Are You (Super Deluxe Edition)","playParams":{"id":"1837776033","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":89,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-are-you-super-deluxe-edition/1837776033","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7qGnKtZPJMP3LFgEl2WM4r"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837776033/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"61499","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/61499?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761931501136,"RTCI":0}}},"1838042863":{"id":"1838042863","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838042863?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Anish Kumar","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/anish-kumar/1510744726","artwork":{"bgColor":"425588","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"eae9e0","textColor2":"e9d3c4","textColor3":"c8ccce","textColor4":"c8bab8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/68/58/1e/68581e12-60e0-5ccf-d085-29d6230a13cc/5059449254432.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"50504d","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e7e0e1","textColor2":"ded5d0","textColor3":"c9c3c3","textColor4":"c1bbb6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/36/9f/97/369f9706-b887-314e-3c91-60bcf324dff5/436cd702-dc32-45f4-bc56-07c036e55451.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A clutch of genre-fluid club tracks from the hotly tipped DJ/producer.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music","Dance"],"name":"AK Cuts: Vol. 1 -

The Toronto R&B artist signed to a major label, logged No. 1 hits with Justin Bieber and Tyler, The Creator, and with 2023’s <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, scored his highest-charting album to date and graduated to arena-headliner status. But as a child of the church, Caesar has always seemed less interested in indulging in the spoils of stardom than in forging a deep spiritual connection with his congregation of fans. In the lead-up to the release of his fourth full-length, <i>Son of Spergy</i>, Caesar hosted surprise pop-up concerts in various cities, turning up in local parks on a few hours’ notice with just an acoustic guitar—a fitting prelude to his most intimate and off-the-cuff album to date. \n\nNamed for his gospel-singer father, <i>Son of Spergy</i> is a moment for Caesar to recalibrate after years of whirlwind success, and reconnect with family, old flames, and the church. “Lord, let your blessings rain down,” he sings on the opener, “Rain Down,” a hazy-headed hymn that sets the soul-searching tone for the album. Compared to the beat-driven experimentation of <i>NEVER ENOUGH</i>, <i>Son of Spergy</i> is both a more organic and psychedelic experience, favoring folky instrumentation that Caesar weaves to delightfully daydreamy effect on openhearted serenades like “Have a Baby (With Me)” and the Bon Iver-assisted beauty “Moon,” where jazzy piano wafts through the dulcet acoustic arrangement like a misty drizzle. \n\nBut <i>Son of Spergy</i>’s Zen vibe is counterbalanced by Caesar’s growing confidence at drawing far outside the lines of R&B: “Call on Me” is an upbeat outlier that pairs crunchy alt-rock guitars and reggae riddims, while “Baby Blue” is a beautifully dazed ballad that just turns stranger and stranger over its six minutes, layering woozy strings, chopped-up vocals, and sound-effect samples with White Album-style wanderlust.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Son Of Spergy","playParams":{"id":"1839352404","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/son-of-spergy/1839352404","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2xyVcW7Xab4ITjIQ98ewZJ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839352404/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1019899019","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1019899019?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761906878456,"RTCI":0}}},"1839489366":{"id":"1839489366","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839489366?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Demi Lovato","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/demi-lovato/280215821","artwork":{"bgColor":"201e1b","hasP3":false,"height":3600,"textColor1":"c3bbb3","textColor2":"a0bad2","textColor3":"a29b94","textColor4":"869aad","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/51/42/be5142ae-5926-11ea-101e-89328904b10d/25UM1IM42009.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3600},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"11100f","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dfcfc1","textColor2":"d1ae90","textColor3":"b6a89e","textColor4":"ab8e76","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/dc/f1/20/dcf120c3-406d-4f81-c22d-c68496c8bde0/9adc8ecc-d9bf-4c05-839b-622681c4a9ed.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"a09f9b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"100d0a","textColor2":"232220","textColor3":"2c2a27","textColor4":"3c3b38","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a2/94/4f/a2944f3d-15b5-ac20-f7f3-f243581b131d/43fbf05f-b650-4332-9247-9175d3ce1f8a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"After a hard-rock pivot, a celebratory return to house, EDM, and club pop.","standard":"Shortly before releasing her eighth album in 2022, Demi Lovato posted a photo dressed in all black with her middle fingers up, captioned “a funeral for my pop music.” That album, <i>Holy Fvck</i>, channeled heavy feelings through hard rock and pop punk, abandoning the sweetness of her biggest hits to embrace her early inspirations. Lovato’s first remix album, 2023’s <i>REVAMPED</i>, doubled down on the pivot, reworking songs like “Heart Attack” and “Cool for the Summer” into tough rock numbers. But as she teased her ninth studio album in summer 2025, the 33-year-old singer captioned a cheeky TikTok from the studio: “My pop music coming back to life after we held a funeral for it.” Popvato had officially returned.\n\nOn <i>It’s Not That Deep</i>, Lovato sweats it out under the strobe lights, reveling in the sultry, celebratory sounds of house, EDM, and club pop. “I wanna go fast/I wanna go hard,” she sings on “Fast,” a pulsing ode to letting go of inhibitions. She breaks out the choreo for the first time in years in the video for “Here All Night,” a synth-pop jam about hitting the club after a breakup. Executive producer Zhone (whose past credits include Troye Sivan’s “Rush” and Kesha’s “Joyride”) maintains the frisky, fully embodied mood. “It’s not that deep, unless you want it to be,” Lovato winks on the electro thumper “Kiss,” though it’s not shallow, either. See “Sorry to Myself,” a sparkling synth-pop reckoning: “I was my favorite hater, but I’m tired,” she belts out. “Now I’m flirting with hope.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"It’s Not That Deep","playParams":{"id":"1839489366","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-not-that-deep/1839489366","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0bzP9iV2QbM6174JLfGxcc"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839489366/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"280215821","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/280215821?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761930303183,"RTCI":0}}},"1839521852":{"id":"1839521852","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839521852?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Bob Dylan","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bob-dylan/462006","artwork":{"bgColor":"dadbdd","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0d0e10","textColor2":"202223","textColor3":"363739","textColor4":"454748","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/60/1b/72/601b7216-2502-c984-b21d-d836790f9695/196873416908.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"ceccca","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"0e0d0c","textColor2":"272624","textColor3":"343332","textColor4":"484745","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/e8/91/5c/e8915cfb-6faa-7e09-cb00-160a3359a081/Job2a96f8f7-ebdf-4adf-89c3-d0fe439a211d-202961269-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396955994_2336618866-Time1757705091800.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"191919","gradient":{"color":"191919","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"1e1c1c","textColor3":"363534","textColor4":"444342","textGradient":["ffffff","1e1c1c"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/57/92/91/57929136-b9b4-98c4-3341-369aa00dddcc/Jobb272fd9e-7a15-4a2a-89dd-fc0cb8e1c224-202961270-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_396955977_2336618864-Time1757707482787.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048}},"genreNames":["Folk","Music"],"name":"Through The Open Window: The Bootleg Series Vol. 18 (Highlights)","playParams":{"id":"1839521852","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":42,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/through-the-open-window-the-bootleg-series-vol/1839521852","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7KcszWpAtYB3YDEK88QFWf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839521852/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"462006","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761918834326,"RTCI":0}}},"1840036480":{"id":"1840036480","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840036480?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Trevor Jackson","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/trevor-jackson/3868593","artwork":{"bgColor":"090808","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"fff1dc","textColor2":"d8ae7f","textColor3":"cdc2b1","textColor4":"ae8c67","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0a/8f/51/0a8f510e-e404-df59-daf5-b844b31d50d5/GoodBye_Cover-copy-7792ee9a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Heartbreak and growth inspire a soulful EP from the R&B singer.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music"],"name":"Goodbye -

Growing up in a conservative Massachusetts town, it was the one time she could step outside and be whoever she wanted, if only for a night. “Now that I’ve accepted myself and have allowed myself to be more grounded in my body, I am living every day that way,” the singer shared on social media. Like Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce or Mariah Carey’s Bianca, <i>Stage Girl</i> is her act of becoming, but instead of shedding her persona when the show ends, she’s stepping fully into the person she was always meant to be. \n\nA self-described “stan of pop music making pop music,” Eli built her debut from the DNA of her idols. It glitters with 2000s nostalgia and full-hearted ambition, echoing the powerhouse vocals (and, occasionally, whistle notes) of Carey, Jordin Sparks, and Ariana Grande in her agile runs, while her songwriting stays witty, grounded, and, above all, radically joyful. She kisses off an ex with bubblegum bravado on “Girl of Your Dreams” (“For a man who’s such a child/You don’t know how to play with dolls,” she taunts), finds divinity in emotional overwhelm on “All at Once,” and aches on “Marianne,” a ballad about losing love and an imagined future after coming out. Where “I Wish I Was a Girl” reframes dysphoria as rediscovery, “Like a Girl” turns gender confirmation into flirtation. By the time she reaches “Somebody I’m Not,” her transformation feels complete: “I don’t wanna die in the body of somebody I’m not.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Stage Girl","playParams":{"id":"1840980645","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stage-girl/1840980645","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/6WOa0ML0MubR3Vz2QwTI6R"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840980645/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1802895652","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1802895652?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761906890712,"RTCI":0}}},"1841464675":{"id":"1841464675","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841464675?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ossi Grace","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ossi-grace/1483381644","artwork":{"bgColor":"060d2e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"9fd9ff","textColor2":"77a0f8","textColor3":"80b0d5","textColor4":"6183d0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9c/6f/9b/9c6f9b82-3aef-2d43-bd3a-8efa351d5619/196873634968.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"100e08","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1eae3","textColor2":"bde6f0","textColor3":"c4beb7","textColor4":"9bbbc2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/c3/00/16/c30016d2-2806-3ebf-7909-e89eca442cce/e7e99112-c9e0-41c6-8bd8-c12be77d0b40.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Eleven tracks exploring longing, love, and maintaining faith against the odds.","standard":"The sonics of Ossi Grace’s <i>In a Hopeless Place</i>—a textured blend of warm lo-fi synths, subdued guitars, and elastic rhythms—provide the perfect backdrop for the Nigerian-born, UK-based singer’s intimate, confessional lyrics. The sound itself is a testament to Grace’s journey from her days engaging performative conflict to the purposeful healing of her present. The singer’s learnings there are distilled into 11 tracks exploring longing, love, and maintaining faith against the odds. In an era of fleeting digital romance, Grace’s messaging upholds depth, persistence, and emotional honesty.\n\nThe project’s title, then, might read to some as a far cry from the music’s luxuriant soundscapes, but for Grace, it’s culturally aspirational. “In Nigeria, we come into a picture of a hopeless place,” she tells Apple Music. “‘If you want a better life, you have to leave.’ This project was me saying that I did find love in a hopeless place. So it wasn’t hopeless.” Below, Grace talks us through some of the key tracks of <i>In a Hopeless Place</i>.\n\n<b>“You (Intro)”</b>\n“I’m a serial comebacker. I feel like I’m just the kind of person that will not leave. I won’t be at peace until I know that there’s nothing else I can genuinely do to fix this relationship. So I just always go back. It’s not even pride. It’s that sense of wanting to finish what I started.”\n\n<b>“Love Affair”</b>\n“When it comes to songwriting, I don’t even think too much about it. I’m such a playful person. I just write based on remembering something that happened in the past and I look for a clever way to put it so I can dance to it. I love when a song feels light but still says something serious underneath.”\n\n<b>“Ocean”</b>\n“I had just got signed and I was in Ghana. I got to the chorus and I’m like, ‘What can I do?’ I was drinking water and I heard myself swallow. I just decided to build on that. Start with a drizzle till it becomes rain and it fills up your ocean. Let’s build our love gradually.”\n\n<b>“I Remember”</b>\n“This song reminds me of who I used to be. [I’m] thinking back, like, why did we just not say ‘I’m sorry’? Why were we so proud? We didn’t need to get to this point. The experience of loss makes you remember. I can’t hold on to hurt for a long time. Once I let it out, that’s the end.”\n\n<b>“Love Like This”</b>\n“Every single song is based on real-life events. ‘Love Like This’ is me telling you how I viewed love. You do me, I do you. That was how I was raised. I was proud of the rubbish. It’s a championship. I’m not that person anymore. I don’t think I can ever pick up the pen again and tell you that I’m going to hurt you.”\n\n<b>“Reason”</b>\n“It’s about self-respect. Choosing yourself is not as easy as it sounds. But it’s something that I do like to practice now. The whole idea is that peace is a discipline too. I wanted that to come through quietly in this track.”\n\n<b>“Only You”</b>\n“There was a time where I was making my whole life about somebody else. It was just always you, you, you, you. But I then lost my self-respect. These are older songs. I was coming out of making my life about somebody else. Now when I sing it, it feels like closure.”\n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","African","Afro-Beat"],"name":"In A Hopeless Place","playParams":{"id":"1841464675","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-a-hopeless-place/1841464675","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3p4gFaEBX6OMPuxVsJgEw5"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841464675/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1483381644","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1483381644?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761932025767,"RTCI":0}}},"1841523275":{"id":"1841523275","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841523275?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Pentatonix","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pentatonix/466047278","artwork":{"bgColor":"616286","hasP3":false,"height":4500,"textColor1":"fcd5b6","textColor2":"fdc34f","textColor3":"ddbeac","textColor4":"deb05a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/f7/fd/b7/f7fdb70c-577e-87d7-456e-68a9f217218f/25UM1IM38397.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4500},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"a7a5cc","gradient":{"color":"a7a5cc","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"fdc34f","textColor3":"ddbeac","textColor4":"deb05a","textGradient":["000000","fdc34f"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/bc/23/ef/bc23ef16-d41b-9534-79f7-86fe7cf20a5c/Job4ae328c5-6f3a-4fd8-8bab-d986084641e9-207439433-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_405305399_2404376977-Time1761856596600.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"a7a5cc","gradient":{"color":"a7a5cc","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1c1517","textColor3":"282329","textColor4":"332c34","textGradient":["000000","1c1517"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/82/10/f0/8210f011-c0ec-e7f6-aa75-68abac419d88/Job80c8742b-219f-4391-ae43-c96931914ff2-207439432-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_405305398_2404376978-Time1761854954480.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d1a58b","textColor2":"cf9a68","textColor3":"aa8772","textColor4":"a97e56","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/47/91/20/4791203f-5363-84ce-ae1c-1b12a16f89d2/e715fa31-ee16-4481-b8e4-674ae8667deb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"040406","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dfb899","textColor2":"d69779","textColor3":"b3947b","textColor4":"ac7962","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/2b/eb/a5/2beba557-cba6-1f75-3084-2cef004e4c4b/fb862924-c68d-4d1e-8958-42653e8ff2eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"’Tis the season for a gifted Yuletide LP from the a cappella group.","standard":"Leave out the cookies and a glass of milk for Pentatonix, who are back with their 11th festive project, <i>Christmas in the City</i>. Come down the chimney for an array of presents: harmonies of old classics (a big-band take on Burl Ives’ “Holly Jolly Christmas,” or a rousing “Silver Bells”) and gift-wrapped originals (“Bah Humbug,” which reinvents Ebenezer Scrooge’s story, as well as a chronicle of the Elf on the Shelf phenomenon aptly called “Elf”). A few of Santa’s friends join to deck the halls: JoJo lends herself to the sentimental “Snowing in Paris” and the a cappella group revives Frank Sinatra for a posthumous duet on “I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.” Ol’ Blue Eyes becomes the third ghost of Christmases past tapped by PTX, following Elvis Presley (“O Little Town of Bethlehem”) and Bing Crosby (“White Christmas”) on previous seasonal albums. And one special offering under the tree? “Moody Rudy,” a mashup of Chuck Berry’s “Run Rudolph Run” with Glen Miller’s “In the Mood.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Holiday","Music"],"name":"Christmas in the City","playParams":{"id":"1841523275","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-in-the-city/1841523275","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7xaP8xn3tGJYPg3xwcbe9s"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841523275/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"466047278","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/466047278?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761905836889,"RTCI":0}}},"1841975745":{"id":"1841975745","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1841975745?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Outkast","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/outkast/289550","artwork":{"bgColor":"361718","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e2a450","textColor2":"f67d22","textColor3":"c08745","textColor4":"cf6820","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/23/9a/25/239a2545-18a6-8ac5-9007-fe555cadb36b/196873619873.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"371719","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e3a44e","textColor2":"f67c22","textColor3":"c18743","textColor4":"d06820","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/4b/fd/f6/4bfdf6f6-9887-4ecc-5f78-72d5c08d6ecf/Job1665af5d-f544-4699-b2b7-cf59482cffe2-204153995-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399057546_2354033936-Time1758815133840.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{"color":"000000","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fb873a","textColor3":"c18041","textColor4":"cd6e2f","textGradient":["ffffff","fb873a"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/65/ec/45/65ec45f6-9f25-16c4-134f-a9ca94c1e449/Jobbf6aa055-6098-4d22-8985-d356265f3ce3-204153994-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399057544_2354033937-Time1758812848563.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"484a4b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7f7f7","textColor2":"cce0ea","textColor3":"d4d5d5","textColor4":"b2c2ca","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/b4/b4/e8/b4b4e8d8-4335-1e72-75cc-92cb59b45d03/87c12576-5c26-4f1c-be69-89ab8fba28eb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Their fourth LP hits a milestone—fresher and cleaner than ever with new remixes.","standard":"You’d be hard-pressed to find a music fan who was around for Outkast’s 2000 opus <i>Stankonia</i> and doesn’t remember that album’s impact. The <i>Aquemini</i> follow-up catapulted the Atlanta duo from their status as the foremost spokespeople for Southern hip-hop to bona fide pop-culture celebrities whose reach and influence—though still very much rooted in rap—extended far beyond a single genre. <i>Stankonia</i>’s singles were monsters, to be sure, but once you get past the apocalyptic frenzy of “B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad),” the off-kilter balladering of “Ms. Jackson,” and the snap-along funk of “So Fresh, So Clean,” what do casual fans actually remember about <i>Stankonia</i>?\n\nCan they call out the alien synth warbles and fiery Killer Mike verse of “Snappin’ & Trappin’”? Do they remember the cacophonous beat switch for André 3000’s verse on “Humble Mumble”? Do they scrunch up their faces when they think of the hard-as-nails posse cut “Gangsta Sh*t”? Would their hearts sink if you were to bring up “Toilet Tisha”? Outkast had always gone their own way, but the album that would land them a KIDZ BOP rendition also has guest verses from steely rap veterans B-Real and Khujo Goodie, a song entitled “?” where Andre alone sounds off for a single fitful verse, and “I’ll Call B4 I Cum,” featuring the queen of Memphis hip-hop Gangsta Boo.\n\n<i>Stankonia</i>’s sonics are built on fuzzy rock guitar and unendingly funky basslines directly descendent from Parliment-Funkadelic’s trippiest material, and it sounds as otherworldly decades later as it did when it was up against other chart-shaking, much more straight-ahead projects of 2000, like Nelly’s <i>Country Grammar</i>, Eminem’s <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, and JAY-Z’s <i>The Dynasty - Roc La Familia</i>.","tagline":"New Deluxe

The album cover glows with the stunning purple of Vezzo’s luxury whip, but the operative word in the title is “passion,” which the MC brings in spades, even when he’s attacking these electro-infused beats with his signature laidback flow.

I just wanted to do something that was really empowering, something I’d never done before, and to challenge myself. And when I got up there, I was able to see the sunset, and it was beautiful. It was serene.”\n\nAfter years of documenting the highs and lows of her life online, the YouTube star turned R&B singer is learning to quiet the noise. “I used to be such an oversharer,” she says. “Now I’m trying to find the balance between maintaining my peace and family while staying true and relatable.” Looking back on her twenties, she sees how heartbreak and healing have shaped the woman she is now. She walks through that growth on <i>30.</i>, a project that marks both a personal reset and creative evolution. “People know me as, like, the heartbreak girl, the lover girl, and that’s my core. I am. But I also want people to know that, like, outside of that, I’m really an artist. I was born to do this. I can do anything. I can sing anything.”\n\nExecutive produced by No ID (Kanye West, JAY-Z, J. Cole) and Poo Bear (Justin Bieber, USHER, Lupe Fiasco), <i>30.</i> is the most fun she’s had making music since her 2020 debut, <i>missunderstood</i>, and it sounds like it. She radiates That Girl energy on “put it on (eat)…,” a sassy self-love anthem for both get-ready playlists and the club, proclaiming, ”Forgive me if I shine too bright/My heart’s full of light.” And yes, she’s still a lover girl, hyping up her ride-or-die on “my man…” and embracing her sensuality, narrating the heightened anticipation of waiting for a lover to come home (“tipsy…”) and the intimacy that follows (“rain…”). “Even though this is a versatile project, I really wanted people to know, like, I’m still here, still R&B,” she says of the latter song.\n\nAmid the fun and creative experimentation, <i>30.</i> still makes space for vulnerability. Riding an Afrobeat groove, Queen lets go of a past love with maturity (“what u lookin 4 [wyl4]...”) and requires that her next match her energy (“i deserve…”). But it’s the title track’s stormy, self-deprecating introduction that lays her bare, exposing her flaws. “Some of the recording was me just ranting in the studio, and I was like, ‘Wait, keep that on there,’” she recalls.

This needed to happen,” Armin van Buuren says of his new classical project. <i>Piano</i> is a collection of 15 short pieces for piano and strings, all composed, performed, and produced by van Buuren. Not that we needed confirmation of his musical powers, but van Buuren proves himself a pianist of considerable expressive talent, with a melodic instinct that draws simultaneously on his love of classical music and on his life as today’s foremost trance DJ. “Sonic Samba,” featuring cellist Gavriel Lipkind, has anthemic qualities, while the ambient “Clouded Window” blends classical grace and cutting-edge technology with its use of a mic’d drone. And in the waltz-like, bittersweet “Longing,” prompted by van Buuren’s time on the road away from his family, you can sense an artist whose classical journey has well and truly begun.\n\nArmin van Buuren’s classical calling came to him after a grueling promotional tour of America’s East Coast in early 2020 left him questioning his love of music. “The shows were amazing, they were all sold out, but I ran against a brick wall and a kind of a depression,” the Dutch DJ tells Apple Music Classical. “I was like, ‘OK, I’m not happy.’” van Buuren embarked on a course of therapy that challenged him to question his identity: “Who’s Armin van Buuren? Who do I want to be?” And then, just weeks later, Covid hit. “That period was kind of a savior for me,” he says. He quit drinking, announced to the world that he was taking a sabbatical, and set about rebuilding himself.\n\n“That’s when I found my real love for music again,” he reveals. “And right at the same time, my brother introduced me to Geronimo Snijtsheuvel, a piano teacher who’s trained in classical and jazz to conservatory level. We started playing Satie and Chopin, and it was great. But, in all honesty, when he came a week later, I hadn’t practiced because I was too busy in the studio.” Soon, however, instead of learning pieces van Buuren was using them as starting points for his own ideas, and piano lessons morphed into composition classes. “I’d come up with the basic ideas… but Geronimo helped me with his musical skill and knowledge, and he started explaining all the scales and chords to me, and how they could resolve.”\n\nWith Snijtsheuvel as his mentor, van Buuren turned his ideas into 15 standalone pieces, and conceived the string parts as simple MIDI files, ready for translation onto manuscript. In January 2024, van Buuren made the bold decision to record each track in a single take at ConcertLab, Utrecht’s state-of-the-art recording studio. “Every day I would be in the gym, and then spend two, three hours rehearsing at the piano, trying to play the pieces flawlessly. Then I’d drive to ConcertLab. I had seven days and 15 pieces to record.” When van Buuren heard the strings alongside him for the first time, he experienced a catharsis. “I had tears rolling on my face and I couldn’t stop it,” he reveals. “I was like, ‘This is where I need to be.’” Indeed, some of <i>Piano</i>’s most touching tracks, including “Soaring Kite” and “Ballerina,” are scored in 3/4, the time signature of the waltz. “We have triplets in trance, but we don’t have waltzes. And I love waltzes—there’s something romantic about them, but you would never consider writing them in an electronic dance situation. I hope to maybe translate the waltz into a trance song one day.”\n\nVan Buuren’s interest in classical music has been bubbling on the surface since childhood when his father sowed early musical seeds. Joep van Buuren, now in his late seventies, still presents a weekly classical show on the Dutch radio station Studio Alphen. “He took me to the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam many times,” Armin van Buuren remembers; “my brother and I sometimes hated it, but I guess he did influence us in a very positive way, because I’ve always been open to classical music.” Joep’s musical influence on Armin, however, wasn’t confined to classical, crossing over into the realms of electronic music. “He used to listen to Klaus Schulze—he was really into experimental stuff. And there was a time in the ’90s when he used to listen a lot to Jean-Michel Jarre, which is early electronic music. I remember, too, that I’d come downstairs and my dad would be blasting Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and my brother would be blasting the Prodigy, and my dad would just rave to it.

Though the proud Harlemite released only one studio album in his far-too-short lifetime, 1995’s <i>Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous</i>, his impact on generations of rappers continues to this day. While a handful of posthumous projects have trickled out in the two and a half decades since his passing—not the least of which being his DJ Premier-helmed <i>The Big Picture</i>—the release of <i>Harlem’s Finest: Return of the King</i> stands to become the definitive final statement on his artistic might.\n\nBig L’s choice of words here sometimes calls back to slang and slander prevalent in ’90s rap, but the relative timelessness of his lyrics makes this 16-track collection superior to the typical odds-and-sods compilation foisted upon fandoms. The blend of past and present in both beats and rhyme form unquestionably contributes to this, with appearances by his contemporaries, like DITC co-founder Showbiz and fellow Children of the Corn spitter Herb McGruff, coming alongside those by his spiritual successors, including Joey Bada$$ (“Grants Tomb ’97”) and Errol Holden (“Big Lee & Reg”). \n\nBoth happen concurrently on “Fred Samuel Playground,” in which producer Conductor Williams lays down a dank boom-bap rhythm for a newly recorded Method Man verse. Blurring things further is the rare and very special Mac Miller verse that opens “Forever,” acknowledging the meaningful breadth of Big L’s sway. Even with these inventive hybrids, the fortunate inclusion of his seminal, downright magical freestyles for the likes of DJ Doo Wop and Stretch & Bobbito—inclusive of a monumental JAY-Z tag-team moment—truly makes this an essential listen.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"Harlem's Finest: Return Of The King","playParams":{"id":"1844684029","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/harlems-finest-return-of-the-king/1844684029","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/52bbgcaJfoKW3N2eO8TYMN"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844684029/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"855039","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/855039?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761905849644,"RTCI":0}}},"1844692222":{"id":"1844692222","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1844692222?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Chainsmokers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756","artwork":{"bgColor":"a1a2aa","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0e1025","textColor2":"121427","textColor3":"2b2d3f","textColor4":"2f3041","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/aa/43/9b/aa439b32-9c9f-8598-b925-46241dbebe35/196873582542.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"57585a","gradient":{"color":"57585a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"03040c","textColor3":"22232b","textColor4":"22232b","textGradient":["ffffff","03040c"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/68/3c/44/683c445f-9470-62e5-36c8-1b11565bdc02/Jobf329b6fc-64c4-431a-8fed-43b9ab14e722-206917970-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_404242775_2396268637-Time1761336488149.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"57585a","gradient":{"color":"57585a","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"05060c","textColor3":"23242b","textColor4":"24252b","textGradient":["ffffff","05060c"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/4a/e5/77/4ae577d7-81d9-33ea-5a54-0fc8aa9f3103/Jobb659e341-9126-40ff-b466-5178bda7806e-206917971-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_404242776_2396268638-Time1761337923782.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"6983a7","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"070809","textColor2":"181817","textColor3":"1b2128","textColor4":"282d34","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/12/17/87/121787e4-8fd6-ea46-7fab-8e14ea1c8fab/ae5c7cb2-8e74-4f2e-a678-02b187323cee.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The superstar DJ duo gets heady and hedonistic.","standard":"Since achieving dance-pop ubiquity with hits like 2015’s “Roses” and 2016’s “Closer,” the duo of Alex Pall and Drew Taggart have hustled their way to EDM’s highest echelons: Grammys, world tours, Vegas residencies, venture capitalism. But in recent years, the superstar DJs have seemed less interested in chasing the highs of their radio-friendly megahits, burrowing into moodier melodies and more nuanced productions.

But when it came time to follow that one up, they opted instead to bring it all back home. \n\n“We decided to take a break from touring this year so we could focus a little more on the music,” Payo says of recording <i>LO QUE ME FALTA POR LLORAR</i> in a studio of their own in McAllen, Texas, mere minutes from where they got their start in Edinburg. Through this, they were able to slow things down and get to the core of what has made Grupo Frontera so compelling, even as they maintained the collaborative streak fans crave from them. “Obviously, we don’t like to leave our sound behind either, the cumbia, what we bring to give it our touch,” says bajo quinto player Alberto “Beto” Acosta. \n\nThis comes through naturally on team-ups here with other elite artists operating in their chosen genre, such as Los Dareyes De La Sierra on “mi droga” and Tito Double P on “échame la mano.” Yet it also extends to their tracks with reggaetón hitmakers Ozuna and Myke Towers, who find their place in fusions both subtle and otherwise. “If the artist wants to have their essence, we have it there too,” accordionist Juan Javier Cantú says. “Cumbia magically enters with everything.”\n\nThough such prominent guests naturally raise the expectations here, on their own, Grupo Frontera prove as formidable a unit as ever before—possibly more so now that they’ve given themselves space to create. They offer honesty amid heartbreak on the deeply relatable and beautifully arranged “monterrey,” a quality that extends to other such highlights as “si me quiere” and “tranqui.” “We are where we are because of the fans,” Beto says. “God gave us this opportunity to be this high up.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Música Mexicana","Music","Latin"],"name":"LO QUE ME FALTA POR

(2021) with a different outlook on life and a striking record, <i>Juniper</i>, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the South London-born singer-songwriter. “I know we’ve got problems/That’s just family/And God knows what we carry from our history,” she sings on “Mother,” bold, punctuating percussion building up and breaking into twinkling piano riffs as she draws connecting lines through the generations. Relationships and their rippling effects are central to <i>Juniper</i>: “House with a Pool” narrates an abusive scenario in soulful, melancholic tones; “Paris” explores how bittersweet memories have altered her perception of the city of love; and sensual, slow-burn “Carmen” holds up a mirror to Crookes’ relationship with herself. \n\nStar turns come from Vince Staples, who contributes a poetic eight-bar evaluation of jealous rivals to “Pass the Salt,” and Kano, offering the other side of the equation to Crookes’ raw calculation of heartbreak on “Mathematics.” (Listeners may also recognize the resonant backing vocals on warm, retro groove “Somebody to You” as belonging to alt-rock singer-songwriter Sam Fender.) But, of course, it is Crookes herself that shines the brightest, cutting straight to the heart of her expressions and observations with scathing acerbity and exercising the versatility of her

The Ghanaian MC’s <i>WALK WITH ME</i> is the sound of a rapper who didn’t just participate in Ghana’s trap wave, but one who helped shape it, held his line, and kept building even when the scene shifted around him. The production remains unapologetically trap: cold drums, brooding bass, and a pace that gives his Twi cadences room to flex. But there’s growth here, too: Smoke’s raps are raw and chest-punching, yet he moves easily into melodic phrasing without losing bite.\n\nThere are but two features—AratheJay on “Hold On” and Vic Mensa on “Believer”—and the choice to keep the guest list short reinforces an ethos of owning your lane and standing firm in it. On “Bro Code,” Smoke declares himself “trap president,” which comes off less an empty brag than someone whose journey—mistakes, loyalties, and scars—has granted him the clarity of his standing. Smoke’s “Emere,” which appears towards the end of the album, showcases vocal control and emotional texture, layering tone and breath into something sharp and unmistakably intentional. It’s a feat developed through experience. Whether or not you exalt him as the genre’s leader, the conviction is undeniable.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"WALK WITH

singer-songwriter tells the heart-rending story of a relationship souring.","standard":"Seven years have passed since Lily Allen bagged herself a Mercury Music Prize nomination for <i>No Shame</i>, a peppy yet vulnerable record that chronicled the singer-songwriter’s attempts to pick up the pieces following the breakdown of her first marriage. Her fifth studio album, <i>West End Girl</i>, adheres to a similar formula—eviscerating themes concealed within bright pop melodies—pulling the listener into a tightly contained soap opera that arrives in the wake of her second marriage (to <i>Stranger Things</i> star David Harbour) ending. Announcing the record, she said it was an attempt to document “the events that led me to where I am in my life now” while also describing it as a “mixture of fact and fiction.” \n\nSetting the scene with the title track—a dreamy, orchestral number that depicts a couple moving into a new home but hitting a bump when one of them lands a role in a play—the album narrates a bait-and-switch story in which the boundaries of a relationship (and Allen’s narrator along with them) warp and mutate. “Ruminating” is a drum ’n’ bass spiral into her racing thoughts after an admission of infidelity, while “Relapse” finds her struggling to maintain her sobriety in the wake of ever more painful revelations, her vocals chopped and echoing. Later, “Beg For Me” taps into heartbreak over a pitch-shifted sample of Lumidee’s “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh),” before resigning herself to the stark reality of her situation on “Let You W/In,” a soft, folky production.\n\nThere are, it must be said, very few moments of levity to be found throughout <i>West End Girl</i>, but tracks like “Nonmonogamummy” and “Dallas Major,” which portray reluctant participation in a newly opened relationship, are patterned from the same sardonic cloth as the more biting cuts from her early catalog—albeit dampened by the weary sadness that permeates the album at large. <i>West End Girl</i> closes the window on the drama at the same time as Allen closes the door on her marriage, leaving the listener to mull over events with no return for a triumphant encore—but her razor-edge lyricism and stunning attention to production detail provide ample reasons to wind back to the start and press play all over again.","tagline":"New

Austin singer-songwriter’s 2025 debut gets three additional tracks.","standard":"Dylan Gossett’s debut album opens with a prayer. With minimal accompaniment, the Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter wonders if he’s too far gone on the LP’s old-timey opening track, pairing gospel-tinged harmonies with rootsy guitar to dramatic effect as he asks, “Lord, will you carry me?” Only a minute and a half long, the song sets the tone for the searching and heartfelt album, which Gossett wrote and produced himself. That tune leads into “Hangin’ On,” a bright and buoyant folk-rocker reminiscent of early Mumford & Sons with its quick-strummed rhythm guitar and anthemic feel. The road song “American Trail” dips into newgrass, complete with banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and multi-part vocal harmonies, a sound that differentiates Gossett from peers like Zach Bryan. And the album, of course, features one of Gossett’s biggest hits, the stripped-down and vulnerable “Coal,” on which he wonders if the pressures of life will ever bring forth growth.\n\nOn this deluxe edition, Gossett adds three new tracks, starting with an alternate version of “American Trail” featuring quickly rising Canadian singer-songwriter Noeline Hofmann. Gossett tells Apple Music he’d hoped to work with Hofmann on the project, saying she is “one of the best songwriters out there right now.” Kentucky country rockers Ole 60 join Gossett on a new take on “Back 40,” fleshing out the song with harmonies and additional instrumentation. Gossett closes out the expanded album with the new song “Windy City,” a sweet and spare ballad about connecting with people through music. Below, Gossett shares insight into the deluxe edition tracks.\n\n<b>“American Trail” (feat. Noeline Hofmann)</b>\n“I think Noeline Hofmann is one of the best songwriters there is right now. I think she’s incredible. We connected and I sent her this song and I was like, ‘Listen, no pressure. I think you would sound great on it. If you want to do it, that’s awesome.’ I’m just a huge fan, if anything. And then on a plane, I think, she told me, the first time ever hearing the song, she just wrote that verse. Just craziness. And I was like, ‘Yeah, that’s it. That just sounds great. It’s such a perfect part for it.’ And then the harmonies and everything that she does on it, it’s incredible. So she flew down to Austin and recorded that part, and we became really, really good friends.”\n\n<b>“Back 40” (feat. Ole 60)</b>\n“The dudes just rip. And they’re great guys, they make great music, and I just wanted to be in collaboration with them. We have a history of touring together, and I just thought the song would be perfect for them and for [lead singer] Jacob [Young] and his voice and everything like that. Put some pedal steel on it, too, and it was really cool.”\n\n<b>“Windy City”</b>\n“We had a big realization in Chicago, and that’s kind of why I talked about the Windy City. It’s just talking about everywhere, about how this music has been so powerful and how it’s been in my life, just how it goes everywhere. And the fact that people are listening to our music and watching our shows, buying tickets in Australia and in London and Chicago and Los Angeles, not even where I’m from. I would understand Austin, but going and seeing people across the world singing these songs, it’s like, if people are doing that, then we’re doing all right. Our music’s making an impact.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition and Interview"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Westward (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1846639717","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-24","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/westward-deluxe/1846639717","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/3DOexZdh22jhg9XeLHLG4l"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846639717/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1526025679","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1526025679?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761907195004,"RTCI":0}}},"1846717684":{"id":"1846717684","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846717684?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Marca MP","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marca-mp/1493050737","artwork":{"bgColor":"0b100c","hasP3":false,"height":5085,"textColor1":"edecf7","textColor2":"d7d9d7","textColor3":"c0c0c8","textColor4":"aeb1ae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/58/b5/8e/58b58ecd-cc7d-84c4-8e1c-4c5f914a7747/196873732800.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":5085},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"05060b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"dbcaaf","textColor2":"c7c2b1","textColor3":"b0a38e","textColor4":"a09c90","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ad/c5/d6/adc5d6e2-10ca-b04f-2366-476d63e32522/5eadc1b3-dd89-4b81-bdca-fb14bb73c06b.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Rugged corridos and tempestuous románticas from Chato and co.","standard":"Diverging from their sentimental Valentine’s Day offering, <i>ONLY ENAMORADOS</i>, Marca MP’s second project of 2025 reacclimatizes them with the rugged corridos side of their craft.

Introducing his <i>d00mscrvll</i> project in the spring of 2025, Diplo spoke of growing up obsessing over Memphis legends like Three 6 Mafia as a kid, then witnessing their influence evolve in unexpected, postmodern new directions. (His own definition of phonk in all its many iterations is as good as anyone’s: “Basically Memphis run through a vortex and then painted rainbow colors and then screwed and chopped and taken apart and then put into videos that take over your entire feed.”) The first volume in the <i>d00mscrvll</i> mixtape series taps Memphis OGs like Juicy J and Project Pat, plus Dominican rapper Nfasis and Brazil’s MC Lan, for quick, chaotic bursts of songs inspired by Memphis phonk, Brazilian phonk, and cowbell-heavy phonk-house for all your overstimulating, disassociating pleasures.","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["Electronic","Music"],"name":"d00mscrvll, Vol. 1","playParams":{"id":"1846932152","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/d00mscrvll-vol-1/1846932152","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5QRFnGnBeMGePBKF2xTz5z"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846932152/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1468290871","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1468290871?l=en-US"},{"id":"1849264650","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1849264650?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761906891918,"RTCI":0}}},"1846962858":{"id":"1846962858","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846962858?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Berner","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/berner/212971105","artwork":{"bgColor":"972124","hasP3":false,"height":1500,"textColor1":"fcaf8c","textColor2":"faac89","textColor3":"e89377","textColor4":"e69075","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/07/bb/e8/07bbe8fa-7d2f-6b95-1847-8372a3de748d/199316322460_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1500},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"09","playParams":{"id":"1846962858","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-27","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/09/1846962858","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2k1YdkZD1EuW2OXcGZalCE"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846962858/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"212971105","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/212971105?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761891972746,"RTCI":0}}},"1847075914":{"id":"1847075914","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847075914?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Saba","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/saba/1140260329","artwork":{"bgColor":"211c17","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"b5bfd6","textColor2":"80b1e0","textColor3":"979faf","textColor4":"6d93b8","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/0e/da/6c/0eda6c20-ab86-ab3f-422d-162ca82f0d7e/199806143766.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Chicago MC’s second LP of 2025 plays like a carefree vibe session.","standard":"After building a fanbase and a reputation among other artists as an MC of earnestness, emotional depth, and conceptual density, Saba took a different approach. He created 2025’s <i>From the Private Collection of Saba and No ID</i>—a collaboration with legendary hip-hop producer and fellow Chicagoan No ID (Common, JAY-Z)—as what he described as a “tasting menu”: a compelling collection of songs whose connective tissue is the artists who made them, not a specific theme or topic.\n\nHis second project of the year, <i>COFFEE!</i>, is a mixture of both approaches. It’s named after his car, a black Bronco Wildtrak that he wrote and recorded the project’s nine songs in over the course of a week. (The vehicle itself is even personified as a character on “don’t be long.”) But while it may seem conceptual by title, the album plays more like a sketchbook than a fully realized artistic vision. That works to its benefit, though: Instead of the studious intentionality that distinguished his previous albums, <i>COFFEE!</i> plays like a carefree, jazzy vibe session that gives oxygen to his artistic instincts. \n\nSaba’s supple sense of melody and casual introspection means that even his doodles provide just as much comfort as other artists’ complete portraits. “don't be long” affectionately describes the intrapersonal relationships between his loved ones with conversational catchphrases. “itachi” starts as a slow, airy reflection of perseverance before shifting into a catchy, percussive set of whispered vocals, all within less than a minute and a half. The best contemporary comparison to <i>COFFEE!</i> is Kendrick Lamar's <i>untitled unmastered.</i>: a brief, satisfying detour for one of hip-hop’s best.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative Rap","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"C0FFEE!","playParams":{"id":"1847075914","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-30","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/c0ffee/1847075914","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1F14HUbfaQsbk8bf9txfJb"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847075914/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1140260329","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1140260329?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761889110174,"RTCI":0}}},"1847483274":{"id":"1847483274","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847483274?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Dave East","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dave-east/451759978","artwork":{"bgColor":"182c58","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d9d9d8","textColor2":"cfd3da","textColor3":"b3b7be","textColor4":"aab1c0","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/e4/d3/7c/e4d37c00-681f-58a4-c863-faab78f857c4/199806173411.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1c3161","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e4e4e3","textColor2":"ccd3e3","textColor3":"bcc0c9","textColor4":"a9b3c9","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/00/7b/18/007b18f8-8232-e4f3-ff66-1fa7c90d39b8/Jobfd18e244-662a-42d4-b370-545df8fb2c10-207375388-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_405169941_2403466265-Time1761812401971.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1b305d","hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"dddee3","textColor2":"c9cacd","textColor3":"b6bbc8","textColor4":"a6abb7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/52/e8/13/52e813a6-e69b-285b-8046-c3ee41bc1e49/Jobef577116-df18-4e9c-abd4-40cfa1a82bb2-207375387-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_405169940_2403466264-Time1761810842222.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"d6d3d1","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0d","textColor2":"151516","textColor3":"333334","textColor4":"3c3b3b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/72/10/f6/7210f651-c75b-a358-95e2-ef51f3d6efc1/0512c69f-e2f3-4999-99d4-af2373e7d633.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A New York rap vet brings his city’s mixtape energy back.","standard":"There was a time in New York hip-hop when the mixtape format effectively trumped the album. With this looser format, some of the city’s best rappers delivered their hardest, cleverest verses over quality beats—not infrequently using uncleared samples—as a means to keep the streets fed and the fans hyped. And while the definition of a given project may have lost clear meaning over the past decade, Dave East clearly holds the mixtape spirit in high regard. With producers like Nicholas Craven, Harry Fraud, and HighHonors behind the boards, this fourth installment in the <i>Karma</i> series finds the raspy native doing what he loves on his own terms.\n\nThe skits here draw inspiration from epic crime stories like <i>Goodfellas</i>, <i>Heat</i>, and <i>The Sopranos</i>, largely represented by appearances from infamous hip-hop impressionist Pain In Da Ass. But the most compelling narrative here belongs to East, fully prepared for the worst on “Ahki Store” and revealing all manner of escape routes on the impactful “Runnin’.” Few proper albums bring the lyrical heat the way he does on “Demon” or “Havana,” his pen as sharp as ever. \n\nHis choice of guests also reflects his stature in the game, pulling from a national talent pool of other seasoned stars and independent winners. He details the rough road to a luxe life with Stove God Cooks, dips into a nostalgic cloud-rap bag alongside Wiz Khalifa, and gives the R&B-meets-rap model a rugged refresher opposite Jeremih and Roc-A-Fella vet Rell. As if that weren’t enough, the posthumous Nipsey Hussle presence on “12 Months” lends even greater gravity to the whole <i>Karma 4</i> endeavor.\n","tagline":"New Mixtape"},"genreNames":["East Coast

There’s the energetic, hyper-verbose lyrical flex of the opener “HOME.,” which finds White working through trauma normally reserved for the therapist’s couch. Elsewhere, though, triumph prevails: On “CUT THE LIGHTS.” he’s quick to note just how quickly he’s able to get a party going, and on “SAY IT TO ME.,” he flips a sample of Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.” and showcases his quick wit when he declares that he’ll turn a couple of “grapevines into a cabernet.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"THERE’S A GHOST IN MY HOUSE.","playParams":{"id":"1847510832","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/theres-a-ghost-in-my-house/1847510832","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5fp3kb3iWMd0URTwo6lzah"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847510832/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1129439109","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1129439109?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761911080778,"RTCI":0}}},"1847641847":{"id":"1847641847","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847641847?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"1K Phew","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/1k-phew/1168127389","artwork":{"bgColor":"17111d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f5e3d6","textColor2":"e6b491","textColor3":"c8b9b1","textColor4":"bc9379","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/d5/dd/01/d5dd01b0-cf49-93c8-7401-4790606778b6/1250.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Christian","Music","Hip-Hop/Rap"],"name":"What's Understood 3","playParams":{"id":"1847641847","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-10-31","trackCount":17,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whats-understood-3/1847641847","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/5NVhdfx9e7rHeyeg0QN8O0"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847641847/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1168127389","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1168127389?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1761932981784,"RTCI":0}}},"1847772518":{"id":"1847772518","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847772518?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"WEi","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wei/1533632173","artwork":{"bgColor":"b2b2b2","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"060606","textColor2":"0a0a0a","textColor3":"282828","textColor4":"2b2b2b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ca/d7/86/cad786ce-b493-1f62-20d6-40d5c407c404/cover_KM0023567_1.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["K-Pop","Music","Pop"],"name":"Wonderland -

He lays out his fears most explicitly on “Selfish,” another James Blake joint, reeling off a litany of sins and self-suspicions over ominous chords and haunting vocal samples. “My 27th Birthday” underscores his inner conflicts across almost eight minutes of restrained piano and hi-hat-centric percussion: new money clashes with old, moral conviction with the ethics of consumption, work ethic with the sacrifice of ambition. The state of the world weighs heavy; “How can you be King?/How can you be King?/Don’t speak for the people,” he asks on the title track, closing out the record with a powerful interrogation of his own commitment to social justice and a sage reminder that the push for change is a collective, intergenerational effort.\n\nThe introspection is admirable but the album’s highlights occur when Dave steps outside of himself, whether it’s to position himself as a narrator—unpicking the psychology of a criminal with “Marvellous,” calmly outlining the reasons women may fear men on “Fairchild”—or to engage with his peers as on the sultry Tems teamup “Raindance” or “Chapter 16,” which sees him form an inquisitive dialogue with grime heavyweight (and <i>Top Boy</i> co-star) Kano. And while <i>The Boy Who Played the Harp</i> is a more sonically somber affair than his previous works, the standard of observational insight and lyrical wordplay that have so far earned him an Ivor Novello, a BRIT, and the Mercury Music Prize, remains unchanged. Bending the word “Exodus” so that “there’s repentance in the Bible...” lands with the punchline “…God, remind my ex of this” (“175 Months”) is a shining example. It’s a timely record, arriving in a moment where problems seem insurmountable.

While most celebrities of his caliber and notoriety either curate their public lives to near-plasticized extremes or become defined by tabloid exploits, the erstwhile Odd Futurian chiefly shares what he cares to via his art and the occasional yet ever-quotable interview. As his Tyler, The Creator albums pivoted away from persona-building and toward personal narrative, as on the acclaimed <i>IGOR</i> and <i>CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST</i>, his mystique grew grandiose, with the undesirable side effect of greater speculation.\n\nThe impact of fan fixation plays no small part on <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i>, his seventh studio album and first in more than three years. Reacting to the weirdness, opening track “St. Chroma” finds Tyler literally whispering the details of his upbringing, while lead single “Noid” more directly rages against outsiders who overstep both online and offline. As on his prior efforts, character work plays its part, particularly on “I Killed You” and the two-hander “Hey Jane.” Yet the veil between truth and fiction feels thinner than ever on family-oriented cuts like “Like Him” and “Tomorrow.”\n\nLest things get too damn serious, Tyler provocatively leans into sexual proclivities on “Judge Judy” and “Rah Tah Tah,” both of which should satisfy those who’ve been around since the <i>Goblin</i> days. When monologue no longer suits, he calls upon others in the greater hip-hop pantheon. GloRilla, Lil Wayne, and Sexyy Red all bring their star power to “Sticky,” a bombastic number that evolves into a Young Buck interpolation. A kindred spirit, it seems, Doechii does the most on “Balloon,” amplifying Tyler’s energy with her boisterous and profane bars.\n\nIts title essentially distillable to “an abundance of color,” <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i> showcases several variants of Tyler’s artistry. Generally disinclined to cede the producer’s chair to anyone else, he and longtime studio cohort Vic Wainstein execute a musical vision that encompasses sounds as wide-ranging as jazz fusion and Zamrock. His influences worn on stylishly cuffed sleeves, Neptunes echoes ring loudly on the introspective “Darling, I” while retro R&B vibes swaddle the soapbox on “Take Your Mask Off.”\n","tagline":"New

The Buffalo-bred artist’s well-documented kayfabe tendencies assuredly drove him to execute a dramatic finishing move, which this project most certainly is. After all, his ongoing side quest to build the world’s best new pro wrestling league hasn’t kept him far from the mic this year, dropping installments in this series to correspond with concurrent live 4th Rope events that mix matches with bars.\n\nWith producers like Daringer and Denny Laflare in his corner, songs like “R Truth” and the Rome Streetz tag-team demonstration “Tito Santana” play to his love for the sport. Others more overtly call back to his dope-dealer lore, deftly navigating the street politics of “Tiffany Blue” and whipping up that work on “Free Roleys” alongside Benny the Butcher.
