DRAIN is your friend.’”\n\nThe sentiment fits perfectly with DRAIN’s infectious enthusiasm and feel-good California vibes, both of which seem to ooze from Ciaramitaro’s every pore. “When we play, it feels like I’m kind of hanging out and having a little party with people,” he says. “Maybe I don’t know them, but we’ve got enough common ground. And even now, as our band has been able to accomplish so many things, we still hold on to the fact that we’re friends that are in a band. We’re not that far apart from your friends that are just playing down the street.” \n\nAfter the success of their 2023 album <i>LIVING PROOF</i>, DRAIN made the leap to full-time band. On <i>…IS YOUR FRIEND</i>, they incorporate even more of guitarist Cody Chavez’s heavy metal influences while Ciaramitaro holds it down on bass and Tim Flegal handles drums. “Cody lives and breathes Dokken, thrash metal, and hair metal,” the singer says. “At one point, Tim and I didn’t want to go too far in that direction, but on this album, we really thought about ‘how can we throw all of our stuff in a blender and have it not get lost?’ But we realize there’s a fine line. Hopefully the hardcore kids that know us will enjoy this, and we can bring in some of the metal guys, too.” Below, he comments on each track. \n\n<b>“Stealing Happiness from Tomorrow”</b>\n“We felt this would make a great opener because it starts with one instrument at a time, and when those guitars come in, dude, it’s just these huge chords with the whammy, and I love it. It’s got some New York hardcore in it, with a big mosh outro. Lyrically, I got married between this record and the last one, and I wrote these lyrics shortly after the wedding. I love in hip-hop songs when they’ll take half a line from another song as like a nod or paying homage. On this song, I took a couple lyrics from the Daniel Johnston song ‘True Love Will Find You in the End,’ which was our first dance at the wedding, and reworked them a bit.”\n\n<b>“Living in a Memory”</b>\n“I wrote this one about how I’ll run into people I knew from way back, people I used to party with. I think sometimes they’ll look back fondly at that part of life for themselves, but when I look back at that part of my life, they’re not my proudest or happiest moments. I’ve written about being straight edge before, but this isn’t really a straight edge song because you can apply it to just about anything. I can acknowledge fun times and fun memories, but I never wish I was back there still doing that.”\n\n<b>“Scared of Everything and Nothing”</b>\n“I wrote this one on my honeymoon in Jamaica. We just got off this huge tour, the biggest we had ever done, and a month later I got married. I was thinking about how I have everything I’ve ever wanted in life, so what’s next? Where do you go when you finally have everything you want? It’s really cool, but it’s also kind of a scary thing. In a movie, there’s the problem and they beat it and then the movie’s over. But what happens next? You make these goals and you check them off, and then you’re just done? Is it over? No, you make another goal, and you keep chasing it.” \n\n<b>“Nothing but Love”</b>\n“We’re very fortunate—we don’t really have many haters. But that saying ‘more money, more problems’ is a real thing, dude. The better you’re doing, the more people there are out there who don’t like it, and it’s not even because they necessarily dislike you. But they take success personally or something. It’s a jealousy thing, and it sucks. But instead of ‘fuck you if you don’t like me,’ it’s ‘I love you, man. There’s room for all of us to succeed and excel.’” \n\n<b>“Can’t Be Bothered”</b>\n“We all play a lot of instruments, so our drummer, Tim, came up with this song on guitar. I heard one of our British homies say, ‘I can’t be bothered today.’ Like when it’s a really nice day, I can’t be bothered to do some of the shit I’m supposed to do, like emails or phone calls or any kind of paperwork. I don’t want to do anything except what I want to do, and most of the time that involves me being outside. I absolutely love where I live in Santa Cruz, and in the song, I name-drop a lot of the places I like to hang out, kinda like what Sublime did on ‘Paddle Out.’” \n\n<b>“Loudest in the Room”</b>\n“The beginning starts with these wild animals, but it’s actually just all of our little dogs. We recorded them barking and kind of fucked their voices up to make them sound crazy. Guitar-wise, the opening riff is one of my favorites on the whole record. We don’t ever get political, really, but the lyrics are my commentary on some aspects of the world. I feel like sometimes the loudest people, the ones who preach this or that, end up being the worst people. The person that’s the first to jump on anybody and bring them to the witch trial, they’re always the loudest. They’re overcompensating for having a lack of rational thought.” \n\n<b>“Nights Like These”</b>\n“It’s got a nasty East Coast kind of groove on top of fucking pulverizing guitar riffing. I wrote a good amount of the lyrics while we were on tour and feeling lucky that we get to do what we do. I get to spend time with some of my closest friends, and we get to play music and spread our wings a bit. And we get to share that feeling with new people and watch them have fun every night. It’s really fulfilling.” \n\n<b>“Who’s Having Fun?”</b>\n“I think that everybody thought that this was what the whole record was going to sound like. I love this song, but we only wrote one because that’s all we wanted to do. The guitar gets to open up and kind of tap into some heavy metal shred moments with a fuck-ton of pinches on this one. I feel like we dipped our toe into this world when we did the Descendents cover on the last record, and while some people maybe thought we were going to ditch our sound for this, we feel like we just unlocked a new door.” \n\n<b>“Darkest Days”</b>\n“This is one of the first songs where I needed help trying to figure out cadences and stuff. When the music was done, it was just me and the producer in the studio, and he was laying on the floor, and we were just kind of freestyling and trying to figure out a cool little flow. We just kind of let it happen, and I ended up writing about the yin and yang of life. If you’ve never experienced really dark and tough moments in life, you might not appreciate the other end of it. People who come from a more fortunate background sometimes don’t appreciate what they have because they’ve never experienced the other side.” \n\n<b>“Until Next Time...”</b>\n“This started off as a guitar riff that was really heavy-metal-sounding, and I wasn’t sure how to make it work. But then we wrote this dope, kind of groovy Madball-type chorus and it got really fun. I didn’t have lyrics for it until we got into the studio, and it became kind of like breaking the fourth wall. I was thinking of the end of an old TV show, where it’s like, ‘OK, signing off here. Until next time!’ It’s almost kind of like parting advice, so we all contributed. In one verse, we paid homage to ‘We’re Coming Back’ by Cock Sparrer, which has a lyric that goes, ‘Remember, you’ve got a friend. You’ll never walk alone again.’ That’s a song I’d want playing if I was going into battle.” \n","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Metal","Music","Rock"],"name":"...IS YOUR FRIEND","playParams":{"id":"1816025989","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/is-your-friend/1816025989","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0SgaJxAqnAWhe1YDanb3zQ"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1816025989/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1115849199","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1115849199?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762493544102,"RTCI":0}}},"1817712403":{"id":"1817712403","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1817712403?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Alexisonfire","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alexisonfire/29405104","artwork":{"bgColor":"bce3b6","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"050406","textColor2":"212221","textColor3":"2a3129","textColor4":"40493f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ba/b7/87/bab7874a-b6ed-0806-5a3b-bd63a436c2aa/821826039162.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"bce3b6","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"050406","textColor2":"212221","textColor3":"2a3129","textColor4":"40493f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/ba/b7/87/bab7874a-b6ed-0806-5a3b-bd63a436c2aa/821826039162.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The post-hardcore heroes salute the Canadians who corrupted them. ","standard":"Years before they became the leading lights of the post-Y2K Southern Ontario post-hardcore scene, Alexisonfire were partaking in a daily ritual for misfit ’90s kids across Canada: They rushed home after school to catch MuchMusic’s afternoon alternative-video show <i>The Wedge</i>, which put homegrown acts on the same heavily rotated pedestal as the US and UK buzz bands. The first installment in Alexis’ <i>Copies of Old Masters</i> EP series pays tribute to the Canadian noisemakers who served as their gateways into alt-rock culture, with faithfully grungy but extra-nasty renditions of Rusty radio hits (“Misogyny”) and Doughboys deep cuts (“Neighbourhood Villain”).\n\nOf course, when you grow up in Canada in the ’90s, there’s no escaping the influence of The Tragically Hip, whose propulsive “Fully Completely” is pushed to new levels of white-knuckled intensity through Dallas Green’s dramatic delivery, George Pettit’s Gollum-esque growls, and a sidewinding sax solo. But beyond the familiar favorites, Alexisonfire also honors an unsung underground trailblazer with a sledgehammering cover of “Cuz” by Hamilton sludge-punk legends Shallow North Dakota.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Rock","Music"],"name":"Copies of Old Masters Vol. 1 -

Chicago duo make a return to warm, pastoral folk rock.","standard":"Whitney’s fourth album is a moment of rebirth for the Chicago duo. After making a hard pivot towards pop-influenced sounds on 2022’s <i>Spark</i>, Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek—who, at this point, are a million miles away sonically from the teenage-kicking garage rock of their previous band Smith Westerns—return to the pastoral folk rock they made their name on with <i>Small Talk</i>. The result is a gorgeous and warm affair, complete with lush instrumentation and feathery melodies that resemble a full realization of the sound they first gained notice with on their critically acclaimed debut <i>Light Upon the Lake</i> from 2016. Ehrlich and Kakacek’s distinctive vocals continue to complement each other perfectly, their self-produced arrangements taking on levels of complication that stretch far beyond the Simon & Garfunkel comparisons of their early work and more towards the velvety soft rock of the late 1970s, every horn stab and piano run possessing the effervescence of sipping champagne at dusk.","tagline":"New

enticingly creepy and unique third album from the London outfit.","standard":"On their 2020 debut <i>925</i> and 2022 follow-up <i>Anywhere But Here</i>, London’s Sorry hammered together a sometimes jarring collision of sounds that took in everything from lo-fi bedroom pop and indie to glitch and drum ’n’ bass. On their third album, Sorry’s mutant hybrid holds together much more coherently. That’s in part due to core duo Louis O’Bryen and Asha Lorenz leaning into their more unsettling qualities, with the resulting atmosphere binding everything under its dark spell. \n\nWith Lorenz’s childlike vocals shifting between panic-attack anxiety and creepy playground taunts, <i>COSPLAY</i> skips and lurches through a shadowy sonic underworld coloured by clanking industrial noise (“Jetplane”’s frenetic collision of beats), haunting gothic nightmares (the Cure-like miasma-swamping “Love Posture”), and desolate folk (the O’Bryen-fronted “Life in This Body”). While the album’s title might suggest dressing up in someone else’s style, on <i>COSPLAY</i>, Sorry have fashioned something truly unique.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"COSPLAY","playParams":{"id":"1828653368","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/cosplay/1828653368","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2y9KTl1MXK8jgH40zwh11X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828653368/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1303473736","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1303473736?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762494997551,"RTCI":0}}},"1828776083":{"id":"1828776083","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828776083?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Various Artists","artwork":{"bgColor":"101010","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"cecdd0","textColor2":"e1c1a2","textColor3":"a8a7a9","textColor4":"b79d84","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/dc/53/79/dc5379ff-78ba-eb6d-815a-76edb4278b6b/00198704628238_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Traditional Country","Music","Country"],"name":"Opry 100: Country's Greatest Songs (Live At The Grand Ole Opry)","playParams":{"id":"1828776083","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/opry-100-countrys-greatest-songs-live-at-the-grand-ole-opry/1828776083"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1828776083/artists?l=en-US","data":[]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762428289558,"RTCI":0}}},"1829011456":{"id":"1829011456","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829011456?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jade LeMac","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jade-lemac/1399155122","artwork":{"bgColor":"1f1e1a","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"f2e1c9","textColor2":"d4d3cb","textColor3":"c8baa6","textColor4":"b0afa7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f4/e8/02/f4e802b8-68e7-5e05-d566-4363b3a6c387/5021732940551.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f1e9f3","textColor2":"bdbed1","textColor3":"c4bec6","textColor4":"9a9bab","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/d5/35/67/d5356708-ec42-45e8-6040-d4696ac66101/ab468788-18f7-4a6a-ab41-c4c9d911770d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"241815","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"c1c3da","textColor2":"aaadc9","textColor3":"a1a1b3","textColor4":"8f8fa5","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/0a/8c/e9/0a8ce987-885a-7771-4135-81f0a71158fe/447d46ad-5b26-4927-87cd-17589b4e3b02.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"1f1e1a","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f2e1c9","textColor2":"d4d3cb","textColor3":"c8baa6","textColor4":"b0afa7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/f4/e8/02/f4e802b8-68e7-5e05-d566-4363b3a6c387/5021732940551.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A tidy six-track EP that furthers the Canadian’s songwriting development.","standard":"Canadian songwriter Jade LeMac’s rise was swift, thanks in large part to the success of her breakthrough single “Constellations.” That song served as the title track to her 2023 debut, which introduced a blend of sharp, incisive songwriting with epic instrumentals built for adoring crowds packed into clubs, theaters, and, one day, arenas. On <i>It’s Always at Night</i>, a tidy six-track EP, she furthers her songwriting development and explores love in all its manifestations. \n\n“Running Home” is an electro-fused pop banger that builds and builds before reaching a cathartic chorus that’s accented by statements of devotion and cinematic string swells. On “Sleeping with the Lights On,” LeMac opts for balladry, showcasing her impressive vocal range across a landscape of acoustic guitar chords and pedal steel. She admits to, as the title suggests, sleeping with the lights on, but her clever lyricism reveals an ulterior motive: “I’m scared of the silence, I’m scared of dreams where I’m not yours, darling.”\n","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"It's Always At Night - EP","playParams":{"id":"1829011456","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-always-at-night-ep/1829011456"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829011456/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1399155122","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1399155122?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502666941,"RTCI":0}}},"1829019214":{"id":"1829019214","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829019214?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Jake Owen","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jake-owen/128412737","artwork":{"bgColor":"1e1c1a","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d9c19c","textColor2":"cdb695","textColor3":"b3a082","textColor4":"aa977c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7d/d6/29/7dd629ad-2b46-3dac-7dc6-10a1e2851b59/735380599973.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"1f1e1a","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"b5ccd0","textColor2":"dcb9a2","textColor3":"97a9ac","textColor4":"b69a86","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/37/56/8d/37568d99-bf2f-c3b1-76a5-a8359d122abd/4826a2d9-c4c5-4b9c-9938-6f3db62106a5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"1e1c1a","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"d9c19c","textColor2":"cdb695","textColor3":"b3a082","textColor4":"aa977c","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/7d/d6/29/7dd629ad-2b46-3dac-7dc6-10a1e2851b59/735380599973.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A vibrant portrait of one of country’s finest vocalists navigating middle age.","standard":"Jake Owen may have found early success with beachy party anthems, but the longtime country star has plenty to say about life’s less glamorous moments on this eighth studio album, which marks his first release as an independent artist. Produced by Grammy winner Shooter Jennings (Brandi Carlile, Tanya Tucker), <i>Dreams to Dream</i> is a vibrant and vulnerable portrait of an artist navigating middle age, and shows a new side of the “Barefoot Blue Jean Night” hitmaker. Songs like “Long Time Lovin’ You” remind that Owen is one of the genre’s finer vocalists, as his reedy voice dips into and glides back out of a lower register with agile ease. “Middle Age Crazy” is a welcome addition to the small but vibrant canon of country songs about aging, while “Wrinkle in the Road” makes peace with the passage and ravages of time. Closer “So Long, LA” splits the difference between mournful and hopeful, as Owen recounts returning home to Nashville with a “brand-new fire” burning in his heart.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"Dreams to Dream","playParams":{"id":"1829019214","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dreams-to-dream/1829019214","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7v7WIGwGwIq9gpEc0fdaz1"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829019214/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"128412737","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/128412737?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762494178292,"RTCI":0}}},"1829743986":{"id":"1829743986","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829743986?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Insecure Men","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/insecure-men/1276768047","artwork":{"bgColor":"00333c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f1bd9a","textColor2":"e76819","textColor3":"c1a187","textColor4":"b95e20","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3a/ea/b4/3aeab482-a4aa-5c0e-9d04-1bb363b11233/199538396089.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"01333d","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e4d1c3","textColor2":"f1be9b","textColor3":"b6b2a8","textColor4":"c1a288","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/c0/ef/f6/c0eff62b-5287-60ff-f6e1-755bbd28dd9e/Job3cef6c15-4aa0-4add-8c31-77988c3b68ab-201971995-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395159279_2321476196-Time1756890205537.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"052d34","gradient":{"color":"052d34","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfad88","textColor3":"baaa97","textColor4":"b39579","textGradient":["ffffff","dfad88"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/56/7b/87/567b875d-d922-2309-ee89-c97dff55c276/Jobdc253d16-3f3a-4919-b5e4-dc5696be0846-201971574-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_395159280_2321476195-Time1756888527584.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"00333c","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f1bd9a","textColor2":"e76819","textColor3":"c1a187","textColor4":"b95e20","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/3a/ea/b4/3aeab482-a4aa-5c0e-9d04-1bb363b11233/199538396089.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"A Man For All Seasons","playParams":{"id":"1829743986","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-man-for-all-seasons/1829743986","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/725yD29LPLeE47pEODFkNf"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829743986/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1276768047","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1276768047?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762495042578,"RTCI":0}}},"1829799294":{"id":"1829799294","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1829799294?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"The Dears","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-dears/7233309","artwork":{"bgColor":"2d1d0d","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f6f9d2","textColor2":"f0e9a6","textColor3":"cecdab","textColor4":"c9c087","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/82/d4/0e/82d40ee2-5160-b4a2-03f5-1c48ccfe84e9/116670.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"110e12","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"f5fad3","textColor2":"f1eaa8","textColor3":"c8caac","textColor4":"c4be8a","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/72/3e/da/723edaa6-c329-8795-2638-bb6f1c9f1062/Job18ad8a30-cba5-4e2e-a39e-2a102ae1b41c-201469307-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_394234503_2313605631-Time1756423935265.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"201a15","gradient":{"color":"201a15","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f7f5cd","textColor3":"cdcdbf","textColor4":"ccc8a7","textGradient":["ffffff","f7f5cd"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/8c/d6/e0/8cd6e07e-053d-38d3-09e5-f8489973c4c7/Job4b243de9-466d-4a0d-be96-8bdb82f9823c-201469306-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_394234502_2313605630-Time1756422783408.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"2d1d0d","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f6f9d2","textColor2":"f0e9a6","textColor3":"cecdab","textColor4":"c9c087","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/82/d4/0e/82d40ee2-5160-b4a2-03f5-1c48ccfe84e9/116670.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Life Is Beautiful!

She would go on to apply her singular rasp, keen ear, and strong social conscience to a body of work that stands as a living heritage of American music—singing on Civil Rights Movement anthems, collaborating with Bob Dylan, Prince, and Willie Nelson, and being inducted into both the Rock & Roll and Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Staples briefly considered retiring in 2023; instead, she recorded her quietly stunning 14th solo album. \n\nOn <i>Sad and Beautiful World</i>, the icon interprets a few songs from contemporaries like Leonard Cohen and Curtis Mayfield, but less expected are her takes on newer and more obscure numbers—Kevin Morby’s 2016 protest song “Beautiful Strangers,” or the early Sparklehorse album cut from which Staples draws the title. She’s joined on the closer, a sweet take on Eddie Hinton’s “Everybody Needs Love,” by an all-star cast of backup singers: Bonnie Raitt, Drive-By Truckers’ Patterson Hood, and Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield, plus guitar and drums by MJ Lenderman. And on “Human Mind,” the album’s sole original—written for Staples by Hozier and Allison Russell—she holds out a little hope amid the darkness: “Even in these days I find/This far down the line/I find good in us sometimes.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["R&B/Soul","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Sad and Beautiful World","playParams":{"id":"1830973672","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/sad-and-beautiful-world/1830973672","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/07aZwFEzDfh0BALXf1o6FH"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1830973672/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"49985","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/49985?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762507821313,"RTCI":0}}},"1831026168":{"id":"1831026168","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831026168?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ata Kak","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ata-kak/955577749","artwork":{"bgColor":"ecebb1","hasP3":false,"height":2400,"textColor1":"17110f","textColor2":"181612","textColor3":"423d2f","textColor4":"424132","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/64/23/0e/64230eea-b79e-d178-b6e1-4afc150bce50/57730.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2400},"editorialArtwork":{},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Batakari - EP","playParams":{"id":"1831026168","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":6,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/batakari-ep/1831026168"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831026168/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"955577749","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/955577749?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762432892527,"RTCI":0}}},"1831541288":{"id":"1831541288","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831541288?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Hatchie","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hatchie/1234339576","artwork":{"bgColor":"f4c4c1","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"1a0905","textColor2":"260b01","textColor3":"462e2a","textColor4":"4f3027","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/33/3f/6d/333f6dab-13b6-6ece-3d57-406eaa9f5dab/57825.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"1d130f","gradient":{"color":"1d130f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"2a1004","textColor3":"3f2827","textColor4":"503228","textGradient":["ffffff","2a1004"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9a/00/3c/9a003c63-45b1-4fd0-ee2b-a255c5ca6070/Job7cc58ed1-4e6f-4682-8b1b-b61b39d04686-205720648-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_401886617_2377704034-Time1760125662333.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"1d130f","gradient":{"color":"1d130f","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e39a88","textColor3":"c58e81","textColor4":"bd7c6e","textGradient":["ffffff","e39a88"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/9c/c5/de/9cc5deca-590d-f71e-9149-cea2d13cbc17/Jobe7c9b347-42af-4925-9f49-400a01d7ff92-205720647-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_401886616_2377704035-Time1760123768849.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"e8e9ee","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"35251d","textColor2":"2b2827","textColor3":"594c47","textColor4":"514e4e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ab/12/bf/ab12bf3d-73f2-2e01-9264-63ef6aea18a8/a3d4a7ee-f3d3-441a-af76-c999da3b3708.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"f4c4c1","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"1a0905","textColor2":"260b01","textColor3":"462e2a","textColor4":"4f3027","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/33/3f/6d/333f6dab-13b6-6ece-3d57-406eaa9f5dab/57825.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Heightened romance saturates these dream-pop valentines.","standard":"After writing 2022’s <i>Giving the World Away</i> in lockdown with the live show firmly in mind, Harriette Pilbeam took a different approach for her third album as Hatchie. She put touring on the back burner to just let this set of songs develop naturally and gradually, finding more inspiration in books and movies than in other music and relocating from California back to her native Brisbane and then to Melbourne. Pilbeam immersed herself in such melancholic romance films as <i>Before Sunrise</i> and <i>Blue Valentine</i>, savoring the poignancy of extended longing. The warm, woozy songs on <i>Liquorice</i> capture that sensation nicely, with the title track especially echoing the heightened reality of experiencing intense new love. “We’re just getting to the good bit,” she sings, before the swooning refrain “Don’t need anything other than this.” Produced by Melina Duterte (aka Jay Som) in her LA home studio, the album also features Pilbeam’s trusty partner Joe Agius (RINSE) and Warpaint drummer Stella Mozgawa. Pilbeam thrives in those close collaborations, while still sounding entirely like herself: lead single “Lose It Again” is a co-write with Orchin’s Jeremy McLennan, yet it’s exactly the kind of sugared dream pop she has always done so well. And even when she slips darker lyrical undertones into “Only One Laughing,” her lilting voice and the rippling guitar effects provide comforting reassurance.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Liquorice","playParams":{"id":"1831541288","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/liquorice/1831541288","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0dtHFmAZG3WuxrpxxGoXlV"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1831541288/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1234339576","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1234339576?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762495616128,"RTCI":0}}},"1832031297":{"id":"1832031297","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832031297?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Clark","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/clark/136731821","artwork":{"bgColor":"190f0e","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"e9a37f","textColor2":"de9471","textColor3":"bf8568","textColor4":"b7795d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/90/8a/9e908a8d-2770-c3e6-c4ee-46b8824b8df9/5051142058478_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"150f0e","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"e49a75","textColor2":"da8c66","textColor3":"bb7e60","textColor4":"b37355","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/50/fd/6c/50fd6c88-4f16-6c67-601b-91a1acfea64d/Job86af9166-93f9-4c5a-9adc-abf514515723-207204333-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_404827263_2400810977-Time1761665489305.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"100a0c","gradient":{"color":"100a0c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e09574","textColor3":"c79b7c","textColor4":"b8795e","textGradient":["ffffff","e09574"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/89/fc/60/89fc60ab-ff3e-b971-8d7a-654a6cd58ee5/Job96872773-f323-49d2-98a4-480a3652d404-207204334-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_404827264_2400810976-Time1761666993325.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"f06022","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"130706","textColor2":"16100e","textColor3":"3f190c","textColor4":"422012","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ad/6f/6f/ad6f6ff2-1029-22cb-ea48-9de57614b34c/4180e3b7-43ad-4896-841c-cf3233294811.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"190f0e","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"e9a37f","textColor2":"de9471","textColor3":"bf8568","textColor4":"b7795d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/9e/90/8a/9e908a8d-2770-c3e6-c4ee-46b8824b8df9/5051142058478_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The experimental producer splices throbbing bass with rave-ready synth.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"name":"Steep Stims","playParams":{"id":"1832031297","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/steep-stims/1832031297","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0zL30K7hlasu2LygmuK5EA"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832031297/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"136731821","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/136731821?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762493131611,"RTCI":0}}},"1832310241":{"id":"1832310241","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1832310241?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Armand Hammer & The Alchemist","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=717788605-28446224","artwork":{"bgColor":"cfa176","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"2f0d0b","textColor2":"431210","textColor3":"4f2a20","textColor4":"5f2e24","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/06/47/470647e7-15c9-6a74-b61b-7fc6f1f12313/5063778675431_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"cfa176","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"2f0d0b","textColor2":"431210","textColor3":"4f2a20","textColor4":"5f2e24","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/06/47/470647e7-15c9-6a74-b61b-7fc6f1f12313/5063778675431_cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Grisly dispatches from a vital force in underground rap.","standard":"If the grim hallucinations of billy woods and E L U C I D’s second album with The Alchemist ever feel like too much, just remember the reality that inspired them, from the streets where the ambulance never comes (“Laraaji”) to the resegregated swimming pools where “bleach burn good like menthol” (“Scandinavia”).

Darnielle shoots his shot with his most theatrical project yet.","standard":"In form alone, <i>Through This Fire Across from Peter Balkan</i> feels like a summation of John Darnielle’s ambitions across his 30-year-plus career. His work as The Mountain Goats, rich with storytelling and character study, has often approximated the trappings of musical theater, from the detailed scene-setting of his 2002 classic <i>Tallahassee</i> to the loosely structured rock opera of 2023’s <i>Jenny from Thebes</i>. But the project’s 23rd album feels practically made for the Broadway stage, right down to the sweeping orchestration of the album’s opening “Overture” (the first time an instrumental has been featured on a Mountain Goats album). \n\nFittingly, the record features backing vocal contributions from <i>Hamilton</i> godhead and longtime Darnielle friend Lin-Manuel Miranda—but despite these slight shifts in sound, longtime fans will still recognize <i>Through This Fire</i> as carrying the same elements of Darnielle’s music that have been present throughout his career, every song a detailed revelation of an imaginary world that its creator adds glorious life to.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Through This Fire Across from Peter Balkan","playParams":{"id":"1834009766","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/through-this-fire-across-from-peter-balkan/1834009766","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/23wXSnurzNp56xCyGBPQ65"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834009766/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"4978336","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/4978336?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762495076383,"RTCI":0}}},"1834496662":{"id":"1834496662","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834496662?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/teen-jesus-and-the-jean-teasers/1274446902","artwork":{"bgColor":"214ec8","hasP3":false,"height":4000,"textColor1":"c8dffa","textColor2":"7ab4ff","textColor3":"a7c2f0","textColor4":"68a0f3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/96/be/fa/96befa69-33a7-0370-552b-501023104811/8721215819127.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"214ec8","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"c8dffa","textColor2":"7ab4ff","textColor3":"a7c2f0","textColor4":"68a0f3","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/96/be/fa/96befa69-33a7-0370-552b-501023104811/8721215819127.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The indie rockers’ second album strengthens their defiant attitude.","standard":"Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers have been racking up milestones since releasing their 2024 debut album, <i>I Love You</i>, including touring with Pearl Jam in America and Australia and becoming the first all-female and nonbinary band to score an ARIA for Best Breakthrough Artist. Not bad for an ensemble that formed when its members were still in the first half of their teen years. <i>GLORY</i> beefs up the Melbourne/Canberra quartet’s sound to match their growing stature, with London-based producer Catherine Marks (boygenius, Wolf Alice) decamping to the Central Coast of New South Wales to add more muscle and polish to these punky indie-rock anthems. \n\nPop-friendly effects and shouted group vocals bolster “BALCONY,” which sees singer/guitarist Anna Ryan breezily instruct the song’s subject to break up with their boyfriend. “BAIT” is equally snide, test-driving the POV of a man with an overbearing ego—complete with hollow “player” and “game” slogans. The Jean Teasers also employ rumbling reverb and vivid imagery on the slow-then-fast standout “MOTHER,” without couching their defiant feminist attitude (“And I shall not suffer a holy man’s crusade”). From top to bottom, this album proves to be a natural leveling-up for the band.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"GLORY","playParams":{"id":"1834496662","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/glory/1834496662","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/10dMcSkztXUMidaQWYYspo"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834496662/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1274446902","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1274446902?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762505164662,"RTCI":0}}},"1834739561":{"id":"1834739561","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1834739561?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"BENEE","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/benee/1362746533","artwork":{"bgColor":"535354","hasP3":false,"height":5000,"textColor1":"ede2e5","textColor2":"fad9d6","textColor3":"cec5c8","textColor4":"d8bebc","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/73/22/477322f0-a478-54de-485a-8502d9cb3ab2/25UM1IM19859.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":5000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"565558","hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"fbe5e1","textColor2":"f1c3c3","textColor3":"dac8c6","textColor4":"d2adae","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/2a/0b/47/2a0b47a7-d02c-bf81-5ce7-d3006608d9a1/Job2f29a2bc-2591-4023-8f05-a9d40371a45e-204268784-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399264150_2355903225-Time1758900433292.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"d0ac9f","gradient":{"color":"d0ac9f","y2":0.29},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"e1d3d7","textColor3":"d8bfbd","textColor4":"c5b9bd","textGradient":["000000","e1d3d7"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/f4/0c/aa/f40caa00-227f-6b79-6b77-d685934c2ed5/Jobe0afdbfb-a290-4fe3-ab08-08de828baac8-204268783-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_399264151_2355903224-Time1758899277375.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"12170c","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7e9e1","textColor2":"ebe4e1","textColor3":"c9bfb6","textColor4":"bfbbb6","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/aa/a1/57/aaa15792-d489-1ea2-958a-0993d669792b/92968601-010f-49e8-ab8b-bedde480d918.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"b2b3b2","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"060606","textColor2":"1b1916","textColor3":"292929","textColor4":"393735","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/ba/7d/76/ba7d7658-5527-1f04-97f1-3695a1c59751/b0f97757-beae-4d37-8ca8-48888da6c1ae.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"535354","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"ede2e5","textColor2":"fad9d6","textColor3":"cec5c8","textColor4":"d8bebc","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/47/73/22/477322f0-a478-54de-485a-8502d9cb3ab2/25UM1IM19859.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The alt-pop star: “I’m thinking about a lot deeper and bigger questions.”","standard":"Change and growth have been constants in BENEE’s life since her 2020 debut album, <i>Hey u x</i>. For starters, the New Zealand artist born Stella Rose Bennett moved to Los Angeles which, she tells Apple Music, “definitely changed the way I make music, because I had to find different collaborators. It challenged me in a lot of ways.”\n\nShe also points out that, at 25, her frontal lobes have now fully developed. “I feel I’m thinking about a lot deeper and bigger questions,” she starts. “I read Stephen Hawking’s book, <i>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</i>, and that was a bit of a wake-up. Like, damn, I want to think about science. I want to think about what’s going on in this crazy world. I also want to think about the fantastical side of things, this ethereal, creative world. I have this theme of childlike wonder throughout the album.”\n\nThat dichotomy is reflected in the album’s title. “<i>Ur an Angel</i> is this ethereal idea of this world that we don’t know about,” she explains. “What is an angel? Is it make-believe? That’s the ethereal side of it all, the creative side. Then, when I think of particles, I just think of science. That’s more, this is what’s going on right here. There are some big contrasts like that in the album, where it’s like emptiness, euphoria, and playing with all those themes in each song.”\n\nBENEE’s initial vision for her second album was to make a hyperpop record, but she ended up pursuing a more organic, quirky collection of sophisticated alternative pop, replete with moments of adrenaline-fueled catharsis (“Off the Rails”), summery reggae (“Sad Boiii”), and Auto-Tune-treated R&B pop (“Princess”). “I didn’t think the music I was making in that hyperpop space was going to stand out amongst the art that already existed in that world,” she says. “So I pivoted and was like, ‘I need live instruments and I want it to sound organic.’” Here, BENEE takes Apple Music through <i>Ur an Angel I’m Just Particles</i>, track by track.\n\n<b>“Demons”</b>\n“That song’s about feeling like I’m being taken over by a demon with my anxiety, because sometimes I will obsess over an idea that something is happening, like maybe my partner’s cheating on me. And it might be one of my intrusive thoughts, because I’ve got OCD, so I think that has a big play in it. The ‘Call a cab, I am broken’ [opening line] is a nice way to paint the scene. It’s so relatable when something’s up and you just want to leave. I don’t want to stay out and pretend like I’m having a good time when I am being overwhelmed by emotion.”\n\n<b>“Cinnamon”</b>\n“When I first got to LA it was a bit of a shock to the system. I was missing all my friends and family. Then I bumped into a couple of people that kind of took advantage of my naivety. A lot of the song is about that. In the chorus, there’s this weird sense of acceptance, just knowing that you have to go with the flow and ride the wave. You just have to be kind and grounded and know who you are and hope that that attracts the right kind of people.”\n\n<b>“Vegas”</b>\n“I almost married my current boyfriend in Vegas when I was on tour. We were both there and were like, ‘Should we get married?’ But then I was like, ‘We should think this through.’ My mum was like, ‘No, you can’t get married without me there.’ Then his sister was saying something about the planets, that it’s a weird time to do it. So, I was taking both of the hints and I was like, ‘I don’t know what’s going on here, but I am going to take that as a sign.’”\n\n<b>“Sad Boiii”</b>\n“I wanted it to have that organic New Zealand sound of music that I kind of grew up on. It does have a hint of reggae. I was writing it about being in a relationship with a guy where I kind of felt like I had been tricked, because I thought that he was this really nice, normal guy. He ended up being really emotionally not stable. It was super taxing on me. And I was just like, ‘I’m done with people getting into relationships who don’t fix themselves first or aren’t willing to put that effort in, because it is so not fair to the other person.’”\n\n<b>“Prey4U”</b>\n“It’s pretty sassy. I was more writing about something that didn’t happen, like someone cheating on me, which is a fear of mine. It’s this weird toxic obsession kind of song, where someone has betrayed me and after they’ve done that, I feel a bit helpless. The double entendre with ‘Prey4U’ is I’m saying, ‘I’m eating your heart when it’s over.’ I don’t have to write about anything that is even necessarily true, but there’s a strong vibe there that I can relate to.” \n\n<b>“Chainmail”</b>\n“I was going for dark and emo. When someone is hating on me, there’s not a lot that I see now that I haven’t read before. So I kind of feel somewhat immune, even though it obviously still hurts to be criticized. I think it was kind of my reaction or way to deal with that, saying that you can’t hurt me because I am made of chainmail.” \n\n<b>“Doomsday”</b>\n“I was inspired by this doomsday clock installation in New York [the New York Climate Clock in Union Square], which basically says this is how much time you’ve got to save the planet from collapsing. I was writing this story that I was going to meet up with someone that I love before the world felt like it was going to end. So, painting this kind of serene scape of, I’m going to meet this person by a lake. In the hook it’s [saying], ‘I’m just what I am. And I feel like I’m complicated.’”\n\n<b>“Underwater”</b>\n“It sounds like it should be like a club, upbeat, happy vibe. But then it’s about feeling like you’re underwater, which is like depression—feeling like you can’t get your head out of the water or you can’t hear a lot because everything is kind of muted. I think that that’s a numbness that you feel when you’re going through something.”\n\n<b>“Off the Rails”</b>\n“I worked with two female producers—Luka [Kloser] and Elvira [Anderfjärd] are incredible. And the sound is so intense and angry. I think that really was just the breakdown point of this album, where I was like, ‘I’ve done the obsessed, I’ve done the chaos, I’ve done every emotion. But now I just feel feminine rage and I’m ready to scream in a song.’”\n\n<b>“Animal”</b>\n“I felt really inspired by looking down [from an aeroplane window] and everything looking like ants. If you zoom out or zoom into anything, it’s just infinite particles and microorganisms. I think that is so fascinating and can really take you out of overthinking things because you’re like, ‘Actually, does it matter?’ Problems that can seem so huge, if you think about it for long enough, if you can get yourself out of that, you can just laugh about it.”\n\n<b>“Princess”</b>\n“I was trying to capture this kind of feminine, baddy, ethereal vibe of stepping into a party and kind of hyping myself up, which is not always how I feel at all. When I walk into a room full of people, I’m normally kind of the opposite. But there’s also this weird possessiveness that takes over me sometimes when I’m like, ‘Wait, is my partner checking out that person too much?’ But also I was just saying I’m raving in elegance. And I was just talking a bunch of made-up stuff, but it was fun to live in that vibe.” \n\n<b>“Heaven”</b>\n“I wrote the song when my grandad passed away, which was a big deal because I was very close with him. But also knowing that he was 94 and had lived a really full but complicated life, he would always be like, ‘Oh, I’m ready to go.’ He was always really funny and had a weird childlike wonder about him where he was so youthful. But I found that quite beautiful when he passed, just knowing that he was happy to go. I’m afraid of dying, so I kind of found it to be a weird sense of peace.”","tagline":"New Album and Interview"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Ur an Angel I’m Just

The arrangements on these 12 songs are airy and spacious, a result of producer and songwriter Jonathan Wilson (Father John Misty, Angel Olsen) joining Jaffe and frequent collaborator Gabe Goodman in the studio. The result is a mature evolution of Jaffe’s alt-pop sound, sounding a little older and a lot wiser while still exploring the thorny matters of the heart that he’s become known for. COVID-era flings are cheekily referenced in the breezy folk rock of “Ghost in the Uniform,” and Jaffe wraps himself in a wreath of guitars on “Small Town Joan of Arc” while reflecting on a romantic paramour who’s “All out of Lexapro/With a head full of scotch.” At times, <i>Chasing the Chimera</i> recalls a more expansive take on Phoebe Bridgers’ raw and intimate songwriting style—but Jaffe is far from playing the role of imitator here, instead offering a full-bodied varietal of his increasingly distinct songwriting flavor.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Chasing The Chimera","playParams":{"id":"1835943413","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":12,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chasing-the-chimera/1835943413","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0H4QxLnUPk1GlEkUtLuTww"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835943413/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"873308817","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/873308817?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762499762452,"RTCI":0}}},"1835980827":{"id":"1835980827","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835980827?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kadavar","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kadavar/534423387","artwork":{"bgColor":"201c26","hasP3":false,"height":3686,"textColor1":"dbab8f","textColor2":"eda379","textColor3":"b58e7a","textColor4":"c48868","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0c/d3/53/0cd35347-826b-ad24-a369-a449127afb34/4250795610229.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3686},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"201c26","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"dbab8f","textColor2":"eda379","textColor3":"b58e7a","textColor4":"c48868","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/0c/d3/53/0cd35347-826b-ad24-a369-a449127afb34/4250795610229.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Rock","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Kids Abandoning Destiny Among Vanity And Ruin","playParams":{"id":"1835980827","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":9,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/kids-abandoning-destiny-among-vanity-and-ruin/1835980827","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7MS46A1XwLGtixAH4xjU0E"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1835980827/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"534423387","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/534423387?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762493459237,"RTCI":0}}},"1836273576":{"id":"1836273576","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836273576?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Portugal.

McKinley.\n\nFitting for a record that ruminates on our precarious relationship with the environment, <i>SHISH</i> can be as unpredictably calming and chaotic as nature itself, often within the span of a single song: “Tyonek” begins as a serene snapshot of life in the Arctic before triggering an avalanche of nu-metal riffage; the dulcet indie-pop groove of “Knik” erupts into a fuzzed-out out finale capped by a glammy, fretboard-busting guitar solo. <i>SHISH</i> is the sound of Portugal. The Man doubling down on their refusal to be pigeonholed as the feel-good hitmakers of the “Feel It Still” era, but the album rewards your endurance with the string-swept “Tanana,” an equally despairing and life-affirming anthem about finding strength and joy in the ones you love as the world burns.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"SHISH","playParams":{"id":"1836273576","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/shish/1836273576","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7pbhvtNUvp160w3qgtwCCg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1836273576/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"167649475","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/167649475?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502729145,"RTCI":0}}},"1837507691":{"id":"1837507691","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837507691?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Vincent Mason","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/vincent-mason/1602781449","artwork":{"bgColor":"010505","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"edd6ce","textColor2":"dfd5be","textColor3":"beaca5","textColor4":"b3ab99","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ce/c3/01/cec3019d-ab7e-aa5a-050d-c71ffac59874/25UM1IM24550.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"10100c","gradient":{"color":"10100c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfd5bd","textColor3":"bdaca5","textColor4":"b3ab98","textGradient":["ffffff","dfd5bd"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/d8/86/52/d88652d7-53c6-6fa3-68e6-20e475968ba8/Job21021757-a641-447e-b5a2-1ab0e77e5c86-207779086-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_406006767_2409840475-Time1762238102296.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"10100c","gradient":{"color":"10100c","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dacbaf","textColor3":"beafa7","textColor4":"afa38d","textGradient":["ffffff","dacbaf"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/c8/9c/51/c89c513f-6cf8-7eed-0dd3-3a432f24308d/Job524c3c42-9868-4dd3-8020-2fea39cb3715-207779085-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_406006768_2409840476-Time1762236787908.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"ceb583","textColor2":"d6b265","textColor3":"a8946c","textColor4":"af9254","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/f4/5e/7d/f45e7d1b-aa3b-78be-c9b0-c3643b915af3/72efd85c-7a03-4c1f-b733-db6cd9ddad5d.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"111111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"e6c862","textColor2":"ddbe5e","textColor3":"bba452","textColor4":"b49b4f","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features221/v4/b9/73/4b/b9734b0c-30d2-5616-1f86-0a1a919e9a41/166d31e9-c2f5-4bb1-8cd3-7a7591490f18.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"010505","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"edd6ce","textColor2":"dfd5be","textColor3":"beaca5","textColor4":"b3ab99","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ce/c3/01/cec3019d-ab7e-aa5a-050d-c71ffac59874/25UM1IM24550.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Georgia singer’s debut feels immediate and lived-in.","standard":"The stories that populate this debut album from Vincent Mason may be colorful, but the Georgia-born singer-songwriter isn’t telling tall tales. Instead, the rising country star draws inspiration from his own life—particularly the time he’s spent on the road as a touring musician in recent years, an emotional and eye-opening string of experiences he hopes resonates with listeners whether they’ve set foot on a stage or not. Accordingly, the 14 tracks that make up <i>There I Go</i> feel immediate and lived-in, something producer Jake Gear is able to mirror in his lush, understated work behind the boards. \n\n“I wanted to capture that, but loosely,” Mason tells Apple Music. “I think also I wanted to intertwine that with wanting it to feel like a road trip. I wanted it to feel like you’re getting on the bus, you’re playing a show, you’re going to a bar, getting on the bus again, coming home.” \n\nMason opens <i>There I Go</i> with its title track, a mission statement of sorts that takes clear-eyed stock of the often lonely reality of living as a touring musician and the tempting excesses that can come along with it. “Damned If I Do” is brooding and soulful, with a dark edge to Mason’s vocals as he succumbs to an especially consuming heartbreak. “Old Flame,” with its easygoing melody and Chesney-esque vibe, gives Mason room to showcase the nuance in his voice, while “Painkiller” lets him loose on a ’90s-inspired ode to loving and leaving. Mason closes the album with a worktape version of “Good Run,” ending an already personal project on an intimate, revealing note.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Country","Music"],"name":"There I Go","playParams":{"id":"1837507691","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/there-i-go/1837507691","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1BuczKI8NR9VdbRkjP0KZg"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1837507691/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1602781449","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1602781449?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762498994346,"RTCI":0}}},"1838052961":{"id":"1838052961","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838052961?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Danny Brown","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/danny-brown/217291005","artwork":{"bgColor":"c6d8e0","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"0e0800","textColor2":"25282a","textColor3":"33322c","textColor4":"454b4e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5e/16/aa/5e16aaec-3d7d-4c50-50bf-1395d95379f5/5056818805530.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"c3d2da","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0a0b0c","textColor2":"2a2d2e","textColor3":"2f3335","textColor4":"494e51","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features211/v4/a2/f5/52/a2f5522f-be2c-dbf7-a3ea-b2c7a9402abc/45784c29-f93f-4d59-8834-561ab26f7d9a.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"c6d8e0","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0e0800","textColor2":"25282a","textColor3":"33322c","textColor4":"454b4e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/5e/16/aa/5e16aaec-3d7d-4c50-50bf-1395d95379f5/5056818805530.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Detroit innovator finds hyperpop and clarity. “I wanted to say something.”","standard":"Don’t tell Danny Brown he can rap over anything. Even if it’s true—the Detroit rapper has paired his dexterous rhymes and his stretchy, versatile voice on prog rock, EDM, boom-bap, and seemingly everything in between—he’s weary of people making more of his expansive tastes than they are. “I don’t want it to be a gimmick,” he tells Apple Music. “Is the music enjoyable or not?” From that perspective, it makes perfect sense that Brown chose to build his new album, <i>Stardust</i>, in the sounds of the hyperpop scene. Not only is it a natural progression sonically from previous albums like <i>XXX</i>, <i>Atrocity Exhibition</i>, and his <i>SCARING THE HOES</i> collaboration with JPEGMAFIA; it’s also the perfect soundtrack for this stage of his life. \n\nBrown’s previous solo album, 2023’s <i>Quaranta</i>, was largely somber and reflective: While its title was designed to commemorate him turning 40, the lyrics found him picking up the shattered pieces of his life after years of substance abuse, a messy breakup due to infidelity, and music feeling more like a job than a tool of creative expression. But on <i>Stardust</i>, he’s confident, excited, and having the time of his life. “Sleeping real good at night, ’cause I’m proud of myself,” he raps on album opener “Book of Daniel.” “Say a prayer when I wake up because that rehab helped.” He says that his drug-addled party raps in the 2010s and early 2020s were initially just a result of trying to rap about something different from the dope-dealing bars that populated his earlier work. “I don’t ever think I heard the word Adderall in a rap before I said it, and now it’s just normal,” he says. “But I’m not proud of that at all. ’Oh, I created drug culture in rap.’ That’s not how I want to be remembered. That’s why I’m off that shit.”\n\nA collection of beats and choruses by hyperpop heavy hitters like Quadeca, Holly, and underscores are bright, eccentric, dance-ready, and skittery. But Brown insists that upbeat instrumentals don’t mean the raps lack substance. “If the beats are going to be more poppy than normal, I gotta talk about something. I can’t let it be dumbed down,” he says. “I knew I wanted to say something, but I didn’t just want to repeat myself, And I didn’t want it to be the ‘I’m sober’ album. To me, that’s no different than me making a druggie album again.” \n\nThese aren’t just mindless pop tunes, even if they go down easy. “Lift You Up” is a dance-ready number with Angel Prost (her Frost Children sister Lulu Prost also shows up on the album) about a toxic relationship, while “Flowers” features a chorus by vocalist 8485 and joyful, triumphant raps about how Brown has persevered through hard times. “Starburst” has Brown landing boastful punchline raps over a discordant, screeching beat, and “1999” pairs more confident bars with skittery synths and metal-heavy shrieks by JOHNNASCUS. \n\n“The End” is the most powerful of all, though: a nearly nine-minute journey in three parts, with Danny vulnerably revisiting his years of addiction with candor, clarity, and accountability before making a promise to himself to never go back. The ethereal drum ’n’ bass sound bed and dreamy vocals by Zheani make the song sound like the closing credits on a samurai video game from the 2000s. It’s a fitting conclusion for someone who’s crystal clear about his priorities for the first time in way too long. “50 Cent told me,” Brown says, “that if I just wanted to make music for myself, I might as well just stay in my basement.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Alternative"],"name":"Stardust","playParams":{"id":"1838052961","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/stardust/1838052961","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0h3LYQns7VLlsMW7392Z1X"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838052961/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"217291005","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/217291005?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502812065,"RTCI":0}}},"1838177241":{"id":"1838177241","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1838177241?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Sam Gellaitry","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sam-gellaitry/958258124","artwork":{"bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"81c2c6","textColor2":"f58f76","textColor3":"679b9f","textColor4":"c4735e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/24/89/55/248955a3-b39a-dd4d-038c-8b1ef0675ee0/093624828631.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"435763","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f7ddc5","textColor2":"e0c4b1","textColor3":"d3c2b1","textColor4":"c1aea1","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/4a/ec/be/4aecbe32-3dbc-ed14-9f5d-9d387c726732/bfa0396c-78d1-4cfc-adf7-c7e9b5052051.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"000000","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"81c2c6","textColor2":"f58f76","textColor3":"679b9f","textColor4":"c4735e","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/24/89/55/248955a3-b39a-dd4d-038c-8b1ef0675ee0/093624828631.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Scottish producer’s debut indulges his “creative scatterbrain.”","standard":"Sam Gellaitry has spent most of his life thinking about what his debut should sound like. “I’ve been making this album for pretty much 28 years,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. It’s not far from the truth: Since uploading his first tracks as a teenager from Stirling, the Scottish producer, singer, and songwriter has experimented across future beats, house, funk, and pop—a jazz record was even considered at one point—following his creative impulses wherever (and whenever) they called. \n\n“I guess that’s why it kind of took this long, because I was jumping around,” he admits. “I have that kind of creative scatterbrain. This is the first time I’ve been very thematic and calculated about the sonics. My other projects have not stuck to one genre. The challenge of this album was to stick to one.”\n\n<i>ANYWHERE HERE IS PERFECT</i> feels like Gellaitry expanded the bright, prismatic world of his 2021 hit “Assumptions” (which, serendipitously, resurfaced in a viral moment just months before the project announcement) into an album. It pairs funky dance-floor grooves with sparkling synth-pop and runs them through a retro filter. Songs like “START UP A RUMOUR” and “CURIOUS” beam with the French-house sheen of Daft Punk, while “LOVE ON ME” recalls George Michael in its earnest, exuberant sparkle. Elsewhere, swirling synths, noodly guitar riffs, and digitized vocal harmonies add playful hues and textures. And yes, there are even a few beat switch-ups to scratch that scatterbrain itch. \n\nThe album is as much a personal evolution as it is creative. Across 12 songs, Gellaitry navigates the highs and lows of love with the kind of directness that makes every feeling hit harder. “LIGHTNING,” with its walloping drums and marching-band fervor, captures the intense rush of infatuation when meeting someone new, while “DANGER!” reignites the spark of an old flame. Pushing through relationship paranoia (“ON&ON”), quiet reckoning (“CLOUDS”), and the jagged wounds of past pain (“SCAR / A NEW VOID”), he finds euphoric catharsis in “YOU MIGHT FIND THE ONE.”\n\nGellaitry’s rainbow palette is informed in part by his synesthesia, but he also sees it as a reflection of his Scottish roots, nodding to the country’s cultural exports like happy hardcore and Calvin Harris. “We’ve got so much beautiful nature, but if you’re in a city, like Glasgow, it is a bit gray,” he says. “I feel like a lot of the sounds that come from there are basically painting over the gray. Maybe we’re filling that void that we’re not getting enough sunlight.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"name":"ANYWHERE HERE IS

In 2023, the English singer-songwriter released her debut single “Say Ur Mine,” a decisive step forward from posting online snippets of songs she’d made in her bedroom. The catchy, alt-pop confessional, fueled by what she calls her “self-aware delusion,” quickly struck a chord. Over the next two years, her rise played out like an indie fairy tale: two EPs (<i>rumination as ritual</i> and <i>for your validation</i>), a sold-out headline tour, support slots for Noah Kahan and Dua Lipa, and a Glastonbury debut in June 2025. Those milestones shifted how Rose saw herself. The 22-year-old is no longer just a girl making music—she’s an artist. And <i>Voyeur</i> is an artist’s project.\n\n“The voyeurism is twofold,” Rose explained in a statement. “The audience becomes a voyeur of my innermost thoughts and feelings through the music, but additionally I am a voyeur of myself and my own, sometimes self-sabotaging, decisions.” She dives headfirst into the messiness of early adulthood—love, sex, heartbreak—and emerges with raw, guitar-driven songs that read like torn-out diary pages, turning even her most vulnerable moments into detailed commiserations (or cautionary tales, depending on your vantage point) and hooks that stick.\n\nCaught in the tangle of a casual relationship, “Same Mouth” and “Take It or Leave It” could have soundtracked a ’90s rom-com, as Rose’s attempt to “paint the red flags green” leads to falling too deep. On “Everything Anything,” she reflects on the absurdity of how two people can go from intimate partners to complete strangers, confronting her real-life offender with a stadium-sized cry: “What’s wrong with you?” Even friendships aren’t immune from fallout when she calls out a backstabber in bestie’s clothing on “Stella.” And despite hitting an emotional low on the dark “RIP,” where Rose is consumed by numbness, she hits rewind on “Dumb Girl,” knowing better but diving back in anyway. “Make the moment last/’Cause we burn hard and fast,” she croons wistfully, before tossing out her version of <i>carpe diem</i>: “Fuck it.”","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Voyeur (Deluxe)","playParams":{"id":"1839113807","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/voyeur-deluxe/1839113807","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/53Mn3nQy0YRTBWtyfwrOiL"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1839113807/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1628689028","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1628689028?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502896500,"RTCI":0}}},"1840510950":{"id":"1840510950","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1840510950?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Yukimi & Little Dragon","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?cc=us&ids=1768967173-258535972","artwork":{"bgColor":"345398","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f8e5f7","textColor2":"fad7cc","textColor3":"d1c8e4","textColor4":"d3bdc2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4c/23/96/4c239619-e52c-a2eb-4060-73388a66162f/5054429206463.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"staticDetailSquare":{"bgColor":"c3dbb4","gradient":{"color":"c3dbb4","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":3840,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"0c0a0b","textColor3":"39342d","textColor4":"39342e","textGradient":["000000","0c0a0b"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video211/v4/ff/fe/12/fffe1249-5157-3fec-ed1c-15163e32a6bd/Joba9160efd-2091-49d0-b05b-cf0f7312b58b-204877503-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_400326563_2364859842-Time1759397262222.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3840},"staticDetailTall":{"bgColor":"c3dbb4","gradient":{"color":"c3dbb4","y2":0.48},"hasP3":false,"height":2732,"textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"151514","textColor3":"222d1e","textColor4":"293626","textGradient":["000000","151514"],"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video221/v4/a3/bf/7c/a3bf7cd4-2674-bec1-5825-18ac576f4a15/Jobaae690df-e54c-4feb-aebd-490366892262-204877502-PreviewImage_Preview_Image_Intermediate_nonvideo_sdr_400326564_2364859843-Time1759394160519.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":2048},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"1b222b","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"d2c4bb","textColor2":"c5beb7","textColor3":"ada49e","textColor4":"a39e9b","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/bb/a4/22/bba422a7-6c8d-092d-69c0-3f51db92dff7/639e7da9-9c00-4620-9a9e-41f481584654.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"345398","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f8e5f7","textColor2":"fad7cc","textColor3":"d1c8e4","textColor4":"d3bdc2","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/4c/23/96/4c239619-e52c-a2eb-4060-73388a66162f/5054429206463.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Little Dragon vocalist scales new breezy, soulful heights.","tagline":"New EP"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"Yume -

Composed largely on her first instrument, the piano, <i>Happiness Is Going to Get You</i> presents the more fantastical flip side to its dance-floor-driven predecessor, with the always glamboyant singer adopting a new persona she dubs the Infant Marie, whose retro-futurist look—part Marie Antoinette, part Klaus Nomi—serves as the album’s sonic mood board. The result is a set of cosmopolitan alt-pop earworms infused with a playfully baroque sensibility. The whistling hook and fleet-footed rhythms of “7th Floor” position it as a close cousin to Peter Bjorn and John’s mid-2000s touchstone “Young Folks,” while the bassy bounce of “Reunite” leads us into a sunshower of twinkling harpsichords. \n\nBut Allie’s musical extravagance is always anchored by her self-analytical lyrics and devious sense of humor: “I Hope You Hear This Song” sees her dreaming of writing the sort of chart-topping hit that gets played everywhere out in the world—not for fame and fortune, but to haunt and taunt an ex-boyfriend while he’s “shopping at the mall, getting coffee at the stall.” And thanks to its insidious melody and buoyant “Bitter Sweet Symphony” strings, she just might get her wish.\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Indie

country superstar’s second collection of festive tunes.","standard":"Brad Paisley released his first holiday album, <i>Brad Paisley Christmas</i>, in 2006, nearly two decades before plotting this second collection of festive tunes. Time hasn’t dampened Paisley’s cheer, as the country superstar and beloved guitar-slinger giddily leans into his playful side across a 16-track collection of Christmas favorites and new contributions to the holiday canon. Paisley kicks off the LP with a bit of candid holiday atmosphere on intro track “Plug It In, Sparky,” which leads into his original song “Counting Down the Days,” originally written for the Hallmark Channel’s Countdown to Christmas event. Other original highlights include the title track, a sentimental and image-rich ballad about the reason for the season, and “Leave the Christmas Lights On for Me,” a lively two-stepper about Paisley’s own life on the road away from his family. Paisley’s takes on familiar favorites don’t disappoint, either, as on his faithful, soulful rendition of “The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)” and his guitar-heavy take on “Jingle Bell Rock.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Holiday","Music"],"name":"Snow Globe

Chicago drill star revisits his past: “Just trying to find the hunger again.”","standard":"When the rapper known as Lil Herb broke through in 2012 with his searing Lil Bibby duet “Kill Shit”—an instant classic in the Chicago drill canon—he was a baby-faced 16-year-old with the voice and gravitas of a grizzled veteran. Since then, G Herbo (as he’s been known since 2015) has watched the genre he helped pioneer become a worldwide juggernaut. Meanwhile, he grappled with the trauma of the lifestyle that informed his storytelling on albums like 2020’s <i>PTSD</i> and 2022’s <i>Survivor’s Remorse</i>, which upped the studio gloss without sacrificing his visceral intensity. Stardom fit the former street rapper like a glove.\n\nBut for his seventh album, titled after his original alias, the 30-year-old rapper felt drawn back to his past, revisiting old songs like 2015’s “Briks & Mansions” or 2017’s “Street.” “I was just trying to tap into that stage and that era—just trying to find the hunger again,” Herbo tells Apple Music’s Ebro Darden. “I never do that. Once the music come out, I’ve always been on to the next. But listening to my old projects, watching old videos, it just got me in that mode.”\n\nThe photo on the cover shows a teenage Herbo in one of his early mugshots—a snapshot from a childhood he describes vividly on “Give It All,” juxtaposing school-bus crushes and juke parties with untimely funerals. “It’s tough making it in Chicago,” Herbo says. “Generational curses that just get put on you. Certain people grow up with a chip on their shoulder being from Chicago, because you just experience so much death. You think it’s normal, but it ain’t normal.” “Radar” details nightmarish scenes from his past with writerly precision; on “1 Chance,” he wakes from nightmares about lost friends.\n\nAlternately somber and celebratory, with cameos from Jeremih, Wyclef Jean, and Anderson .Paak, Herbo takes time on <i>Lil Herb</i> to marvel at how far he’s come. Still, he’s as passionate about his craft as he was when he dropped <i>Welcome to Fazoland</i> 11 years ago. “I still read the dictionary,” he says. “I try to learn new words all the time, different kinds of flows. I love rapping, so I don’t ever want to get boxed in.”\n","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"name":"Lil

Venezuelan pop singer shares a substantial, heartfelt debut.","standard":"Even before dropping her debut album, Zhamira Zambrano had already made her mark in the Latin pop world. With songs like “Dicelo” and “extrañándote” done as duets with her husband Jay Wheeler, the Venezuelan singer expanded upon her earlier singles while honing her skills further. With the arrival of <i>Curita Para El Corazón</i>, the now mononymous artist offers up her most substantial work to date, a heartfelt outing that rightfully centers her perspective. \n\nHer flair for the romantic manifests regularly, speaking to the irresistibility of true love on “salto de fe” and expressing sincere outbursts of affection on “canela.” Balancing that out are well-crafted counterpoints like the cutting ballad “quisiera ella” and the trepidatious “lista de espera,” each serving as protective armor against betrayal. On “otra vez,” her latest team-up with Wheeler, she addresses the relatable if fraught complications of second chances, where lustful urges clash with sobering practicality. Yet that’s not the couple’s only collaboration on deck, as they later give their aforementioned joint single “extrañándote” an update with a closing salsa reimagining of the original.","tagline":"New

artist Juwan Elcock blends late-night come-ons with existential musing.","standard":"<i>MOOD CONTROL</i>, the third album in as many years from Austin’s BLK ODYSSY, begins with a TV host asking a number of questions: “Are you depressed? Do you suffer from illness, anxiety, or stress? Does the weight of the world feel too heavy to carry? Are you searching for an escape?” These queries animate the soulful, experimental, and inventive 2025 album from Juwan Elcock. Over the course of the BLK ODYSSY adventure, which began with 2021’s <i>BLK VINTAGE</i>, the songwriter has blended late-night jams built for the bedroom with more existential wanderings that examine the human condition.\n\nOn <i>MOOD CONTROL</i>, these two themes are on a collision course, and Elcock posits that sex and suffering are deeply entwined. Take “HEARTBREAK,” which, despite its subject matter, bounces along with an uptempo drum groove and bubbly bassline. Elcock demands devotion, asking his partner to prove their love by wearing him out like he’s their jeans. Commitment isn’t always healthy.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"MOOD CONTROL","playParams":{"id":"1846459386","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":10,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mood-control/1846459386","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1kWD76hBVHdACbWMNgwqRX"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846459386/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1563573895","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1563573895?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762495096476,"RTCI":0}}},"1846650616":{"id":"1846650616","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846650616?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Leah Kate","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/leah-kate/1385047731","artwork":{"bgColor":"acadb2","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"090808","textColor2":"231b18","textColor3":"2a292a","textColor4":"3f3837","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6b/52/6b/6b526b1e-bc4a-57b1-df70-1dedba9c0ca8/6375caf4-24a8-4e25-aeae-f72008119ec2.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"acadb2","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"090808","textColor2":"231b18","textColor3":"2a292a","textColor4":"3f3837","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/6b/52/6b/6b526b1e-bc4a-57b1-df70-1dedba9c0ca8/6375caf4-24a8-4e25-aeae-f72008119ec2.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"Genius","playParams":{"id":"1846650616","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":13,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/genius/1846650616","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7lclXXDGeQMyAHo2uz4ou8"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846650616/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1385047731","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1385047731?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762495225252,"RTCI":0}}},"1846692876":{"id":"1846692876","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846692876?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Young Miko","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/young-miko/1576521417","artwork":{"bgColor":"ebebeb","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"111111","textColor2":"282829","textColor3":"3c3c3d","textColor4":"4f4f50","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3c/db/46/3cdb4622-a2e0-e95d-6728-04f372b89e48/850071993578_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"161111","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"f3d3c9","textColor2":"e0b19f","textColor3":"c7aca4","textColor4":"b79183","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/00/41/b1/0041b112-5945-2da0-f3ac-9283066e1c37/d05d8481-9d94-48fa-8145-60374647df52.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"ebebeb","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"111111","textColor2":"282829","textColor3":"3c3c3d","textColor4":"4f4f50","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/3c/db/46/3cdb4622-a2e0-e95d-6728-04f372b89e48/850071993578_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"The Puerto Rican star unifies her skills, within rap and beyond.","standard":"Since first going viral with her breakthrough single “Riri” back in 2022, Young Miko quickly became the sort of star that Latin trap had long been needing. Yet by the time her full-length debut <i>att.</i> dropped some two years later, it was abundantly clear that this Puerto Rican rapper couldn’t be contained by any one style or sound. For instance, her joint single “Classy 101” with Feid proved a massive success, its reggaetón beat and her charged-up lyrics making for a perfect match. With <i>Do Not Disturb</i>, she looks to better unify her expanding set of styles under one artistic roof, resulting in an album that holds her hip-hop bona fides close, even as she takes creative risks.\n\nThematically, Miko leans assertively into her queerness here, righteously upending Latin rap and reggaetón’s predominantly male gaze with her own highly credible brand of sex positivity and unmistakable charm on such songs as “En el Ritz” and “Piki.” On “WASSUP,” she deftly reimagines Lil Wayne’s seminal hit single “Lollipop” as a raunchy albeit femme-forward cut, while the irresistible “Dosis” presents a perreo full of licentious promises and persuasive prompts.\n\nMiko’s bilingual prowess speaks across language barriers as well, seeking to draw a broad coalition of listeners into her space with natural ease on “What’s Ur Vibe” and the emboldened “Likey Likey.” Though she plays with sounds as disparate as jungle and R&B on “Ojalá” and the gauzy “Sin pausa,” respectively, she reliably remains a trapera through and through. She basks in a luxe life on “Plug (Type Shit)” and goes bar-for-bar with Eladio Carrión on the momentous “Traviesa.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Latin","Music"],"name":"Do Not Disturb","playParams":{"id":"1846692876","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":16,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/do-not-disturb/1846692876","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/661FeA95LRhOgZCJ3Y5u9A"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846692876/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1576521417","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1576521417?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502951693,"RTCI":0}}},"1846731181":{"id":"1846731181","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846731181?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Ariel Fitz-Patrick","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ariel-fitz-patrick/1531984503","artwork":{"bgColor":"353a43","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f3c7b8","textColor2":"f2ac84","textColor3":"cdaba1","textColor4":"cc9577","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/85/06/84/8506847d-eb70-61ca-e559-d61547eb85f6/25UM1IM48435.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"353a43","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f3c7b8","textColor2":"f2ac84","textColor3":"cdaba1","textColor4":"cc9577","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/85/06/84/8506847d-eb70-61ca-e559-d61547eb85f6/25UM1IM48435.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"genreNames":["Christian","Music"],"name":"ARIEL","playParams":{"id":"1846731181","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":11,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ariel/1846731181","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0vBIYViA9PmaeDLLS2uVCp"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846731181/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1531984503","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1531984503?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762502870980,"RTCI":0}}},"1846883127":{"id":"1846883127","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846883127?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Popcaan","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/popcaan/1098276161","artwork":{"bgColor":"080808","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"d6d6d6","textColor2":"d0d0c2","textColor3":"adadad","textColor4":"a8a89d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fd/b3/2c/fdb32c1e-210d-b21a-099e-4987c435d931/0.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"contentRating":"explicit","editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"080808","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"d6d6d6","textColor2":"d0d0c2","textColor3":"adadad","textColor4":"a8a89d","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/fd/b3/2c/fdb32c1e-210d-b21a-099e-4987c435d931/0.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Ballads about his hero’s journey, guided by street smarts and divine grace.","standard":"The singer born Andrae Sutherland in St. Thomas Parish, Jamaica, has spent more than a decade bridging the gap between dancehall and pop. Since breaking through in 2010 with a feature on Vybz Kartel’s “Clarks,” the 37-year-old has lent his sunny melodies to collaborations with Drake, Young Thug, and Pusha T, while solo projects like 2014’s <i>Where We Come From</i> and 2020’s <i>FIXTAPE</i> established him at the forefront of contemporary dancehall. On Popcaan’s sixth album, <i>Nothing Without God</i>, he steps away from the slow-wine escapades for a set of mellow ballads about his own hero’s journey, guided by street smarts and divine grace. He preaches self-reliance on “Kick It Wid Myself,” gives thanks to God on the piano-driven title track, and beats the odds on “Greatness Inside Out”: “No care weh them fight me/A greatness a run inside.”","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Modern Dancehall","Music","Reggae"],"name":"Nothing Without God","playParams":{"id":"1846883127","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":14,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-without-god/1846883127","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/65clKbczk7FXoDZP4HUWOY"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846883127/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1098276161","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1098276161?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762484480670,"RTCI":0}}},"1846978483":{"id":"1846978483","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846978483?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"EKKSTACY","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ekkstacy/1504423866","artwork":{"bgColor":"2c2c2c","hasP3":false,"height":3000,"textColor1":"f5f5f5","textColor2":"dadada","textColor3":"cccccc","textColor4":"b7b7b7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/a9/d2/bea9d2e8-1f41-c88c-b644-d8889346522e/199826046672-copy-5d1b6c78.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":3000},"editorialArtwork":{"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"2c2c2c","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"f5f5f5","textColor2":"dadada","textColor3":"cccccc","textColor4":"b7b7b7","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/be/a9/d2/bea9d2e8-1f41-c88c-b644-d8889346522e/199826046672-copy-5d1b6c78.png/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Acoustic cuts and more show another side of the Vancouver artist's 2025 LP.","tagline":"New Album"},"genreNames":["Alternative","Music"],"name":"forever and always","playParams":{"id":"1846978483","kind":"album"},"releaseDate":"2025-11-07","trackCount":20,"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever-and-always/1846978483","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1OknBAZwOC2TQJsDQjsRqC"},"relationships":{"artists":{"href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1846978483/artists?l=en-US","data":[{"id":"1504423866","type":"artists","href":"/v1/catalog/us/artists/1504423866?l=en-US"}]}},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"MZ_INDEXER":1762503268062,"RTCI":0}}},"1847372595":{"id":"1847372595","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1847372595?l=en-US","attributes":{"artistName":"Kings of Leon","artistUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kings-of-leon/1883403","artwork":{"bgColor":"3083ce","hasP3":false,"height":1400,"textColor1":"0c070a","textColor2":"0b080c","textColor3":"142031","textColor4":"122033","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/66/2d/ef/662def9c-f73e-eb76-935c-53a917f2de25/00198704800528_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":1400},"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"bgColor":"1d8bff","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"0c070d","textColor2":"0a0910","textColor3":"10223d","textColor4":"0d2340","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/77/18/83/77188365-8409-8a49-bb49-5f33335e26d4/2b1d583d-3b94-4e2e-959e-c60d12644f30.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"subscriptionHero":{"bgColor":"bcc7ce","hasP3":true,"height":1080,"textColor1":"101119","textColor2":"16171c","textColor3":"32363d","textColor4":"373a40","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/f5/07/47/f50747be-bba1-f5e2-d7dd-4a7b77486306/2c977472-9ac6-4b03-8772-e85bddd40cf8.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","width":4320},"superHeroTall":{"bgColor":"3083ce","gradient":{},"hasP3":false,"height":2240,"textColor1":"0c070a","textColor2":"0b080c","textColor3":"142031","textColor4":"122033","url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/66/2d/ef/662def9c-f73e-eb76-935c-53a917f2de25/00198704800528_Cover.jpg/{w}x{h}SHT.AMTPPS01.{f}?l=en-US","width":1680}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A compact preview of sounds from the Followills’ newly self-contained era.","standard":"There are just four songs featured on the second ever EP from Kings of Leon, aptly titled <i>EP #2</i>, but the family Followill still manages to cover a lot of ground in a short space of time. Thematically, “To Space” finds the alt-rock group flirting with the idea of taking a political stance, and “The Wolf” tiptoes even closer to the line, but with lyrics couched in trademark nebulosity, the listener’s invited to extract (or indeed, project) their own meaning. Sonically, however, the Grammy-winning four-piece is more comfortable making a statement: distorted chords muddy the jaunty rhythm of opening track “All the Little Sheep,” while “Pit to the Rind” makes sparing use of instrumentation, punctuating singer/guitarist Caleb Followill’s plaintive vocals with reverberating guitar. As the first step down a wholly new road for Kings of Leon—self-produced, independently released—<i>EP #2</i> serves as an intriguing glimpse ahead at their future direction.","tagline":"New

Spanish star finds her muse in theology books: “This is maximalism.”","standard":"For ROSALÍA, her fourth full-length album <i>LUX</i> only has “little pieces” of her in the lyrics of its songs—and she prefers it that way. “I think the best fiction has this blurry line, the sweet spot between what’s personal and what’s universal, what’s detailed and what’s abstract, what’s implicit and what’s explicit,” the Spanish star tells Apple Music. “It’s both. Because I wrote it, there has to be some sort of truth for me in it. But at the same time, I think it’s much more about the other than about myself.” \n\nThe “other,” in this case, is a group of saints—Saint Rose of Lima, Anandamayi Ma, Hildegard von Bingen, Sufi mystic Rabia al-Adawiyya, and other martyrs across cultures, centuries, and continents—that ROSALÍA voraciously studied in the wake of her third album, 2022’s <i>MOTOMAMI</i>. Instead of immediately writing about the emotional turmoil she’d weathered in its aftermath—a period that included the end of her engagement to former collaborator Rauw Alejandro—she found the muses of her next project in theology books. After immersing herself in the stories of these women of faith, ROSALÍA blended their experiences, and their tongues, with hers. “Where did they come from? What was the language that would be spoken there?” she says. “There were a lot of women that were extremely interesting to me that were nuns, they were poets. And I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to read what they actually wrote. I’m going to try to explain these stories.’”\n\nAcross <i>LUX</i>, ROSALÍA sings in multiple languages—her native Spanish and Catalan, but also Arabic, Japanese, French, Portuguese, Italian, Ukrainian, and German, among others—to invoke these saints while telling stories of flower-strewn funerals, doomed romance, unrequited love, and crises of faith in multiple forms. If 2018’s <i>EL MAL QUERER</i> introduced her singular fusion of flamenco and pop to the world, and <i>MOTOMAMI</i> brought reggaetón into the mix, <i>LUX</i> builds on that work from a high-drama, operatic foundation, one that pairs her lyrical intensity with vocal prowess and orchestral flourish. A cajón and handclaps blend seamlessly with urbano bass, Auto-Tune, and somber strings, often with many or all of these elements weaving throughout the same track (as they do on “De Madrugá”). Her voice soars over each flamenco run with ease (“La Rumba Del Perdón”), only to growl over sinister cello (“Porcelana”), breathlessly trip through a softly strummed waltz (“La Perla”), or reach the rafters of any grand opera house (the exquisite “Reliquia”; her version of an aria, “Mio Cristo Piange Diamante”; the severe and surreal “Berghain,” which features Björk and Yves Tumor). \n\nROSALÍA worked with the London Symphony Orchestra to give <i>LUX</i> the symphonic heft it deserves, and at times, the gravity of the undertaking felt insurmountable. “I definitely had chills so many times while recording vocals,” she says. “I don’t think I ever cried so much making an album. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so much recording vocals. I think that I didn’t maybe want to go through this before. I was like, ‘I’m not ready.’ I know I had to do an album like this, but I wasn’t ready.”\n\nWhether or not she realized it at the time, she was, indeed, ready for <i>LUX</i> and all it entails. It’s the destination she’s been writing towards, uninhibited by instrumentation, devastation, or language. “<i>MOTOMAMI</i> was minimalist,” she says. “This is maximalism.”\n","tagline":"New

Toronto rapper adds a new set of demands to Don't Box Me In.","standard":"Alexander Eli Morand comes by his nom de rap—Smiley—honestly. Even when the Drake-approved Toronto MC is popping off about street struggles and girl trouble over atmospheric OVO beats, he exudes an excitable energy and tongue-in-cheek attitude that turns frowns upside down. The quick-hit mixtape <i>Don’t Box Me In</i> functions as a status update on how Smiley’s life has changed ever since his Drizzy collab “Over the Top” blew up in 2021, and whether he’s reaffirming his loyalty to his Pelham Park homies on “Budge” (“This for all the dogs/I’ll never do a Michael Vick”) or fending off gold-digging girlfriends on “6ixSideKids” (“All you do is talk, bitch/Go start a podcast”), Smiley filters his self-aggrandizing bravado through a sly sense of humor.

Well, its success sparked the flame inside Taylor Swift that led to a reunion with former collaborators Max Martin and Shellback for her 12th full-length <i>The Life of a Showgirl</i>. Indeed, in a very showgirl manner, Swift flew back and forth to Sweden between stops on her European leg—remember, the singer-songwriter believes “jet lag is a choice”—to join Martin and Shellback, Swift’s co-writers and producers on some of the most memorable and popular hits of her career (“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “22,” “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” “Don’t Blame Me,” and “Delicate,” to name a few). The result? A confident, dazzling, at times elegant, at times cheeky, at times sensual pop explosion that examines Swift’s relationships and her fame, which is both deeply personal yet extremely relatable...mostly. (The struggles of “Elizabeth Taylor”—with its thumping rock vibes—can understandably be reserved for the uber-famous showgirls in the room.)\n\n“This album, by personality, was a funnier album,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “It was coming off of <i>TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</i>—the character attributes I was highlighting in that writing process were much more serious and sensitive and introspective, and oftentimes more earnest and stoic, and the characteristics of a poet. This one was like, showgirls are mischievous, fun, scandalous, sexy, fun, flirty, hilarious.” On the album’s first single “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift tests that theory by dipping back into the Shakespearean well that earned her crossover success and adoring fans, and once again, she turns the Bard’s tale into a romance rather than a tragedy. But this time, it’s more mature and fierce—as the acceptant heroine resigns herself to solitude before the hero ever comes around: “I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I/Right before you lit my sky up.”\n\nHer muses, of course, will be well-dissected. The aforementioned savior in “Ophelia” is most likely Swift’s husband-to-be, the three-time Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce. (She did, after all, announce the album on his podcast.) And he <i>probably</i> has a few more cuts dedicated to him—the most direct being the saucy, ’70s-funk-infused “Wood” and its “new heights of manhood” revelation. “When I met Travis, I started to feel a little bit like I could be like a person who could have romantic whims and have these dreams,” she says.\n\n“Actually Romantic,” with its semi-stripped-down production, deals not with a lover but with a certain hater. “You think I’m tacky, baby/Stop talking dirty to me/It sounded nasty but it feels like you’re flirting with me/I mind my business, God’s my witness that I don’t provoke it/It’s kind of making me wet,” Swift teases. And “Father Figure” pays homage to George Michael with Swift’s breathy vocals, ending with a menacing act of betrayal by a protégé: “You made a deal with this devil/Turns out my dick’s bigger/You want a fight, you found it/I got the place surrounded.”\n\nImportantly, though, remove Swift’s own personal inspirations and score-settling and you get what she does best: vibrant songs that speak to universal emotions through her storytelling. The buoyant “Opalite” shows two people finding each other at the right time; baroque-pop “Wi$h Li$t” portrays someone who knows what her heart desires. And “Eldest Daughter,” the famous track 5—generally one of Swift’s most vulnerable on each of her albums—reveals a promise of devotion.\n\nSwift ends the record on its title track, an epic duet with Sabrina Carpenter where the women volley back and forth about a girl named Kitty, perhaps alluding to their own places in the world. “And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the bitches who wish I’d hurry up and die/But I’m immortal now, baby dolls, I couldn’t if I tried,” Swift sings proudly. In other words, as she’s proven time and time again, she’ll never go out of style.\n\n“Making this was really something I’ve been wanting to do for my entire career, because I have always wanted to have fun in this type of way,” she says. “To have fun, to exhibit mischief and be flirty and fun and make jokes—that’s a huge part of my personality. Oftentimes, I get so serious, or I’m really known for a lot of my sad songs, my cathartic songs or breakup songs or whatever, because I love to write those things—but that’s not the place I’m in my life. So what I have left behind is something that really exhibits who I am in this moment.”\n","tagline":"New Deluxe Edition"},"genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"name":"The Life of a Showgirl + Acoustic
